47
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:39,170
gentlemen you know I like to start the

48
00:01:37,819 --> 00:01:41,359
episodes off by letting you know what

49
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:43,849
I'm dabbing on today I'm taking dabs of

50
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,489
gunslinger nectar from Green Dot labs

51
00:01:43,849 --> 00:01:48,500
the label says it is Starfighter and

52
00:01:46,489 --> 00:01:50,569
star dog combined together in one run

53
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,969
the flavor is described as watermelon

54
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,368
gummy slices and fresh ripe watermelons

55
00:01:52,969 --> 00:01:57,799
I definitely got a watermelon flavor I

56
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:59,780
also had a hint of strawberries in there

57
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:01,609
it was delicious I would almost describe

58
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:03,379
it like those candies that your grandma

59
00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:04,759
has in the candy dish they're wrapped in

60
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:06,469
a package that looks like a fake

61
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:07,609
strawberry you suck on it for a couple

62
00:02:06,469 --> 00:02:08,810
of minutes and then you always got to

63
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,550
bite into that thing and then it's got

64
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,979
like a gooey strawberry texture in the

65
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:14,810
middle that's exactly what this

66
00:02:12,979 --> 00:02:18,789
concentrate tasted like so great work as

67
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:21,469
always to our friends at Green Dot labs

68
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:23,239
and I guess that makes a great segue the

69
00:02:21,469 --> 00:02:25,340
dads I was taking today were not my

70
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,409
normal dads these were upgraded fancy

71
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,900

72
00:02:27,409 --> 00:02:31,939

00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,919
of a new quartz banger that also came

76
00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:41,539
with a DAB insert I'm sure we talked

77
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,399

it out and it works as a grinder it's

92
00:03:10,009 --> 00:03:13,039
kind of like a cheese grater for your

93

cannabis it works great if you're trying

94

huge shout out to my friends at happy

107
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:39,830
daddy products now let's talk about

108
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,689
these insert dabs a little bit now that

109
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,830
I've got my own insert dab setup I've

110
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:46,250
had some time to play with it and

111
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:48,920
experiment and experience this I like it

112
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,719
Mike said on Instagram today that it was

113
00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:52,519
better than he expected and hit him

114
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,379
harder than he had anticipated so it

115
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:57,050
sounds like Mike likes the insert dabs

116
00:03:54,379 --> 00:04:00,650
also let's talk about the main

117
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:04,910
differences between taking normal dabs

118
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:06,200
and insert dabs where do I want to start

119
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,879
we want to start with the normal mail

120
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:10,639
sure back in the day we used to heat up

121
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,319
a titanium nail it looks like a screw it

122
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:13,969
had a head on it it had another piece on

123
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,769
it that would screw up and down that

124
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:17,480
would fit in the joint of your rig or

125
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,000
bong you needed a male joint so you

126
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:22,700
either get a pipe or a bong or a bubbler

127
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,560
with a male joint um if you didn't have

128
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:27,560
a male you'd get an adapter that made it

129
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,089
a male joint then the nail would fit in

130
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,980
that joint and then a dome would slide

131
00:04:29,089 --> 00:04:32,810
over that heat up the nail put the dome

132
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:35,509
over that and then you touch the dab to

133
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:36,680
that hot nail and then that dome would

134
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,730
trap the smoke in there and then you

135
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,050
could smoke it through your pipe I'll

136
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,790
explain this joint part that I keep

137
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:43,430
talking about that part where you put

138
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,560
your bong bowl into the bong ah usually

139
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,780
it's a hole and the bong bowl slides

140
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:50,449
into there imagine if they did that the

141
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:52,819
opposite if imagine if the hole was on

142
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:54,949
the bong Bowl and the male part was

143
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:56,389
actually sticking off of the bong or the

144
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,459
bubbler so you got like a little a

145
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,019
little male joint sticking off then you

146
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:02,149
slide this nail into there and you use

147
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:04,250
the screw part the nut that would be on

148
00:05:02,149 --> 00:05:06,139
the screw to adjust the height of how

149
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,819
far it sticks up out of that joint so it

150
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,079
doesn't go too high out of the dome and

151
00:05:07,819 --> 00:05:10,819
then you want to put the dome on there

152
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:12,829
and you want to aim it to where that the

153
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:14,360
head of that nail is basically right in

154
00:05:12,829 --> 00:05:16,189
the center height of the dome is what

155
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,290
you'd kind of aim for so back in the day

156
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:20,689
we used to use a titanium nail hopefully

157
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:23,450
it was titanium then like I mentioned in

158
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,490
the 710 episode task rock I made the

159
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,319
flux nail then task rock made the

160
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:30,100
domeless nail then task rock made the

161
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:33,560
Infinity nail it evolved quite heavily

162
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,320
then glassblowers got in on it and we

163
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,389
started using quartz or glass bangers

164
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,949
instead of titanium nails I highly

165
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,598
recommend you go listen to my 710

166
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:43,430
episode it will teach you all the

167
00:05:41,598 --> 00:05:46,848
details on this so they started making

168
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:47,360
what's called a club banger along with

169
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:49,610
the club

170
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,370
Bangor came the evolution of our rigs

171
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:54,139
where they started putting female joints

172
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,259
on the rigs and making the bangers

173
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:59,840
themselves males these little rigs were

174
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:01,939
usually somewhere between six and eight

175
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,859
inches tall kind of wide based with the

176
00:06:01,939 --> 00:06:05,270
mouthpiece coming up off the top just a

177
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,879
spot to hang a nail on it and they

178
00:06:05,269 --> 00:06:09,589
basically call it a bangor hanger now

179
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:11,300
all the rigs are available in males or

180
00:06:09,589 --> 00:06:12,948
females depending on the artwork or the

181
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,050
style of the rig or what you prefer and

182
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,050
the joints are also available in males

183
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:19,759
or females and they're also available in

184
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,189
45 or 90 degree angles that way you can

185
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,300
get your nail you want them straight up

186
00:06:22,189 --> 00:06:26,000
and down you want to horizontal with the

187
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:27,650
ground so based on what angle your joint

188
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,899
comes off of your rig you need the

189
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:32,120
appropriate setup so we've got it all

190
00:06:29,899 --> 00:06:33,348
customized by now we figured out that we

191
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,840
would need males and females we know

192
00:06:33,348 --> 00:06:37,218
what sizes we need let me get on to we

193
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,329
went to the Bangor wheeler from titanium

194
00:06:37,218 --> 00:06:42,978
into the Bangor the banger is so my rig

195
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:45,378
my joint points straight up so I need a

196
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:48,560
90 degree angle on here I've got a

197
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:50,930
female rig so my rig has a whole it is a

198
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,598
female that sounds [ __ ] weird but

199
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,269
it's got a whole it is a female my nail

200
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,860
my banger is a male it's got a joint so

201
00:06:56,269 --> 00:06:59,810
the joint slides right into the hole

202
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,759
that's pretty self-explanatory it goes

203
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,129
straight up then it turns at a 90 degree

204
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,680
angle at the end of that 90 degree angle

205
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:08,620
there is basically a large glass thimble

206
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,079
it would be similar to a thimble or

207
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,088
maybe a really tiny shot glass the

208
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:15,500
bottom of it is quite thick it's thicker

209
00:07:14,088 --> 00:07:17,899
than the sides that is so that the

210
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,848
bottom will retain heat the sidewalls

211
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:23,060
are fairly thick but not as thick as the

212
00:07:19,848 --> 00:07:25,038
bottom my pointer finger fits in here

213
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,829
quite smoothly my middle finger fits in

214
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,778
there kind of snugly and it goes all the

215
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,418
way to the first knuckle if that gives

216
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:33,978
you any idea of the depth and the

217
00:07:31,418 --> 00:07:36,168
internal diameter is probably the size

218
00:07:33,978 --> 00:07:38,240
of a dime so you could stack Dimes in

219
00:07:36,168 --> 00:07:40,728
here if you wanted to so that's the size

220
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,329
of the banger now I put that I drop that

221
00:07:40,728 --> 00:07:46,278
right into the rig and then I heat the

222
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:48,168
bottom corner I heat where the floor and

223
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:50,598
the wall meet because I want the heat to

224
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:51,859
be focused on the bottom because it's

225
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,288
real thick there it's gonna retain the

226
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,759
heat then the walls I want to have some

227
00:07:54,288 --> 00:07:57,199
heat also just to have that heat all

228
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,990
around because I'm going to use this

229
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,629
radiant heat to heat my dab no here is

230
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,150
where

231
00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:05,430
difference between a normal Bangor tab

232
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:07,019
and an insert dab come into play and

233
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:08,579
there are a couple of ways to do these

234
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,549
insert dabs and I'll talk about them

235
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:14,819
both now before we had insert dabs we

236
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,500
would heat this Bangor fairly hot and

237
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:18,029
then let it cool to our desired

238
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,160
temperature everybody likes a different

239
00:08:18,029 --> 00:08:22,049
temperature on their dabs I you probably

240
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,730
know by now I go hotter than most folks

241
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:25,199
some folks like them nice and cool you

242
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,490
got to get a q-tip and clean half your

243
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,860
dab out of the banger when you're done

244
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:30,569
there's not much left when I'm done so

245
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,009
the way we would normally do it we'd

246
00:08:30,569 --> 00:08:33,569
heat that banger let it cool to the

247
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,340
appropriate temperature use your hand or

248
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,990
whatever to judge how hot it is you put

249
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:38,940
your dab on the end of the dabber you

250
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:41,279
press it into the banger once the dab

251
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,430
all falls off the dabber use a carb cap

252
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,589
to cap that banger that carb cap traps

253
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:49,469
the air that's in there and it reduces

254
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:52,320
the pressure inside that banger vessel

255
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,420
and it reduces the air flow allowed to

256
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,440
go over the hot oil to where when you

257
00:08:54,419 --> 00:09:00,750
pull air over that oil that fresh air

258
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,700
Stokes the heat and makes your oil

259
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,529
evaporate at a lower temperature so

260
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,420
you're not getting a super hot dab and

261
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,309
it tastes better so we let it cool

262
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,229
put the dab in there put the carb cap on

263
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:12,750
and keep hitting it and it tastes super

264
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,769
good and you get a nice fat dad then

265
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,210
when you're done you got a little oil

266
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:16,860
left in there you get a q-tip and you

267
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:18,440
wipe that banger out and then you're

268
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,700
pretty much good to go on another dab

269
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,860
now here's where it branches off and

270
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,470
gets different when we're doing insert

271
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,389
dabs I've got this so I described the

272
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,720
original banger as looking like a

273
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:32,730
thimble I've got another smaller thimble

274
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,230
that fits right inside of here I said

275
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,019
that you could fit a diamond side here

276
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,240
this thing is probably the size of like

277
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:41,220
four dimes five dimes deep stacked up

278
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,070
maybe six times stacked up is just

279
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,810
little little tiny glass dish then you

280
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:47,129
put your dab inside of there or the

281
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:49,529
amount of concentrate that you wish to

282
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:51,450
smoke inside of this little dish I just

283
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:52,829
scoop out like one good-sized crystal

284
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,310
and drop a little crystal inside this

285
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:58,530
dish then you heat the banger and that's

286
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:00,389
I again I heat it where the wall and the

287
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:01,829
floor meet at the corner the bottom

288
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:03,659
corner of the nail and I want that heat

289
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,270
to move up all around the whole nail I

290
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:09,389
get it fairly hot because I need that

291
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:12,559
radiant heat to heat this dab that is

292
00:10:09,389 --> 00:10:14,429
inside of the dish so once it's heated I

293
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,289
carefully

294
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:18,539
this dish that's got my dab in it and I

295
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:19,649
drop it right inside of this banger I'll

296
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:23,909
hold it by the mic and do it you can

297
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:25,259
hear it this is what it sounds like it's

298
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:27,120
a little sticky so it didn't slide as

299
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,580
well as it should but it just dropped

300
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,528
right in there so we'll say I heated it

301
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,540
he did the [ __ ] out of it till it's hot

302
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:36,629
not orange hot but just before orange

303
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:38,159
hot drop that a little insert in there

304
00:10:36,629 --> 00:10:40,350
with the dab in there then set the carb

305
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,329
cap on it and then I wait I just wait

306
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:43,589
just a couple of seconds let's see if I

307
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:45,149
dropped it in here right now I'll Tod

308
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,440
will say don't drop it in there

309
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:48,450
and then we'll go ahead and put the carb

310
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,040
cap on it boom carb cap is on I would

311
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,528
wait till about now you would see the

312
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:54,750
dab start reacting now the dab would

313
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:57,899
really be bubbling now I would start

314
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:59,820
hitting it and now I'm getting instead

315
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,679
of taking that dab and pressing it up

316
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,209
against the superhot surface and

317
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,719
scorching it and making it cook right

318
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:08,699
away it is slowly coming to temperature

319
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,129
where it can vaporize I'm using that

320
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,410
radiant heat of the outside glass to

321
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,509
suck that heat through the carb cap over

322
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:18,000
that dish inside there with the oil in

323
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:20,899
it and it brings that temperature up

324
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,778
really slowly and it makes that oil

325
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:26,909
evaporate or vaporize at a much lower

326
00:11:24,778 --> 00:11:30,360
temperature and it makes it taste so

327
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:31,769
good and it's it slowly comes up to

328
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,870
temperature where I can it starts off

329
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:36,179
with a kind of a thin thin vapor smoke

330
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,950
dab but it starts as it goes it gets to

331
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:40,319
that thick smoke that I appreciate and

332
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,870
I've noticed there is very little waste

333
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,790
since I'm not scorching the dab on that

334
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,190
hot nail right away there's hardly any

335
00:11:44,789 --> 00:11:49,199
waste I'm getting all of the dab that I

336
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,880
put in this dish so I'm getting a lower

337
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,129
temperature dab because I'm starting to

338
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,720
smoke it at its lowest vaporizing

339
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,980
temperature right when it starts going I

340
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,839
start hitting it I can see when it's

341
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,009
bubbling inside that dish so then I

342
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,390
start hitting it and I'm getting all

343
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:02,490
those chirps that normally would have

344
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:04,679
been burned off when I pressed that dab

345
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,060
against the hot banger so I'm getting

346
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:07,799
all those chirps and I'm also getting

347
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,119
that fat chunky dab that I like so it's

348
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,189
like the best of both worlds I'm getting

349
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,690
the low temp flavor and I'm getting all

350
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:15,510
the cannabinoids and I'm getting that

351
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,420
fat thick smoke that I appreciate from

352
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,169
my dad so I heat it up and I drop that

353
00:12:18,419 --> 00:12:20,699
dish in there

354
00:12:19,169 --> 00:12:22,349
I set the carb cap on it I give it just

355
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,209
long you can watch it you can see when

356
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,470
the Earl just starts puddling in the

357
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,729
middle of that dish and it starts

358
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,259
boiling up that's when you want to hit

359
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:29,699
it and then spin that

360
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,318
kappa round and you can see it move the

361
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:33,238
oil around inside there and move it to

362
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,678
the hotter spots and make it even out it

363
00:12:33,239 --> 00:12:36,929
makes a puddle less deep so it can burn

364
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:38,759
better but i really like the way it

365
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:40,948
brings it up to temperature instead of

366
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,329
just right a temperature right away it

367
00:12:40,948 --> 00:12:43,889
brings it up to the tamp and then it

368
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,208
keeps going up because that heats

369
00:12:43,889 --> 00:12:46,829
trapped in there and as you smoke it

370
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:49,288
it's heating up that oil longer and

371
00:12:46,828 --> 00:12:52,469
hotter and hotter and it makes it taste

372
00:12:49,288 --> 00:12:54,808
great I got super lid off of it and my

373
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:56,339
banger isn't ridiculously dirty all I've

374
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,808
got to do now that it's cooled off I can

375
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,009
retry it inside of here I can pull this

376
00:12:57,808 --> 00:13:01,108
little insert right out

377
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:03,509
sometimes I'll drop this insert into a

378
00:13:01,109 --> 00:13:05,729
dish of alcohol it's probably do about

379
00:13:03,509 --> 00:13:06,959
now after 3 or 4 good dads I can't get

380
00:13:05,729 --> 00:13:08,309
it all the way clean if I got a big

381
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,978
thick dad I can't get it all the way

382
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:12,058
clean I just drop it in a dish I so let

383
00:13:10,979 --> 00:13:13,229
it sit for a couple of minutes and then

384
00:13:12,058 --> 00:13:14,938
I pull it out and use a paper towel and

385
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:16,350
or a q-tip just to polish it up a little

386
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:18,298
bit and we're ready to take dabs again

387
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:22,259
so that's one way that I've been doing

388
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:24,028
the insert dabs Mike likes to take

389
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,489
little tiny dabs it might came over the

390
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:29,068
other night and I was like if I take the

391
00:13:26,489 --> 00:13:30,538
dabber and wipe the dabber off into the

392
00:13:29,068 --> 00:13:33,479
dish that I was gonna give Mike there's

393
00:13:30,538 --> 00:13:35,129
not even enough concentrate in here til

394
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,089
it doesn't look like there's anything in

395
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,009
here and I don't know how this is gonna

396
00:13:36,089 --> 00:13:39,569
work it was just really I'm not making

397
00:13:38,009 --> 00:13:41,068
fun of Mike he taiks tiny dabs but it

398
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,889
didn't seem effective to do it that way

399
00:13:41,068 --> 00:13:45,328
so I heated the banger I threw the

400
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,579
insert in there and then I put Mike's

401
00:13:45,328 --> 00:13:50,399
dab on the dabber and had him just dab

402
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:52,168
that into the inside of the dish

403
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,339
no I told not to hit that he knew what

404
00:13:52,168 --> 00:13:55,318
to do he need to hit the inside of the

405
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:58,259
dish and not the the banger itself and

406
00:13:55,318 --> 00:14:00,778
it made his dab burn I could see it it

407
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:02,068
burned more smoothly it didn't I didn't

408
00:14:00,778 --> 00:14:04,619
flash you know what I mean it didn't

409
00:14:02,068 --> 00:14:06,269
just sit in singe it just melted nice

410
00:14:04,619 --> 00:14:07,168
and smoothly and he carb capped it and

411
00:14:06,269 --> 00:14:08,788
he got a nice dad

412
00:14:07,168 --> 00:14:10,048
and Mike kind of went pale and his eyes

413
00:14:08,788 --> 00:14:11,668
went a little glassy it looked like

414
00:14:10,048 --> 00:14:13,649
marbles in his head for a minute so

415
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:15,480
that's another great way to utilize the

416
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:16,589
insert then you let it cool and once

417
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,999
again a just reach in there and pull it

418
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:19,649
right out and then your banger isn't

419
00:14:17,999 --> 00:14:21,389
dirty you've got an insert that you can

420
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:23,100
clean if you've got a bunch of people

421
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:24,629
that want to come dab in a group maybe

422
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:26,308
think about a couple of inserts because

423
00:14:24,629 --> 00:14:28,589
the only time consuming part is really

424
00:14:26,308 --> 00:14:31,108
cleaning the inserts so that's insert

425
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:33,119
dabs that's where we've gotten to I

426
00:14:31,109 --> 00:14:34,829
really enjoy the insert dabs I feel like

427
00:14:33,119 --> 00:14:38,129
it makes my dabs more efficient more

428
00:14:34,828 --> 00:14:39,748
effective more flavorful I really

429
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:41,819
appreciate it so once again shot it's my

430
00:14:39,749 --> 00:14:42,360
friends at happy daddy because I did not

431
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:44,909
ask

432
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,829
insert banger and an insert dab insert

433
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:48,928
but they hooked me up and I'm really

434
00:14:46,828 --> 00:14:50,399
glad they did all right you guys I've

435
00:14:48,928 --> 00:14:51,720
been talking about dabs for like ten

436
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,489
minutes so guess what I'm gonna press

437
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,678
pause I'm gonna get a fresh bottle of

438
00:14:53,489 --> 00:14:57,298
water I'm gonna take about four fatty

439
00:14:55,678 --> 00:14:59,039
dabs and then I'll be back to do a

440
00:14:57,298 --> 00:15:00,838
podcast ladies and gentlemen thanks for

441
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,610
hanging out with me all right welcome

442
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:05,160
back podcast world I just took some dabs

443
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,169
of some stuff called whammy bar nectar

444
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:09,659
from Green Dot labs the strains are a

445
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:12,568
lemon essence and papaya the flavor is

446
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:15,058
described as honeysuckle lemon candy and

447
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:16,738
lemon candies so if lemon candy wasn't

448
00:15:15,058 --> 00:15:18,838
enough they threw in more lemon candies

449
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:21,329
I definitely got the honeysuckle flavor

450
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:23,879
the lemon was just hinted it kind of

451
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:25,708
reminded me of like a sweet girly tea

452
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:27,720
like if you had a celestial Seasonings

453
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:30,178
tea that had sort of a honeysuckle hint

454
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,920
to it sort of a lemony sweetness to it

455
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:34,919
that's kind of what it reminded me of

456
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,838
the high went straight to my face I feel

457
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,519
it in my eyes it kind of feels like I'm

458
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:40,170
wearing snowboard goggles or heavy

459
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,480
sunglasses or something

460
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:43,979
they named the strain headband headband

461
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,360
because when they smoked it they said it

462
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:46,528
felt like they were wearing a headband

463
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,110
they had something around their head

464
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:51,749
they could totally rename this strain to

465
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:54,418
like scuba goggles or snowboard goggles

466
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:56,159
or 3d glasses or something like that cuz

467
00:15:54,418 --> 00:15:58,828
it went right to my eyes I felt it right

468
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,659
in my face immediately and the taste is

469
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:02,428
delicious great concentrates as always

470
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:03,778
from Green Dot labs and of course they

471
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:05,578
do not pay me to say that I'm not

472
00:16:03,778 --> 00:16:07,860
sponsored by them by anyway I don't get

473
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,659
any deals from anybody I just really

474
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,100
approve of this concentrate so big shout

475
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,438
out to them and I like to let you guys

476
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:17,339
know what I am smoking on a little look

477
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:19,349
into my world speaking of a little look

478
00:16:17,339 --> 00:16:21,540
into my world I was on Instagram live

479
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:23,909
today and somebody gave me a thank-you

480
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:26,159
for the episode with Jesse they said

481
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:28,019
thanks for pulling back the curtain and

482
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,578
letting us peek behind the curtain a

483
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:31,198
little bit they meant that we were

484
00:16:29,578 --> 00:16:32,578
talking about the industry Jesse and I

485
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,958
of course have been in the legal

486
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:36,359
cannabis industry since its inception

487
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:38,159
here in Colorado so we were talking a

488
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,168
lot about the legal candidate cannabis

489
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,118
industry and its evolution so we had a

490
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:43,798
listener say thank you for peeling back

491
00:16:42,119 --> 00:16:45,660
the curtain hey dude thank you again for

492
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:48,568
listening I do appreciate it and I'm

493
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:50,490
glad you guys enjoy the the insight sort

494
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:52,740
of the view into our world sometimes I

495
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:54,480
forget that you guys may be in a state

496
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,009
that doesn't have legal cannabis or you

497
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,139
may not be able to find Ken

498
00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:00,029
mr. concentrates and you were living

499
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:01,889
vicariously through me so I tried to

500
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:03,720
keep you guys updated I try to keep you

501
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,220
guys included and I try to have fun with

502
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:07,140
you guys so thanks for hanging out and I

503
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,059
hope you enjoy the updates you guys I'm

504
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,280
awful rambly after those dabs but we

505
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:14,009
were gonna make this happen to continue

506
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:16,259
this flow kind of segue into this when

507
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:18,119
jesse was here we really were having a

508
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:19,349
good time we got really into our

509
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,769
conversations and there were a few

510
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:25,379
things that I missed that I wanted to

511
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:27,150
cover in that episode so just real

512
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,100
quickly I want to recap a couple of

513
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:32,040
things that I missed on the last episode

514
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,959
of course the last episode was based on

515
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:36,029
a question somebody asked me why is it

516
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,309
so difficult to set up a grow indoors

517
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:41,039
when it happens naturally by itself

518
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:43,200
outdoors of course Jesse and I had a lot

519
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,420
of information to give on that my main

520
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,039
piece of advice was it doesn't just

521
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,330
happen naturally outdoors it may look

522
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,190
like it because you don't see us out

523
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:52,199
there all day but when the Sun comes up

524
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:53,880
we're already out there watering we're

525
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,200
doing any defoliation that needs to be

526
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:57,210
done we're taking care of the garden

527
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,710
before the peak of the Sun in the middle

528
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,390
of the day or at least we're trying to

529
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:02,069
so there's a lot of [ __ ] to be done out

530
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,140
outdoors and outdoor growing it doesn't

531
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:05,519
just happen you could throw some clones

532
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,680
out there some seeds out there and hope

533
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,940
at the end of the year you get a crop

534
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,350
but if you want a high quality garden

535
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,970
you need to be out there every day

536
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,500
taking care of those plants making sure

537
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:15,240
there's no pests there's no problems you

538
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,680
have to defoliate you have to do pruning

539
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,299
you have to do lolli popping you have to

540
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:20,759
do popping and twisting and cracking

541
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:23,279
there's so much to be done so that was

542
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:26,940
my first point then here are a couple of

543
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:29,460
things that I missed so growing indoors

544
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,960
all of the pests that are there all of

545
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,730
the bugs that are there were brought in

546
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,160
by you either on your clothes on your

547
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:36,420
shoes or in another plant that you

548
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,000
brought into the grow if you brought

549
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:40,800
clones home from a dispensary or from a

550
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,180
friend those pests came there now

551
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,190
there's nothing there to combat those

552
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,860
pests because you only brought in those

553
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:49,440
pests outdoors if you get a small spider

554
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:51,240
spider mite infestation something

555
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,070
outside will come along and eat those

556
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,910
spider mites and run them off and then

557
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:55,109
in a couple of days

558
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,960
something's gonna come along and eat

559
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:59,579
those and run them off outside is always

560
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,090
competing for territory so you're not

561
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:05,220
going to get as troublesome and massive

562
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:07,049
bug infestations as you are indoors

563
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,750
because you're gonna have some sort of a

564
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:11,879
balance so outdoors has balance

565
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,220
and a lot of that balance is what makes

566
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,630
it so much easier to grow out there like

567
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,250
I said in the other episode every time

568
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,510
you add a piece of equipment indoors you

569
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,700
have to add another piece of equipment

570
00:19:18,509 --> 00:19:22,200
to combat something that it does it's

571
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,759
got a side effect that's not desirable

572
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,039
now you need another piece of equipment

573
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,990
and that piece of equipment has another

574
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,250
side effect you add a light it gets hot

575
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,960
in the room you put an air conditioner

576
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,029
in there now it's gonna get too humid or

577
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,890
too dry so you're gonna have to add

578
00:19:33,029 --> 00:19:36,180
either a humidifier or dehumidifier now

579
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,770
you're gonna have runoff water you have

580
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,330
to do something with that water it's

581
00:19:37,769 --> 00:19:40,980
just a whole bunch of more things to add

582
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:42,659
every time you think about it if you

583
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,610
want to run co2 you need to rethink your

584
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,870
whole ventilation system it's just every

585
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:46,889
time you add something there's more to

586
00:19:45,869 --> 00:19:49,319
think about I'm gonna keep going with

587
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,450
the stuff that we missed outdoors is

588
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,819
naturally vented we don't need to

589
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:55,200
supplement co2 we can't add an air

590
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,990
conditioner you can't add a heater

591
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,000
outdoors is doing what it does it may be

592
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:01,769
too hot but the plants can adjust

593
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,680
because they're not trapped in that room

594
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:06,900
with no fresh air it is hot but it is

595
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,960
fresh hot air there's the proper amount

596
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,519
of co2 in there the plants there's wind

597
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,529
and airflow the plants aren't just

598
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,879
sucking up that stale moist water that's

599
00:20:13,529 --> 00:20:17,160
coming up from the pots when you water

600
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,660
all that water goes into the soil it

601
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,970
gets warm now water starts evaporating

602
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:22,500
up out of the soil that moist air goes

603
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,120
up all around your plants you're just in

604
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,490
there sucking up there in the sauna all

605
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:27,899
day outdoors they can kind of regulate

606
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,490
because they're outdoors they've got

607
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:32,160
fresh air it's not just that same

608
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,440
stagnant air all day so it's naturally

609
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,300
vented outside so we've talked about the

610
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:39,210
pest balance and we've talked about the

611
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:41,099
natural ventilation the natural co2 the

612
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:44,850
natural wind it's not trapped in there

613
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:46,740
breathing that same funky stagnant air

614
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:49,289
now let's talk about the main factor

615
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:53,430
that contributes to amazing outdoor

616
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:56,089
cannabis the Sun because the Sun is

617
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:58,769
everything without Sun nothing lives

618
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:01,500
nothing exists without the Sun we could

619
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:02,700
go for a little while but everything

620
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,480
would go to [ __ ] on earth without the

621
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,580
Sun so the Sun is the strongest most

622
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,980
powerful resource for the plants the Sun

623
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:13,349
is the main nutrient the plants want

624
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,660
light more than anything that is the

625
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:17,309
number one nutrient ingredient the

626
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,680
number one thing that your plants want

627
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:22,990
is light the more light you give them

628
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,880
the more energy they have to grow the

629
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,589
thicker the stocks can get the happier

630
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,090
the leaves can get which means the

631
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:30,428
fatter your buds are gonna get and

632
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:32,829
what's the best source of light you can

633
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:34,480
imagine it is the Sun you can take your

634
00:21:32,829 --> 00:21:36,579
lumen meter and you can put it outside

635
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,079
in the Sun and it's gonna max out you

636
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:40,149
can carry your lumen meter over to a

637
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,470
shady spot and it's still so sunny

638
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,870
outside that it's not gonna matter

639
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,910
that's how much Sun is outside you can

640
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:47,500
move your lumen meter a couple of inches

641
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:49,630
away from a grow light and it's gonna

642
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:53,950
show differences that's how strong the

643
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:56,230
Sun is the Sun gives those plants extra

644
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,700
energy to fight any problems that they

645
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,529
may have if they've got some bugs

646
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,000
attacking them they're not as weak as

647
00:21:59,529 --> 00:22:04,450
the indoor plants that have been getting

648
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,490
fed LED lighting or even high pressure

649
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,140
sodium lighting you've got to turn into

650
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:09,730
electricity and shoot down some wires

651
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,230
and then send it to this bulb and hope

652
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:13,299
that that bulb gives it enough energy to

653
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,610
live it does work it's working just fine

654
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:16,799
but it is not comparable to the Sun the

655
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:19,329
Sun is like putting it on

656
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,399
performance-enhancing drugs the Sun is

657
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:23,109
what makes everything live you guys all

658
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,990
of us there are cultures that worship

659
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:27,669
the Sun so when you put those plants

660
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:31,029
outdoors if they're getting a little bug

661
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:32,470
infestation first off the other bugs are

662
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:33,970
gonna come and fight them off if you got

663
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,410
spider mites some other bug is gonna go

664
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,610
oh hey bro there's a bunch of a little

665
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:37,990
spider mites over here let's go [ __ ]

666
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:39,609
eat them all all those other bugs are

667
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,900
gonna go eat those and hopefully those

668
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,099
bugs don't eat your plants what if they

669
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,630
do you know what some other bugs is

670
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:44,740
gonna go hey brother there's a bunch of

671
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,970
these bugs over here looking like a

672
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,679
bunch of [ __ ] let's go eat them and

673
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,610
those bugs are gonna go eat those and

674
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,050
then they're gonna get bored and they're

675
00:22:48,609 --> 00:22:51,669
gonna ramble on look for more bugs to

676
00:22:50,049 --> 00:22:53,230
eat so the first thing that's gonna

677
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:54,880
happen to bugs are gonna eat them second

678
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,650
of all they're gonna be much more

679
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,510
healthy because they're outdoor plants

680
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,309
they are getting the sunshine how much

681
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:02,170
healthier do you feel when you go spend

682
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:03,369
a day outside if you're not feeling good

683
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,140
if you got a runny nose if you got a

684
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:06,369
cold if you're sneezing you just go sit

685
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,780
in the sunshine for a little while and

686
00:23:06,369 --> 00:23:09,489
it will cook that [ __ ] out of you and

687
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,319
you will feel better how often have you

688
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:11,829
been bummed out and depressed or pissed

689
00:23:11,319 --> 00:23:13,089
off

690
00:23:11,829 --> 00:23:15,129
you just go lean against the tree and

691
00:23:13,089 --> 00:23:17,349
sit in the sunshine you feel better the

692
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:19,450
Sun is [ __ ] Magic you guys so it

693
00:23:17,349 --> 00:23:21,549
makes the plants stronger it gives them

694
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:23,799
a better self defense it makes them

695
00:23:21,549 --> 00:23:26,609
healthier overall so that is one aspect

696
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:28,928
of the Sun now another aspect is

697
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:30,909
photosynthesis heavily increases with

698
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:33,160
all that natural sunlight there's every

699
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:34,870
ray that this plants want everything

700
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:36,340
they naturally think they should get is

701
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:36,849
happening they're not missing a certain

702
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:38,500
speck

703
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:40,028
so they are able to grow more

704
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,950
appropriately they can update their

705
00:23:40,028 --> 00:23:44,288
nutrients more properly they can eat

706
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:46,509
more you can feed them more because they

707
00:23:44,288 --> 00:23:48,490
perform stronger it's like you've got

708
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:50,649
Usain Bolt out there just [ __ ]

709
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,058
running as fast as he can of course he's

710
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:53,589
gonna need to eat a little bit more than

711
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:55,359
my scrawny ass who's sitting here at the

712
00:23:53,589 --> 00:23:57,490
[ __ ] table all day I would be an

713
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,439
indoor grow plant Usain Bolt would be an

714
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,950
outdoor grow plant maybe we should say

715
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,919
LeBron James is probably more more

716
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:09,278
applicable today LeBron is a [ __ ]

717
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,259
outdoor [ __ ] hybrid vigor [ __ ]

718
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,480
ganja plant I'm an indoor or [ __ ]

719
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:15,220
yeah I'm just an indoor plant and you

720
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,200
can see the difference right

721
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,269
LeBron Oh pushed me down and dunk on me

722
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,730
I would ask him for the ball so I could

723
00:24:19,269 --> 00:24:23,230
maybe have a chance to play that's so

724
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,419
outdoor plants are getting those

725
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,819
sunshine rays they're getting so much

726
00:24:25,419 --> 00:24:29,500
stronger they're way healthier they're

727
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:32,138
able to process their nutrients better

728
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:33,909
they're getting fresh air they're

729
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:35,740
getting all the cycles that are a little

730
00:24:33,909 --> 00:24:37,360
tougher because how tough would you be

731
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:38,829
if you had to sit out there and [ __ ]

732
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,240
deal with the morning dew' every morning

733
00:24:38,829 --> 00:24:42,009
just getting all over you just all cold

734
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,569
and funky and boyish like goddamn and

735
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:45,190
I'm cold and [ __ ] I can do about it and

736
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:46,269
then the Sun starts coming up and you

737
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,679
just start getting hot and you're just

738
00:24:46,269 --> 00:24:49,690
getting cooked you're like [ __ ] I'm just

739
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,700
getting roasted now I wish the [ __ ]

740
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,320
morning dew drops had come back and then

741
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,960
the wind comes and starts bending me

742
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:57,490
over and whipping your ass and then

743
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,409
probably like a squirrel climbed up you

744
00:24:57,490 --> 00:25:01,690
or something or a goat peed on you and

745
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:03,399
then as the day went on it got hot as

746
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,778
[ __ ] and then the Sun started going down

747
00:25:03,398 --> 00:25:06,158
and it got real windy and then it got

748
00:25:04,778 --> 00:25:07,480
kind of cold to where you wish is a

749
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,250
plant you wish you could go get a little

750
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,759
plant hoodie cuz it's kind of chilly out

751
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,679
there

752
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,870
but that makes those plants that much

753
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,179
stronger and that much more robust and

754
00:25:13,869 --> 00:25:18,908
that much more vigorous so the Sun and

755
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:21,370
the outdoor just nature just makes

756
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:23,289
everything a little bit stronger so I

757
00:25:21,369 --> 00:25:25,000
wouldn't say it makes it easier but it

758
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:27,638
definitely is a corrector if you make

759
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,159
mistakes outdoors the sunshine will have

760
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:31,599
so much more forgiveness for you the

761
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,639
sunshine will help you out if you've got

762
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,949
a plant with problems that Sun just like

763
00:25:33,638 --> 00:25:38,589
a human a depressed or sick human the

764
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:41,500
sunshine will be a turbo boost to heal

765
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:43,298
you and your plants so that's mainly

766
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:45,339
what I wanted to add when Jesse was here

767
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:46,990
I did not think to rant on how important

768
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:48,939
the Sun was we had a lot of things going

769
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:50,650
on like I said earlier you guys there

770
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:53,169
are cultures that worship

771
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:55,720
the Sun our entire solar system spins

772
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:57,580
around the Sun so it's got to be doing

773
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,380
something right it's got to do something

774
00:25:57,579 --> 00:26:01,629
special to the plants and you can see it

775
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:03,460
that's why outdoor growing is completely

776
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,929
different than indoor growing also you

777
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,909
have to deal with that Sun while you're

778
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:08,830
out there and an indoor grow environment

779
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:10,570
it's like 77 degrees I got the air

780
00:26:08,829 --> 00:26:12,819
conditioner blowing if it gets too hot

781
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:14,230
in there I can just not be in there for

782
00:26:12,819 --> 00:26:16,480
a few minutes if you're in the outdoor

783
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,849
grow you're an outdoor grow if it's 107

784
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,778
degrees outside guess what it's 107 good

785
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:21,969
luck deal with it

786
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:23,409
so that's the downfall to the outdoor

787
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,778
growing is you've got to be out there

788
00:26:23,409 --> 00:26:27,100
also so I'm not gonna end or say

789
00:26:25,778 --> 00:26:28,538
anything about the potency or the

790
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:30,189
quality or the difference on which is

791
00:26:28,538 --> 00:26:31,629
better indoor outdoor that's still gonna

792
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,149
be another debate for another episode

793
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:38,080
but I wanted to add some of the things I

794
00:26:34,148 --> 00:26:41,250
left on why it's so challenging indoors

795
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:43,599
when it just happens naturally outdoors

796
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:45,669
now that I feel like I got that caught

797
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,230
up let's read an email from a listener

798
00:26:45,669 --> 00:26:49,028
it doesn't say if they want me to say

799
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,788
their name so I'm gonna get right into

800
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:53,230
the email it goes like this thanks for

801
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:55,329
all of your help I've learned so much

802
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,278

803
00:26:55,329 --> 00:26:59,259

from us and thanks for listening to

813
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,240
those Thursday episodes because that was

814
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,190
a lot of work to put those together so

815
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,778
I'm glad you appreciate those and man

816
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,330
you are a crazy dude if you think you

817
00:27:22,778 --> 00:27:27,759
could listen to me all day that's pretty

818
00:27:25,329 --> 00:27:29,918
intense anyway dude thanks for the great

819
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,538
message he says big shout-out to you and

820
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,970
all of your guests then he also says

821
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:36,099
okay enough ass-kissing so I've been a

822
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,899
gardener for a while now and it still

823
00:27:36,099 --> 00:27:40,418
bothers me when it's time to cut them

824
00:27:37,898 --> 00:27:42,250
down so it sounds like this guy's been

825
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:44,470
growing cannabis for quite a while but

826
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,759
when it's harvest time it still bothers

827
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,130
him he's got a little emotional

828
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,349
attachment he continues the email with I

829
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,090
was wondering if it gets easier in a big

830
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:53,889
grow when you have to cut down hundreds

831
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:56,168
or do you still have that special

832
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:57,820
connection to them I just don't think I

833
00:27:56,169 --> 00:27:59,288
would enjoy working in a big grow it

834
00:27:57,819 --> 00:28:01,960
seems like it's more about production

835
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:03,908
than caring and nurturing a life I know

836
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,250
you really care for the plants so what

837
00:28:03,909 --> 00:28:06,590
is your

838
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:08,480
harvest day like again thanks for the

839
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:10,939
great podcast and all of your help

840
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,099
take a fatass deb for me bro he didn't

841
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,720
even sign it it just says from my iPad

842
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:16,369
so hey dude thanks for the great email

843
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,559
if anybody out there would like to send

844
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:21,739
me an email my email address is grow

845
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,909
from your heart at hotmail.com you know

846
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,569
I'd love to hear from you now let's

847
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,680
answer some of this question he said

848
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:29,539
does it get easier

849
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,769
when you have to cut down hundreds or do

850
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,440
you still have that special connection

851
00:28:30,769 --> 00:28:35,420
with them you know the first time it was

852
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,340
kind of intimidating to cut down a giant

853
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:39,860
room we cut down forty two lights worth

854
00:28:37,339 --> 00:28:41,990
of plants I don't even remember the

855
00:28:39,859 --> 00:28:44,389
exact number it was close to seventy

856
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:47,539
five pounds of product that was my first

857
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:50,480
harvest in that facility it was a little

858
00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:52,220
intimidating but I don't know that I had

859
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,809
some sort of like oh no they're cutting

860
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,579
down my children I think I understand

861
00:28:53,809 --> 00:28:58,039
I've grown for so long that I understand

862
00:28:55,579 --> 00:28:59,750
that's the process now the commercial

863
00:28:58,039 --> 00:29:02,420
grow you're kind of right it is about

864
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:04,579
production at the commercial grow it's

865
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:06,170
all about cutting them down cleaning the

866
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:07,939
room putting more plants in there

867
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:09,410
getting those plants to the dry and cure

868
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,670
room paying attention to them every day

869
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:12,710
so that we can get them trimmed and

870
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:15,529
dried and ready to go to the patients

871
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:17,509
now that's where you get to see the

872
00:29:15,529 --> 00:29:19,940
reward so the that weird feeling you

873
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:23,180
have of cutting them down just think of

874
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:26,450
that as one step closer to somebody with

875
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:28,580
cancer or seizures being that much

876
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,130
closer to feeling better so that's a way

877
00:29:28,579 --> 00:29:32,839
to kind of offset that weird cutting

878
00:29:31,130 --> 00:29:34,040
down your babies sort of feeling I don't

879
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:36,049
think I have that feeling in the

880
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,970
commercial grows anymore now it's like

881
00:29:36,049 --> 00:29:39,529
we've got a lot to do let's get in here

882
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,829
and get it done and we've got a big team

883
00:29:39,529 --> 00:29:44,269
that so we got a guy going through

884
00:29:42,829 --> 00:29:45,710
there's three layers of trellis netting

885
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:47,480
we got a guy that goes through and cuts

886
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:48,829
the two bottom layers off never cut that

887
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,480
top layer off as it goes all crazy

888
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:51,769
they'll go through and clean out the two

889
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,299
bottom layers a net and then we got a

890
00:29:51,769 --> 00:29:54,950
guy that comes through and cuts the

891
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,089
plants at the base and then we got

892
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,009
another guy that'll come through and

893
00:29:56,089 --> 00:30:00,409
pull those plants out of that net and

894
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:01,849
then get them onto a tray or under like

895
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,900
a little car and then that little car it

896
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:04,609
gets a bunch of plants and it gets

897
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:06,560
wheeled over to the scale there's a guy

898
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:08,329
weighing each plant shouting out numbers

899
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,279
to either Mike or Ernie

900
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:12,109
mmm excuse me for the throat clearing I

901
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:13,670
apologize that guy shouts out numbers to

902
00:30:12,109 --> 00:30:15,439
Mike or ernie Mike and Ernie put those

903
00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,029
numbers into a spreadsheet then that

904
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,049
plant gets moved to a whole another area

905
00:30:17,029 --> 00:30:19,490
the dry and cure area

906
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,700
those guys hang it on the drying tear

907
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,680
line so it is a conveyor belt process at

908
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:28,039
harvest time in a big production

909
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:30,860
facility you're right you may not be

910
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:33,950
satisfied or enjoying working in a big

911
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:36,409
grow it's not meant to be like a craft

912
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:38,750
sort of a hobby grow it is something it

913
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,880
is a production facility so and you're

914
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:42,710
right it is more about production but it

915
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,500
is all about nurturing and caring for a

916
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:47,569
life we touch every single plant we D

917
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:50,180
foliate each plant we lollipop each

918
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:51,769
plant we crack every branch of the

919
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:55,460
plants so there is a lot of love put

920
00:30:51,769 --> 00:30:57,650
into them it is just done more quickly

921
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,569
and more methodically you don't put on

922
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:02,090
your favorite podcast and kind of relax

923
00:30:59,569 --> 00:31:03,799
and get stoned and listen to Rogen and

924
00:31:02,089 --> 00:31:05,809
pop these plants you got Rogen in the

925
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,309
headphones or the ear buds or whatever

926
00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:08,960
you're rocking but you're just cracking

927
00:31:07,309 --> 00:31:11,029
plants and moving it's kind of it is

928
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,640
more of a high pace sort of a production

929
00:31:11,029 --> 00:31:15,200
thing you got to go fast it the the pace

930
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,060
II work in a home grow and Jesse even

931
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,830
said it on an episode the pace you work

932
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:20,690
in a home draw would not pay the bills

933
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:23,359
in a commercial facility so it is a way

934
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:24,590
different sort of a thing your question

935
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,240
says I know you really care for the

936
00:31:24,589 --> 00:31:28,250
plants so what is your harvest day like

937
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,470
I just told you that it's kind of like

938
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:33,579
Jason and Freddy going in there and just

939
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:36,620
destroying [ __ ] but on the same token I

940
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:38,839
also have a private grow a personal grow

941
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:41,029
with six plants I've got six in flower

942
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:43,039
and six and veg cuz it's Colorado I'm a

943
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:45,440
lot 12 plants with my medical marijuana

944
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,440
card so I've got a very small garden

945
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,660
that's the garden where I put on Joey

946
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,190
Diaz or Joe Rogan or Doug loves movies

947
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:56,570
or tadd hussies podcast and I'll put on

948
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:58,160
one of those shows and I'll get my ear

949
00:31:56,569 --> 00:32:00,049
buds in and I'll get nice and baked and

950
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,900
I'll go play with the plants and those

951
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:04,970
are the plants that I get to really love

952
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,610
and care for and nurture a little more

953
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,860
personally like I do love all the plants

954
00:32:07,609 --> 00:32:12,049
in the large facility but there's a lot

955
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:13,759
of them and you can't you can't will

956
00:32:12,049 --> 00:32:16,069
remember hey did you check that one

957
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,539
plant over in row three that just keeps

958
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:19,460
being a [ __ ] we know we we can identify

959
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:22,190
we'll have a relationship with one plant

960
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,529
if it's standing out but in my home grow

961
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:26,990
I can tell you which plant is in each

962
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:29,180
room and in which position so if they're

963
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,099
in the flowering room there are six pots

964
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,640
under one light I can tell you if I

965
00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:33,319
numbered the

966
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,240
one two three four five six I could tell

967
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:37,519
you which plant is which I know that

968
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,990
King Solomon is number four because he's

969
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:41,210
the first one in that front row and then

970
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,890
I don't even want to tell you that

971
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,450
Clementine is in there and Clementine is

972
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,820
about to get pollinated by King Solomon

973
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,019
and there's a few other really cool

974
00:32:46,819 --> 00:32:49,669
things in there but yeah I got another

975
00:32:48,019 --> 00:32:51,559
breeding project going on and I can tell

976
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:53,570
you each plant that is in there and I

977
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:55,639
can tell you like what has gone on with

978
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:57,559
it and when I cracked this sticks on it

979
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,600
and everything that it's been fed so

980
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,769
there is a huge difference between the

981
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,299
commercial grow and the personal draw

982
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:04,039
I've got a different relationship with

983
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:05,839
the commercial grow and the personal

984
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:07,460
grow it's like being in two different

985
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,319
bands it's like being in a death metal

986
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:11,269
band where all night long I've got to be

987
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:12,950
just my feet are going and I'm intense

988
00:33:11,269 --> 00:33:14,210
and if I miss one beat it's all [ __ ]

989
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,920
and you just got to be going lightning

990
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,600
fast and killing it that's the

991
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:19,789
commercial grow then I guess I got a

992
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:21,379
reggae band for my homegrown where it's

993
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,789
chill we're gonna get the songs are

994
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,230
gonna sound good we're gonna relax and

995
00:33:22,789 --> 00:33:26,059
Aaron's gonna have a good time and what

996
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,589
needs to happen will happen like it's

997
00:33:26,059 --> 00:33:29,419
it's like being in two totally different

998
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:31,069
bands it's like having two totally

999
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,630
different relationships it's like the

1000
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:34,279
difference between being in a hugely

1001
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:36,170
successful band that plays the Pepsi

1002
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:38,299
Center or being in a band that plays

1003
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:40,700
like the black sheep it's a totally

1004
00:33:38,299 --> 00:33:42,919
different environment I love those big

1005
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:44,600
Pepsi Center gigs it's a lot of fun it's

1006
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,279
a lot of challenging I like the sweat

1007
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:48,019
and the challenge of are we gonna get

1008
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:50,089
this done and we got to go 100 miles an

1009
00:33:48,019 --> 00:33:51,829
hour but at the same time you also enjoy

1010
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:53,269
those little black sheep gigs or you

1011
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,980
know everybody in the audience and you

1012
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:56,960
can see the whole crowd and you just get

1013
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:59,779
to smile and relax a little bit so I

1014
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,809
love them both but I try not to get too

1015
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:04,309
personally attached to the plants in the

1016
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:05,869
commercial grow one of the hard things

1017
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,879
is when we decide to get rid of a

1018
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:08,960
cultivar at the commercial grow will be

1019
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,519
like so we've been looking at the

1020
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,190
numbers and this cut doesn't produce

1021
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:15,409
very much or maybe it's not reaching up

1022
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,668
to lab testing expectations or something

1023
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,619
like that so we'll end up getting rid of

1024
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,059
a cut and sometimes that hurts my

1025
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:22,309
feelings because sometimes I really like

1026
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:24,500
them but other than that I try not to

1027
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:26,029
get too attached I do get really excited

1028
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,019
when we get new stuff in a commercial

1029
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,790
grow though if we've been running the

1030
00:34:27,019 --> 00:34:30,530
same genetics and you're like hey we

1031
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:32,300
just got blueberry cookies I'm like oh

1032
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,890
yeah that kind of stuff does get me

1033
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,080
excited but I try not to get too

1034
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:37,819
personally attached to the commercial

1035
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,789
grow I try to keep in mind that that is

1036
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:42,950
business and then I keep the home grow

1037
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:44,480
the personal grow more like the one that

1038
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:45,408
I'm kind of more intimate and personal

1039
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,389
with

1040
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:50,179
so dude thanks for the great email you

1041
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:52,608
are right you may not enjoy working in a

1042
00:34:50,179 --> 00:34:54,378
commercial growing facility but you may

1043
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:56,778
learn a lot of things that you could

1044
00:34:54,378 --> 00:34:58,400
take home and implement into your home

1045
00:34:56,778 --> 00:34:59,900
grow that would make you more efficient

1046
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,789
and more productive and more cost

1047
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,528
effective so it may be worth the

1048
00:35:01,789 --> 00:35:05,269
trade-off and also it's something you've

1049
00:35:03,528 --> 00:35:07,608
got experience in so you may not hate it

1050
00:35:05,268 --> 00:35:09,439
it may be fun it may be value valuable

1051
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:11,568
for you and it will also make you

1052
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,190
