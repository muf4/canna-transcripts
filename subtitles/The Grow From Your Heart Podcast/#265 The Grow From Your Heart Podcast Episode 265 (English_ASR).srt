podcast the main heart and soul is going

46
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,340
to be somebody sent me an email they

47
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,450
wanted to know since aren't a lot of our

48
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,400
friends who are working dispensaries and

49
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:03,500
I've been in dispensary environment for

50
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,240
the past several years we got a question

51
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,669
they want to know about what's the

52
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,159
craziest [ __ ] we have ever seen in a

53
00:04:07,669 --> 00:04:11,569
dispensary or to smoke event but before

54
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,569
we get to that I want to do a couple of

55
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:15,949
emails let's do let's do Kip's first

56
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:17,988
because his name is Kip and that's cool

57
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:21,259
as [ __ ] I've never met anybody in person

58
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:24,169
whose name was Kip I don't think your

59
00:04:21,259 --> 00:04:26,569
name is Kip he's got cool parents Kip

60
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,340
shoutout to Kip ah I found Kip on

61
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:30,620
Facebook you sent me a message it says I

62
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:32,359
have some plants that I need that I had

63
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,680
a friend take care of during a trip and

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,199
even though an average he's a decent

65
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,579
grower he put my 10 inch plants with his

66
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:39,740
that were a few feet high and didn't

67
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:41,389
raise him up and they were severely

68
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,519
stretched almost 8 inches between notes

69
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,899
he said on average I'd waste him and

70
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,089
start a new stock but I'm currently out

71
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:48,289
of seeds and clones due to the trip and

72
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:50,239
I don't have any good candidates for

73
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:52,129
clones other than the tops of the plants

74
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,840
there's your answer right there bro he

75
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:56,480
goes on to say if it wasn't the last of

76
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,649
the genetics I had I'd waste them or

77
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,330
pull the tops and clone it but I'm

78
00:04:57,649 --> 00:05:02,179
wondering if you had any quick ways to

79
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:04,189
maybe get a plant to put out some shoots

80
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,490
so I have something to clip by the

81
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:11,389
corner I'm running 600 watt HBS at the

82
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:12,860
time age-old newts in dirt I usually use

83
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:14,870
nectar the gods but I can't see spending

84
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:16,009
a fortune to raise these plants any help

85
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,439
would be appreciated

86
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,550
uh you can put them into bigger pots and

87
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:21,350
top them and they'll start shooting out

88
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,730
more shoots give them a high phosphorous

89
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,170
diet with a lot of nitrogen and

90
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,210
phosphorous they'll spit out more shoots

91
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,500
there's a product called Bushmaster

92
00:05:26,209 --> 00:05:29,930
that'll make them shoot out more shoots

93
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,399
put them into bigger pots feed them a

94
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:32,689
good diet and they'll shoot out more

95
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,560
shoots even plenty of white give them

96
00:05:32,689 --> 00:05:35,418
plenty of space

97
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:38,060
top them do some topping and pinching

98
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:39,949
techniques but your main answer to your

99
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,750
question is what's left

100
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,060
the tops of those plants clone those bro

101
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,129
Kono's right away get those healthy tops

102
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,930
cloned in the cloner labeled get them

103
00:05:46,129 --> 00:05:50,060
routed and then take really good care of

104
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,889
those new clothes that's the solution

105
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,389
for that Kip I appreciate the message on

106
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:56,079

107

112
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:45,589
email about these folks have seen some

113
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:47,150
interesting he says one Rasta Jeff first

114
00:06:45,589 --> 00:06:48,829
off I love the podcast I burned through

115
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:51,409
all the episodes on stitcher and about a

116
00:06:48,829 --> 00:06:53,209
week and I have to wait painfully from

117
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:58,040
week to week for each new episode I

118
00:06:53,209 --> 00:07:00,709
think yeah if you go to my website I

119
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,170
read genetics Colorado comm there are

120
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,699
100 episodes available on there for you

121
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,319

122
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,539

125
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:14,180
[ __ ] that's not up there I do need to

126
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,649
post some of the older stuff there's

127
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,449
some stuff it was really useful that is

128
00:07:15,649 --> 00:07:19,759
phased out like a couple of episodes

129
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:21,889
were really so those early episodes had

130
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,750
a lot of heavy girl information I may go

131
00:07:21,889 --> 00:07:25,789
throw some of those out like midweek

132
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:29,089
episodes just as bonus repeats again

133
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:31,850
alright but anyway he says I found that

134
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:33,500
what it lets see being from an illegal

135
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,540
state of Pennsylvania I cannot take your

136
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,639
advice in the literal sense due to

137
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,350
legalities however I have found that

138
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,169
what is good for the cannabis plant is

139
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,670
also good for some vegetable plants

140
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,230
adding organic nutrients such as compost

141
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:46,699
teas and trimming techniques like wall-e

142
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,860
popping have done wonders for my

143
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,379
tomatoes and hot peppers keep up the

144
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,980
good work I'm glad that's applicable to

145
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:55,469
your outdoor veggie her that's

146
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,569
he goes on to say I was I also welcome

147
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,160
the great advice from white Mike on the

148
00:07:57,569 --> 00:08:00,449
legal side of things recently in

149
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,700
Pennsylvania the Senate House

150
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,229
unanimously passed a bill allowing for

151
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,759
restricted hemp production for

152
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,530
university research it's currently

153
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,759
awaiting the final signature from

154
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:13,409
Governor Tom wolf Tom wolf yes I know we

155
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,180
are miles behind Colorado but I guess we

156
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,770
need to start somewhere it continues

157
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,389
with my wife and I will have the

158
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:20,909
pleasure of visiting your fine state

159
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:23,579
next week that'll probably be by the

160
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:26,400
time this podcast airs emailing before

161
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:28,709
that but he says we are overjoyed if it

162
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,449
counting down for weeks we will of

163
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:32,159
course be flying into Denver into the

164
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:34,049
Denver area and beginning our venture

165
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,519
adventure from there my first question

166
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:37,379
is do you have any recommendations for

167
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,389
recreational dispensaries in the Denver

168
00:08:37,379 --> 00:08:42,000
region we want to make sure we establish

169
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:44,370
a reputable place with products that are

170
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,139
grown from the heart then a second

171
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:47,850
question is do you think you could do an

172
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:49,740
episode on how to troubleshoot and solve

173
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:51,090
different signs of nutrient burn and/or

174
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,120
nutrient deficiencies if you have a

175
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,670
potassium deficiency you would see these

176
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,679
signs as opposed to nitrogen deficiency

177
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,569
etc I think that would make a great

178
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,750
informative episode bro that episode is

179
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:07,470
gonna happen watch a screenshot of your

180

181
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,410
anyway before I keep rambling don't

182
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,590

that he had two questions for you guys

195
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,419
he asked about a dispensary a

196
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,269
recreational dispensary recommendation

197
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:46,860
in the Denver area I unfortunately have

198
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:49,079
no clue where to tell you to go because

199
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,360
I don't buy recreational cannabis I grow

200
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,740
and then I'm a master grower at a shop

201
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,919
or I just go there and pick up flowers

202
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:56,879
on that employee discount smoke those

203
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:59,039
does anybody in the room have a

204
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,419
recommendation for a reputable

205
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:08,858
dispensary in the Denver area

206
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:08,858
[Music]

207
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:14,330
my favorite places to send people the

208
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,250
clinic has a rec side the clinic is a

209
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:22,129
great place in my opinion flowers are

210
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:24,470
always quality anything in the room

211
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:25,730
listening they say natty REMS I was just

212
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,340
gonna say that

213
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:29,480
so did natty rims that's funny I would

214
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,430
say the only thing I can really

215
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:33,980
recommend is places I've been I've been

216
00:10:31,429 --> 00:10:45,709
into natty rims and it's actually a very

217
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:48,200
nice bit take green solutions I would

218
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:50,360
say fly into Denver get to your hotel

219
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,120
get on your phone download the weed Maps

220
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,440
app just look what's near your hotel and

221
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,659
then read reviews for a few of those

222
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,850
places and don't hit just one place go

223
00:10:56,659 --> 00:11:00,469
to a couple places I check them out get

224
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,240
the experience because every place is

225
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,430
going to have a different vibe of some

226
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,980
sort there's gonna be different music

227
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:09,469
like if the spot the music is loud it's

228
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,560
reggae in-your-face as soon as you get

229
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,570
there it's a party sales the environment

230
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:16,219
they want you to buy buy buy things are

231
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,200
set up to where it's like impulse buy is

232
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:20,480
right where you need them and it's got

233
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,280
that kind of flow to it green and

234
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,230
healthy on the other hand I know the

235
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:26,120
owner he wanted to set up more with the

236
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,620
art gallery sort of a feel and it does

237
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,330
have that sort of a feel it's more

238
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,399
spread out it's more spacious there's

239
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,560
artwork everywhere and so every

240
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:35,870
dispensary and the quality of product

241
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:39,469
from the two shops is amazingly [ __ ]

242
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,179
different different to I mean every

243
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,100
shops gonna have its own vibe its own

244
00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:44,689
selection its own way of doing things

245
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,360
and especially if you're from

246
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:48,980
Pennsylvania it's worth hitting several

247
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,690
just to check out the different ones

248
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,610
you're also gonna want to make time to

249
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:54,980
hit illusions glass gallery downtown

250
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,310
shout out to white Mike yeah you're

251
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,080
definitely not - yeah it's somewhere

252
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,579
you're gonna want to stop this just

253
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:04,040
makes make sure it's part of your trip

254
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,240
and be careful smoking in your hotel you

255
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:07,009
may think that because you're in

256
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,950
Colorado now we can smoke out the hotel

257
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:11,759
negative make sure that you've got a

258
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,560
marijuana friendly room and

259
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,450
worried about calling and asking the

260
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:17,099
hotel just call it from your phone and

261
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,690
pretend like you're lost or coming next

262
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,759
week and want to know what their policy

263
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:22,760
is they'll be happy to explain it to you

264
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,340
in your room or do something like that

265
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:33,149
I would highly recommend looking into

266
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:35,639
things like the smoke buddy and the like

267
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:44,159
scented candles from smoke shops the

268
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:46,620
ones that are actually yeah off the

269
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,539
smoke alarm they will charge you the 250

270
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,820
or 500 are cleaning for you depending on

271
00:12:48,539 --> 00:13:02,339
how boozy the hotel is charge you for

272
00:12:50,820 --> 00:13:04,440
that [ __ ] kinetic products is what they

273
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,780
are on Instagram their website to order

274
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,420
stuff will be up and running on the 25th

275
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:11,819
of this month so and I don't actually

276
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,500
have the exact website for that yet but

277
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,530
you can check them out on Instagram at

278
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:21,750
kinetic products and they have a wax pen

279
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:24,149
that has a quartz coil in it for a

280
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:26,279
little kinetic force because I think

281
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:40,039
when you see kinetic I see with a K but

282
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:43,100
it's the Colorado right it's see a

283
00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:46,649
[Music]

284
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:49,500
little bit all right so let's get back

285
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:51,169
on track Kip your second question first

286
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,250
question was dispensary recommendations

287
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:55,649
second question yes I'm gonna do that

288
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,000
make an episode on troubleshooting and

289
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:58,559
solving problems that's a really good

290
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,600
idea I've actually got a written down

291
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,039
it's gonna be a really in-depth one of

292
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,720
those long episodes I've got to write

293
00:14:02,039 --> 00:14:05,939
out and really plan well there's a lot

294
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:07,080
of stuff to think about I've got to find

295
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,610
a starting point I think the starting

296
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:15,210
point is printing out that chart that

297
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:19,870
shows you all the leaves with the

298

00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:56,950
east side of our town is [ __ ] there's a

00:15:54,278 --> 00:15:58,838

it's not it's not the prettiest place to

334
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:09,789
go so all those people came and then all

335
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:11,409
parts of Caro this was back in the

336
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:13,509
purely medical days it was just anybody

337
00:16:11,409 --> 00:16:15,909
who had or wanted I'm medical marijuana

338
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:17,649
card there would be we had probably ten

339
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:19,329
seats inside the place and there would

340
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,009
be people in every chair and then

341
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:23,589
standing outside waiting to come in

342
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:26,080
still and there was a receptionist and

343
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,700
myself as a budtender and then I hired

344
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,930
Mike as a backup but tender because I

345
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,150
couldn't get through everybody's there

346
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:50,229
and then my second week we hire

347
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:52,000
the security guard now if you're

348
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:57,759
thinking about opening you can just go

349
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,679
to your favorites there wasn't even that

350
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,659
the boss would pay me to drive to Denver

351
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,949
on the if I was going to a concert maybe

352
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:04,599
like here's some money stop at a couple

353
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,709
dispensaries pick up some advertisements

354
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,509
and some product and see what they got

355
00:17:05,709 --> 00:17:09,459
and he just throw me money to go do

356
00:17:07,509 --> 00:17:10,838
recon work and come back and kind of

357
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:13,769
adjust our [ __ ] to be a little bit

358

better every time we went crazy old dude

359
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:20,230
so Mike and I ran the first place and I

360
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:21,850
had some [ __ ] crazy experiences in

361
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,170
that place I wrote down just just to

362
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:28,859

maybe a 55 65 year old it's normal

transaction nothing surprising or

368
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,580
interesting about it and so right at the

00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:59,620
edge she's like you two are sweet here

370

check this out she reaches into her

371
00:17:59,619 --> 00:18:03,879
purse and pulls out this little plastic

372
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,160
bag with this plant it looked like old

373
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:10,330
bubblegum in Pocket lint like it was

374
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,710
black and in like stringy I guess is how

375
00:18:10,329 --> 00:18:15,389
I would describe it she's like you're

376

some opening for me I hope you enjoy it

[Music]

379
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:28,940
that place was bizarre that my favorite

380
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:32,240
people there were the the kids coming

381
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:34,090
there to sell so we just wander and Tara

382
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,380
was the terrified look on their face

383
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:42,439
with a little messenger bag that they

384
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:43,850
were kind of hugging to their side just

385
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,649
terrified because this was in the

386
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,389
beginning when like you could have as

387
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:49,639
much marijuana as you had medical cards

388
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:53,390
for but it was still four hundred and

389
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,038
outs like in the story and so they're

390
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:56,509
hauling around a lot more money than

391
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:58,849
they're comfortable with on their hip

392
00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:01,879
and as far as most people are concerned

393
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:04,519
that's a major crime just wanted into a

394
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,929
store to try and sell it like it's a

395
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:12,579
weird experience I'm sure well we can

396
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:15,440
meet a lot of friends from those folks

397
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:17,028
yeah I would offer those guys eight

398
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,558
hundred quarter pound or thirty two

399
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:20,089
hundred pound - take it or leave it

400
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,220
you could get nine hundred out of me if

401
00:19:20,089 --> 00:19:24,038
it was really really good but a lot of

402
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,750
those people will just look at me like

403

there's so many bizarre ones YouTube

falling down the stairs

it's the edibles one of the managers

415

owners would make they were all homemade

they were all delicious and they were

417
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:19,660
all insanely potent and she was sweet

418
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,670
and she would kind of insist that you

419
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:24,340
eat like one of everything when she'd

420
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,100
bring in a new batch and so by like

421
00:20:24,339 --> 00:20:29,649
middle midday or lunch you'd be like -

422
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:31,149
hi - form words sometimes and now

423
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:33,130
watching a co-worker tumble down a

424
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,019
switchback stare and then land like it's

425
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,520
sprawled out face-first in front of a

426
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:42,069
lobby full of customers and then they

427
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:46,839
just pop up they're like who's next down

428
00:20:42,069 --> 00:20:49,869
the stairs hauling all the plants out of

429
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:53,849
there do you remember that yeah we have

430
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:56,039
an RV or was it the RV time u-haul truck

431
00:20:53,849 --> 00:20:59,679
when we got shut down

432
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:03,039
that was just you have to stop and we

433
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,810
were like okay we'll stop then but we've

434
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,230
got the [ __ ] in the store where we do

435
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:07,450
with it

436
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,150
and basically all of the plants that

437
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:13,299
were in the grow were just if you want

438
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:16,420
them hauler and so for like half a day

439
00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:18,099
from like noon to midnight randomly

440

people would pull up out back walk

441
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:23,859
around knock on the door come inside

442
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:25,659
we'd pick out the half dozen or dozen or

443
00:21:23,859 --> 00:21:32,139
whatever plants they had paperwork for

444
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:34,029
and wanted they had they bail it was one

445
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:38,050
of the most Ranger experiences of my

life but it was a lot of fun to be like

at one point there was a u-haul and the

dude had was a caregiver for like 11

449
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,220
people and so we sat there and went

450
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:46,720
through his paperwork for like 20

451
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,539
minutes double-check and everything and

452
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,250
then loaded [ __ ] you don't even know by

like this is your one warning you know

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,750
and he was like well it's not a big deal

517
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:25,870
on gifting him this bud so I'm allowed

518
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,619
to do that and I was like no no you're

different rules for rec and medical and

when you're in a medical shop you have

to play by the height of the medical

your your to pharmacy and the pharmacist

526
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:51,519
is like here's your pills you know like

redistribute this medicine to anybody

else and so that's what our main concern

there is that you're not going nobody

they need that medicine they have the

that cannabis home and take it out of

the black package that we've sold it to

you in and some time passes we don't

know what happens after that and we

can't care but don't tell us about it

547

and take it out of our [ __ ] packaging

no matter what you do with it that was

thought it was a dispensary just the

obvious thing - you know what you know

it's actually really odd that really

doesn't have anything to do with weed I

559

was working in the smoke shop one day it

was a Saturday and me and my manager

were both on the floor and I had some

guy I was showing him some hand pipe and

I was I guess I should explain that I

don't have hair on the sides of my head

was like I had my head down and I was

00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,350
like pulling out a pipe to show him and

568
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:29,808
he reaches across the counter and he

569

takes his hand and he runs it across the

nightmarish customer like you did not

used to the light in the birds keep

652
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:25,450

656
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:42,339
bringing things into the dispensary I'm

657
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:45,640
friends with the person so I'm not gonna

658
00:30:42,339 --> 00:30:48,789
say where any of that but somebody came

659
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:53,830
into a place that I work and brought in

660
00:30:48,789 --> 00:31:00,250
a product that they wanted us to look at

661
00:30:53,829 --> 00:31:04,689
and the entire dome on the pen was just

662
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:08,950
like this color you know like you know

663
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:12,970
the like dome open globe could not even

664
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:18,759
see it and I was just like you can't

665
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:22,029
have that right vaporizers out of their

666
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:23,819
pocket left right I've got a weird bag

667
00:31:22,029 --> 00:31:25,899
of returned ones that we've got like

668
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:27,970
receipts in like as much documentation

669
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:30,130
as we can because we send them back to

670
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:31,839
the company for replacement units but

671
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:34,660
half of them are like burnout and a tiny

672
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:37,629
bit dirty and so we keep epic records on

673
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,670
all of that [ __ ] so that there's no but

674
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:41,890
that's a daily occurrence people pulling

675
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:46,930
[ __ ] like that out of their pocket Mike

676
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:49,060
at the place you work be careful how I

677
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:55,269
ask this you get a prize for wearing a

678
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:56,559
small shirt sometimes that's some of the

679
00:31:55,269 --> 00:31:58,259
random [ __ ] that I've seen happen at

680
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,319

I mean sometimes we'll see today in

682

weird things happen when it's that crazy

683
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:07,359
in the summer if you shop at Mike's

684
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:08,859
dispensary and you're in like a bikini

685
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:14,500
there's a good chance you'll get some

686
00:32:08,859 --> 00:32:24,819
gifts yeah it's funny when you watch all

687
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:26,259
the dudes there all right so I'm gonna

688
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,250
tell a ridiculous story that happened to

689
00:32:26,259 --> 00:32:28,480
be one time when I worked at our

690
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,329
dispensary that's probably be the last

691
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:31,490
one

692
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:33,319
crazy stories for this episode because

693
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:34,609
it thank you for listening so one day I

694
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,169
was working at work at the dispensary

695
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:40,490
selling goodall weed and it was myself

696
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:42,400
and my receptionist is I guess what she

697
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:46,549
would officially be her name was tree

698
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:53,480
she probably weighed 90 pounds and was

699
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:56,149
afraid of the wind she was and so one

700
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,470
day a normal customer there were regular

701
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,630
customers that would come in there was a

702
00:32:57,470 --> 00:33:00,740
lady she wasn't even a lady I'm not

703
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,450
gonna call her lady because of what she

704
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,609
did she was a female she was large

705
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:07,309
female and her husband was a dude who

706
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:08,719
was about equal size with me and they

707
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:12,019
would come in often and I knew who they

708
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,490
were and one day she came in early in

709
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:15,259
the morning and said how much is an

710
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,700
ounce and I told her in ounces this much

711
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,769
at the time at that dispensary an ounce

712
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:20,150
was three hundred and twenty dollars and

713
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:21,529
she said if I come up with three will

714
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:23,060
you do it since she was a regular

715
00:33:21,529 --> 00:33:25,279
customer I said don't tell anybody hook

716
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:26,539
you up for 300 bucks does like you send

717
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,920
your old man in later I'll do it for

718
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,750
three for him also because I got a baby

719
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:31,850
and they switch shifts and I just know

720
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:35,269
how that should work so she comes back

721
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:37,039
later and she's got like 200 I don't

722
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:38,990
even remember how it goes and she comes

723
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,839
in like way later we're about to close

724
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:43,309
and she comes back in and she's like hey

725
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,809
sell me an ounce for like 250 or

726
00:33:43,309 --> 00:33:46,399
whatever and I was like I can't do it

727
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:48,529
I'll do it for three any lesson that'll

728
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,480
get in trouble and she's like begging

729
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:52,099
and I'm like I can't do it just like let

730
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,650

776
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:19,579

779
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:32,149
scissors Within Reach like right within

780
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:33,320
reach I was about to go down and he's

781
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,059
like you [ __ ] you told my wife

782
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,710
they'd if you sold her an ounce were you

783
00:35:35,059 --> 00:35:38,630
torn out if she sucked your dick and and

784
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:40,610
then tree starts yelling I was right

785
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:42,140
[ __ ] here all that's between tree and

786
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:43,849
I and the office in the bud room is a

787
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,349
tapestry honestly that's all it was a

788
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:47,000
black tapestry and she's like I was

789
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:48,610
right here he didn't [ __ ] say any of

790
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,440
that she's like I can hear everything

791
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:53,210
he's like [ __ ] you and finally when he

792
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,710
turned his head I grabbed the mace and

793
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:56,090
the scissors I got the mace with my

794
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,369
right hand in the scissors with my left

795
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,900
hand and by now his girlfriend came in

796
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:03,170
too and was backing him up and left they

797
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,150
left the baby in the car and so I told

798
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:06,860
him bro you're kind of threatening me

799
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:08,180
and I'm not sure what to do about it so

800
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:09,440
I'm gonna [ __ ] mace you then I'm

801
00:36:08,179 --> 00:36:10,699
gonna stab you and then I'm gonna mace

802
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,429
your [ __ ] wife and then I'm gonna

803
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:18,349
call the cops if you guys and tree

804
00:36:13,429 --> 00:36:26,869
looked at me like wow peaceful dude that

805
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:28,400
grows weed and smoke weed and sees me

806
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:31,369
about to spray some dude in his face

807
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:33,559
stab him with [ __ ] trimmed scissors

808
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:35,329
and then go after his girl with the mace

809
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,980

827
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,720
they didn't like the idea of a

828
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,730
dispensary it sound like we should add a

829

830
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:27,019

beautiful all right you guys I told my

849
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:24,109
craziest story that I can think of what

850
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:26,449
so we didn't cover events really my

851
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:29,269
friend Katrina took she took a DAB and

852
00:38:26,449 --> 00:38:31,039

853
00:38:29,269 --> 00:38:33,170

854
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,210
her but we stayed in a really swanky

855
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:38,240
hotel the night before and they had free

856
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:39,860
lotion and she herself up in all the

857
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,419
damn lotion she used it all so I tried

858
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:47,660
to catch her and it was trying to like

859
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:49,130
trying to catch like three times and I

860
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:51,349
finally got her all awkward and then

861
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:52,730
Toni was with me and I go Toni just pick

862
00:38:51,349 --> 00:38:53,719
her up and put her on my shoulders bro

863
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,880
because I was holding her just like

864
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:57,199
she's like a wet noodle so he spun her

865
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:59,030
around and threw up on my shoulders now

866
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,099

870
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,820
drinking it and woke up

871
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:13,338

880
00:39:37,068 --> 00:39:40,338

881
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,838

882

demo dab dab and by the time the last of

887
00:39:54,858 --> 00:40:01,210
the smoke hit his lungs I'm pretty sure

888
00:39:56,659 --> 00:40:44,899
part of the dad came out of that came

889
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:48,108
out of his mouth my friend lovely work

890
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:53,170

since it's also the [ __ ] out oh my god

892
00:40:53,349 --> 00:40:57,530
the Terps for a couple few episodes

893
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:59,179
they're still around sorry I'm wiggling

894
00:40:57,530 --> 00:41:00,920
my head funny my hat is pulling my dread

895
00:40:59,179 --> 00:41:02,808
I need to fix that it's not a large

896
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:04,548
container but the last for these Terps

897
00:41:02,809 --> 00:41:05,390
are amazing did you guys get to try the

898
00:41:04,548 --> 00:41:09,650
lemon gene

899
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:09,650
[Music]

900
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:18,848
you can have to lick the bottle if you

901
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:20,589
want to taste ride the ghost with the

902
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,690
lemon gee I've heard about but haven't

903
00:41:20,588 --> 00:41:24,279
tried the ghost was wonderful we're

904
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:28,990
talking about ways to use it earlier I

905
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:32,700
really like pouring the OG Kush Terps on

906
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:36,338
to solvent less hash like the 120 micron

907
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,808
drip cream or blue sure - yeah just

908
00:41:36,338 --> 00:41:39,759
press out this ones press right here

909
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:41,740
there's like a little patty just just

910
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,869
pour a little drip on there it's pretty

911
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:45,129
it's pretty thick the Terps are pretty

912
00:41:43,869 --> 00:41:46,809
thick and kind of viscous so you got a

913
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,338
poor quickly or it'll run down the side

914
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:50,289
of the bottle you don't learn to get the

915
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:52,929
angle going but I really love parted on

916
00:41:50,289 --> 00:41:54,789
the [ __ ] solvent list I poured some

917
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:56,048
onto just a little piece of shatter the

918
00:41:54,789 --> 00:41:57,760
other day and so that I had a whole

919
00:41:56,048 --> 00:41:59,650
piece of shatter with some money and of

920
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,660
course I'm dripped onto the oil slick so

921
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,980
I was dipping it up using shatter and

922
00:42:01,659 --> 00:42:05,019
solvent listen whatever I was smoking

923
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:07,780
just rubbing it in on the oil slick my

924
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:10,420
favorite way honestly is to get a small

925
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,920
ish dad and then just dunk it right into

926
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,960
the Terps and don't even go too hard

927
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,430
just a little bit of Terps they just

928
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,769
smoke it that way I actually dropped a

929
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:19,989
little bit of the ghost train haze Terps

930
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:22,119
directly onto the email head made it

931
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:24,519
like the next five or six or eight dabs

932
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:28,599
to steel chirpy he didn't last as long

933

was a few weeks ago good [ __ ] luck to

950
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:08,858
the evil lab crew because we've seen a

951
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:10,240
lot of really cool cannabis products

952
00:43:08,858 --> 00:43:13,000
come out in the past a year past two

953
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:15,368
years past or whatever and this one

954
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,528
might be my favorite the Terps this

955
00:43:15,369 --> 00:43:19,390
might be the newest greatest thing to

956
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:20,449
come out in cannabis what do you think

957
00:43:19,389 --> 00:43:22,579
Mike

958
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:24,469
there's been some stuff recently that's

959
00:43:22,579 --> 00:43:27,920
been impressive but this kind of took it

960
00:43:24,469 --> 00:43:29,750
to another a new place a very fun new

961
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,220

965
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:40,460
eat a little tiny dab of that and I like

966
00:43:38,869 --> 00:43:41,960
to dip it into the OG Kush and then

967
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:43,519
maybe put it in the lemon G after that

968
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,900
then maybe revel on the coast rain hey

969
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:48,139

995
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:38,059
over the year yeah easily and it works

996
00:45:35,300 --> 00:46:05,900
it still works the coils are still good

997
00:45:38,059 --> 00:46:12,170
the workhorse because I've used a couple

998
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:13,730
of coils on this unit here more like a

999
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,050
microphone you guys for binding email

1000
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:20,679
get the one with the coil that looks

1001
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:20,680
like a microphone cable not the one yeah

1002
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:33,289
right yeah I remember when you were

1003
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:35,359
making that table in Florida like I

1004
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:37,639
remember you and I try to figure out how

1005
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:41,380
you are going to paint it and you doing

1006
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:44,269
the tape on the top yeah and the tape

1007
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:46,490
when you pulled it off or whatever and

1008
00:46:44,269 --> 00:46:50,469
that's the reason you painted it because

1009
00:46:46,489 --> 00:46:50,469
you originally we're gonna do something

1010
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:56,449

1011
00:46:53,199 --> 00:47:00,189
that's right and then when you put when

1012
00:46:56,449 --> 00:47:00,189
you put the tape down you pull the

1013
00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:15,440

[Music]

1038

half of shatter in each bar this is not

1039
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:58,300
100 percent THC this is probably in the

1040
00:49:56,590 --> 00:50:06,519
high 80s so they threw a gram and a half

1041
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:08,980
in there they couldn't be tested by the

1042
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:14,889
media they could maybe be products these

1043
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:17,349
are just somebody's days when anyone

1044
00:50:14,889 --> 00:50:19,000
could have used lab testing we only had

1186
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,250
about making feminized seeds and

1187
01:02:06,119 --> 01:02:10,319
selecting phenotypes / seeds and seed

1188
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:12,059
breeding and feminized seed making this

1189
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:13,440
one was right up my alley so I took a

1190
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:15,539
lot of notes this would be a great

1191
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,670
episode in my opinion I'm excited to do

1192
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:19,440
it but before we get that far let's talk

1193
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,389
about the secret session guys the secret

1194
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:23,369
session was just a few days ago and in

1195
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:24,719
my opinion this was the best secret

1196
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:27,569
session we've done in Colorado

1197
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:29,309
you know the secret session on 421 the

1198
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:31,110
day after 4/20 that was pretty [ __ ]

1199
01:02:29,309 --> 01:02:32,880
fantastic but that was the day after

1200
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:34,260
4/20 there were a lot of really cool

1201
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,360
people in town that wouldn't normally be

1202
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,980
here we had a lotta extra height because

1203
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,960
of 4/20 weekend a lot of extra momentum

1204
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:42,300
that really helped us out it was a

1205
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:45,179
little over overhyped and too big for me

1206
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,920
I like a smaller more intimate event so

1207
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:48,359
without all the hustle and bustle this

1208
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,680
was my favorite secret session I think

1209
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:51,269
there were plenty of people there the

1210
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:52,859
place was packed but it was a little

1211
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:54,809
more intimate there was more room to dab

1212
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,550
more room to chill out I was a little

1213
01:02:54,809 --> 01:02:57,929
quieter you could go get some quiet

1214
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:00,390
space and talk to some people if you

1215
01:02:57,929 --> 01:03:02,429

1308
01:05:47,550 --> 01:05:49,590
shoutouts I've got for the secret sex

1309
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:51,869
you guys I turn

1310
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:54,360
down edibles this time I did not eat any

1311
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:56,489
edibles if the secret sesh I shot it to

1312
01:05:54,360 --> 01:06:00,180
TNT extracts he gave me some 200

1313
01:05:56,489 --> 01:06:05,039
milligram bacon bacon wrapped in

1314
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:07,859
parchment paper okay but of course I

1315
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,389
gave that to her buddy buh buh buh buh

1316
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:10,800
buh blaster Co all the edibles I was

1317
01:06:09,389 --> 01:06:13,559
given that night I passed it right over

1318
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,550
to buh buh people people just walk by

1319
01:06:13,559 --> 01:06:15,809
you and hand you edibles they're like

1320
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,760
you need some edibles bro and I will

1321
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:18,809
take but then if I'm not an edible zone

1322
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,760
that night I just pass them on to

1323
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:23,449
friends Bobo got all of my excess

1324
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,560
edibles he was lit up that's pretty fun

1325
01:06:23,449 --> 01:06:27,899
I'm afraid you guys ate a bunch of

1326
01:06:25,559 --> 01:06:30,059
edibles at the last secret session I I

1327
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:32,039
don't even know a lot of edibles I had a

1328
01:06:30,059 --> 01:06:33,869
lot of THC in my body I'm gonna guess

1329
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:35,969
somewhere between 800 and 1500

1330
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:38,069
milligrams of THC in my body I was

1331
01:06:35,969 --> 01:06:40,349
challenged I was having a rough time and

1332
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:42,840
then our friends at teensy TNT extracts

1333
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:44,250
gave me a 1000 milligram edible and I

1334
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,500
ate it for breakfast the next day on my

1335
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:48,780
way to work by the time I got to work I

1336
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:50,699
it felt like I had wrapped a vise around

1337
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:52,950
my brain and I was trying to function on

1338
01:06:50,699 --> 01:06:54,509
half speed all day so I've been afraid

1339
01:06:52,949 --> 01:06:56,730
of edibles since then to tell you the

1340
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:58,350
truth and I haven't eaten any it's been

1341
01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:00,719
quite a while I don't know if I'll do it

1342
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:02,250
for a little while probably go see fish

1343
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:03,779
and eat a couple hundred milligrams at

1344
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:05,760
the fish that might be what has to

1345
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:07,560
happen all right you guys let's get to

1346
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:08,880
the point let's get to the point the

1347
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:10,170
point of this podcast I received an

1348
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,400
email from a friend let me open up this

1349
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:14,789
email I've got a save right here on the

1350
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:16,050
phone this dude signed his name as just

1351
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:18,360
a noob trying to learn and then he

1352
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:19,950
called himself ban so noob trying to

1353
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:21,510
learn this question was great you asked

1354
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:24,149
a lot of great [ __ ] and you really

1355
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:25,710
sparked a great podcast in my opinion so

1356
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:27,630
let me read the email the email goes

1357
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:28,889
like this greetings Jeff first off I

1358
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:30,510
want to say thank you for the kick-ass

1359
01:07:28,889 --> 01:07:32,730
podcast and then you have taught me so

1360
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:34,530
much in these weekly sessions they make

1361
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:36,360
my Monday morning commute tolerable

1362
01:07:34,530 --> 01:07:37,590
that's why I put them out Monday morning

1363
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:39,390
so your weekend doesn't hire you sue

1364
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:40,680
your week doesn't have to start with a

1365
01:07:39,389 --> 01:07:42,750
shitty Monday you start off with some

1366
01:07:40,679 --> 01:07:44,849
kick-ass podcast material I'm glad you

1367
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:47,070
noticed thanks for checking it out so he

1368
01:07:44,849 --> 01:07:48,659
goes on to say while I have yet to grow

1369
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:50,340
by because of where I live the topic

1370
01:07:48,659 --> 01:07:52,440
nonetheless consumes much of my thoughts

1371
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:54,120
and I try to learn everything I can

1372
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,829
much of the gain knowledge has led to

1373
01:07:54,119 --> 01:07:58,079
practices that have benefitted my

1374
01:07:55,829 --> 01:08:00,150
outdoor vegetable garden even still I

1375
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,529
have what may seem to be a stupid

1376
01:08:00,150 --> 01:08:03,660
question

1377
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:04,950
dude your question is not stupid I was

1378
01:08:03,659 --> 01:08:06,449
so excited when I read this I was like

1379
01:08:04,949 --> 01:08:08,519
oh I know a lot about this and I'm gonna

1380
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:10,049
get to ramble on for a long time so I'm

1381
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:12,000
gonna continue with email it says it

1382
01:08:10,050 --> 01:08:13,920
seems that many screens are named for a

1383
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,480
special phenotypically Express trait

1384
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,520
that manifests any particular smell

1385
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:19,079
flavor or color now if you're lucky

1386
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,819
enough to find one of those desirable

1387
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:22,798
phenotypes the strain is known for when

1388
01:08:20,819 --> 01:08:24,839
popping seeds it seems that you can

1389
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:27,689
enjoy that treat continually if you had

1390
01:08:24,838 --> 01:08:29,838
the foresight to take clones absolutely

1391
01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:33,179
correct that's why I encourage everybody

1392
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:34,739
every time you grow a seed every time it

1393
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:36,420
gets big enough to take a clone you take

1394
01:08:34,739 --> 01:08:37,889
a clone off of it before you flower it

1395
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,588
because you don't know if that seed is

1396
01:08:37,890 --> 01:08:42,750
going to bear the most amazing cannabis

1397
01:08:40,588 --> 01:08:44,100
you have ever smoked in your life and if

1398
01:08:42,750 --> 01:08:45,600
you don't have a clone of it you might

1399
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,829
try to kick yourself in the ass and

1400
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,079
you're gonna be kind of mad about it

1401
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:51,960
it's heartbreaking when you don't get a

1402
01:08:49,079 --> 01:08:54,930
cut of your of this super amazing herb I

1403
01:08:51,960 --> 01:08:56,130
grew some excuse me for the throat

1404
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:57,869
clearing of course that's a bunch of

1405
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:00,480
dabs sorry about that

1406
01:08:57,869 --> 01:09:03,720
I grew some Holy Grail cush from DNA

1407
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:05,699
genetics and it was honestly superb

1408
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:07,470
cannabis if you can get your hands on

1409
01:09:05,699 --> 01:09:08,548
some Holy Grail Kush seeds I recommend

1410
01:09:07,470 --> 01:09:09,990
that from that from another breeder

1411
01:09:08,548 --> 01:09:11,670
that's not even my brand get that from

1412
01:09:09,989 --> 01:09:14,460
DNA to genetics and maybe a reserve a

1413
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:15,838
privada project by now but a Holy Grail

1414
01:09:14,460 --> 01:09:18,449
cush get the real deal the old-school

1415
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:21,180
[ __ ] from DNA genetics it's amazing

1416
01:09:18,449 --> 01:09:23,849
cannabis I could not get the phenotype I

1417
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:25,619
selected would not make clones they

1418
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:27,630
would not root for [ __ ] I put them in

1419
01:09:25,619 --> 01:09:29,460
rock wool they'd shriveled up I put them

1420
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:31,739
in a corner they got funky and fell

1421
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:33,329
apart I could not get that [ __ ] to clone

1422
01:09:31,739 --> 01:09:36,210
I'll never get to taste that flavor

1423
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:37,619
again my friend pops is an old guy he

1424
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:39,989
says that was one of the top-five best

1425
01:09:37,619 --> 01:09:41,789
pots he's ever smoked that pops is all

1426
01:09:39,989 --> 01:09:43,439
dude hard to impress so the holy bro

1427
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:45,569
cush was some special [ __ ] I could not

1428
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:48,149
get it to root I wish I had a clone of

1429
01:09:45,569 --> 01:09:50,850
that it is gone one of my favorite

1430
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:52,829
strains ever was the p90 one and there

1431
01:09:50,850 --> 01:09:55,079
were some serious raids of large grow

1432
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:57,149
facilities in the p90 one rumor has it

1433
01:09:55,079 --> 01:09:59,369
was lost in that raid somebody claims to

1434
01:09:57,149 --> 01:10:02,339
have it but I really don't know if that

1435
01:09:59,369 --> 01:10:04,140
is what they got anybody can claim to

1436
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:05,550
have it so let's talk about something

1437
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:06,810
else you said in here it seems that the

1438
01:10:05,550 --> 01:10:08,789
screens are named for a special

1439
01:10:06,810 --> 01:10:10,170
phenotypically expressed trade yes

1440
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:11,430
that's why the Sour Diesel is called

1441
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:13,500
Sour Diesel because it smells like

1442
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:14,530
diesel feel I think they tried to name

1443
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,090
the Girl Scout cookies

1444
01:10:14,529 --> 01:10:17,469
because they wanted us to think that it

1445
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:18,970
tastes like Girl Scout cookies it's a

1446
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:20,770
little bit they called The Thin Man cut

1447
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:22,329
if you get the Thin Mint they taste the

1448
01:10:20,770 --> 01:10:25,540
Finn mint cookies and the Thin Mint cut

1449
01:10:22,329 --> 01:10:27,850
it could be close so that part is

1450
01:10:25,539 --> 01:10:30,010
totally accurate now here's where what I

1451
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:32,710
really uh what I really like to get into

1452
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:34,449
in this part of the email it says ah

1453
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:35,980
if the traits are passed from mother to

1454
01:10:34,449 --> 01:10:38,229
clone would it be likely that the same

1455
01:10:35,979 --> 01:10:40,119
traits would be present in nearly 100%

1456
01:10:38,229 --> 01:10:45,219
of the seeds if you were to make

1457
01:10:40,119 --> 01:10:47,739
feminized seeds from this plant

1458
01:10:45,220 --> 01:10:49,480
you would hope so because of logic but

1459
01:10:47,739 --> 01:10:50,529
that is not accurate and I took a bunch

1460
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:51,429
of notes and I'll get into that I'm

1461
01:10:50,529 --> 01:10:52,539
gonna have to take a break here in a

1462
01:10:51,430 --> 01:10:53,530
second take a drink but let me keep

1463
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:55,119
reading the email and then I'll take a

1464
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:56,259
drink take a quick break just cuz you

1465
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:59,170
guys don't wanna hear me clear my throat

1466
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:01,119
a thousand more times the email goes on

1467
01:10:59,170 --> 01:11:03,399
to say my logic may be way off on this

1468
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:05,710
as I am NOT a botanist or geneticist but

1469
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:07,479
if if it does play out like this then

1470
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,980
why don't the seed companies grow out

1471
01:11:07,479 --> 01:11:10,869
several plants to find that rare

1472
01:11:08,979 --> 01:11:13,659
phenotype and then make feminized seeds

1473
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:16,059
from that plant any knowledge you can

1474
01:11:13,659 --> 01:11:16,449
drop will be greatly appreciated thanks

1475
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:18,700
bro

1476
01:11:16,449 --> 01:11:20,619
from just a noob trying to learn then he

1477
01:11:18,699 --> 01:11:22,119
signs it been noob this is a great

1478
01:11:20,619 --> 01:11:23,199
question I'm gonna press pause for just

1479
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:25,300
a second here take a drink and then I'll

1480
01:11:23,199 --> 01:11:27,399
be right back all right you guys I'm

1481
01:11:25,300 --> 01:11:28,600
back took a big fresh drink I feel like

1482
01:11:27,399 --> 01:11:29,829
I'm better I'll be better for a minute

1483
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:31,539
I'm gonna take a DAB and [ __ ] it all up

1484
01:11:29,829 --> 01:11:33,369
again but I'm better for now alright

1485
01:11:31,539 --> 01:11:34,510
let's get back to this email the part

1486
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:36,069
that got my attention here at the end

1487
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:37,810
said if the traits are passed from

1488
01:11:36,069 --> 01:11:39,159
mother to clone would it be likely that

1489
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:43,420
the same traits would be present in

1490
01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:45,550
nearly 100% of the seeds no a clone

1491
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:47,710
you're taking a cutting from an existing

1492
01:11:45,550 --> 01:11:49,180
plant and that plant is making a root of

1493
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:50,529
course right and then you're getting a

1494
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:52,720
clone so all the traits are passed

1495
01:11:50,529 --> 01:11:55,869
because there is no opportunity for any

1496
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:59,289
other chromosomes or genetics or traits

1497
01:11:55,869 --> 01:12:01,750
to be introduced into that cut there's

1498
01:11:59,289 --> 01:12:03,699
nothing you're not gonna pull DNA out of

1499
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:05,890
the air to change the traits oh yes that

1500
01:12:03,699 --> 01:12:08,229
one will be exactly like the mother that

1501
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:09,820
it came from now when we're working with

1502
01:12:08,229 --> 01:12:12,909
seeds we have the opportunity for

1503
01:12:09,819 --> 01:12:15,369
variation because we're using pollen

1504
01:12:12,909 --> 01:12:17,289
that has chromosomes from the

1505
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:19,359
grandparents you're not only getting

1506
01:12:17,289 --> 01:12:21,579
parents not only getting chromosomes

1507
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,529
from that selected phenotype but you're

1508
01:12:21,579 --> 01:12:25,960
getting chromosomes from whatever that

1509
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:27,609
plant is a cross up so let me back up a

1510
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:29,409
little bit something that I want to

1511
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:31,479
mention we do search for those selected

1512
01:12:29,409 --> 01:12:34,569
phenotypes that you mentioned right now

1513
01:12:31,479 --> 01:12:36,299
I'm making a rise f2s which means I made

1514
01:12:34,569 --> 01:12:39,159
in a rise plant a rot and a rice grain

1515
01:12:36,300 --> 01:12:41,380
which I took Daybreaker as the male and

1516
01:12:39,159 --> 01:12:44,319
I put Daybreaker pollen on a golden goat

1517
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:46,960
female and I took those seeds and what

1518
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:49,449
came out of that I named that arise so I

1519
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,430
found a beautiful male I've got a studly

1520
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:54,159
male he produces the structure I want

1521
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:56,709
the aroma I want he makes resin this

1522
01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:58,779
male plant is a stud so I've got that

1523
01:12:56,708 --> 01:13:01,179
and then I've got I think right now I've

1524
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:03,118
got three or four gorgeous arise females

1525
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:05,349
that I need to pull it pick one of those

1526
01:13:03,118 --> 01:13:07,179
because I want to take that arise male

1527
01:13:05,349 --> 01:13:10,150
and I want to put that pollen on that

1528
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:11,828
arise female and make a rise F twos and

1529
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:14,049
I'm doing that by selecting the perfect

1530
01:13:11,828 --> 01:13:15,549
phenotype of the perfect male and the

1531
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:17,409
perfect female to bring out the traits

1532
01:13:15,550 --> 01:13:18,699
that I'm looking for now I could screw

1533
01:13:17,408 --> 01:13:20,170
that all up I could bring out a bunch of

1534
01:13:18,698 --> 01:13:21,488
recessive traits and it could be a total

1535
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:22,719
disaster and I'll have to go back and

1536
01:13:21,488 --> 01:13:24,998
find a different male and female and do

1537
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,948
it all over again but that's why I grow

1538
01:13:24,998 --> 01:13:28,569
out a bunch of them myself before I try

1539
01:13:26,948 --> 01:13:30,638
to sell them or give them away to

1540
01:13:28,569 --> 01:13:32,049
anybody I make sure to cry probably a

1541
01:13:30,639 --> 01:13:34,989
hundred of those by myself before

1542
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:36,670
anybody else will even see them so we do

1543
01:13:34,988 --> 01:13:39,368
look for those phenotypes we find those

1544
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:41,529
perfect phenotypes and sometimes a cross

1545
01:13:39,368 --> 01:13:43,149
will be made it wasn't intended to smell

1546
01:13:41,529 --> 01:13:44,618
like something I don't think the tangi I

1547
01:13:43,149 --> 01:13:45,518
don't think that the guy that made tangi

1548
01:13:44,618 --> 01:13:47,109
I think that was Crockett

1549
01:13:45,519 --> 01:13:48,820
I don't think Crockett was like I want

1550
01:13:47,109 --> 01:13:52,359
to make tangi I think tangi should be

1551
01:13:48,819 --> 01:13:55,208
Caleo and this whatever the hell used I

1552
01:13:52,359 --> 01:13:56,558
forgot but this orange plant uh I don't

1553
01:13:55,208 --> 01:13:57,880
think he was like I want to make tangi I

1554
01:13:56,559 --> 01:13:59,229
think he crossed some [ __ ] and they came

1555
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,849
out and tastes like tangerines and he's

1556
01:13:59,229 --> 01:14:02,469
like that's a tan gee I think that's how

1557
01:14:00,849 --> 01:14:03,519
that came I don't think Sour Diesel I

1558
01:14:02,469 --> 01:14:04,958
don't think anybody was like I want to

1559
01:14:03,519 --> 01:14:06,699
make a strain that tastes like diesel

1560
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:08,859
feel I think it was actually named

1561
01:14:06,698 --> 01:14:10,538
because of that so they selected that

1562
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:13,988
one now let's talk about something else

1563
01:14:10,538 --> 01:14:16,748
you said why don't we use those selected

1564
01:14:13,988 --> 01:14:18,609
phenotypes we do and then if I'm gonna

1565
01:14:16,748 --> 01:14:21,368
make feminized seeds from that selected

1566
01:14:18,609 --> 01:14:23,049
phenotype I'm going to treat so I'm

1567
01:14:21,368 --> 01:14:24,639
gonna take two clones of the same plant

1568
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:26,199
the selected phenotype that has the

1569
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,449
traits that we like the one that so

1570
01:14:26,198 --> 01:14:30,368
we'll say grateful dog I've made

1571
01:14:28,448 --> 01:14:31,719
feminized seeds of grateful dog I've

1572
01:14:30,368 --> 01:14:33,969
grown a bunch of my own grateful dog

1573
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:36,458
seeds I found the one that is stellar so

1574
01:14:33,969 --> 01:14:38,590
I take two clones of that I reverse one

1575
01:14:36,458 --> 01:14:40,688
and I put that reversed pollen onto the

1576
01:14:38,590 --> 01:14:44,590
female grateful dog and now I make

1577
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:47,769
grateful dog seeds now sometimes those

1578
01:14:44,590 --> 01:14:49,869
grateful dog seeds look like chem dog

1579
01:14:47,769 --> 01:14:51,670
and sometimes those grateful dog seeds

1580
01:14:49,868 --> 01:14:54,938
look a little bit more like San Fernando

1581
01:14:51,670 --> 01:14:57,010
Valley OG Kush but a lot of them look

1582
01:14:54,939 --> 01:14:59,409
very much like the grateful dog clone

1583
01:14:57,010 --> 01:15:01,090
that I reversed and started with and

1584
01:14:59,408 --> 01:15:02,738
then we'll get a little a little bit of

1585
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:04,538
variation that's a little closer to the

1586
01:15:02,738 --> 01:15:06,129
chem but more OG and then a little more

1587
01:15:04,538 --> 01:15:07,958
OG but closer to the cam and then you'll

1588
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:09,279
see blends of the traits it's kind of

1589
01:15:07,958 --> 01:15:10,389
like making kids you know like your

1590
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:11,618
sister might look a little

1591
01:15:10,389 --> 01:15:13,659
from you but you could definitely tell

1592
01:15:11,618 --> 01:15:15,458
you're from the same gene pool it's just

1593
01:15:13,658 --> 01:15:16,868
gonna vary a little bit more from so

1594
01:15:15,458 --> 01:15:17,979
you're gonna see traits of grandmas what

1595
01:15:16,868 --> 01:15:20,438
I'm saying you're gonna see traits of

1596
01:15:17,979 --> 01:15:22,208
grandpa's what I'm saying and sometimes

1597
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:24,010
you might see great grandparent traits

1598
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:25,479
so let me refer back to my notes here to

1599
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:27,719
keep myself on topic because I'm getting

1600
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:30,010
way way off of what I'm trying to say so

1601
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:31,868
we do search for those phenotypes and

1602
01:15:30,010 --> 01:15:35,349
that's how we make our f 2s and then we

1603
01:15:31,868 --> 01:15:37,958
do reverse those to make our feminized

1604
01:15:35,349 --> 01:15:41,800
seeds I breed with my second and third

1605
01:15:37,958 --> 01:15:43,208
generations from those select I make my

1606
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:44,409
second and third generations from those

1607
01:15:43,208 --> 01:15:46,029
selected plants and I was talking about

1608
01:15:44,408 --> 01:15:47,469
picking one female and one female

1609
01:15:46,029 --> 01:15:50,078
something else or one male and one

1610
01:15:47,469 --> 01:15:52,569
female something else I also do I will

1611
01:15:50,078 --> 01:15:55,509
take multiple females of the same strain

1612
01:15:52,569 --> 01:15:57,158
and one male of that strain and hit

1613
01:15:55,510 --> 01:15:59,800
three or four different females with

1614
01:15:57,158 --> 01:16:01,779
that male pollen and that way I've got I

1615
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,760
can see the variation I can see that

1616
01:16:01,779 --> 01:16:05,618
this girl produces more resinous

1617
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,599
offspring I can see that this girl

1618
01:16:05,618 --> 01:16:08,799
produces tall and lanky offspring so I

1619
01:16:07,599 --> 01:16:10,029
don't want to breed to that one again

1620
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,439
let's go ahead and get rid of that I can

1621
01:16:10,029 --> 01:16:13,779
see that this one over here produces

1622
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:15,249
really lanky plants that stink really

1623
01:16:13,779 --> 01:16:16,538
well but don't make a lot of resin so

1624
01:16:15,248 --> 01:16:19,029
maybe I don't want to breed to that one

1625
01:16:16,538 --> 01:16:21,219
so I'll go and hit multiple females so

1626
01:16:19,029 --> 01:16:24,238
that way I can find the best breeding

1627
01:16:21,219 --> 01:16:26,800
plant so that I can use so I'll also hit

1628
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,718
different females of different strains

1629
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,998
in that room with that male so I'll put

1630
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,559
four females so when I do this will rise

1631
01:16:30,998 --> 01:16:35,109
f2 it's about to happen pretty soon I'll

1632
01:16:32,559 --> 01:16:36,399
probably put two maybe three females of

1633
01:16:35,109 --> 01:16:38,529
a rise in there to be honest and then

1634
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:40,209
I'm gonna probably put seven or eight

1635
01:16:38,529 --> 01:16:41,529
maybe nine or ten females of other

1636
01:16:40,208 --> 01:16:43,029
strains in there that'll be a grateful

1637
01:16:41,529 --> 01:16:44,198
dog in there I'm gonna put a golden goat

1638
01:16:43,029 --> 01:16:46,359
in there to take it backwards a little

1639
01:16:44,198 --> 01:16:47,469
bit I've got some other stuff that's

1640
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:49,719
gonna go in there I've got some crosses

1641
01:16:47,469 --> 01:16:51,340
I made that'll go in there then I'm

1642
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:54,099
gonna hit all of those with pollen and

1643
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:55,449
then we'll see what comes of all of that

1644
01:16:54,099 --> 01:16:56,918
progeny there'll be a whole bunch of

1645
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:59,168
great stuff in it all right let's get

1646
01:16:56,918 --> 01:17:01,148
myself back on track he said my logic

1647
01:16:59,168 --> 01:17:03,130
may be way off on this but I'm not a

1648
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,630
botanist or geneticist which I like they

1649
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:06,130
said but if it does play like this then

1650
01:17:04,630 --> 01:17:07,479
why don't the seed companies grow out

1651
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:08,979
several plants to find the rare

1652
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:11,619
phenotypes and then make feminized seeds

1653
01:17:08,979 --> 01:17:14,050
from that plant well that's kind of

1654
01:17:11,618 --> 01:17:15,759
exactly what they slash we do my friend

1655
01:17:14,050 --> 01:17:17,409
I hope I explained that in a way that

1656
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:18,639
makes a lot of sense to you one thing I

1657
01:17:17,408 --> 01:17:20,319
want to go back over is the word

1658
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:23,690
phenotype I hear a lot of people say

1659
01:17:20,319 --> 01:17:26,359
phenome it's a Fino Phe and

1660
01:17:23,689 --> 01:17:29,299
fino phenotype a phenotypic expression

1661
01:17:26,359 --> 01:17:32,599
Fino not phenome just just to make you

1662
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:33,949
something cooler in your circle so when

1663
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:35,780
you're making seeds and those seeds do

1664
01:17:33,948 --> 01:17:37,579
come out of course variation is natural

1665
01:17:35,779 --> 01:17:39,439
that's something that we expect we can't

1666
01:17:37,579 --> 01:17:41,210
control it completely if you want to

1667
01:17:39,439 --> 01:17:42,919
make something that I did that I didn't

1668
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:44,210
even realize I was kind of I was doing

1669
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:45,770
something out of the norm I made

1670
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:49,340
feminized seeds and then I found my

1671
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:51,110
favorite my favorite phenotype out of

1672
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:53,719
that batch of feminized seeds and then I

1673
01:17:51,109 --> 01:17:55,460
hit that feminized plant with the

1674
01:17:53,719 --> 01:17:57,739
original pollen that I made feminized

1675
01:17:55,460 --> 01:18:00,560
seeds from and the progeny from that was

1676
01:17:57,738 --> 01:18:02,419
super stable I did it again and then I

1677
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:04,130
tried to reverse one of those plants and

1678
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,449
I could not get it to reverse I could

1679
01:18:04,130 --> 01:18:07,609
not make the plant herm

1680
01:18:05,448 --> 01:18:09,409
I could not change the sex of that plant

1681
01:18:07,609 --> 01:18:12,019
to make more feminized seeds with that

1682
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:13,760
generation of that progeny and I was

1683
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,469
super impressed with the stability of

1684
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:18,710
that plan that plan is still around it's

1685
01:18:15,469 --> 01:18:20,510
been named Gd 77 a lot of people ask me

1686
01:18:18,710 --> 01:18:23,680
about my naming schemes they're very

1687
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:26,329
random grateful dog was Gd

1688
01:18:23,680 --> 01:18:29,030
1977 is one of my favorite years of the

1689
01:18:26,329 --> 01:18:32,510
Grateful Dead so GD 77 it's the Grateful

1690
01:18:29,029 --> 01:18:34,159
Dead 77 female I love it it's in the

1691
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:35,539
mother room right now that's one of my

1692
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:37,639
favorite keepers I've probably had that

1693
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:39,050
one for I don't even know how long I

1694
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:41,180
really can't remember I've had it for a

1695
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:42,890
super long time long time eight years

1696
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:45,170
I'll say eight years I've had that clone

1697
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:46,369
alright let's get back on track here I

1698
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:47,750
like the variation that's what I'm

1699
01:18:46,369 --> 01:18:49,309
saying variation is cool when you're

1700
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:50,869
making seeds I like variation I don't

1701
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:52,510
want every seed to grow out just like

1702
01:18:50,869 --> 01:18:54,619
the picture on the package because

1703
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:55,969
everyone's got that one I want a little

1704
01:18:54,619 --> 01:18:57,198
bit of variation that means that the

1705
01:18:55,969 --> 01:18:58,789
grower down the street that bought those

1706
01:18:57,198 --> 01:19:00,889
seeds doesn't have the phenotype that

1707
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:02,539
I've got and it means that there might

1708
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:04,070
be something better in there that means

1709
01:19:02,539 --> 01:19:05,149
you can always keep growing more seeds

1710
01:19:04,069 --> 01:19:06,738
that's why I always that's why I love

1711
01:19:05,149 --> 01:19:07,809
see you might find something better than

1712
01:19:06,738 --> 01:19:10,069
what you've already got

1713
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:11,239
sometimes if somebody loses a plant or

1714
01:19:10,069 --> 01:19:12,799
if something doesn't root when you try

1715
01:19:11,238 --> 01:19:14,389
to clone it I always look at the bright

1716
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:16,130
side that means I get to grow more seeds

1717
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:17,840
because see the way to go

1718
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:19,400
seeds have vigor you can find new [ __ ]

1719
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,930
in there every every strain that you're

1720
01:19:19,399 --> 01:19:23,549
smoking every clone that you've ever

1721
01:19:20,930 --> 01:19:26,909
grown that came from a seed

1722
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:28,320
right and had to so uh the variation of

1723
01:19:26,909 --> 01:19:31,170
course you could stabilize that just by

1724
01:19:28,319 --> 01:19:32,460
by breeding make f2s make f3s by the

1725
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:34,529
time you get to have five those seeds

1726
01:19:32,460 --> 01:19:36,840
will be super stable you'll start making

1727
01:19:34,529 --> 01:19:40,019
seeds that produce almost clones once

1728
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:41,640
you get to the f6 generation probably

1729
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:43,230
90% of the seeds that you plant are

1730
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:44,640
going to look just like the picture on

1731
01:19:43,229 --> 01:19:46,349
the package if the breeder did it

1732
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,369
properly alright guys I'm gonna take a

1733
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:48,750
DAB in a drink I'm gonna get another

1734
01:19:47,369 --> 01:19:50,099
email to you before I do that I want to

1735
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,869
give a big shout out to our buddy the

1736
01:19:50,100 --> 01:19:53,010
noob that sent us this email I really

1737
01:19:51,869 --> 01:19:54,359
appreciate it I like talking about

1738
01:19:53,010 --> 01:19:55,590
feminized seeds I like talking about

1739
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:57,779
making seeds I like talking about

1740
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:59,400
breeding that's my favorite [ __ ] so if

1741
01:19:57,779 --> 01:20:00,659
you have more questions about that send

1742
01:19:59,399 --> 01:20:03,809
them to me gross my heart at hotmail.com

1743
01:20:00,659 --> 01:20:05,399
I will read your emails on a future

1744
01:20:03,810 --> 01:20:08,010
episode guys I need a drink and a DAB

1745
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:10,759
bear with me play some reggae music Andy

1746
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,760
and hang out for a second

1747
01:20:11,550 --> 01:21:10,699
[Music]

1748
01:21:07,090 --> 01:21:12,050
all right my back took a drink did not

1749
01:21:10,698 --> 01:21:14,210
take some dabs this time I think I have

1750
01:21:12,050 --> 01:21:15,889
a voice I think my throat is gonna hold

1751
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:17,210
up for at least a couple more emails

1752
01:21:15,889 --> 01:21:20,000
alright let's get to another email

1753
01:21:17,210 --> 01:21:21,469
this one says Rasta Jay recently

1754
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,539
discovered my latest batch of girls are

1755
01:21:21,469 --> 01:21:26,179
not as innocent as I would like yes they

1756
01:21:23,539 --> 01:21:27,948
are flat ass full of seeds my question

1757
01:21:26,179 --> 01:21:29,989
for you is if there are any dead

1758
01:21:27,948 --> 01:21:32,448
giveaways to determine if they were

1759
01:21:29,988 --> 01:21:34,549
pollinated or simply harmed I did have a

1760
01:21:32,448 --> 01:21:36,888
sneaky male get by me until about week

1761
01:21:34,550 --> 01:21:38,600
three I had him labeled wrong and stuck

1762
01:21:36,889 --> 01:21:41,090
him in the flower room I'm hoping this

1763
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:43,130
is the case and not a her issue then he

1764
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:46,310
continues to give me reasons why his

1765
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:47,900
plants may have harmed and Duty out of

1766
01:21:46,310 --> 01:21:50,210
male he [ __ ] up you got a boy in there

1767
01:21:47,899 --> 01:21:52,158
that male at three weeks he Buster did

1768
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:54,170
not be pollinated you girls do you know

1769
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,638
what that male was that's my question

1770
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:57,500
now if you know what that male plant was

1771
01:21:55,639 --> 01:21:57,920
you may have accidentally just bred some

1772
01:21:57,500 --> 01:21:59,539
[ __ ]

1773
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:00,889
keep those seeds grow them out see what

1774
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:02,359
you got yeah I'm pretty sure that that

1775
01:22:00,889 --> 01:22:04,520
mail drop Paulette it only takes about

1776
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:06,198
14 days for some of those stud layer

1777
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:07,610
males to just start blowing pollen

1778
01:22:06,198 --> 01:22:09,829
everywhere so if you had them in there

1779
01:22:07,609 --> 01:22:11,779
until about week three I'm pretty sure

1780
01:22:09,829 --> 01:22:13,789
that's who hit those girls with fallen

1781
01:22:11,779 --> 01:22:15,829
from the list of things you mentioned

1782
01:22:13,789 --> 01:22:19,010
that may be reasons why those plants

1783
01:22:15,829 --> 01:22:21,350
earned it does not look like Lee to me

1784
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:23,420
the recent switch of lighting that would

1785
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:24,710
not do it the site Fox healing emission

1786
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:27,230
that's because they got too hot I don't

1787
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:28,050
think that made them firm so you had a

1788
01:22:27,229 --> 01:22:29,629
dude in there

1789
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:32,090
[Music]

1790
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:32,840
if you were growing from seed or if you

1791
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:34,850
have a male plant

1792
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:36,529
I have males in my stable I got a couple

1793
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:38,150
of big fat male arise plants in there

1794
01:22:36,529 --> 01:22:40,189
got Solomon just chilling he's kicking

1795
01:22:38,149 --> 01:22:41,599
it like three feet tall but if you're

1796
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:43,638
going from Seaton you got boy plants

1797
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,650
those boy plants will drop pollen I've

1798
01:22:43,639 --> 01:22:47,900
actually got a strawberry tangi banana

1799
01:22:45,649 --> 01:22:49,219
male plant in a very small pot it's

1800
01:22:47,899 --> 01:22:52,279
getting root bound and I can see male

1801
01:22:49,219 --> 01:22:53,869
flower clusters forming on the top if I

1802
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:55,880
don't get that out of there in the next

1803
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:57,079
10 days he will drop all that pollen

1804
01:22:55,880 --> 01:22:58,190
will come from there so if you're if

1805
01:22:57,079 --> 01:22:59,869
you're growing from seed keep an eye on

1806
01:22:58,189 --> 01:23:01,428
those pollen sacks and if you don't want

1807
01:22:59,869 --> 01:23:02,658
seeded plants if you don't want pollen

1808
01:23:01,429 --> 01:23:04,579
don't be lazy

1809
01:23:02,658 --> 01:23:06,079
get those males out of there let's do

1810
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:07,670

01:34:43,720 --> 01:34:52,480
couple of people yeah it was super fun

2056
01:34:46,510 --> 01:34:56,560
but yeah she's just because everybody

2057
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:58,869
wants to follow a dabbing granny so yeah

2058
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:01,000
granny also she listens to the podcast

2059
01:34:58,869 --> 01:35:02,559
when you told me that she listens to the

2060
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,829
podcast who put the biggest smile on my

2061
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,880
face

2062
01:35:02,829 --> 01:35:08,859
so actually you have Brett to thank for

2063
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:13,960
that and well I mean like I was just

2064
01:35:08,859 --> 01:35:16,059
sitting there we were Brett and I were

2065
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:19,180
talking about the podcast at canna

2066
01:35:16,060 --> 01:35:22,810
Canyon that day and granny was like what

2067
01:35:19,180 --> 01:35:27,400
podcast is this and Brett said give me

2068
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:30,070
your phone subscribe to the podcast he

2069
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:31,569
goes here you go and so and so she turns

2070
01:35:30,069 --> 01:35:33,849
to me and she said you're on this and I

2071
01:35:31,569 --> 01:35:40,359
said I said I'm very fortunate Jeff has

2072
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:42,520
me on the podcast way more than she

2073
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:44,259
started listening to them and so like I

2074
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:45,970
guess one of the first couple of ones

2075
01:35:44,260 --> 01:35:47,320
which I don't know what the first couple

2076
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:49,570
ones she listens to actually work but

2077
01:35:47,319 --> 01:35:55,179
she listened to the dispensary talk one

2078
01:35:49,569 --> 01:35:56,529
yeah and she was like oh was it me that

2079
01:35:55,180 --> 01:36:01,659
you were talking about flirting with you

2080
01:35:56,529 --> 01:36:02,739
in the dispensary a lot of people might

2081
01:36:01,659 --> 01:36:04,630
know who we're talking about you guys

2082
01:36:02,739 --> 01:36:07,779
check out the dab in granny on Instagram

2083
01:36:04,630 --> 01:36:11,020
she's on Facebook when I discovered her

2084
01:36:07,779 --> 01:36:13,599
she took a giant dab like a big dab you

2085
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:15,640
guys she did like a hundred of my dabs

2086
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:20,470
one of the first time I saw the video I

2087
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:21,880
felt so bad she's a little young to be

2088
01:36:20,470 --> 01:36:23,500
my granny but she could be Lindsey's

2089
01:36:21,880 --> 01:36:25,090
granny she could definitely be your

2090
01:36:23,500 --> 01:36:29,319
granny so she's a granny she's for sure

2091
01:36:25,090 --> 01:36:31,090
we're not being derogatory handle is

2092
01:36:29,319 --> 01:36:49,119
dabbing underscore granny I don't think

2093
01:36:31,090 --> 01:36:51,730
it's the dab off of a rig and then she

2094
01:36:49,119 --> 01:36:53,890
jugs a beer like a whole pint glass and

2095
01:36:51,729 --> 01:36:56,049
then she takes a shot and then she blows

2096
01:36:53,890 --> 01:36:57,910
out her dad and takes another dab from

2097
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:59,529
the nectar collector and smiles into the

2098
01:36:57,909 --> 01:37:03,550
camera like that's how you do it [ __ ]

2099
01:36:59,529 --> 01:37:05,529
and then ends the video so that's

2100
01:37:03,550 --> 01:37:07,420
actually like one of her staple things

2101
01:37:05,529 --> 01:37:10,630
she kind of like changes it around a

2102
01:37:07,420 --> 01:37:12,460
little bit but like I'm pretty sure she

2103
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:14,350
did that on Facebook live today or some

2104
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:17,109
version of that you know like a dab of

2105
01:37:14,350 --> 01:37:18,789
beer and then like a shot and then

2106
01:37:17,109 --> 01:37:21,699
something you know didn't mean like a

2107
01:37:18,789 --> 01:37:23,319
bong rapers I don't know but yeah so I

2108
01:37:21,699 --> 01:37:24,880
think she does some sort of variation

2109
01:37:23,319 --> 01:37:28,479
and that's her like I think she calls it

2110
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:31,270
her party trick okay I could be wrong I

2111
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:33,309
really could but yeah that's I think

2112
01:37:31,270 --> 01:37:35,360
that's where she really her version of a

2113
01:37:33,310 --> 01:37:39,340
sprite

2114
01:37:35,359 --> 01:37:42,049
[Music]

2115
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:43,880
they caught my eye because it was

2116
01:37:42,050 --> 01:37:47,119
someone who could be my grandmother with

2117
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:49,819
the dab lined up that was like I mean it

2118
01:37:47,119 --> 01:37:53,840
was YouTube dab worthy size it was

2119
01:37:49,819 --> 01:37:56,989
massive my pink try to take maybe half a

2120
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:58,730
gram three-quarters of a gram and then

2121
01:37:56,989 --> 01:38:01,550
she takes this dab like a champ and as

2122
01:37:58,729 --> 01:38:03,769
I'm sitting there like wow she like

2123
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:06,890
throws down a pint and then does a bong

2124
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:09,620
rip and then exhales the bong rip and

2125
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:14,329
the dab and I'm looking at this video in

2126
01:38:09,619 --> 01:38:16,519

2170
01:39:56,619 --> 01:40:00,849
new stupid Instagram feature I'll just

2171
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:02,349
give it a second there's a new feature

2172
01:40:00,850 --> 01:40:15,579
on Instagram I don't know if I care not

2173
01:40:02,350 --> 01:40:17,320
I don't know if I like it just feels

2174
01:40:15,579 --> 01:40:19,210
like it never ends there's just so many

2175
01:40:17,319 --> 01:40:20,769
pictures that scroll by I'm like honey

2176
01:40:19,210 --> 01:40:23,409
the Karen I forgot I forgot that I don't

2177
01:40:20,770 --> 01:40:26,140
care that's right I think what you have

2178
01:40:23,409 --> 01:40:30,609
to remember is that Instagram was

2179
01:40:26,140 --> 01:40:33,850
originally just pictures look at how far

2180
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:37,000
Instagram has actually evolved and what

2181
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:43,650
it actually started from can you really

2182
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:46,899
hate them for doing a live feature I

2183
01:40:43,649 --> 01:40:49,269
don't know I don't really like I have

2184
01:40:46,899 --> 01:40:51,670
pros and cons about it so I just don't

2185
01:40:49,270 --> 01:40:53,140
really I just feel like they're trying

2186
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,970
to suck up too much of my attention now

2187
01:40:53,140 --> 01:40:56,680
I can scroll up and down and left and

2188
01:40:54,970 --> 01:40:59,320
right and it just [ __ ] me all up

2189
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:01,900
there's no and there's no end to it now

2190
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:03,909
because there's that's enough I have to

2191
01:41:01,899 --> 01:41:05,439
stop alright since we're talking about

2192
01:41:03,909 --> 01:41:08,050
social media this is a good segue

2193
01:41:05,439 --> 01:41:09,969
Twitter people I've got three names of

2194
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:11,980
folks that I have got envelopes with

2195
01:41:09,970 --> 01:41:13,810
your name written on it there's a stamp

2196
01:41:11,979 --> 01:41:15,069
on there there's a return address label

2197
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:17,230
on there that someone claimed it was

2198
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:18,579
mediocre but I think it's just fine it's

2199
01:41:17,229 --> 01:41:20,079
gonna work just fine there's a return

2200
01:41:18,579 --> 01:41:21,399
address label on there that gets lost it

2201
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:24,279

got some stickers coming in the mail bro

2239
01:42:35,139 --> 01:42:39,489
my painted chef friend also that segues

2240
01:42:38,078 --> 01:42:41,618
right into the next part how you guys

2241
01:42:39,488 --> 01:42:43,359
like that double segue we're doing a

2242
01:42:41,618 --> 01:42:44,558
Grateful Dead style one right into the

2243
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:47,639
other we're not gonna stop keep on

2244
01:42:44,559 --> 01:42:50,199
jamming Sammy asked about easy cloners

2245
01:42:47,639 --> 01:42:51,609
his basic question was do you recommend

2246
01:42:50,198 --> 01:42:55,268
an easy clone or do you like an easy

2247
01:42:51,609 --> 01:42:56,649
cloner yes I love an easy cloner what I

2248
01:42:55,269 --> 01:43:00,369
really like about an easy cloners you

2249
01:42:56,649 --> 01:43:02,348
can cut large clones if you take big

2250
01:43:00,368 --> 01:43:04,118
clones they'll route quickly and those

2251
01:43:02,349 --> 01:43:05,590
big clones I think they take off much

2252
01:43:04,118 --> 01:43:07,630
more quickly than clones and rockwool

2253
01:43:05,590 --> 01:43:08,918
cubes Mike remembers my old school days

2254
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:09,340
of trying to cut Collins and rock wool

2255
01:43:08,918 --> 01:43:12,908
cubes

2256
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:14,590
I took so many clones and put them in a

2257
01:43:12,908 --> 01:43:15,998
rock wool cubes I did that for a lot of

2258
01:43:14,590 --> 01:43:18,159
years with a lot of different Brewers

2259
01:43:15,998 --> 01:43:20,559
Mike used to grow hand for everybody

2260
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:23,948
around here and honestly the easy clone

2261
01:43:20,559 --> 01:43:27,519
is a huge step up it's in my mind if

2262
01:43:23,948 --> 01:43:30,009
you're growing in cloning regularly it's

2263
01:43:27,519 --> 01:43:31,479
worth the investment I just make sure

2264
01:43:30,010 --> 01:43:33,369
you get a good would you remember your

2265
01:43:31,479 --> 01:43:34,929
first easy cloning bro yeah let's not

2266
01:43:33,368 --> 01:43:36,728
talk too much about that no but two

2267
01:43:34,929 --> 01:43:39,099
seconds after you would plugged it in

2268
01:43:36,729 --> 01:43:41,019
your advice would have been don't buy on

2269
01:43:39,099 --> 01:43:43,538
that crap yeah those old ones sucked the

2270
01:43:41,019 --> 01:43:45,789
new models are awesome yeah they worked

2271
01:43:43,538 --> 01:43:48,429
out all the kinks it doesn't explode and

2272
01:43:45,788 --> 01:43:50,319
turn your grow room into a waterpark

2273
01:43:48,429 --> 01:43:53,019
anymore that's the best description

2274
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:54,788
there are new models the new ez cloners

2275
01:43:53,019 --> 01:43:56,739
the low what are they con the low rise

2276
01:43:54,788 --> 01:43:58,868
the low-profile models they're white now

2277
01:43:56,738 --> 01:44:00,998
I really dig them they require less

2278
01:43:58,868 --> 01:44:03,339
water which is really helpful because

2279
01:44:00,998 --> 01:44:05,408
that also means less nutrients I'm only

2280
01:44:03,340 --> 01:44:06,668
familiar with the big black beast but it

2281
01:44:05,408 --> 01:44:09,098
gets the double thumb it's the same

2282
01:44:06,668 --> 01:44:10,748
thing but just a new design they used to

2283
01:44:09,099 --> 01:44:12,310
delete remember how the old black ones

2284
01:44:10,748 --> 01:44:14,868
used to spray out of the side

2285
01:44:12,310 --> 01:44:16,610
they don't leak or drip anymore the new

2286
01:44:14,868 --> 01:44:18,649
design is way better they're easier to

2287
01:44:16,609 --> 01:44:20,509
clean I really like the new easy cleaner

2288
01:44:18,649 --> 01:44:22,129
so Sam uses if you're looking to up your

2289
01:44:20,510 --> 01:44:24,230
clone game get yourself an easy cloner

2290
01:44:22,130 --> 01:44:25,550
it is super easy to use that thing you

2291
01:44:24,229 --> 01:44:27,289
need a healthy mother poke a get your

2292
01:44:25,550 --> 01:44:29,389
cloner set up by that I mean get the

2293
01:44:27,289 --> 01:44:30,948
cloner [ __ ] bill if the neoprene is

2294
01:44:29,389 --> 01:44:32,449
in there get the little manifold and

2295
01:44:30,948 --> 01:44:34,428
there get its brand get it run and fill

2296
01:44:32,448 --> 01:44:36,888
it up with water just below those red

2297
01:44:34,429 --> 01:44:38,810
sprayers remember how much water you put

2298
01:44:36,889 --> 01:44:40,099
in it figure that out put nutrients in

2299
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:42,619
there I would use a little bit of bloom

2300
01:44:40,099 --> 01:44:45,289
like your base blue nutrient a little

2301
01:44:42,618 --> 01:44:47,868
bit of micro and just dip them in some I

2302
01:44:45,289 --> 01:44:49,158
like to use the the EZ clone or gel

2303
01:44:47,868 --> 01:44:50,479
though with that what's that one called

2304
01:44:49,158 --> 01:44:52,039
should I can't think of the name clone

2305
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:54,500
ex it's a purple clone ex gel like to

2306
01:44:52,039 --> 01:44:56,118
use that [ __ ] dip it in there put it in

2307
01:44:54,500 --> 01:44:57,710
a little neoprene collar cut it to where

2308
01:44:56,118 --> 01:44:59,658
there's like two or three nodes

2309
01:44:57,710 --> 01:45:01,730
underneath that collar put that [ __ ] in

2310
01:44:59,658 --> 01:45:03,649
the cloner put the cloner on for 45

2311
01:45:01,729 --> 01:45:04,968
minutes on 15 minutes off because that

2312
01:45:03,649 --> 01:45:07,908
water will heat up because of that pump

2313
01:45:04,969 --> 01:45:09,649
I put a t5 light about you know foot

2314
01:45:07,908 --> 01:45:12,079
above that and just let the t5 light run

2315
01:45:09,649 --> 01:45:13,698
24 hours a day and no [ __ ] in like 7 or

2316
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:14,899
8 days you'll start seeing little warts

2317
01:45:13,698 --> 01:45:16,698
pop out of the plant that's where the

2318
01:45:14,899 --> 01:45:18,888
roots are gonna grow like 10 to 14 days

2319
01:45:16,698 --> 01:45:20,689
you'll have savage roots in 17 to 21

2320
01:45:18,889 --> 01:45:22,159
days those roots are gonna be so big

2321
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:26,238
you'll have to go to a 3 gallon pot and

2322
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:27,859
skip a cup a huge step up in technology

2323
01:45:26,238 --> 01:45:30,049
from the old school clone domes huge

2324
01:45:27,859 --> 01:45:31,519
step up so I highly highly recommend we

2325
01:45:30,050 --> 01:45:34,340
use those at the grow I run a big

2326
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,989
commercial grow and I've got 1 2 3 there

2327
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:38,449
are 6 easy cleaners filled with clones

2328
01:45:35,988 --> 01:45:40,399
right now yet to grow that's how we keep

2329
01:45:38,448 --> 01:45:41,868
it thank you go on like this about the

2330
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:43,549

yes right in the next topic on the last

2347
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:32,029
episode we talked a lot about dabbing

2348
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:33,710
and stuff and I want to talk about email

2349
01:46:32,029 --> 01:46:36,019
temperature and getting your email set

2350
01:46:33,710 --> 01:46:38,600
to the temperature that is perfect for

2351
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:40,760
you because I like my email a little bit

2352
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:43,210

was just a beautiful thing to watch it

2360
01:46:56,840 --> 01:47:00,199
was pretty funny it was pretty funny but

2361
01:46:58,609 --> 01:47:01,849
I just let Spence do his thing he's a

2362
01:47:00,199 --> 01:47:02,960
hash maker and he would bring over slabs

2363
01:47:01,850 --> 01:47:04,130
and dab me out with them and you could

2364
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:05,420
bake it whatever temp you want if you're

2365
01:47:04,130 --> 01:47:08,000
gonna drop that much hash on there do

2366
01:47:05,420 --> 01:47:09,350
your thing player but uh most people

2367
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,970
keep their emails a little lower than I

2368
01:47:09,350 --> 01:47:12,860
do I like mine a little hot somebody's

2369
01:47:10,970 --> 01:47:14,930
asking me how do I get my email to the

2370
01:47:12,859 --> 01:47:17,449
perfect temperature the temperature is

2371
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:19,100
all kind of subjective it's all about do

2372
01:47:17,449 --> 01:47:21,949
you want it hot and her tea do you want

2373
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:24,110
it low tip all taste some of the new

2374
01:47:21,949 --> 01:47:25,099
trend is to heat a nail and this is not

2375
01:47:24,109 --> 01:47:26,719
that you know this is if you're using

2376
01:47:25,100 --> 01:47:29,660
like a banger the new trend is to heat

2377
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:32,119
the nail let it get way too hot and then

2378
01:47:29,659 --> 01:47:33,800
let it cool way down and then put your

2379
01:47:32,119 --> 01:47:35,899
dab on there and waste half the [ __ ]

2380
01:47:33,800 --> 01:47:37,640
dab and then act like it tasted real

2381
01:47:35,899 --> 01:47:39,259
good and then get a q-tip and clean it

2382
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:40,430
off that's what all the trendy kids are

2383
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:42,770
doing now that's what you see it all the

2384
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:45,380
events that is not my style I like to

2385
01:47:42,770 --> 01:47:47,810
heat it and when it's hot enough to cook

2386
01:47:45,380 --> 01:47:49,069
the dab I drop a real big dab on it make

2387
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:51,170
sure it all cooks and I get a big thick

2388
01:47:49,069 --> 01:47:52,639
fat milky hit that makes my eyes water

2389
01:47:51,170 --> 01:47:54,109
and makes my lungs kind of Twitter a

2390
01:47:52,640 --> 01:47:55,910
little bit and I put a carb cap on it

2391
01:47:54,109 --> 01:47:57,889
make it even fatter and I like to get a

2392
01:47:55,909 --> 01:47:59,479
fat dad so sending the email to the

2393
01:47:57,890 --> 01:48:01,670
perfect tip is kind of subjective for

2394
01:47:59,479 --> 01:48:04,189
you the way I would say to do it use a

2395
01:48:01,670 --> 01:48:06,109
carb cap definitely uses carved-out

2396
01:48:04,189 --> 01:48:08,210
they're actually went and googled apart

2397
01:48:06,109 --> 01:48:10,130
about a carb cap let's talk about a carb

2398
01:48:08,210 --> 01:48:12,140
cap for a second here this actually

2399
01:48:10,130 --> 01:48:13,609
comes from High Times Magazine and it

2400
01:48:12,140 --> 01:48:15,560
was written I wrote it down it's written

2401
01:48:13,609 --> 01:48:17,329
by Shawn black

2402
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:19,070
this is like this the carb cap is

2403
01:48:17,329 --> 01:48:22,250
exactly what it sounds like a carburetor

2404
01:48:19,069 --> 01:48:23,420
for your rig it restricts restricts what

2405
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:25,460
the [ __ ] does that word mean it

2406
01:48:23,420 --> 01:48:27,319
restricts the amount of airflow to your

2407
01:48:25,460 --> 01:48:31,369
nail allowing you to collect the last

2408
01:48:27,319 --> 01:48:32,989
bits of your oil to punctuate the end of

2409
01:48:31,369 --> 01:48:34,309
your head by cat and this is the part

2410
01:48:32,989 --> 01:48:35,719
that's important by capping the nail you

2411
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:38,000
restrict the air flow into the rig

2412
01:48:35,720 --> 01:48:39,920
through the small contact area between

2413
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:42,020
the cap and the edge of the nail while

2414
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:44,239
inhaling strongly the reduced air flow

2415
01:48:42,020 --> 01:48:46,040
places the entire rig under low pressure

2416
01:48:44,239 --> 01:48:48,260
including the oil that pulled on the

2417
01:48:46,039 --> 01:48:50,149
nail without vaporizing under low

2418
01:48:48,260 --> 01:48:52,449
pressure every component of the hash oil

2419
01:48:50,149 --> 01:48:55,460
suddenly has a lower boiling temperature

2420
01:48:52,449 --> 01:48:57,380
what once boiled it should say which

2421
01:48:55,460 --> 01:48:59,210
which once boil at high temperatures can

2422
01:48:57,380 --> 01:49:01,640
now do so at much lower temperatures

2423
01:48:59,210 --> 01:49:03,890
giving you a bloom of thicker better

2424
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:05,450
tasting smoke the carbon cap lets you

2425
01:49:03,890 --> 01:49:08,000
actually finish the dab instead of

2426
01:49:05,449 --> 01:49:09,889
wasting it in a thick sputtering puddle

2427
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,479
the trend now you guys is that thick

2428
01:49:09,890 --> 01:49:13,310
sputtering puddle because everyone wants

2429
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:16,009
to taste if the Terps turps is the new

2430
01:49:13,310 --> 01:49:17,480
word Terps is the new thing I like that

2431
01:49:16,010 --> 01:49:20,360
carb cap description there so you get

2432
01:49:17,479 --> 01:49:22,939
your email you guys set it to hot set it

2433
01:49:20,359 --> 01:49:26,719
to low just go one direction I recommend

2434
01:49:22,939 --> 01:49:29,029
just slowly climb up you're looking for

2435
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:30,770
the sweet spot in between wasting a lot

2436
01:49:29,029 --> 01:49:32,300
of your product and burning the living

2437
01:49:30,770 --> 01:49:34,160
[ __ ] out of your throat like I did

2438
01:49:32,300 --> 01:49:35,800
myself last night how far away right now

2439
01:49:34,159 --> 01:49:38,420
is my finger from the top of that nail

2440
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:40,760
inch and a half perfect that's what I

2441
01:49:38,420 --> 01:49:42,949
thought so put your fingers and inch to

2442
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:44,720
two inches above the nail and should be

2443
01:49:42,949 --> 01:49:47,090
able to sit there comfortably for like

2444
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:48,829
one or two seconds before ooh that's hot

2445
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:50,239
it should feel like your fingers getting

2446
01:49:48,829 --> 01:49:51,859
pinched like someone's just pinching

2447
01:49:50,239 --> 01:49:53,239
your finger a little bit that's about

2448
01:49:51,859 --> 01:49:54,769
the right temperature where I like it

2449
01:49:53,239 --> 01:49:56,689
Audrey kind of feels like you getting

2450
01:49:54,770 --> 01:49:58,640
pension after a couple seconds see the

2451
01:49:56,689 --> 01:50:04,819
toy that I should have now but I don't

2452
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:06,440
is a laser town I've got have left the

2453
01:50:04,819 --> 01:50:08,090
house with money in my pocket to go buy

2454
01:50:06,439 --> 01:50:10,329
one a couple of times and something

2455
01:50:08,090 --> 01:50:12,860
happens and I end up at home without one

2456
01:50:10,329 --> 01:50:23,449
it's just not in the cards because it's

2457
01:50:12,859 --> 01:50:24,679
not necessary it's it's just depends on

2458
01:50:23,449 --> 01:50:26,239
what kind of hash you're smoking also if

2459
01:50:24,680 --> 01:50:28,100
you're smoking shatter like this shatter

2460
01:50:26,239 --> 01:50:28,710
you can put it on there kind of hot I've

2461
01:50:28,100 --> 01:50:30,390
had some

2462
01:50:28,710 --> 01:50:32,010
accent probably go hotter if I smoke and

2463
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:34,680
live res I might turn it down just a bit

2464
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:35,880
to get more of that taste so it depends

2465
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:37,680
on the concentrate you've got you guys

2466
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:39,300
get the concentrate that you've got get

2467
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:41,039
the nail sit a little bit low put the

2468
01:50:39,300 --> 01:50:43,050
dab on there if it doesn't put the carb

2469
01:50:41,039 --> 01:50:44,969
cap on start smoking if that dad doesn't

2470
01:50:43,050 --> 01:50:46,980
melt enough obviously turn that [ __ ] up

2471
01:50:44,969 --> 01:50:48,659
and just go five or ten degrees higher

2472
01:50:46,979 --> 01:50:50,968
every time until you get the dab you

2473
01:50:48,659 --> 01:50:54,119
want I can't recommend the carb cap

2474
01:50:50,969 --> 01:50:56,310
enough the first time you use one when

2475
01:50:54,119 --> 01:50:57,840
you throw it on top of the nail the

2476
01:50:56,310 --> 01:51:00,420
first thing that goes through your head

2477
01:50:57,840 --> 01:51:02,219
is where'd all that come from as you

2478
01:51:00,420 --> 01:51:05,430
watch the vapor going through your rig

2479
01:51:02,219 --> 01:51:07,260
quadruple and thicken because that

2480
01:51:05,430 --> 01:51:09,329
wasn't on your nail a second ago had you

2481
01:51:07,260 --> 01:51:11,219
taken a breath and hit it you wouldn't

2482
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:13,079
have gotten any of that and suddenly

2483
01:51:11,219 --> 01:51:15,600
you've got a huge milked out rig going

2484
01:51:13,079 --> 01:51:17,460
for you again it's so sweet I love just

2485
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,320
when you cap it you just see it you just

2486
01:51:17,460 --> 01:51:20,789
start pulling like ah there you go

2487
01:51:19,319 --> 01:51:22,319
you know that's part of the reason I've

2488
01:51:20,789 --> 01:51:24,090
been so baked the last couple of shows

2489
01:51:22,319 --> 01:51:26,340
I've done is because I didn't have one

2490
01:51:24,090 --> 01:51:29,460
at home for the last several months and

2491
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:30,840
now was not getting nearly as stoned at

2492
01:51:29,460 --> 01:51:32,609
home because I didn't have all the tools

2493
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:33,719
with me so when he dropped the carb cap

2494
01:51:32,609 --> 01:51:34,889
on there you guys you're pulling your

2495
01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:36,270
head you're taking your hit then you get

2496
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:37,619
enough smoke to fill your lungs you want

2497
01:51:36,270 --> 01:51:39,870
to blow out so that you could pull the

2498
01:51:37,619 --> 01:51:41,760
rest of that don't take the carb cap off

2499
01:51:39,869 --> 01:51:43,949
because at that time you're letting all

2500
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,600
that vapor and that pressure and that

2501
01:51:43,949 --> 01:51:47,159
vacuum that you've created you've just

2502
01:51:45,600 --> 01:51:49,079
ruined that by letting the carb cap off

2503
01:51:47,159 --> 01:51:50,430
leave that carb cap on there almost

2504
01:51:49,079 --> 01:51:51,600
until you're done dabbing sometimes it's

2505
01:51:50,430 --> 01:51:54,119
a good idea to lift it cuz that [ __ ]

2506
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:55,560
gets hot but just put it on there inhale

2507
01:51:54,119 --> 01:51:57,300
blow your head out leave the cap on

2508
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:59,880
inhale the rest and then take it off as

2509
01:51:57,300 --> 01:52:01,320
soon as you're done don't don't take it

2510
01:51:59,880 --> 01:52:02,909
off until you're done Davin cuz a lot of

2511
01:52:01,319 --> 01:52:04,829
folks lose part of their dab that I've

2512
01:52:02,909 --> 01:52:06,689
seen people feather them and try to get

2513
01:52:04,829 --> 01:52:09,180
fancy with it just set it on there and

2514
01:52:06,689 --> 01:52:10,799
let her go one thing I do I honestly do

2515
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:12,659
turn it a little bit there's one hole in

2516
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,949
there and the top of that carb cap and I

2517
01:52:12,659 --> 01:52:16,289
like to turn it just because I think

2518
01:52:13,949 --> 01:52:18,750
that I move my or I take a larger dab

2519
01:52:16,289 --> 01:52:20,488
the nose with you need to spread it

2520
01:52:18,750 --> 01:52:21,810
across the top of the nail just a little

2521
01:52:20,488 --> 01:52:24,750
bit more than some and I'm not trying to

2522
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:27,060
be a big [ __ ] dad when we're talking

2523
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:29,729
temperature I can get away with a much

2524
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:32,610
lower temp and now waste anything

2525
01:52:29,729 --> 01:52:37,619
because I'm putting a much smaller dab

2526
01:52:32,609 --> 01:52:42,000
to the nail each time you can't do

2527
01:52:37,619 --> 01:52:44,699
low temp half gram or a gram dab you end

2528
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:46,079
up doing a point to dab in the rest of

2529
01:52:44,699 --> 01:52:50,309
the puddles and then you feel like a

2530
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:51,449
dick for wasting watch your ass I wanna

2531
01:52:50,310 --> 01:52:52,860
mention one more thing and then you just

2532
01:52:51,449 --> 01:52:54,720
kind of said weighed me into another

2533
01:52:52,859 --> 01:52:56,729
part I want to talk about you guys when

2534
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:59,490
you're taking a DAB with a carb cap and

2535
01:52:56,729 --> 01:53:00,899
you're using an email this happened at

2536
01:52:59,489 --> 01:53:02,670
the can of Canyon and it happens here

2537
01:53:00,899 --> 01:53:04,229
occasionally I just wanted to bring this

2538
01:53:02,670 --> 01:53:05,760
up for the folks that are learning to

2539
01:53:04,229 --> 01:53:10,739
dab and even the experienced neighbors

2540
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:12,630
bra take the carb cap off the email

2541
01:53:10,739 --> 01:53:14,279
because that email is turned on and it's

2542
01:53:12,630 --> 01:53:16,260
hot and you leave that carbon cap on

2543
01:53:14,279 --> 01:53:18,989
there and it heats up the carb cap and

2544
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:20,220
then whoever whoever sees it wants to

2545
01:53:18,989 --> 01:53:21,929
take a DAB they're not thinking about

2546
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:23,789
that is hot they're thinking I want a

2547
01:53:21,930 --> 01:53:24,960
dad and they reach through the carb cap

2548
01:53:23,789 --> 01:53:27,810
and they burn the [ __ ] out of themselves

2549
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:29,880
so be careful please take that

2550
01:53:27,810 --> 01:53:32,070
yeah please take that carb cap off of

2551
01:53:29,880 --> 01:53:34,109
the email just set it on an oil slick

2552
01:53:32,069 --> 01:53:35,460
pad I see so many people there's an oil

2553
01:53:34,109 --> 01:53:38,549
slick pad on my table this pad is

2554
01:53:35,460 --> 01:53:40,230
designed to catch hash oil not stick to

2555
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:41,850
here my table right here this would part

2556
01:53:40,229 --> 01:53:44,759
the hash will stick to this all [ __ ]

2557
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:46,320
day just put the two put the carb cap

2558
01:53:44,760 --> 01:53:49,310
down on the oil slick pad if you see one

2559
01:53:46,319 --> 01:53:52,469
that's what that's for utilize that

2560
01:53:49,310 --> 01:53:54,590
would segue me into another part that I

2561
01:53:52,470 --> 01:53:57,500
wanted to talk about

2562
01:53:54,590 --> 01:53:59,420
when we're giving dabs to somebody is it

2563
01:53:57,500 --> 01:54:01,309
up to me

2564
01:53:59,420 --> 01:54:03,618
to heat that it I feel like if I give

2565
01:54:01,309 --> 01:54:05,599
you a DAB this will be another question

2566
01:54:03,618 --> 01:54:07,368
I'm gonna ask one of us pulls a dab off

2567
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:08,630
the parchment paper for you I'll heat

2568
01:54:07,368 --> 01:54:10,368
the rig to be nice just because we're

2569
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:12,319
dabbing at my spot or in my car or

2570
01:54:10,368 --> 01:54:14,089
wherever we happen to be I'm gonna heat

2571
01:54:12,319 --> 01:54:15,469
this I know like I know I'm sorry I'm

2572
01:54:14,090 --> 01:54:16,880
gonna heat the nail to the appropriate

2573
01:54:15,469 --> 01:54:19,399
temperature and then I'm gonna maybe

2574
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,868
we're camping and I'm gonna heal the

2575
01:54:19,399 --> 01:54:21,649
appropriate temperature and I'm gonna

2576
01:54:20,868 --> 01:54:23,808
hand it to you

2577
01:54:21,649 --> 01:54:25,488
do I hang on to that [ __ ] until it's

2578
01:54:23,809 --> 01:54:37,520
the right tip or do I give it to you and

2579
01:54:25,488 --> 01:54:40,098
let you decide when to dab that's if

2580
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:43,219
it's someone new and new to dabbing I

2581
01:54:40,099 --> 01:54:44,719
would just be like okay like I would

2582
01:54:43,219 --> 01:54:46,489
just probably hold on to until it was

2583
01:54:44,719 --> 01:54:51,760
ready and then give it to him but if

2584
01:54:46,488 --> 01:54:51,759
it's somebody you know dabs a lot

2585
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:55,079
[Music]

2586
01:54:55,118 --> 01:54:58,939
because do you remember a couple weeks

2587
01:54:57,408 --> 01:55:05,868
ago when we were having a conversation

2588
01:54:58,939 --> 01:55:07,038
about somebody he came from somebody

2589
01:55:05,868 --> 01:55:08,960
tried to be nice and give me a big fat

2590
01:55:07,038 --> 01:55:10,279
dab and they heated the nail nice and

2591
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:11,929
hot and when I went to pick up the rig

2592
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:15,078
they put their hand on it and said it's

2593
01:55:11,929 --> 01:55:16,279
too hot and I tried polite I'm like cool

2594
01:55:15,078 --> 01:55:18,439
you're giving me a DAB I'll let you do

2595
01:55:16,279 --> 01:55:19,908
your thing but in my mind I thought it's

2596
01:55:18,439 --> 01:55:21,408
gonna cool down way too much and this

2597
01:55:19,908 --> 01:55:23,479
big damn is just gonna end up as a

2598
01:55:21,408 --> 01:55:25,279
puddle on your nail and these guys were

2599
01:55:23,479 --> 01:55:27,468
like proud of how much they clean out of

2600
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:29,840
their rig with the q-tip you know I want

2601
01:55:27,469 --> 01:55:32,118
to smoke that bro put that in my lungs

2602
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:34,130
if we paid for it the dispensary wasn't

2603
01:55:32,118 --> 01:55:36,469
like oh you're gonna q-tip it here's 30%

2604
01:55:34,130 --> 01:55:38,179
off I don't understand how people can

2605
01:55:36,469 --> 01:55:43,368
waste that amount of hat it's like when

2606
01:55:38,179 --> 01:55:46,130
you're paying 20 30 60 80 100 gram for

2607
01:55:43,368 --> 01:55:48,198
hash how do you waste half of it on the

2608
01:55:46,130 --> 01:55:49,529
just letting it puddle and then kicking

2609
01:55:48,198 --> 01:55:51,689
it into the trash

2610
01:55:49,529 --> 01:55:53,489
that's like taking two sips off your

2611
01:55:51,689 --> 01:55:54,719
beer and putting the whole bottle the

2612
01:55:53,489 --> 01:55:56,039
rest of the bottle of the trash and

2613
01:55:54,720 --> 01:56:02,940
ordering another beer and dragging that

2614
01:55:56,039 --> 01:56:04,560
way all night dude choose how hot he

2615
01:56:02,939 --> 01:56:06,439
wants it if I want to want to burn my

2616
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:12,750
lung as if on a roast my esophagus

2617
01:56:06,439 --> 01:56:14,659
let me new people and be gentle a lot of

2618
01:56:12,750 --> 01:56:16,920
us have a good story about the

2619
01:56:14,659 --> 01:56:19,050
introducing someone the hash where they

2620
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:22,560
were like nah I want to take the hit you

2621
01:56:19,050 --> 01:56:25,710
took and we give it one or two no you

2622
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:29,250
don't bro like just a bit of advice go

2623
01:56:25,710 --> 01:56:31,020
slow very strong and they resist a

2624
01:56:29,250 --> 01:56:33,000
little bit so we say [ __ ] it and let him

2625
01:56:31,020 --> 01:56:34,650
jump off the cliff that's not

2626
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:36,869
necessarily I've told the story of the

2627
01:56:34,649 --> 01:56:39,359
dude a guy I was at a cannabis cup

2628
01:56:36,869 --> 01:56:40,529
mistaking dabs and a guy walked up he

2629
01:56:39,359 --> 01:56:42,089
said what are you doing there bro does

2630
01:56:40,529 --> 01:56:43,920
like smoking dabs and he's like I never

2631
01:56:42,090 --> 01:56:45,029
seen dad's before can I get a dad and I

2632
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:47,069
was like sure and I gave him what I

2633
01:56:45,029 --> 01:56:51,059
thought would be a normal first dab for

2634
01:56:47,069 --> 01:56:54,119
a guy but I saw what you smoked give me

2635
01:56:51,060 --> 01:56:57,060
what you smoked that's gonna [ __ ] you up

2636
01:56:54,119 --> 01:56:58,439
I don't care I could smoke and so I did

2637
01:56:57,060 --> 01:57:00,990
what he asked for and I gave him a Jeff

2638
01:56:58,439 --> 01:57:02,489
sighs dad she dude up hooked him up that

2639
01:57:00,989 --> 01:57:05,099
dude took that hit and pulled in the

2640
01:57:02,489 --> 01:57:06,899
smoke and blew it out and vanished he

2641
01:57:05,100 --> 01:57:08,490
walked into the crowd like bye I gotta

2642
01:57:06,899 --> 01:57:09,659
go he was so high he didn't know what to

2643
01:57:08,489 --> 01:57:12,960
do with himself he couldn't look me in

2644
01:57:09,659 --> 01:57:16,170
the eye anymore he was done I thought

2645
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:18,239
it's kind of funny but good chunk of my

2646
01:57:16,170 --> 01:57:20,789
day explaining to people who aren't

2647
01:57:18,239 --> 01:57:24,809
familiar with hash and edibles - please

2648
01:57:20,789 --> 01:57:27,659
go slow I talk to people all the time

2649
01:57:24,810 --> 01:57:30,720
that have I took the way too big a dab

2650
01:57:27,659 --> 01:57:34,050
and it was like the longest 12 hours of

2651
01:57:30,720 --> 01:57:35,640
my life while I waited to come down and

2652
01:57:34,050 --> 01:57:37,409
I feel bad for those people and it's

2653
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:39,990
unnecessary like we used to be a little

2654
01:57:37,409 --> 01:57:42,359
gentler with it and there used to be an

2655
01:57:39,989 --> 01:57:45,619
initiation process before these products

2656
01:57:42,359 --> 01:57:48,509
were available and it negated the

2657
01:57:45,619 --> 01:57:49,979
necessity to do to say that a lot of

2658
01:57:48,510 --> 01:57:51,780
this stuff there are people out there

2659
01:57:49,979 --> 01:57:55,979
whose first experience with cannabis was

2660
01:57:51,779 --> 01:57:57,659
a DAB yeah it's unfair that's like the

2661
01:57:55,979 --> 01:58:00,319
first time you drank when you were in

2662
01:57:57,659 --> 01:58:02,090
middle school or a teenager or whatever

2663
01:58:00,319 --> 01:58:05,389
you had moonshine and you guys were

2664
01:58:02,090 --> 01:58:12,380
[ __ ] beer funneling it it's it's so

2665
01:58:05,389 --> 01:58:15,500
unnecessary there boof and shine why

2666
01:58:12,380 --> 01:58:18,139
would you do that it's the same thing my

2667
01:58:15,500 --> 01:58:19,550
first my first intro to marijuana with

2668
01:58:18,139 --> 01:58:22,400
us

2669
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:25,190
a giant dab a life resin and it's like

2670
01:58:22,399 --> 01:58:26,719
in in what happened next you spent seven

2671
01:58:25,189 --> 01:58:28,819
hours in your hotel room wondering if

2672
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:31,639
you were dead or not it's just you were

2673
01:58:28,819 --> 01:58:33,139
too big to handle it it never should

2674
01:58:31,639 --> 01:58:35,359
have happened like you didn't need to be

2675
01:58:33,139 --> 01:58:37,279
in that end of the pool go slow I need

2676
01:58:35,359 --> 01:58:42,649
to put a disclaimer on my dad videos do

2677
01:58:37,279 --> 01:58:44,389
not try this at home so I think with

2678
01:58:42,649 --> 01:58:46,339
that going back to your original

2679
01:58:44,389 --> 01:58:48,849
question your Jeff I think it's about

2680
01:58:46,340 --> 01:58:51,650
knowing your audience and about knowing

2681
01:58:48,849 --> 01:58:55,340
like who's in your car like if it's a

2682
01:58:51,649 --> 01:59:07,460
you know experienced divers let him do

2683
01:58:55,340 --> 01:59:08,900
it but if not because we're setting a

2684
01:59:07,460 --> 01:59:10,219
bad example we're talking about dabbing

2685
01:59:08,899 --> 01:59:18,379
in the car what shouldn't happen we're

2686
01:59:10,219 --> 01:59:21,020
the kids we're you and I each have

2687
01:59:18,380 --> 01:59:30,920
slipped about dabbing in the car like

2688
01:59:21,020 --> 01:59:32,389
we're outdoorsy it's Colorado I think

2689
01:59:30,920 --> 01:59:35,319
it's [ __ ] fun to dab in the car wash

2690
01:59:32,389 --> 01:59:35,319
when you get the car wash

2691
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:43,859

2692
01:59:48,390 --> 01:59:51,529

[Music]

2694
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:11,069

2710
02:00:57,510 --> 02:01:02,640
over there is that how are you supposed

2711
02:01:00,899 --> 02:01:07,019
am I supposed to pull him off a DAB or

2712
02:01:02,640 --> 02:01:08,430
is that his job or I think Lindsey said

2713
02:01:07,020 --> 02:01:11,900
it perfectly a second ago someone

2714
02:01:08,430 --> 02:01:11,900
knowing you're on depends on who's who

2715
02:01:12,380 --> 02:01:19,829
you always get that one kid hanging out

2716
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:21,000
at the secret stash and we're all a

2717
02:01:19,829 --> 02:01:22,050
bunch of friends we're a bunch of heads

2718
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:23,609
were a bunch of family there's always

2719
02:01:22,050 --> 02:01:24,539
one guy in every [ __ ] group and you

2720
02:01:23,609 --> 02:01:26,670
know who I'm thinking about right now

2721
02:01:24,539 --> 02:01:28,140
that guy if you hand him your shatter

2722
02:01:26,670 --> 02:01:30,300
he's gonna try to smoke all of this in

2723
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:31,800
one DAP just because he wants to smoke

2724
02:01:30,300 --> 02:01:34,320
as much as he can while he's there and

2725
02:01:31,800 --> 02:01:36,510
get as high as he can everybody every

2726
02:01:34,319 --> 02:01:38,789
group has that one guy that one friend I

2727
02:01:36,510 --> 02:01:40,110
think it's funny when people ask me for

2728
02:01:38,789 --> 02:01:41,760
a DAB and they try to do that because

2729
02:01:40,109 --> 02:01:44,130
then I get to watch them cough and turn

2730
02:01:41,760 --> 02:01:45,030
red and turn purple and most not out of

2731
02:01:44,130 --> 02:01:50,130
their face

2732
02:01:45,029 --> 02:01:54,719
it's worth it to me is watching them

2733
02:01:50,130 --> 02:01:56,489
function after that exactly because you

2734
02:01:54,720 --> 02:01:59,640
know what Jeff the thing about it is is

2735
02:01:56,489 --> 02:02:03,359
they watch people like you take huge

2736
02:01:59,640 --> 02:02:06,810
dabs and you know be able to just take

2737
02:02:03,359 --> 02:02:08,969
point five you know or bigger dabs and

2738
02:02:06,810 --> 02:02:11,760
they say here and go oh I can go on this

2739
02:02:08,970 --> 02:02:15,570
level with this guy and they take this

2740
02:02:11,760 --> 02:02:18,060
one they die and then they can't

2741
02:02:15,569 --> 02:02:21,179
function and you know what you do you

2742
02:02:18,060 --> 02:02:23,130
continues to take point five or bigger

2743
02:02:21,180 --> 02:02:28,230
DAV's and you keep going through the

2744
02:02:23,130 --> 02:02:31,260
night and they're just like been

2745
02:02:28,229 --> 02:02:34,369
trainings you're going deep this is your

2746
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:37,880
Olympics you just for comparison there's

2747
02:02:34,369 --> 02:02:42,090
more residue on the dabber I just used

2748
02:02:37,880 --> 02:02:43,980
then the dab I just took Mike you're the

2749
02:02:42,090 --> 02:02:50,940
Segway champion because I want to talk

2750
02:02:43,979 --> 02:02:52,859
about ninja dabs right now so a lot of

2751
02:02:50,939 --> 02:02:54,509
people we take for granted a lot of

2752
02:02:52,859 --> 02:02:56,670
folks listening to this podcast or not

2753
02:02:54,510 --> 02:02:58,079
colorado-based people I can tell by

2754
02:02:56,670 --> 02:02:59,039
looking at the stats I try to ignore

2755
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:01,199
them because I don't want it to

2756
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:02,699
influence my performance but I could

2757
02:03:01,199 --> 02:03:04,679
tell by looking at the stats and a large

2758
02:03:02,699 --> 02:03:07,710
portion of our audiences in Colorado but

2759
02:03:04,680 --> 02:03:10,050
more than 50% is not Colorado based and

2760
02:03:07,710 --> 02:03:11,789
a large portion is not even in America

2761
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:14,130
those people don't get to dab they don't

2762
02:03:11,789 --> 02:03:15,840
know what dabs are somebody put me back

2763
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:18,989
on track ninja dabs obviously what the

2764
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:20,730
[ __ ] ninja damn sorry ninja dabs so if

2765
02:03:18,989 --> 02:03:22,619
Lindsay was to get herself a DAB and she

2766
02:03:20,729 --> 02:03:24,989
was to start dabbing I would sneakily

2767
02:03:22,619 --> 02:03:26,460
I've got my MacBook here open I would

2768
02:03:24,989 --> 02:03:28,170
well she can't see me by behind the

2769
02:03:26,460 --> 02:03:29,640
computer I put another dab on another

2770
02:03:28,170 --> 02:03:31,199
dabber and as soon as Lindsay starts

2771
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:32,910
inhaling that dab right before she puts

2772
02:03:31,199 --> 02:03:35,489
the carb cap on I would reach over and

2773
02:03:32,909 --> 02:03:38,489
put a sizable amount of hash on the nail

2774
02:03:35,489 --> 02:03:40,019
for her and ninja dabber I just get that

2775
02:03:38,489 --> 02:03:41,579
just add a little to her and make her

2776
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:44,550
coughing get her a little extra [ __ ]

2777
02:03:41,579 --> 02:03:47,670
up more than she expected I've also seen

2778
02:03:44,550 --> 02:03:51,180
it referred to putting a DAB underneath

2779
02:03:47,670 --> 02:03:52,949
the carb cap so you lay the carb cap is

2780
02:03:51,180 --> 02:03:55,409
just it's a hunk of metal with a hole in

2781
02:03:52,949 --> 02:03:56,979
it did you set on top of the hot nail so

2782
02:03:55,409 --> 02:03:58,869
if you take some hash

2783
02:03:56,979 --> 02:04:01,659
surreptitiously place it underneath the

2784
02:03:58,869 --> 02:04:03,579
car cap of all that car or the wall they

2785
02:04:01,659 --> 02:04:05,170
their carb caps on their cap in their

2786
02:04:03,579 --> 02:04:08,949
dab it's gonna heat up enough to drop

2787
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:10,359
that on the nail so be a good 3 4 5 10

2788
02:04:08,949 --> 02:04:12,250
seconds into their hit their hit

2789
02:04:10,359 --> 02:04:13,299
quadruples all of a sudden they don't

2790
02:04:12,250 --> 02:04:15,069
even know where it came from

2791
02:04:13,300 --> 02:04:16,630
yep that's happened to me more than once

2792
02:04:15,069 --> 02:04:18,729
in his led to some less than productive

2793
02:04:16,630 --> 02:04:22,690
afternoons I've called those time bombs

2794
02:04:18,729 --> 02:04:25,149
or landmines but I've also heard them

2795
02:04:22,689 --> 02:04:27,399
called sniper dabs for mother folks I've

2796
02:04:25,149 --> 02:04:29,079
got multiple enzymes and ninja dads

2797
02:04:27,399 --> 02:04:30,639
Roseau is when I heard those calls

2798
02:04:29,079 --> 02:04:31,840
we've got multiple carp caps and I'll

2799
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:35,739
just set them out on the table and

2800
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:37,329
occasionally one will have a little just

2801
02:04:35,738 --> 02:04:38,559
keeps going and they turn red they blow

2802
02:04:37,329 --> 02:04:39,909
snot out of their face and they choke

2803
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:43,450
for a few minutes and it's really funny

2804
02:04:39,909 --> 02:04:56,859
to me I laugh a lot it is it's the blue

2805
02:04:43,449 --> 02:05:02,949
one if it ever happened we're talking

2806
02:04:56,859 --> 02:05:05,529
about dad stuff I've got notes it's

2807
02:05:02,949 --> 02:05:08,109
summertime and it's hot here in Colorado

2808
02:05:05,529 --> 02:05:09,880
and your dads are gonna be stuck to the

2809
02:05:08,109 --> 02:05:12,009
parchment paper and hard to [ __ ] okay

2810
02:05:09,880 --> 02:05:14,680
first of all I saw a dispensary on

2811
02:05:12,010 --> 02:05:17,800
Instagram today selling their patch in

2812
02:05:14,680 --> 02:05:19,329
little plastic discs [ __ ] that step up

2813
02:05:17,800 --> 02:05:21,430
your game use parchment paper it's cheap

2814
02:05:19,329 --> 02:05:23,439
get some parchment paper put your dad's

2815
02:05:21,430 --> 02:05:24,789
in parchment paper or one of those like

2816
02:05:23,439 --> 02:05:26,289
silicone containers let's get away from

2817
02:05:24,789 --> 02:05:27,939
the plastic things we're all your dad's

2818
02:05:26,289 --> 02:05:29,350
stick to it you gotta scrape it for

2819
02:05:27,939 --> 02:05:32,229
[ __ ] days to waste like a quarter

2820
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:34,329
grab no one wants to scrape out of that

2821
02:05:32,229 --> 02:05:36,159
little plastic dish yeah that's the

2822
02:05:34,329 --> 02:05:38,260
first time you go to scrape out of you

2823
02:05:36,159 --> 02:05:40,539
realize that it's plastic and half the

2824
02:05:38,260 --> 02:05:43,960
divers out here aren't gentle enough to

2825
02:05:40,539 --> 02:05:45,970
I mean it's it quickly becomes a

2826
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:49,720
question of who am I willing to dab

2827
02:05:45,970 --> 02:05:51,880
little strips of plastic oh it's great

2828
02:05:49,720 --> 02:05:53,949
that off my nail or do I just have to

2829
02:05:51,880 --> 02:05:54,850
kiss the rest of this hash go just let

2830
02:05:53,949 --> 02:05:57,189
it go

2831
02:05:54,850 --> 02:05:59,160
yeah honestly step your packaging up a

2832
02:05:57,189 --> 02:06:04,419
little bit I'm be sensitive to this

2833
02:05:59,159 --> 02:06:05,949
nevermind well like the packaging

2834
02:06:04,420 --> 02:06:08,230
matters and a lot of people don't think

2835
02:06:05,949 --> 02:06:10,238
it through to the end stage they come up

2836
02:06:08,229 --> 02:06:10,868
with the dough product and it's like

2837
02:06:10,238 --> 02:06:12,609
pork

2838
02:06:10,868 --> 02:06:15,819
the Lamborghini engine and a [ __ ] pen

2839
02:06:12,609 --> 02:06:18,460
so sometimes it's ridiculous and it's

2840
02:06:15,819 --> 02:06:20,319
that it's gotta move it doesn't matter

2841
02:06:18,460 --> 02:06:22,029
how good your product is if the

2842
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:24,368
packaging is hideous and it's not

2843
02:06:22,029 --> 02:06:26,829
displayable it's gonna annoy the people

2844
02:06:24,368 --> 02:06:28,448
that sell it just a little even if

2845
02:06:26,829 --> 02:06:30,189
they're annoyed just a little they're

2846
02:06:28,448 --> 02:06:32,710
gonna reference the product that isn't

2847
02:06:30,189 --> 02:06:34,178
annoying more that's gonna move 10 times

2848
02:06:32,710 --> 02:06:35,829
faster you're gonna make a lot less

2849
02:06:34,179 --> 02:06:39,219
money all because you think you're

2850
02:06:35,829 --> 02:06:40,719
packaging through to the end and I mean

2851
02:06:39,219 --> 02:06:42,819
we're watching a change in waves in

2852
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:44,980
Colorado right now every hash company

2853
02:06:42,819 --> 02:06:47,019
had their cool unique shaped logo

2854
02:06:44,979 --> 02:06:49,059
package and all of those are

2855
02:06:47,020 --> 02:06:51,639
transitioning to almost identical

2856
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:53,139
envelopes now when you guys are seeing

2857
02:06:51,639 --> 02:07:00,429
it just as fast as I am up in the

2858
02:06:53,139 --> 02:07:03,760
springs I'm sure the packaging matters

2859
02:07:00,429 --> 02:07:05,889
in the original point of this was it's

2860
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:09,880
summer the shatters a little tacky right

2861
02:07:05,889 --> 02:07:11,800
now that's a problem when it's a plastic

2862
02:07:09,880 --> 02:07:14,079
container yeah use parchment but where I

2863
02:07:11,800 --> 02:07:16,000
was headed with that is air conditioner

2864
02:07:14,079 --> 02:07:18,460
tech you guys your shadows getting all

2865
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,090
funky go just set that shatter put her

2866
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:20,230
in a baggie

2867
02:07:19,090 --> 02:07:21,369
well you if you're not gonna be there

2868
02:07:20,229 --> 02:07:22,809
for more than four or five minutes you

2869
02:07:21,368 --> 02:07:24,399
don't have to put in a baggie just set

2870
02:07:22,810 --> 02:07:25,780
that parchment in the freezer close the

2871
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:27,939
door make sure you sit on a dry area

2872
02:07:25,779 --> 02:07:29,198
close the door let that [ __ ] get nice

2873
02:07:27,939 --> 02:07:30,339
and cold for a few minutes and pull it

2874
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:31,750
out and now you can function with that

2875
02:07:30,340 --> 02:07:33,400
shatter it's gonna be a whole lot easier

2876
02:07:31,750 --> 02:07:36,819
to deal with it's gonna be real snappy

2877
02:07:33,399 --> 02:07:39,098
real crunchy if you maybe you know

2878
02:07:36,819 --> 02:07:40,539
there's an air conditioner in places you

2879
02:07:39,099 --> 02:07:42,969
can turn on that vent and turn that

2880
02:07:40,539 --> 02:07:44,710
[ __ ] up cool down your carb cap cool

2881
02:07:42,969 --> 02:07:47,020
down your dab and then you can cool down

2882
02:07:44,710 --> 02:07:48,510
your shatter also but make it a whole

2883
02:07:47,020 --> 02:07:50,619
lot easier for you guys to function I

2884
02:07:48,510 --> 02:07:52,179
don't buy a lot of shatter during the

2885
02:07:50,618 --> 02:07:54,309
summer for this exact reason I just

2886
02:07:52,179 --> 02:07:56,440
wanna bother like if I go with the

2887
02:07:54,310 --> 02:08:00,639
butter or a wax or a live resident it's

2888
02:07:56,439 --> 02:08:02,379
already a little tacky or soupy it's not

2889
02:08:00,639 --> 02:08:07,630
gonna mess with it much ain't no season

2890

02:08:41,408 --> 02:08:46,689
forgetting us fire source see that's

2904

2905
02:08:46,689 --> 02:08:52,839
like we've always got 7 Bicks like we

2906
02:08:50,619 --> 02:08:55,779
can find a way to get that now hot give

2907
02:08:52,840 --> 02:08:56,949
us a minute so you're on the go and

2908
02:08:55,779 --> 02:08:58,420
you're going somewhere to dab somebody

2909
02:08:56,948 --> 02:09:00,789
take a can of butane you have no money

2910
02:08:58,420 --> 02:09:02,350
no idea how many times everybody's had

2911
02:09:00,789 --> 02:09:04,448
everything we've needed to take dad's

2912
02:09:02,350 --> 02:09:06,010
and nobody had any butane so I'm the

2913
02:09:04,448 --> 02:09:07,569
kind of butane in my backpack so I'm

2914
02:09:06,010 --> 02:09:09,159
like I'll trade you guys a phat dab for

2915
02:09:07,569 --> 02:09:10,329
this butane and I get the next dad that

2916
02:09:09,158 --> 02:09:11,829
comes out of that as soon as that torch

2917
02:09:10,329 --> 02:09:13,090
is filled guess who gets a DAB that

2918
02:09:11,829 --> 02:09:14,710
would be me because I had the butane to

2919
02:09:13,090 --> 02:09:16,600
save the day I don't know if it's the

2920
02:09:14,710 --> 02:09:18,880
Boy Scout in here the smoker or the

2921
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:20,440
stoner but I've always got a couple of

2922
02:09:18,880 --> 02:09:22,569
lighters like if I'm gonna go dab

2923
02:09:20,439 --> 02:09:25,928

2924
02:09:22,569 --> 02:09:29,679
torches two nails two rigs because rigs

2925
02:09:25,929 --> 02:09:31,630
get dropped nails get lost they call so

2926
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:33,730
it's a weird [ __ ] happens and it ruins

2927
02:09:31,630 --> 02:09:35,409
the session it's oh dude we could all be

2928
02:09:33,729 --> 02:09:37,209
high right now but we forgot a part in

2929
02:09:35,408 --> 02:09:39,099
our tweets fancies so now we're sober

2930
02:09:37,210 --> 02:09:42,039
Lindsey texted me one night she's like

2931
02:09:39,100 --> 02:09:43,570
dude I'm somewhere I don't have a rig

2932

2933
02:09:43,569 --> 02:09:49,299
Reagan no torch yeah I had a Reagan I

2934
02:09:47,439 --> 02:09:52,089
had note so we say Reagan it sounds

2935
02:09:49,300 --> 02:09:53,469
terrible we mean a small water pipe I

2936
02:09:52,090 --> 02:09:55,510
prefer a smaller I went over this on

2937
02:09:53,469 --> 02:09:58,029
another episode of small pipe with a dab

2938
02:09:55,510 --> 02:09:59,530
nail on it we go domeless nowadays a lot

2939
02:09:58,029 --> 02:10:04,509
of us use of what's called a banger it's

2940
02:09:59,529 --> 02:10:06,670
a quartz hash nail hash bucket it's

2941
02:10:04,510 --> 02:10:08,139
[ __ ] marvelous but Lindsey had the

2942
02:10:06,670 --> 02:10:09,908
pipe in the nail part but she didn't

2943
02:10:08,139 --> 02:10:11,619
have a way to make the nail part hot to

2944
02:10:09,908 --> 02:10:13,238
where she can melt hash on it do you

2945
02:10:11,619 --> 02:10:14,829
remember my advice lens the way that I

2946
02:10:13,238 --> 02:10:17,709
really thought would work for you uh

2947
02:10:14,829 --> 02:10:21,670
what you gave me two that I thought were

2948
02:10:17,710 --> 02:10:23,279
actually quite so you gave me the gas

2949
02:10:21,670 --> 02:10:26,430
stove

2950
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:27,899
you know how's your stove Oh sir either

2951
02:10:26,430 --> 02:10:30,690
way it would work the stove use the damn

2952
02:10:27,899 --> 02:10:36,319
stove right and then I just take the

2953
02:10:30,689 --> 02:10:39,599
deal on anything on the stove the car

2954
02:10:36,319 --> 02:10:41,609
the car cigarette I told her to use the

2955
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:43,680
car a cigarette lighter as a carb cap on

2956
02:10:41,609 --> 02:10:45,119
the banger like if you just heat that

2957
02:10:43,680 --> 02:10:46,890
[ __ ] up till it glows and then you

2958
02:10:45,119 --> 02:10:48,930
drop your dab in the banger and then put

2959
02:10:46,890 --> 02:10:50,310
the cigarette lighter over it and draw

2960
02:10:48,930 --> 02:10:52,740
the heat would work just like how the

2961
02:10:50,310 --> 02:10:54,030
carb cap works yeah she didn't try it

2962
02:10:52,739 --> 02:11:00,630
because she didn't have the [ __ ]

2963
02:10:54,029 --> 02:11:05,639
cigarette lighter you could probably

2964
02:11:00,630 --> 02:11:08,609
take a dab by using that what the nail

2965
02:11:05,640 --> 02:11:13,380
and the rig is for is it replaces hot

2966
02:11:08,609 --> 02:11:15,630
knife it's exactly what it sounds like

2967
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:18,060
you take two butter knives she's an

2968
02:11:15,630 --> 02:11:20,279
electric stove until the tips glow and

2969
02:11:18,060 --> 02:11:21,990
then mash a piece of hash in the middle

2970
02:11:20,279 --> 02:11:24,869
that's how like everyone in Europe got

2971
02:11:21,989 --> 02:11:26,969
stoned for like 71 to 75 to smoke hash

2972
02:11:24,869 --> 02:11:32,340
like that my buddy Sam's [ __ ] kitchen

2973
02:11:26,970 --> 02:11:34,949
years ago when people my parents age

2974
02:11:32,340 --> 02:11:36,720
come into the shop and ask for hash what

2975
02:11:34,949 --> 02:11:41,149
they're thinking about is hot knife hits

2976
02:11:36,720 --> 02:11:44,280
or the little pin under the beer mug

2977
02:11:41,149 --> 02:11:46,559
what is that [ __ ] I literally explain it

2978
02:11:44,279 --> 02:11:50,909
as this is the new fancy hash like

2979
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:53,910
that's my it's the easiest way to bring

2980
02:11:50,909 --> 02:11:55,800
them up to speed but yeah hot knife it's

2981
02:11:53,909 --> 02:11:57,539
work on the fancy hash - it's just a

2982
02:11:55,800 --> 02:11:59,850
little closer to crack smoking that most

2983
02:11:57,539 --> 02:12:01,619
of us likes to get what time I suck our

2984
02:11:59,850 --> 02:12:03,630
buddy Kevin took his car cigarette

2985
02:12:01,619 --> 02:12:15,529
lighter and took a DAB just through the

2986
02:12:03,630 --> 02:12:15,529
dab on the course easily

2987
02:12:20,710 --> 02:12:24,529
we're at a party late one night and

2988
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:27,050
we're smoking a bowl and we had shatter

2989
02:12:24,529 --> 02:12:28,189
and this is before like like Kevin and I

2990
02:12:27,050 --> 02:12:29,570
were kind of weird were some of the

2991
02:12:28,189 --> 02:12:32,929
first dab kids around here Boehner

2992
02:12:29,569 --> 02:12:35,000
smoked weed at the time I was Kevin was

2993
02:12:32,930 --> 02:12:36,500
me i Kevin was making chatter out of the

2994
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,090
material I was growing we're kind of

2995
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:40,340
ahead of the curve so we'd go places

2996
02:12:38,090 --> 02:12:41,569
people would have a rig and I didn't I

2997
02:12:40,340 --> 02:12:43,220
didn't used to drive around with the rig

2998
02:12:41,569 --> 02:12:44,809
on me I wouldn't take glass with me I

2999
02:12:43,220 --> 02:12:47,150
wouldn't do any of that stuff I didn't

3000
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:49,160
like taking a rig with me anywhere but

3001
02:12:47,149 --> 02:12:51,259
we would get a bowl burning real hot

3002
02:12:49,159 --> 02:12:53,329
just get it super ridiculous cherried

3003
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:54,829
and then just drop globs of hash on to

3004
02:12:53,329 --> 02:12:57,590
it and then try to smoke as much of that

3005
02:12:54,829 --> 02:13:05,229
as we could I would make us choke so

3006
02:12:57,590 --> 02:13:08,180
hard but we would get highest in the day

3007
02:13:05,229 --> 02:13:09,859
the swingarm skillets where we have them

3008
02:13:08,180 --> 02:13:11,960
glowing like the Sun and then throw a

3009
02:13:09,859 --> 02:13:14,179
quarter gram dab down because we didn't

3010
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:17,248
know anything about what we were doing

3011
02:13:14,180 --> 02:13:17,249
[Music]

3012
02:13:20,750 --> 02:13:25,069
[Music]

3013
02:13:22,180 --> 02:13:26,000
one day we're dabbing and he heated the

3014
02:13:25,069 --> 02:13:27,859
banger and I don't know what he was

3015
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:30,260
thinking he grabbed a phat dab and like

3016
02:13:27,859 --> 02:13:32,000
just hits the banger sets the torch down

3017
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:33,920
and just puts the dab on the nail

3018
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,659
usually you got a way to fit at least a

3019
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:37,250
few seconds a lot of these new kids are

3020
02:13:35,659 --> 02:13:43,430
setting a [ __ ] timer they got a

3021
02:13:37,250 --> 02:13:45,770
little [ __ ] hourglass right in he

3022
02:13:43,430 --> 02:13:47,420
just goes in and I was probably 15 feet

3023
02:13:45,770 --> 02:13:50,150
away from him sitting in another chair

3024
02:13:47,420 --> 02:13:54,409
and I can hear the dab scream the dab

3025
02:13:50,149 --> 02:13:56,000
way and we could all hear from across

3026
02:13:54,409 --> 02:13:57,590
the room and that dude turned a purple

3027
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:59,600
and red tons of different colors and

3028
02:13:57,590 --> 02:14:01,220
coughed forever that poor dude took the

3029
02:13:59,600 --> 02:14:04,640
hottest dad ever and I'll never forget

3030
02:14:01,220 --> 02:14:07,550
it she was terrible glowy glowy

3031
02:14:04,640 --> 02:14:09,410
the first generation of dab kids have

3032
02:14:07,550 --> 02:14:12,380
some of the best little burn and brand

3033
02:14:09,409 --> 02:14:15,710
marks where's your where's your dab

3034
02:14:12,380 --> 02:14:17,930
wound I've got to drip wounds on one of

3035
02:14:15,710 --> 02:14:19,310
my legs from the skillet days that you

3036
02:14:17,930 --> 02:14:21,200
can't really tell what they're like

3037
02:14:19,310 --> 02:14:22,850
their dad related unless you could

3038
02:14:21,199 --> 02:14:26,269
explained and then the straight makes

3039
02:14:22,850 --> 02:14:28,340
sense but I remember seeing kids like

3040
02:14:26,270 --> 02:14:29,090
when domeless nails first started being

3041
02:14:28,340 --> 02:14:31,159
notched

3042
02:14:29,090 --> 02:14:36,110
little bit sort of like castle towers

3043
02:14:31,158 --> 02:14:37,698
yeah I was in like Walmart or some [ __ ]

3044
02:14:36,109 --> 02:14:40,309
and a kid reached out with some money

3045
02:14:37,698 --> 02:14:42,348
and I saw this forearm that he had that

3046
02:14:40,310 --> 02:14:45,920
brand mark on his wrist and I was just

3047
02:14:42,349 --> 02:14:47,569
too [ __ ] busted up laughing I saw a

3048
02:14:45,920 --> 02:14:50,750
whole bunch of the circular dome with

3049
02:14:47,569 --> 02:14:52,819
snail burns yeah um back in the dome

3050
02:14:50,750 --> 02:14:54,560
days people had all sorts of crazy drip

3051
02:14:52,819 --> 02:14:57,710
burns you guys don't let your friends

3052
02:14:54,560 --> 02:14:59,270
try to carb the dab rig just don't pull

3053
02:14:57,710 --> 02:15:01,069
that hot nail it's hot you just heated

3054
02:14:59,270 --> 02:15:02,659
it with the torch don't carve it just

3055
02:15:01,069 --> 02:15:03,948
smoke it's not it's not a bond you're

3056
02:15:02,658 --> 02:15:05,598
not smoking pot it's not gonna burn

3057
02:15:03,948 --> 02:15:07,279
you're not gonna carve it if you just

3058
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:09,440
smoke it'll quit smoking when it's done

3059
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:11,389
just do it you'll be cool a friend of

3060
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:13,098
mine he was being handed a rig and the

3061
02:15:11,389 --> 02:15:15,618
person almost dropped it and he reached

3062
02:15:13,099 --> 02:15:17,929
out reflexively and grabbed it in the

3063
02:15:15,618 --> 02:15:19,908
heat sinks in the top of the nail wind

3064
02:15:17,929 --> 02:15:23,060
up in between his thumb and forefinger

3065
02:15:19,908 --> 02:15:27,259
and the brand right there looks like

3066
02:15:23,060 --> 02:15:29,659
half space-alien he just because of the

3067
02:15:27,260 --> 02:15:31,219
the way the bowl pressed into his hand

3068
02:15:29,658 --> 02:15:34,039
and then the heat sinks below it the

3069
02:15:31,219 --> 02:15:38,050
little metal stripes sounds terrible no

3070
02:15:34,039 --> 02:15:38,050
was hideous but now the brand looks cool

3071
02:15:39,849 --> 02:15:49,969
yeah alright let's good to go back to a

3072
02:15:43,099 --> 02:15:51,739
positive note guys the new thing is to

3073
02:15:49,969 --> 02:15:54,500
take some good chatter or some good hash

3074
02:15:51,738 --> 02:15:58,189
of any kind and then dunk it into fresh

3075
02:15:54,500 --> 02:16:00,859
terpenes either from blue words are hard

3076
02:15:58,189 --> 02:16:02,809
at the end of the show or of course our

3077
02:16:00,859 --> 02:16:04,368
friends at Evo labs that is the thing I

3078
02:16:02,810 --> 02:16:06,560
think Duncan the dads in Terps kind of

3079
02:16:04,368 --> 02:16:08,779
pushes it to a whole new level the ghost

3080
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:11,659
train haze dabs make my eyes vibrate and

3081
02:16:08,779 --> 02:16:13,069
lemon g dabs I make my head spin a

3082
02:16:11,658 --> 02:16:14,388
little bit and the OG Kush tabs just

3083
02:16:13,069 --> 02:16:16,819
make me want to lay down and chill the

3084
02:16:14,389 --> 02:16:18,560
[ __ ] out the Terps the chirps so these

3085
02:16:16,819 --> 02:16:19,488

3206

granny with Bret from Evo labs and of

3208
02:26:50,219 --> 02:26:54,929
course our friend Lindsay the traveling

3209
02:26:51,930 --> 02:26:56,790
stoner this evening I pulled out my zoom

3210
02:26:54,930 --> 02:26:59,068
h6 I took out my trusty memory Carter

3211
02:26:56,790 --> 02:27:00,960
through it my MacBook and the files are

3212
02:26:59,068 --> 02:27:02,579
all there I can grab the files and I can

3213
02:27:00,959 --> 02:27:05,158
move them to my macbook but for some

3214
02:27:02,579 --> 02:27:06,420
reason none of that [ __ ] is playable so

3215
02:27:05,158 --> 02:27:08,398
none of the material that I recorded

3216
02:27:06,420 --> 02:27:11,100
with Gavin granny will be aired on this

3217
02:27:08,398 --> 02:27:13,408
podcast unless one of my tech-savvy

3218
02:27:11,100 --> 02:27:15,329
friends is able to get this SD card and

3219
02:27:13,408 --> 02:27:17,158
pull this information off of there in a

3220
02:27:15,329 --> 02:27:18,719
usable format because so far I'm [ __ ]

3221
02:27:17,158 --> 02:27:20,100
I tried for about an hour all I did was

3222
02:27:18,719 --> 02:27:22,398
frustrate myself I was not able to get

3223
02:27:20,100 --> 02:27:22,399
it going

3224
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:28,109
grannie podcast that I recorded is lost

3225
02:27:26,010 --> 02:27:30,148
it's available on her Facebook we did a

3226
02:27:28,109 --> 02:27:31,649
Facebook live video of it but I think

3227
02:27:30,148 --> 02:27:34,198
that's the only way you're going to hear

3228
02:27:31,648 --> 02:27:37,198
or see any of that episode granny I

3229
02:27:34,199 --> 02:27:38,790
apologize technology [ __ ] me I don't

3230
02:27:37,199 --> 02:27:41,760
know what else to say Brett I apologize

3231
02:27:38,790 --> 02:27:44,399
Lindsey I apologize the bad news is the

3232
02:27:41,760 --> 02:27:46,500
podcast is lost and gone for [ __ ]

3233
02:27:44,398 --> 02:27:48,869
ever technology aided Technology kicked

3234
02:27:46,500 --> 02:27:52,379
my ass you can't win every time the good

3235
02:27:48,870 --> 02:27:53,939
news however is that Davin granny's got

3236
02:27:52,379 --> 02:27:55,528
to come back to the show and Brett's got

3237
02:27:53,939 --> 02:27:57,270
to come back and Lindsey has to come

3238
02:27:55,529 --> 02:27:59,220
back and we have to do another podcast I

3239
02:27:57,270 --> 02:28:00,988
think I want to do a podcast was granny

3240
02:27:59,219 --> 02:28:02,549
by herself and with Brett by himself and

3241
02:28:00,988 --> 02:28:03,869
then a podcast with the group together I

3242
02:28:02,549 --> 02:28:05,459
think granny should be on the podcast

3243
02:28:03,870 --> 02:28:08,250
kind of frequently because she has a lot

3244
02:28:05,459 --> 02:28:09,000
of great [ __ ] to say so I actually think

3245
02:28:08,250 --> 02:28:10,590
Randy needed

3246
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:12,059
oh [ __ ] so much to say I encouraged her

3247
02:28:10,590 --> 02:28:13,829
to start her own podcast was something

3248
02:28:12,059 --> 02:28:15,478
that actually said when she was here so

3249
02:28:13,829 --> 02:28:16,829
I apologize you guys I advertise that

3250
02:28:15,478 --> 02:28:18,719
like we're gonna have an amazing episode

3251
02:28:16,829 --> 02:28:20,309

3252
02:28:18,719 --> 02:28:22,858
episode that you expected but I'm going

3253
02:28:20,309 --> 02:28:24,478
to do my best to make it amazing so

3254
02:28:22,859 --> 02:28:26,189

02:28:27,568 --> 02:28:31,439
at the candy cane and we smoked so much

3258
02:28:29,219 --> 02:28:33,679

3259
02:28:31,439 --> 02:28:36,600
friends stop by pop tea and chosen one

3260
02:28:33,680 --> 02:28:40,260
pop deep glass art and chosen one glass

3261
02:28:36,600 --> 02:28:42,359
art showed up this took some dabs for a

3262
02:28:40,260 --> 02:28:43,859
little while so everybody that tried to

3263
02:28:42,359 --> 02:28:44,939
make that podcast happen I'm gonna move

3264
02:28:43,859 --> 02:28:48,390
forward and quit talking about that

3265
02:28:44,939 --> 02:28:50,190
let's talk about some positive things

3266
02:28:48,389 --> 02:28:52,469
more positive stuff you guys the other

3267
02:28:50,190 --> 02:28:54,600
night I got to see Joey Coco Diaz it

3268
02:28:52,469 --> 02:28:55,920

02:28:57,989 --> 02:29:02,549
works in downtown Denver I think that

3272
02:28:59,579 --> 02:29:05,159
Comedy Works downtown is probably the

3273
02:29:02,549 --> 02:29:07,469
best comedy club on the planet if it's

3274
02:29:05,159 --> 02:29:09,450
the second it's the second best to the

3275
02:29:07,469 --> 02:29:11,699
comedy store in Los Angeles California

3276
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:14,159
other than that Comedy Works is the best

3277
02:29:11,700 --> 02:29:16,050
comedy club in the world now since I'm

3278
02:29:14,159 --> 02:29:18,930

3279

Joey Coco Diez that is one of my that

3280
02:29:18,930 --> 02:29:20,880

3281
02:29:20,521 --> 02:29:23,250

3282
02:29:20,879 --> 02:29:24,719

3283
02:29:23,250 --> 02:29:26,549
Works hey guys Joey Diaz walked out on

3284
02:29:24,719 --> 02:29:27,929
stage and he grabbed the mic now before

3285
02:29:26,549 --> 02:29:28,920
he could get to the mic he got a

3286
02:29:27,930 --> 02:29:32,340
standing ovation

3287
02:29:28,920 --> 02:29:34,350
Joey walked out to a standing ovation he

3288
02:29:32,340 --> 02:29:36,271
grabbed the mic and he said what up you

3289
02:29:34,350 --> 02:29:37,710
bad [ __ ] and that's just the

3290
02:29:36,271 --> 02:29:39,090
way Joey starts the show and I knew it

3291
02:29:37,709 --> 02:29:40,619
was gonna be a party from then he had

3292
02:29:39,090 --> 02:29:43,260
this little strut in his stride the

3293
02:29:40,620 --> 02:29:44,610
whole time Joey was killing it the show

3294
02:29:43,260 --> 02:29:46,110
was hosted by a comedian whose name I

3295
02:29:44,610 --> 02:29:46,800
cannot recall he was a new guy he's got

3296
02:29:46,110 --> 02:29:49,319
some dreadlocks

3297

he's a very entertaining dude there's a

3298
02:29:49,319 --> 02:29:53,399
another comedian whose name I cannot

3299
02:29:51,180 --> 02:29:54,630
remember who was the opening act then

3300
02:29:53,399 --> 02:29:55,889
there was a feature act whose name was

3301
02:29:54,629 --> 02:29:57,509
Rick who I've seen several times he's

3302
02:29:55,889 --> 02:29:59,039
pretty good he did see everyone trying

3303
02:29:57,510 --> 02:30:00,989
to do a bunch of weed jokes in Colorado

3304
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:02,880

3312
02:30:14,729 --> 02:30:18,000
the pros that's for the noobs we've

3313
02:30:15,930 --> 02:30:19,860
heard all the weed jokes so the opening

3314
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:21,360
actually but both all three did a couple

3315
02:30:19,860 --> 02:30:22,829
of weed jokes that hosted a couple we'd

3316
02:30:21,360 --> 02:30:24,600
joke to joey barely talked about weed

3317
02:30:22,829 --> 02:30:26,879

3318
02:30:24,600 --> 02:30:29,010
eats more edibles than you and Joey

3319
02:30:26,879 --> 02:30:30,750
still is able to go onstage and put out

3320
02:30:29,010 --> 02:30:32,850
an amazing [ __ ] comedy show Joey had

3321
02:30:30,750 --> 02:30:34,500
me laughing Joey Coco Diaz you guys he's

3322
02:30:32,850 --> 02:30:35,909
the host of a podcast called the Church

3323
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:38,340
of what's happening now he was in a

3324
02:30:35,909 --> 02:30:39,989
movie called The Longest Yard he's an

3325
02:30:38,340 --> 02:30:41,280
amazing comedian he's Joe Rogan's

3326
02:30:39,989 --> 02:30:41,699
favorite comedian if that tells you

3327
02:30:41,280 --> 02:30:44,489
anything

3328
02:30:41,700 --> 02:30:46,290
he had me laughing so hard that the

3329
02:30:44,489 --> 02:30:48,209
sides of my stomach and ribs were

3330
02:30:46,290 --> 02:30:50,580
hurting my back was hurting in a weird

3331
02:30:48,209 --> 02:30:51,779
way my cheeks hurt there's a little spot

3332
02:30:50,579 --> 02:30:53,969
like right behind where my sun glasses

3333
02:30:51,780 --> 02:30:55,470
would rest on my head that [ __ ] hurt it

3334
02:30:53,969 --> 02:30:57,779
felt like tumors squeezing my head nose

3335
02:30:55,469 --> 02:30:59,039
from laughing so hard and then I told my

3336
02:30:57,780 --> 02:30:59,880
buddy I was like I'm laughing so hard I

3337
02:30:59,040 --> 02:31:01,811
think I'm gonna cry

3338
02:30:59,879 --> 02:31:03,010
and I think Joey might have heard me

3339
02:31:01,810 --> 02:31:04,090
because when he heard I was gonna when

3340
02:31:03,011 --> 02:31:05,649
he heard that I was gonna cry think he

3341
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:07,360

that night let's talk about other

3364
02:31:47,470 --> 02:31:51,459
positive things that happened in my life

3365
02:31:48,940 --> 02:31:52,630
last night you guys I got to see one of

3366
02:31:51,459 --> 02:31:54,879
my favorite bands

3367
02:31:52,629 --> 02:31:57,489
Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem band

3368
02:31:54,879 --> 02:31:59,619
they were in my hometown of Pueblo

3369
02:31:57,489 --> 02:32:02,079
Colorado they were ten minutes away from

3370
02:31:59,620 --> 02:32:03,851
my house at the Bruges Ale House all I

3371
02:32:02,079 --> 02:32:06,489
do is drive over there find parking

3372
02:32:03,851 --> 02:32:08,710
March on in and get my reggae on it was

3373
02:32:06,489 --> 02:32:10,539
local it was amazing I shot it to the

3374
02:32:08,709 --> 02:32:14,379
Bruges Ale House that club is great it's

3375
02:32:10,540 --> 02:32:16,540
probably the best venue in Pueblo right

3376
02:32:14,379 --> 02:32:17,890
now there are a couple theaters they

3377
02:32:16,540 --> 02:32:19,660
compete but I'm gonna give that place

3378
02:32:17,890 --> 02:32:21,190
the number one venue for the vibe I

3379
02:32:19,659 --> 02:32:22,511
think in a back door that rolls up

3380
02:32:21,190 --> 02:32:24,790
you're right on the Riverwalk you can

3381
02:32:22,511 --> 02:32:26,530
see the river right behind you the sound

3382
02:32:24,790 --> 02:32:29,230
is good in there the vibe is good it was

3383
02:32:26,530 --> 02:32:32,891
a great place the band oh my goodness

3384
02:32:29,229 --> 02:32:34,270
Joseph Israel and the band tour because

3385
02:32:32,890 --> 02:32:35,529
I've been seeing Joseph Israel for

3386
02:32:34,271 --> 02:32:38,170
probably I've been watching his band for

3387
02:32:35,530 --> 02:32:40,239
probably ten years this was I've seen

3388
02:32:38,170 --> 02:32:42,700
several of their shows I've seen this

3389
02:32:40,239 --> 02:32:44,771
band progress and come a long long way

3390
02:32:42,700 --> 02:32:46,420
and last night's show is the best show

3391
02:32:44,771 --> 02:32:48,159
that I've ever seen them do it was the

3392
02:32:46,420 --> 02:32:49,569
second to last show on their tour and

3393
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:51,159
you could tell that they just played

3394
02:32:49,569 --> 02:32:52,090
until they were done tonight's show

3395
02:32:51,159 --> 02:32:53,649
they're not gonna have a lot of energy

3396
02:32:52,090 --> 02:32:55,090
cuz they wore themselves out last night

3397
02:32:53,649 --> 02:32:57,729
whoever sees him tonight I'm sorry I

3398
02:32:55,090 --> 02:32:59,200
drained all their energy my favorite

3399
02:32:57,729 --> 02:33:00,789
album from Joseph Israel is an album

3400
02:32:59,200 --> 02:33:03,550
called gone are the days I think it was

3401
02:33:00,790 --> 02:33:05,080
his original release they played there

3402
02:33:03,549 --> 02:33:06,640
probably 15 songs on there I think a

3403
02:33:05,079 --> 02:33:08,021
couple of more like dub remixes so

3404
02:33:06,640 --> 02:33:09,369
there's like probably 10 songs on there

3405
02:33:08,021 --> 02:33:11,500
they must have played seven or eight of

3406
02:33:09,370 --> 02:33:12,910
them and they played all my favorites

3407
02:33:11,500 --> 02:33:14,530
now I could yell out a song and they

3408
02:33:12,909 --> 02:33:15,640
would play it for me they weren't gonna

3409
02:33:14,530 --> 02:33:17,230
play a song called

3410
02:33:15,640 --> 02:33:18,550
the truth is one of my favorites and

3411
02:33:17,229 --> 02:33:19,810
there was a break you know when the

3412
02:33:18,550 --> 02:33:21,220
musicians are like tuning their guitars

3413
02:33:19,810 --> 02:33:23,829
they're all talk and I've taken a drink

3414
02:33:21,220 --> 02:33:25,180
I yelled out truth and I was like right

3415
02:33:23,829 --> 02:33:27,579
in the front row so Joseph looked at me

3416
02:33:25,181 --> 02:33:28,659
like oh yeah and they talked about it

3417
02:33:27,579 --> 02:33:30,341
for a minute and they said we haven't

3418
02:33:28,659 --> 02:33:31,959
played this we don't practice this we

3419
02:33:30,341 --> 02:33:34,329
haven't played this since we recorded

3420
02:33:31,959 --> 02:33:36,010
the gone are the days album and they

3421
02:33:34,329 --> 02:33:37,060
started singing the chorus they just

3422
02:33:36,011 --> 02:33:39,130
started doing like a really cool

3423
02:33:37,060 --> 02:33:42,011
acapella harmony version of the chorus

3424
02:33:39,129 --> 02:33:43,209
and then once that chorus ended the

3425
02:33:42,011 --> 02:33:45,940
guitar player started playing the guitar

3426
02:33:43,209 --> 02:33:48,279
lick and they played the song truth for

3427
02:33:45,940 --> 02:33:49,390
me it wasn't tight and it wasn't perfect

3428
02:33:48,280 --> 02:33:51,311
but you know what it was beautiful that

3429
02:33:49,390 --> 02:33:54,220
my friends tried to play that song for

3430
02:33:51,310 --> 02:33:55,989
me so much love - Joseph Israel and the

3431
02:33:54,220 --> 02:33:58,000
Jerusalem band and the entire crew at

3432
02:33:55,989 --> 02:33:59,829
Bru's Ale House and an amazing time I

3433
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:02,440
get to smoke after the show with a

3434
02:33:59,829 --> 02:34:04,959
couple of the guys something I should

3435
02:34:02,440 --> 02:34:06,610
mention I have been a huge fan of a bass

3436
02:34:04,959 --> 02:34:08,890
player by the name of Chris

3437
02:34:06,610 --> 02:34:10,360
Meredith he plays with Joseph Israel in

3438
02:34:08,890 --> 02:34:12,520
the Jerusalem band but he's also known

3439
02:34:10,360 --> 02:34:14,141
as a recording artist in Jamaica and

3440
02:34:12,521 --> 02:34:16,450
he's also well known for playing with

3441
02:34:14,140 --> 02:34:18,431
Stephen Marley I walked into the

3442
02:34:16,450 --> 02:34:20,200
building and Chris Meredith was just

3443
02:34:18,431 --> 02:34:22,030
standing there talking to Joseph Israel

3444
02:34:20,200 --> 02:34:24,011
and I realized he was gonna be the blade

3445
02:34:22,030 --> 02:34:25,780
bass player for the show that night that

3446
02:34:24,011 --> 02:34:27,761
put a huge smile on my face because he

3447
02:34:25,780 --> 02:34:29,141
recorded Joseph's album with him he went

3448
02:34:27,761 --> 02:34:30,431
on tour for the first tour and then he

3449
02:34:29,140 --> 02:34:32,079
had to go back to Jamaica and he took

3450
02:34:30,431 --> 02:34:33,909
off for a little while so we didn't see

3451
02:34:32,079 --> 02:34:35,530
him on tour with Joseph it was great to

3452
02:34:33,909 --> 02:34:37,091

02:35:27,521 --> 02:35:30,931
week long enough

3484
02:35:28,771 --> 02:35:32,880
let's talk about Gro knowledge a few

3485
02:35:30,931 --> 02:35:34,590
episodes back I was asked how to handle

3486
02:35:32,879 --> 02:35:36,479
grasshoppers and what I've noticed is

3487
02:35:34,590 --> 02:35:38,310
everybody is getting bombarded with

3488
02:35:36,479 --> 02:35:40,049
grasshoppers and their outdoor cannabis

3489
02:35:38,310 --> 02:35:41,640
grow this year the number one way that

3490
02:35:40,049 --> 02:35:43,500
you can get rid of your grasshoppers is

3491
02:35:41,640 --> 02:35:44,940
just to clean up if you can mow all the

3492
02:35:43,500 --> 02:35:46,500
grass mow all the weeds get rid of

3493
02:35:44,940 --> 02:35:47,579
anywhere for them to live get rid of all

3494
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:49,290
the stuff for them to eat the

3495
02:35:47,579 --> 02:35:51,090
grasshoppers won't want to come around I

3496
02:35:49,290 --> 02:35:53,400
understand that your neighbors probably

3497
02:35:51,090 --> 02:35:54,780
have a big-ass pile of grass and leaves

3498
02:35:53,399 --> 02:35:56,369
and [ __ ] in their yard that you cannot

3499
02:35:54,780 --> 02:35:57,480
do anything about it's illegal to go

3500
02:35:56,370 --> 02:35:59,730
over there with the torch and just burn

3501
02:35:57,479 --> 02:36:01,379
that [ __ ] down so if you're having

3502
02:35:59,729 --> 02:36:04,229
problems with grasshoppers somebody

3503
02:36:01,379 --> 02:36:06,750
recommended to me garlic and fermented

3504
02:36:04,229 --> 02:36:08,279
garlic sprays to help keep grasshoppers

3505
02:36:06,750 --> 02:36:10,500
and other pests away I assumed that this

3506
02:36:08,280 --> 02:36:12,181
would work on most insects and most

3507
02:36:10,500 --> 02:36:15,181
living creatures if you ferment some

3508
02:36:12,181 --> 02:36:17,340
garlic or mush garlic up into a spray

3509
02:36:15,181 --> 02:36:18,569
and spray that around your plants on and

3510
02:36:17,340 --> 02:36:20,640
or around your plants and on the

3511
02:36:18,569 --> 02:36:21,989
perimeter of your plants most bugs are

3512
02:36:20,640 --> 02:36:23,220
going to stay away from that and

3513
02:36:21,989 --> 02:36:24,659
definitely you will not have any

3514
02:36:23,220 --> 02:36:26,579
vampires so if you're worried about

3515
02:36:24,659 --> 02:36:28,500
vampires in the garden you could double

3516
02:36:26,579 --> 02:36:30,420
up on the garlic spray you'll be just

3517
02:36:28,500 --> 02:36:32,129
fine so shout it to the person that told

3518
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:33,960
me about fermented garlic sprays and

3519
02:36:32,129 --> 02:36:35,009
using them in my garden to keep away

3520
02:36:33,959 --> 02:36:36,959
grasshoppers

3521
02:36:35,010 --> 02:36:38,729
outdoors because I don't grow outdoors

3522
02:36:36,959 --> 02:36:40,199
myself very much but a lot of our

3523
02:36:38,729 --> 02:36:42,180
friends do and I think you know the next

3524
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:43,440
episode may feature our buddy Jesse and

3525
02:36:42,181 --> 02:36:44,579
we're gonna talk about some outdoor

3526
02:36:43,440 --> 02:36:45,721
stuff shout out to Jesse if you're

3527
02:36:44,579 --> 02:36:46,979
listening to this call me dude let's

3528
02:36:45,720 --> 02:36:48,600
plan this episode so we can get it

3529
02:36:46,979 --> 02:36:50,459
recorded well record it at my house

3530
02:36:48,601 --> 02:36:51,989
we'll use my computer we won't use the

3531
02:36:50,459 --> 02:36:53,970
zoom h6 because I'm paranoid too that

3532
02:36:51,989 --> 02:36:55,681
thing looks red it's gonna break and not

3533
02:36:53,970 --> 02:36:59,220
record the damn show again so probably

3534
02:36:55,681 --> 02:37:00,721
won't do that grasshoppers yes emails

3535
02:36:59,220 --> 02:37:02,039
I've got some emails here at my phone

3536
02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:04,199
people have asked some questions you

3537
02:37:02,040 --> 02:37:05,340
guys asked great questions I want to

3540
02:37:07,079 --> 02:37:10,620
the questions over time on the air I'm a

3541
02:37:09,510 --> 02:37:12,750
little bit backed up something after

3542
02:37:10,620 --> 02:37:15,360

3543
02:37:12,750 --> 02:37:16,979

questions on the show been loving the

3548
02:37:23,399 --> 02:37:27,869
show helps me get through my day at a

3549
02:37:25,470 --> 02:37:30,209
mind-numbing job with robots you work

3550
02:37:27,870 --> 02:37:31,740
with robots or just like people who are

3551
02:37:30,209 --> 02:37:33,449
unaware at people who are programmed to

3552
02:37:31,739 --> 02:37:35,310
act like robots I'm curious no he said

3553
02:37:33,450 --> 02:37:37,590
questions for the show when you flip to

3554
02:37:35,310 --> 02:37:39,899
twelve twelve or eleven thirteen DJ

3555
02:37:37,590 --> 02:37:42,478
short style how long till you want to go

3556
02:37:39,899 --> 02:37:45,389
from metal-halide to HPS

3557
02:37:42,478 --> 02:37:48,358
I want to talk about this 12 12 or 11 13

3558
02:37:45,389 --> 02:37:50,398
DJ short style thing but Mazar 420 is

3559
02:37:48,359 --> 02:37:52,920
asking is when I change my light cycle

3560
02:37:50,398 --> 02:37:56,549
from my vegetative stage either 24 hours

3561
02:37:52,920 --> 02:37:58,379
on or an 18-6 cycle or maybe a 16-8

3562
02:37:56,549 --> 02:38:00,209
depends on where you are when I change

3563
02:37:58,379 --> 02:38:03,809
my light cycle to my flowering phase

3564
02:38:00,209 --> 02:38:06,148
which would normally be 12 12 or he says

3565
02:38:03,809 --> 02:38:07,049
the 11 13 DJ short style let me talk

3566
02:38:06,148 --> 02:38:09,719
about that for a minute

3567
02:38:07,049 --> 02:38:12,209
DJ short is a well-known breeder he's a

3568
02:38:09,719 --> 02:38:14,038
great speaker he's an author is well

3569
02:38:12,209 --> 02:38:14,818
educated and very passionate about the

3570
02:38:14,039 --> 02:38:17,248
cannabis plant

3571
02:38:14,818 --> 02:38:19,379
DJ short breeds amazing strains he is

3572
02:38:17,248 --> 02:38:21,328
known for the blueberry DJ shortbread

3573
02:38:19,379 --> 02:38:22,978
the flow so there's something in DJ

3574
02:38:21,328 --> 02:38:26,189
shirts catalog that you have smoke that

3575
02:38:22,978 --> 02:38:28,618
you have enjoyed they came from all DJ

3576
02:38:26,189 --> 02:38:30,898
now DJ does a trick when he's flowering

3577
02:38:28,619 --> 02:38:34,979
his plants he does not run them for 12

3578
02:38:30,898 --> 02:38:37,010
on 12 off he does 11 hours on and 13

3579
02:38:34,978 --> 02:38:40,420
hours off

3580
02:38:37,010 --> 02:38:43,760
his theory on this is that you will see

3581
02:38:40,420 --> 02:38:45,950
broader variants in Fino typical

3582
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:47,300
expression from your plants so if you're

3583
02:38:45,950 --> 02:38:49,579
a breeder and you're looking for

3584
02:38:47,299 --> 02:38:51,590
phenotypes this extra hour really lets

3585
02:38:49,579 --> 02:38:53,389
the plants express themselves and show

3586
02:38:51,590 --> 02:38:55,609
the variation and show their potential

3587
02:38:53,389 --> 02:38:58,219
it also will save you one hour of

3588
02:38:55,609 --> 02:39:01,520
electricity over a sixty-five day cycle

3589
02:38:58,219 --> 02:39:03,289
which is gonna be 65 hours kilowatt

3590
02:39:01,520 --> 02:39:05,000
hours that you're not spending on your

3591
02:39:03,290 --> 02:39:06,800
lights it's also gonna be an hour

3592
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,529
resting off of your air conditioning

3593
02:39:06,799 --> 02:39:11,659
it's also going to some people think it

3594
02:39:09,529 --> 02:39:13,520
increases their yield I tried it I

3595
02:39:11,659 --> 02:39:15,619
didn't like what it did to some of my

3596
02:39:13,520 --> 02:39:17,810
plants I did like what it did this some

3597
02:39:15,620 --> 02:39:20,240
of my plants so it's very plant specific

3598
02:39:17,809 --> 02:39:22,189
it's Stream specific it may be phenotype

3599
02:39:20,239 --> 02:39:24,228
specific I have not experimented enough

3600
02:39:22,189 --> 02:39:26,239
to know but a lot of people in the

3601
02:39:24,228 --> 02:39:27,769
community are switching to the 1113

3602
02:39:26,239 --> 02:39:29,568
method it saves money

3603
02:39:27,770 --> 02:39:31,640
it saves time and if you've got the

3604
02:39:29,568 --> 02:39:33,199
right varietals it will work for you one

3605
02:39:31,639 --> 02:39:34,579
thing I've noticed some of my heavier

3606
02:39:33,200 --> 02:39:36,350
sativas didn't like it in the beginning

3607
02:39:34,579 --> 02:39:38,539
it took them a while to get used to it I

3608
02:39:36,350 --> 02:39:40,399
liked my sativas on twelve twelve and

3609
02:39:38,540 --> 02:39:41,689
then toward the end of the phase that's

3610
02:39:40,398 --> 02:39:43,340
when I would start dropping down the

3611
02:39:41,689 --> 02:39:45,770
timers they didn't seem to really like

3612
02:39:43,340 --> 02:39:48,380
it when I went 13 hours of darkness

3613
02:39:45,770 --> 02:39:51,229
right away so that catches us up to

3614
02:39:48,379 --> 02:39:53,299
speed on the DJ Shore 11:13 method now

3615
02:39:51,228 --> 02:39:55,519
he says how long once you do this flip

3616
02:39:53,299 --> 02:39:57,228
do you want to go from metal halide to

3617
02:39:55,520 --> 02:40:00,170
HPS that's his first part of his

3618
02:39:57,228 --> 02:40:02,179
question generally I let it go 10 to 14

3619
02:40:00,170 --> 02:40:03,950
days rocking the metal halide when I see

3620
02:40:02,180 --> 02:40:05,180
the bud starting to form when I see

3621
02:40:03,950 --> 02:40:06,590
those little pre buds and the pre

3622
02:40:05,180 --> 02:40:08,148
flowers just starting to pop up they're

3623
02:40:06,590 --> 02:40:09,889
getting a little dandelions that's

3624
02:40:08,148 --> 02:40:13,579
usually when I switch in that bowl if

3625
02:40:09,889 --> 02:40:15,139
you if you really want to go crazy do it

3626
02:40:13,579 --> 02:40:17,029
three weeks because I think when you

3627
02:40:15,139 --> 02:40:18,349
flip those plants are gonna stretch for

3628
02:40:17,029 --> 02:40:20,390
about three weeks and keeping that

3629
02:40:18,350 --> 02:40:22,159
halide bulb in there really I think

3630
02:40:20,389 --> 02:40:24,199
helps prevent them from stretching so

3631
02:40:22,159 --> 02:40:26,299
much so keep that halide in there for 10

3632
02:40:24,200 --> 02:40:28,909
to 14 days if you want to go extreme go

3633
02:40:26,299 --> 02:40:30,259
21 days but you may slow down bud

3634
02:40:28,909 --> 02:40:32,239
development at that point I like to

3635
02:40:30,260 --> 02:40:33,469
switch it in there about that 14th day

3636
02:40:32,239 --> 02:40:35,510
because that's what my buds are gonna

3637
02:40:33,469 --> 02:40:37,429
start happening one thing that you can

3638
02:40:35,510 --> 02:40:39,950
utilize that I've done and had great

3639
02:40:37,430 --> 02:40:41,540
success with is mix and match spectrums

3640
02:40:39,950 --> 02:40:44,329
use a little bit of metal halide and use

3641
02:40:41,540 --> 02:40:46,189
a little bit of HBS if you can so I had

3642
02:40:44,329 --> 02:40:47,959
a I've got a reflector it's called the

3643
02:40:46,189 --> 02:40:49,130
Gro Zilla and I haven't used it in a

3644
02:40:47,959 --> 02:40:49,340
long time I should fire it up and do

3645
02:40:49,129 --> 02:40:51,109
some

3646
02:40:49,341 --> 02:40:53,690
experiments with it just for fun but

3647
02:40:51,110 --> 02:40:55,431
this reflector holds two bulbs and they

3648
02:40:53,690 --> 02:40:57,740
say not to put more than a thousand watt

3649
02:40:55,431 --> 02:41:00,021
total in there it may say 1,200 total so

3650
02:40:57,740 --> 02:41:02,511
you could put two 600 bulbs in this one

3651
02:41:00,021 --> 02:41:04,940
reflector what I did I put a 600 watt

3652
02:41:02,511 --> 02:41:06,771
high pressure sodium and a 400 watt

3653
02:41:04,940 --> 02:41:10,551
metal halide in there and hung that bulb

3654
02:41:06,771 --> 02:41:12,501
in a 5x5 hydro Hut and I put nine three

3655
02:41:10,550 --> 02:41:15,229
gallon pots under there and honestly I

3656
02:41:12,501 --> 02:41:17,899
grew some of the most photogenic and

3657
02:41:15,229 --> 02:41:19,820
most aromatic most flavorful and most

3658
02:41:17,899 --> 02:41:22,100
potent cannabis I have ever grown came

3659
02:41:19,820 --> 02:41:23,960
from that 5x5 Hut with that mix spectrum

3660
02:41:22,101 --> 02:41:26,480
light there was some very impressive

3661
02:41:23,960 --> 02:41:29,030
cannabis the only problem was it didn't

3662
02:41:26,479 --> 02:41:30,800
harvest what I wished it would have when

3663
02:41:29,031 --> 02:41:32,391
I heart when I use a thousand watt HBS

3664
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:34,130
in one of those huts with proper ducting

3665
02:41:32,390 --> 02:41:36,261
and venting and air conditioning I can

3666
02:41:34,130 --> 02:41:37,550
pull a pound and a half really close to

3667
02:41:36,261 --> 02:41:38,631
two pounds it's hard to hit two pounds

3668
02:41:37,550 --> 02:41:40,251
in those huts cuz you're really limited

3669
02:41:38,630 --> 02:41:42,081
on height and space so you gotta like

3670
02:41:40,251 --> 02:41:43,581
top him out and pull him out real far

3671
02:41:42,081 --> 02:41:45,470
and train them you can get a pound and a

3672
02:41:43,581 --> 02:41:48,860
half out of one of those huts when I did

3673
02:41:45,470 --> 02:41:51,109
the HPS metal halide combo I got right

3674
02:41:48,860 --> 02:41:53,451
about a pound in a corner so it didn't

3675
02:41:51,110 --> 02:41:54,921
do what I would expect I think that 600

3676
02:41:53,450 --> 02:41:57,439
watt light kind of didn't let it push

3677
02:41:54,921 --> 02:41:59,001
but the flavor and the aroma and the

3678
02:41:57,440 --> 02:42:00,560
potency made up for the lack of weight

3679
02:41:59,001 --> 02:42:01,851
because it was for me I was growing it

3680
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:04,070
from my own head stash so I didn't need

3681
02:42:01,851 --> 02:42:05,301
a whole bunch alright so that's the

3682
02:42:04,070 --> 02:42:08,030
first party question I would do it

3683
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:09,649
somewhere between 14 and 21 days 10 days

3684
02:42:08,031 --> 02:42:11,150
if you're trying to go early 14 days is

3685
02:42:09,649 --> 02:42:12,560
about ideal 21 days if you're really

3686
02:42:11,149 --> 02:42:14,511
trying to keep those plants short

3687
02:42:12,560 --> 02:42:16,640
because that's that halide lamp is gonna

3688
02:42:14,511 --> 02:42:18,740
keep them from stretching on you as part

3689
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:21,649
of why we do that so he also says also

3690
02:42:18,740 --> 02:42:23,120
was wondering how long once under 12 12

3691
02:42:21,649 --> 02:42:24,770
do you wait to switch your nutrients

3692
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:26,899
from veg to bloom

3693
02:42:24,771 --> 02:42:28,311
he also says hope to hear my questions

3694
02:42:26,899 --> 02:42:31,161
get answered on the show sincerely

3695
02:42:28,310 --> 02:42:33,470
master 420 so he's wondering how long

3696
02:42:31,161 --> 02:42:34,701
from the day we switched to 1212 do we

3697
02:42:33,470 --> 02:42:37,490
wait to switch our nutrients from

3698
02:42:34,700 --> 02:42:40,130
vegetable I kind of do a slow transition

3699
02:42:37,490 --> 02:42:43,610
I believe that your plant is going to

3700
02:42:40,130 --> 02:42:46,130
absorb somewhere between 80 and 90% of

3701
02:42:43,610 --> 02:42:47,181
its nitrogen that all that all of its

3702
02:42:46,130 --> 02:42:48,800
going to observe through its whole life

3703
02:42:47,181 --> 02:42:50,301
it's gonna absorb most of that through

3704
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:51,979
the vegetative stage once you hit

3705
02:42:50,300 --> 02:42:53,270
flowering once you get to that second or

3706
02:42:51,979 --> 02:42:55,011
third week of flowering you're not gonna

3707
02:42:53,271 --> 02:42:56,841
use a whole lot of nitrogen just enough

3708
02:42:55,011 --> 02:42:58,881
to keep the leaves green and keep the

3709
02:42:56,841 --> 02:43:01,011
plant moving so nitrogen is gonna kind

3710
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:03,250
of fizzle out so you can switch the

3711
02:43:01,011 --> 02:43:04,899
nutrients right away if you'd like to

3712
02:43:03,250 --> 02:43:08,260
or you can keep those nutrients going

3713
02:43:04,899 --> 02:43:10,449
slowly and taper so if you're if you've

3714
02:43:08,260 --> 02:43:12,550
got grow and you've got bloom maybe go

3715
02:43:10,450 --> 02:43:14,050
seven to ten days with that grow before

3716
02:43:12,549 --> 02:43:16,509
you pull out the grow nutrient and throw

3717
02:43:14,049 --> 02:43:18,219
in the bloom it or you can just switch

3718
02:43:16,510 --> 02:43:21,040
right away it's up to you it kind of

3719
02:43:18,219 --> 02:43:23,889
depends on the strains also Gorilla Glue

3720
02:43:21,040 --> 02:43:25,780
really likes to eat so I kind of stick

3721
02:43:23,889 --> 02:43:27,639
with my veg nutrients for an extra week

3722
02:43:25,780 --> 02:43:30,070
or two with the Gorilla Glue

3723
02:43:27,639 --> 02:43:31,809
things like flow-flow doesn't require a

3724
02:43:30,069 --> 02:43:33,940
lot of food flow will just grow like a

3725
02:43:31,809 --> 02:43:36,399
son-of-a-bitch so I'll switch flow right

3726
02:43:33,940 --> 02:43:37,989
away when I go 12:12 that day they get

3727
02:43:36,399 --> 02:43:39,729
fed their bloom nutrients they start

3728
02:43:37,989 --> 02:43:42,119
getting but basically your first day of

3729
02:43:39,729 --> 02:43:45,609
bloom nutrients aren't very far off from

3730
02:43:42,120 --> 02:43:46,780
your last week of veg nutrients so it

3731
02:43:45,610 --> 02:43:49,090
shouldn't be too abrupt of a switch

3732
02:43:46,780 --> 02:43:51,760
either way but somewhere between that

3733
02:43:49,090 --> 02:43:53,139
first day and about seven to ten days in

3734
02:43:51,760 --> 02:43:54,700
is when I will totally have switched

3735
02:43:53,139 --> 02:43:56,019
from vegetable nutrients it kind of

3736
02:43:54,700 --> 02:43:58,030
depends on the plant it kind of depends

3737
02:43:56,020 --> 02:43:59,710
on what I'm doing it kind of kind of

3738
02:43:58,030 --> 02:44:01,870
depends on the room the stream the brand

3739
02:43:59,709 --> 02:44:04,539
of nutrients if I'm using botanic your

3740
02:44:01,870 --> 02:44:06,310
bottled newts my switch from my veg

3741
02:44:04,540 --> 02:44:08,620
stage to my flower phase like I said is

3742
02:44:06,309 --> 02:44:10,600
not very different it's a base nutrient

3743
02:44:08,620 --> 02:44:12,400
it's cal-mag liquid karma and maybe a

3744
02:44:10,600 --> 02:44:14,110
little bit of what else am I using in

3745
02:44:12,399 --> 02:44:16,029
there potassium silicates and there

3746
02:44:14,110 --> 02:44:17,409
wouldn't be a whole lot else oh there's

3747
02:44:16,030 --> 02:44:18,460
a dog resting on my feet and I just move

3748
02:44:17,409 --> 02:44:19,750
my foot kick from right in the head I'm

3749
02:44:18,459 --> 02:44:21,579
sorry puppy I didn't mean to do that boy

3750
02:44:19,750 --> 02:44:23,379
I'm sorry I apologize big shout out to

3751
02:44:21,579 --> 02:44:24,520
make the dog you guys make the dogs been

3752
02:44:23,379 --> 02:44:26,049
hanging out with me for a couple days a

3753
02:44:24,520 --> 02:44:28,180
cool ass dog you guys would like him

3754
02:44:26,049 --> 02:44:30,039
sorry I just kicked your head boy I feel

3755
02:44:28,180 --> 02:44:31,389
bad everyone on the show hears me

3756
02:44:30,040 --> 02:44:34,180
apologizing I won't do it again buddy

3757
02:44:31,389 --> 02:44:36,219
I'll pet you so yeah my veggie newts

3758
02:44:34,180 --> 02:44:38,530
there'll be some what did I say base

3759
02:44:36,219 --> 02:44:40,449
nutrients which would be the botanic air

3760
02:44:38,530 --> 02:44:41,920
pure blend Pro grow and then you've got

3761
02:44:40,450 --> 02:44:43,000
some cal-mag in there maybe a little bit

3762
02:44:41,920 --> 02:44:45,579
of liquid Carmen that's a potassium

3763
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:47,250
silicates that's basically my veg mix I

3764
02:44:45,579 --> 02:44:49,719
would add something in there for roots

3765
02:44:47,250 --> 02:44:52,659
some sort of root inoculate use whatever

3766
02:44:49,719 --> 02:44:55,750
you would like you can use either the

3767
02:44:52,659 --> 02:44:59,469
plus life from veg bloom bigshot at the

3768
02:44:55,750 --> 02:45:02,020
veg bloom you could use the rhizome mix

3769
02:44:59,469 --> 02:45:03,369
the botanic air makes you could use what

3770
02:45:02,020 --> 02:45:04,540
am I think there's there's one product

3771
02:45:03,370 --> 02:45:06,910
I'm really thinking I can't say the name

3772
02:45:04,540 --> 02:45:08,170
o G bio war use some OG bio war in that

3773
02:45:06,909 --> 02:45:10,000
[ __ ] to get your roots going so add

3774
02:45:08,170 --> 02:45:11,710
that to it for roots and you got pretty

3775
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:13,930
much everything you need there week one

3776
02:45:11,709 --> 02:45:15,129
a flower you basically want to feed the

3777
02:45:13,930 --> 02:45:16,908
same thing that you've been feeding for

3778
02:45:15,129 --> 02:45:17,898
the last couple weeks of veg

3779
02:45:16,908 --> 02:45:20,328
because your plants are just gonna start

3780
02:45:17,898 --> 02:45:21,918
transitioning so week one you've got the

3781
02:45:20,328 --> 02:45:24,048
option a week one to switch out that

3782
02:45:21,918 --> 02:45:25,699
pure blend Pro grow to the bloom formula

3783
02:45:24,049 --> 02:45:27,919
or you can do it at the start of week

3784
02:45:25,699 --> 02:45:29,748
two or definitely do it by week three

3785
02:45:27,918 --> 02:45:31,578
your plants are gonna need that much

3786
02:45:29,748 --> 02:45:33,588
nitrogen by week three and if you keep

3787
02:45:31,578 --> 02:45:35,988
going with the grow formula you may burn

3788
02:45:33,588 --> 02:45:38,359
them so you can go the first week or two

3789
02:45:35,988 --> 02:45:40,309
with your grow newts and then by week

3790
02:45:38,359 --> 02:45:41,539
three definitely switch all the way into

3791
02:45:40,309 --> 02:45:43,788
your flowering newts you don't need to

3792
02:45:41,539 --> 02:45:44,959
add everything by week three you really

3793
02:45:43,789 --> 02:45:47,629
don't need a lot at week three you can

3794
02:45:44,959 --> 02:45:48,909
start introducing things slowly maybe

3795
02:45:47,629 --> 02:45:50,899
get some sugars in there at week three

3796
02:45:48,908 --> 02:45:52,368
you don't need a lot of week three by

3797
02:45:50,898 --> 02:45:53,868
week four or five and six that's where

3798
02:45:52,369 --> 02:45:55,009
things really started cracking that's

3799
02:45:53,869 --> 02:45:57,140
when you're gonna want to start adding

3800
02:45:55,009 --> 02:45:58,218
bud boosters whatever you gonna use to

3801
02:45:57,139 --> 02:45:59,418
make the weight a little thicker or

3802
02:45:58,218 --> 02:46:01,458
whatever you gonna use to sweeten it up

3803
02:45:59,418 --> 02:46:03,468
four or five and six is when all that

3804
02:46:01,459 --> 02:46:05,209
[ __ ] comes in so if you're running a

3805
02:46:03,468 --> 02:46:06,828
strain that likes a lot of nitrogen keep

3806
02:46:05,209 --> 02:46:08,959
those nitrogen nutrients coming keep

3807
02:46:06,828 --> 02:46:10,369
that base grow new coming for the first

3808
02:46:08,959 --> 02:46:11,779
couple of weeks if you've got a strain

3809
02:46:10,369 --> 02:46:13,248
that's got plenty of nutrients if your

3810
02:46:11,779 --> 02:46:14,810
leaves are nice and lush green if

3811
02:46:13,248 --> 02:46:16,520
they're dark green don't even worry

3812
02:46:14,809 --> 02:46:18,439
about that grow new go ahead and switch

3813
02:46:16,520 --> 02:46:20,209
it over to the bloom nutrients alright I

3814
02:46:18,439 --> 02:46:22,369
hope that answered your question I know

3815
02:46:20,209 --> 02:46:23,899
I used a botanic hair as an example

3816
02:46:22,369 --> 02:46:26,209
that's the brand that I use in my

3817
02:46:23,898 --> 02:46:28,728
small-batch personal growth for myself

3818
02:46:26,209 --> 02:46:31,609
if I'm gonna smoke it it's probably

3819
02:46:28,728 --> 02:46:33,679
grown with botanic hair I do plan on

3820
02:46:31,609 --> 02:46:35,328
doing a side by side between botanic

3821
02:46:33,679 --> 02:46:37,520
hair and veg bloom in the near future

3822
02:46:35,328 --> 02:46:39,259
and I will be completely honest about

3823
02:46:37,520 --> 02:46:42,588
what I see and I will share my

3824
02:46:39,259 --> 02:46:43,879
experience and my results here on the

3825
02:46:42,588 --> 02:46:45,949
podcast you guys make sure you support

3826
02:46:43,879 --> 02:46:47,419
botanic hair and veg bloom I've used

3827
02:46:45,949 --> 02:46:48,529
them both in different environments and

3828
02:46:47,418 --> 02:46:50,689
different scenarios that are both

3829
02:46:48,529 --> 02:46:53,509
wonderful products I can't wait to run a

3830
02:46:50,689 --> 02:46:56,179
side-by-side I've got a 5 by 5 Hut and

3831
02:46:53,509 --> 02:46:57,738
another 5 by 5 hydro Hut in a row but

3832
02:46:56,179 --> 02:47:00,168
very similar light with the same lights

3833
02:46:57,738 --> 02:47:01,908
they're on a flip box every 12 hours one

3834
02:47:00,168 --> 02:47:03,498
comes on one shuts off so we got a

3835
02:47:01,908 --> 02:47:05,628
flowering chamber that's always being

3836
02:47:03,498 --> 02:47:07,009
used I'm gonna do veg bloom on one side

3837
02:47:05,629 --> 02:47:09,020
I want to do botanic hair on the other

3838
02:47:07,009 --> 02:47:10,488
and I will completely post a ton of

3839
02:47:09,020 --> 02:47:13,069
pictures to my Instagram and I'll let

3840
02:47:10,488 --> 02:47:14,868
you guys know how it goes all right I

3841
02:47:13,068 --> 02:47:16,458
want to thank a friend Maz our 424 sent

3843
02:47:16,459 --> 02:47:19,879
information to ramble off at you guys

3844
02:47:18,529 --> 02:47:22,520

3845
02:47:19,879 --> 02:47:23,659
phone the next email comes from he

3846
02:47:22,520 --> 02:47:25,310
signed it with his real name I don't

3847
02:47:23,658 --> 02:47:27,889
know nice and hi my name is Kelvin

3848
02:47:25,309 --> 02:47:29,418
I'll see let's read this we have spoken

3849
02:47:27,889 --> 02:47:30,170
before but I have another question so I

3850
02:47:29,418 --> 02:47:32,059
live in Oklahoma

3851
02:47:30,170 --> 02:47:33,739
city where the heat gets pretty hot it

3852
02:47:32,059 --> 02:47:35,869
can get into a hundred or above in my

3853
02:47:33,739 --> 02:47:37,610
garden room I was wondering if a bigger

3854
02:47:35,870 --> 02:47:39,710
carbon filter what helped me out any

3855
02:47:37,610 --> 02:47:41,720
right now I'm running a 400 watt high

3856
02:47:39,709 --> 02:47:43,669
pressure sodium and a metal halide Apolo

3857
02:47:41,719 --> 02:47:46,159
light with a 4-inch carbon filter and

3858
02:47:43,670 --> 02:47:47,780
inline fan I was thinking about getting

3859
02:47:46,159 --> 02:47:49,489
an air conditioner but I don't want to

3860
02:47:47,780 --> 02:47:52,400
if I can lower temps with the carbon

3861
02:47:49,489 --> 02:47:55,250
filters during the day the temps get

3862
02:47:52,399 --> 02:47:57,409
from a hundred and ten to a hundred and

3863
02:47:55,250 --> 02:48:01,399
fifteen thank you Jeff

3864
02:47:57,409 --> 02:48:03,500
growers love dude 110 or 115 in your

3865
02:48:01,399 --> 02:48:04,879
grow room that is tremendously warm for

3866
02:48:03,500 --> 02:48:07,399
your plants your plants are freaking out

3867
02:48:04,879 --> 02:48:09,349
development stops growth and development

3868
02:48:07,399 --> 02:48:11,840
stops production stops inside your plant

3869
02:48:09,350 --> 02:48:14,300
around 85 90 degrees unless you're

3870
02:48:11,840 --> 02:48:15,860
introducing co2 if you're inducing co2

3871
02:48:14,299 --> 02:48:19,429
if you've got very high levels of co2

3872
02:48:15,860 --> 02:48:21,290
your plants can tolerate in the 90s 110

3873
02:48:19,430 --> 02:48:22,729
to 115 you're stressing the [ __ ] out of

3874
02:48:21,290 --> 02:48:24,229
those plants the buds are starting to

3875
02:48:22,728 --> 02:48:26,809
spread out you're gettin Airy buds

3876
02:48:24,228 --> 02:48:28,369
they're gonna be fluffy they're gonna be

3877
02:48:26,809 --> 02:48:29,899
small the plants are gonna be stunted

3878
02:48:28,370 --> 02:48:31,430
growth the humidity is probably getting

3879
02:48:29,899 --> 02:48:33,770
[ __ ] ridiculous in that room with that

3880
02:48:31,430 --> 02:48:35,960
type of heat the good thing about this

3881
02:48:33,770 --> 02:48:37,310
is you're not gonna have any bugs no

3882
02:48:35,959 --> 02:48:40,309
damn bug in the world is gonna want to

3883
02:48:37,309 --> 02:48:41,449
hang out 115 degree grow room so your

3884
02:48:40,309 --> 02:48:43,159
main question let's get to the point

3885
02:48:41,450 --> 02:48:45,320
here your question is well a carbon

3886
02:48:43,159 --> 02:48:47,180
filter help cool that room no not at all

3887
02:48:45,319 --> 02:48:50,478
a carbon filter does not provide any

3888
02:48:47,180 --> 02:48:53,090
cooling you need you you need to

3889
02:48:50,478 --> 02:48:54,949
introduce cooler air into that room and

3890
02:48:53,090 --> 02:48:57,710
you need to remove the hot air from the

3891
02:48:54,950 --> 02:48:59,360
room a fan won't help you because it's

3892
02:48:57,709 --> 02:49:01,069
just gonna blow hot air around you need

3893
02:48:59,360 --> 02:49:03,620
to exchange the air you got to get that

3894
02:49:01,069 --> 02:49:05,689
heat out of there maybe bigger ducting

3895
02:49:03,620 --> 02:49:08,180
and a bigger blower to blow the heat out

3896
02:49:05,689 --> 02:49:09,860
but a bigger carbon filter won't help

3897
02:49:08,180 --> 02:49:12,350
you cool the room you need an air

3898
02:49:09,860 --> 02:49:15,200
conditioner ifit's a large room get

3899
02:49:12,350 --> 02:49:16,610
yourself a window model like the window

3900
02:49:15,200 --> 02:49:18,110
kind if it's a smaller room and you

3901
02:49:16,610 --> 02:49:20,090
don't have a window for it get yourself

3902
02:49:18,110 --> 02:49:23,380
one of those portable rolling air

3903
02:49:20,090 --> 02:49:26,510
conditioners I really like the soleus

3904
02:49:23,379 --> 02:49:28,579
14,000 BTU portable air conditioner they

3905
02:49:26,510 --> 02:49:30,228
do not pay me they do not sponsor me

3906
02:49:28,579 --> 02:49:31,579
it's what I buy if I need an air

3907
02:49:30,228 --> 02:49:33,889
conditioner or a rolling air conditioner

3908
02:49:31,579 --> 02:49:35,870
for a home grow or a small grow that's

3909
02:49:33,889 --> 02:49:39,079
what I go get is one of those soleus

3910
02:49:35,870 --> 02:49:40,340
14,000 BTU - heater is an air

3911
02:49:39,079 --> 02:49:41,719
conditioner and it's a dehumidifier

3912
02:49:40,340 --> 02:49:43,670
all-in-one unit

3913
02:49:41,719 --> 02:49:43,998
it's about waist-high it's only about

3914
02:49:43,670 --> 02:49:45,648
three

3915
02:49:43,998 --> 02:49:47,929
feet tall looks like a little r2d2 you

3916
02:49:45,648 --> 02:49:49,519
guys and it's got a duck that runs out

3917
02:49:47,929 --> 02:49:51,289
and I think it's got a duck they can

3918
02:49:49,519 --> 02:49:53,209
come in also if you choose to ducked in

3919
02:49:51,289 --> 02:49:54,739
but I don't ducked in I just let the air

3920
02:49:53,209 --> 02:49:57,019
conditioner recycle the air in the room

3921
02:49:54,738 --> 02:49:58,308
is where that air comes from so that air

3922
02:49:57,019 --> 02:50:00,318
is already cool kind of that's going

3923
02:49:58,308 --> 02:50:02,358
into the compressor and then it blows

3924
02:50:00,318 --> 02:50:05,208
the heat through a duct a four-inch duct

3925
02:50:02,359 --> 02:50:05,539
and you can mount that duct wherever you

3926
02:50:05,209 --> 02:50:08,119
want

3927
02:50:05,539 --> 02:50:09,409
I usually board up a window cut a four

3928
02:50:08,119 --> 02:50:11,029
inch hole through the window put a duct

3929
02:50:09,408 --> 02:50:12,558
mount onto that window and run that four

3930
02:50:11,029 --> 02:50:17,149
inch air conditioning duct right out of

3931
02:50:12,558 --> 02:50:20,058
there that 14,000 BTU unit would be

3932
02:50:17,148 --> 02:50:24,618
overkill for your 400 watt HBS and your

3933
02:50:20,058 --> 02:50:26,568
metal halide apollo light I'm assuming

3934
02:50:24,619 --> 02:50:28,819
that your small grow room is inside of

3935
02:50:26,568 --> 02:50:30,439
another room since it's so small and I'm

3936
02:50:28,818 --> 02:50:31,638
not I'm not I'm not worried that you

3937
02:50:30,439 --> 02:50:33,889
have a small girl band I make it funny

3938
02:50:31,638 --> 02:50:35,568
but I'm just wondering is this grow room

3939
02:50:33,888 --> 02:50:37,429
inside of another room do you have this

3940
02:50:35,568 --> 02:50:39,048
like did you construct a small room

3941
02:50:37,429 --> 02:50:41,418
inside of a bedroom or this maybe a

3942
02:50:39,049 --> 02:50:44,089
closet also but if it's a small room

3943
02:50:41,418 --> 02:50:45,558
maybe you can air-conditioned that room

3944
02:50:44,088 --> 02:50:47,599
a little bit better and then duct the

3945
02:50:45,558 --> 02:50:49,038
heat out of your grow I just air

3946
02:50:47,599 --> 02:50:50,359
conditioned the outside environment so

3947
02:50:49,039 --> 02:50:52,209
that you're bringing in cooler air

3948
02:50:50,359 --> 02:50:54,379
you just need cooler air in that room

3949
02:50:52,209 --> 02:50:56,059
carbon filters not gonna cool off the

3950
02:50:54,379 --> 02:50:57,739
air a fan is not gonna cool off the air

3951
02:50:56,058 --> 02:50:59,838
you actually need some freon in there

3952
02:50:57,738 --> 02:51:01,308
you need an air conditioner bro so hope

3953
02:50:59,838 --> 02:51:03,078
that works I hope answered your question

3954
02:51:01,308 --> 02:51:04,518

02:51:44,088 --> 02:51:49,158
pineapple jack shatter from turf backs

3975
02:51:46,429 --> 02:51:51,078
and I dunked it in OG ghost rain haze

3976
02:51:49,158 --> 02:51:54,888
fresh Terps from our friends at evil

3977
02:51:51,078 --> 02:51:56,958
labs then I feel like my brain was put

3978
02:51:54,888 --> 02:51:57,661
on a rocket and launched into outer

3979
02:51:56,959 --> 02:51:59,251
space

3980
02:51:57,661 --> 02:52:00,841
and then it blew up like one of those

3981
02:51:59,251 --> 02:52:02,581
beautiful fireworks and then it all just

3982
02:52:00,841 --> 02:52:04,681
came back together and floated down into

3983
02:52:02,581 --> 02:52:06,091
my head that's what happens when you

3984
02:52:04,681 --> 02:52:09,331
dunk your dad's in Terps and you take

3985
02:52:06,091 --> 02:52:11,011
big old fat dabs whoo shouts everybody

3986
02:52:09,331 --> 02:52:14,070
involved in making these Terps happen I

3987
02:52:11,011 --> 02:52:15,661
had the lab manager from Evo labs in the

3988
02:52:14,070 --> 02:52:19,050
last podcast and that's the one

3989
02:52:15,661 --> 02:52:20,851
the memory card ate and we cannot listen

3990
02:52:19,050 --> 02:52:22,350
to so sorry Brett I wish we could have

3991
02:52:20,851 --> 02:52:23,490
done that but Brett that means you gotta

3992
02:52:22,351 --> 02:52:25,621
come back on the show and smoke some

3993
02:52:23,490 --> 02:52:27,479
turps with me I owe a huge thank you to

3994
02:52:25,620 --> 02:52:29,300
Davin granny and I owe a huge thank you

3995
02:52:27,479 --> 02:52:32,161
to Brett Davin granny showed up with

3996
02:52:29,300 --> 02:52:34,520
enough Terps to dab out an army and

3997
02:52:32,161 --> 02:52:36,751
Brett will try to compete with that

3998
02:52:34,521 --> 02:52:38,581
so big thanks to you guys for showing up

3999
02:52:36,751 --> 02:52:39,899
to the podcast too well prepared also

4000
02:52:38,581 --> 02:52:42,871
thanks to the candy canyon for letting

4001
02:52:39,899 --> 02:52:45,240
me invade the small corner of their

4002
02:52:42,870 --> 02:52:46,710
facility I had four couches and a table

4003
02:52:45,240 --> 02:52:48,331
occupied and nobody can hang out that

4004
02:52:46,710 --> 02:52:50,251
region because we're doing the podcast I

4005
02:52:48,331 --> 02:52:51,451
didn't mind if people hung out but when

4006
02:52:50,251 --> 02:52:52,681
they saw the microphones come out they

4007
02:52:51,450 --> 02:52:55,710
heard me talk and they all just took off

4008
02:52:52,681 --> 02:52:57,060
to be polite I don't I think it's cool I

4009
02:52:55,710 --> 02:52:59,490
like the ambience and the vibe in the

4010
02:52:57,060 --> 02:53:01,440
background I'm rambling like a

4011
02:52:59,490 --> 02:53:03,570
[ __ ] hashtag they like it when I

4012
02:53:01,440 --> 02:53:06,331
ramble I wanted to share with you guys a

4013
02:53:03,570 --> 02:53:08,671
little progress on my most current

4014
02:53:06,331 --> 02:53:09,810
breeding project if you follow me you

4015
02:53:08,671 --> 02:53:11,220
know that I am a breeder

4016
02:53:09,810 --> 02:53:13,770
I am the head breeder for I read

4017
02:53:11,220 --> 02:53:16,470
genetics I am currently working with a

4018
02:53:13,771 --> 02:53:18,031
male plant that I call a rise the screen

4019
02:53:16,470 --> 02:53:20,399
is known as a rise the male plant

4020
02:53:18,031 --> 02:53:22,261
himself has been named Solomon that is

4021
02:53:20,399 --> 02:53:24,690
King Solomon he is going to father many

4022
02:53:22,261 --> 02:53:26,461
children he will be the grandfather to

4023
02:53:24,690 --> 02:53:29,251
many children but Solomon is my male

4024
02:53:26,460 --> 02:53:31,831
plant is a an arise plant which is a

4025
02:53:29,251 --> 02:53:33,570
cross of a golden goat female that was

4026
02:53:31,831 --> 02:53:35,701
pollinated by a Daybreaker male

4027
02:53:33,570 --> 02:53:37,800
Daybreaker came from gage green genetics

4028
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:40,500
so much love and respect today - gage

4029
02:53:37,800 --> 02:53:43,411
green the day breaker is Joseph Oh G and

4030
02:53:40,501 --> 02:53:45,871
Kim D so there's gonna be a little bit

4031
02:53:43,411 --> 02:53:47,940
of og cush and Kim dog lineage in there

4032
02:53:45,870 --> 02:53:49,860
and then I crossed that - I put the

4033
02:53:47,940 --> 02:53:51,931
pollen from that male on to the golden

4034
02:53:49,861 --> 02:53:54,001
goat the golden goat is Island sweet

4035
02:53:51,931 --> 02:53:56,341
skunk and Romulan and a Hawaiian sativa

4036
02:53:54,001 --> 02:53:59,460
so you got that tropical tasty flavor I

4037
02:53:56,341 --> 02:54:01,021
pollinated it with that cushy skunky

4038
02:53:59,460 --> 02:54:02,970
funk flavor a little bit of everything

4039
02:54:01,021 --> 02:54:05,780
in my opinion mixed it all together and

4040
02:54:02,970 --> 02:54:08,090
it made a strain called a rise

4041
02:54:05,780 --> 02:54:09,710
I found three or four really great

4042
02:54:08,090 --> 02:54:11,720
phenotypes of the arize there's a very

4043
02:54:09,709 --> 02:54:13,339
golden goat reminiscent phenotype of her

4044
02:54:11,720 --> 02:54:15,409
eyes I do not keep that one because I've

4045
02:54:13,340 --> 02:54:17,601
got a golden goat it's too similar I get

4046
02:54:15,409 --> 02:54:20,690
rid of it there's one that's got this

4047
02:54:17,601 --> 02:54:22,159
sweet skunky funky you can't keep it in

4048
02:54:20,690 --> 02:54:23,870
a baggie without all your friends in

4049
02:54:22,159 --> 02:54:26,149
smoke some of that weed with me kind of

4050
02:54:23,870 --> 02:54:27,380
smell to it that's my favorite female of

4051
02:54:26,149 --> 02:54:30,199
the bunch then there's one that makes

4052
02:54:27,379 --> 02:54:31,489
really long skinny buds and I don't know

4053
02:54:30,200 --> 02:54:33,141
where it came from but it gives you this

4054
02:54:31,489 --> 02:54:34,610
hazy high I don't know where the haze

4055
02:54:33,140 --> 02:54:36,560
came from in the genetics but it just

4056
02:54:34,610 --> 02:54:39,200
makes your head melt your eyes just get

4057
02:54:36,560 --> 02:54:41,810
[ __ ] squinty you go dumb you just

4058
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:42,800
start stuttering it so that phenotype is

4059
02:54:41,810 --> 02:54:45,140
great but you know there are three or

4060
02:54:42,799 --> 02:54:47,149
four key key phenotypes that I found

4061
02:54:45,140 --> 02:54:49,129
I've put all three of those phenotypes

4062
02:54:47,149 --> 02:54:50,181
not the golden goat dominant phenotype

4063
02:54:49,129 --> 02:54:53,569
but I've put my three favorite

4064
02:54:50,181 --> 02:54:55,340
phenotypes in a room with a male of this

4065
02:54:53,569 --> 02:54:56,989
same cultivar but the male of the same

4066
02:54:55,340 --> 02:54:59,630
strain from the same seed back they're

4067
02:54:56,989 --> 02:55:01,521
all F wands so I put the F ones the male

4068
02:54:59,629 --> 02:55:03,199
and the female in a room this male I've

4069
02:55:01,521 --> 02:55:06,590
posted pictures of into my Instagram he

4070
02:55:03,200 --> 02:55:08,811
makes male flower clusters as long as my

4071
02:55:06,590 --> 02:55:10,340
arm which is very amazing for a male

4072
02:55:08,810 --> 02:55:11,539
plant to make buds like this it's

4073
02:55:10,340 --> 02:55:14,450
incredible it's got a little bit of

4074
02:55:11,540 --> 02:55:16,431
resin on it it smells very pungent it's

4075
02:55:14,450 --> 02:55:19,101
got a hint of vomit to the smell as a

4076
02:55:16,431 --> 02:55:20,780
breeder vomit is a good treat if you've

4077
02:55:19,101 --> 02:55:24,620
got a male plant that smells like vomit

4078
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:26,440
or feet or a bar trashcan that is a good

4079
02:55:24,620 --> 02:55:29,601
breeding plant it's gonna pass on good

4080
02:55:26,440 --> 02:55:31,940
good aromatic traits so I've got that

4081
02:55:29,601 --> 02:55:33,590
male and then I've got let's see what

4082
02:55:31,940 --> 02:55:35,239
else is in there there is a golden goat

4083
02:55:33,590 --> 02:55:36,979
female because I'm gonna do a little bit

4084
02:55:35,239 --> 02:55:38,750
of a golden goat backcross there's a

4085
02:55:36,979 --> 02:55:40,340
lemon skunk female in there because I

4086
02:55:38,750 --> 02:55:43,340
want to see what this arised does to the

4087
02:55:40,340 --> 02:55:45,799
lemon skunk and there is a grateful dog

4088
02:55:43,340 --> 02:55:48,110
female so there are multiple themed

4089
02:55:45,799 --> 02:55:51,049
phenotypes of the arise so there would

4090
02:55:48,110 --> 02:55:53,420
be a rise f2s coming out very soon it'll

4091
02:55:51,049 --> 02:55:55,399
be tested by a bunch of my people before

4092
02:55:53,420 --> 02:55:56,899
they're available to you guys but a lot

4093
02:55:55,399 --> 02:55:58,310
of people get to test them out then

4094
02:55:56,899 --> 02:55:59,629
there will be grateful dog to arise

4095
02:55:58,310 --> 02:56:01,851
which doesn't even have a name

4096
02:55:59,629 --> 02:56:03,709
there will be golden goat to arise which

4097
02:56:01,851 --> 02:56:05,659
would be like a golden goat backcross

4098
02:56:03,709 --> 02:56:07,909
kind of and then there'll be lemon skunk

4099
02:56:05,659 --> 02:56:10,170
cross to arise which who knows what

4100
02:56:07,909 --> 02:56:12,119
that's gonna do that's gonna be amazing

4101
02:56:10,170 --> 02:56:13,620
both of those plants make a lot of resin

4102
02:56:12,120 --> 02:56:15,780
both of those plants have a really nice

4103
02:56:13,620 --> 02:56:17,010
structure I really see a lot of great

4104
02:56:15,780 --> 02:56:19,800
things so I'm excited about that they're

4105
02:56:17,010 --> 02:56:21,210
currently the date today is I'm pressing

4106
02:56:19,799 --> 02:56:22,739
my button on my phone as the 14th they

4107
02:56:21,209 --> 02:56:26,039
went into flower on the 3rd so they're

4108
02:56:22,739 --> 02:56:26,850
11 days in the male plant is getting big

4109
02:56:26,040 --> 02:56:28,260
old balls

4110
02:56:26,850 --> 02:56:29,670
his balls are starting you know when the

4111
02:56:28,260 --> 02:56:31,380
male plant starts to flower out the

4112
02:56:29,670 --> 02:56:33,149
balls point up but now they're starting

4113
02:56:31,379 --> 02:56:34,619
to hang his nuts are starting to hang

4114
02:56:33,149 --> 02:56:36,329
which means within the next four to six

4115
02:56:34,620 --> 02:56:37,561
days I'm gonna have pollen coming out of

4116
02:56:36,329 --> 02:56:39,209
there which may be a little earlier than

4117
02:56:37,560 --> 02:56:40,649
I wanted so I'm gonna move him over to

4118
02:56:39,209 --> 02:56:43,500
another room to keep him away from the

4119
02:56:40,649 --> 02:56:45,690
girls because the girls their pistols a

4120
02:56:43,500 --> 02:56:47,549
little you guys call them hairs probably

4121
02:56:45,690 --> 02:56:48,930
the little white pistols the hairs on

4122
02:56:47,549 --> 02:56:50,849
the plant that looks like a dandelion

4123
02:56:48,930 --> 02:56:52,889
I want those nice and thick and stout

4124
02:56:50,850 --> 02:56:54,690
before I put that pollen on there so I'm

4125
02:56:52,889 --> 02:56:56,579
gonna move this boy to another area just

4126
02:56:54,690 --> 02:56:58,500
to keep him from dust and his pollen on

4127
02:56:56,579 --> 02:56:59,940
these girls too early and then once I

4128
02:56:58,500 --> 02:57:01,680
see all the girls have their pistols

4129
02:56:59,940 --> 02:57:04,200
nice and hairy nice and furry

4130
02:57:01,680 --> 02:57:05,850
almost that tarantula look then I'm

4131
02:57:04,200 --> 02:57:06,990
gonna bring the boy over there and I'm

4132
02:57:05,850 --> 02:57:08,610
gonna just leave him in the room with

4133
02:57:06,989 --> 02:57:09,869
them overnight and then in the morning

4134
02:57:08,610 --> 02:57:11,579
as soon as lights come on my give a

4135
02:57:09,870 --> 02:57:13,410
little shake and that pollen is gonna

4136
02:57:11,579 --> 02:57:16,739
dust all those plants and I'm gonna do

4137
02:57:13,409 --> 02:57:17,850
that probably 4 or 5 days again or 5 4

4138
02:57:16,739 --> 02:57:20,129
or 5 days later I'm gonna do that again

4139
02:57:17,850 --> 02:57:21,060
just let the lights come on and walk in

4140
02:57:20,129 --> 02:57:22,920
there and give him a little bit of a

4141
02:57:21,060 --> 02:57:24,239
shake and just get that pollen all over

4142
02:57:22,920 --> 02:57:26,549
all those plants so when I see a little

4143
02:57:24,239 --> 02:57:28,771
bit of a shake guys if you grab a male

4144
02:57:26,549 --> 02:57:30,750
cannabis plant that is in full flower

4145
02:57:28,771 --> 02:57:32,521
that's got pollen sacs hanging off of it

4146
02:57:30,750 --> 02:57:34,590
you could flick it like listen to I'm

4147
02:57:32,521 --> 02:57:36,120
gonna flick the microphone stand that's

4148
02:57:34,590 --> 02:57:39,000
all you got to do you flick it that hard

4149
02:57:36,120 --> 02:57:41,130
pollen goes there everywhere everywhere

4150
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:43,500
so after that I'll have to take a shower

4151
02:57:41,129 --> 02:57:45,119
off to change clothes I'll have to go

4152
02:57:43,500 --> 02:57:47,340
spray down any female plants that I do

4153
02:57:45,120 --> 02:57:48,840
not want receiving pollen it'll be some

4154
02:57:47,340 --> 02:57:50,670
work but it'll be definitely definitely

4155
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:52,530
worth it off to change clothes wash my

4156
02:57:50,670 --> 02:57:54,060
dreadlocks before I go to anybody else's

4157
02:57:52,530 --> 02:57:55,739
garden I wouldn't disrespect anyone

4158
02:57:54,060 --> 02:57:57,690
else's garden like that I'll put on

4159
02:57:55,739 --> 02:57:59,190
specific clothes they cover me up most

4160
02:57:57,690 --> 02:58:02,069
of the ways that I just drop them right

4161
02:57:59,190 --> 02:58:03,360
in the washer it's a chore but that's

4162
02:58:02,069 --> 02:58:04,889
where my breeding project is you guys

4163
02:58:03,360 --> 02:58:06,420
the mail is just getting ready to draw a

4164
02:58:04,889 --> 02:58:08,789
polity I'm I just kicked the doggy and

4165
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:10,110
I'm sorry boy sorry dude I didn't mean

4166
02:58:08,790 --> 02:58:11,700
to kick you his head's right here on my

4167
02:58:10,110 --> 02:58:15,720
foot so every time I get excited it was

4168
02:58:11,700 --> 02:58:18,271
my st. no UFC I apologize

4169
02:58:15,719 --> 02:58:20,228
so my plants are the Britton project is

4170
02:58:18,271 --> 02:58:21,729
11 days the males

4171
02:58:20,228 --> 02:58:24,010
just dropping pollen the male is just

4172
02:58:21,728 --> 02:58:25,658
rot starting to drop all the females are

4173
02:58:24,010 --> 02:58:27,010
almost ready to take it I'm gonna

4174
02:58:25,658 --> 02:58:29,590
separate him for a little bit just to

4175
02:58:27,010 --> 02:58:31,420
put some tension in the room then

4176
02:58:29,590 --> 02:58:33,460
reintroduce them together in few days

4177
02:58:31,420 --> 02:58:35,619
and then once they pollinate it's

4178
02:58:33,459 --> 02:58:37,238
probably gonna be about six weeks before

4179
02:58:35,619 --> 02:58:39,970
those seeds are ready for harvest I'm

4180
02:58:37,238 --> 02:58:41,318
gonna let them go about seven I don't

4181
02:58:39,969 --> 02:58:43,358
wanna let go too long but I want them

4182
02:58:41,318 --> 02:58:45,459
nice and done I want um hard then we'll

4183
02:58:43,359 --> 02:58:47,859
cut down the plants we will set them all

4184
02:58:45,459 --> 02:58:49,538
in individual areas over individual

4185
02:58:47,859 --> 02:58:52,029
containers and just let them dry for a

4186
02:58:49,539 --> 02:58:53,439
couple few days once they I will pre

4187
02:58:52,029 --> 02:58:55,180
trim them at that point will give them

4188
02:58:53,439 --> 02:58:56,710
will just take off all the big leaves

4189
02:58:55,180 --> 02:58:58,630
and we cut them down most of the

4190
02:58:56,709 --> 02:59:00,368
families will be gone so well dry it

4191
02:58:58,629 --> 02:59:01,688
we'll hang them let them dry and then

4192
02:59:00,369 --> 02:59:04,090
you just take the plants and you cut

4193
02:59:01,689 --> 02:59:05,318
basically cut one stick off and I put on

4194
02:59:04,090 --> 02:59:07,359
rubber gloves and hold it over like a

4195
02:59:05,318 --> 02:59:08,618
pie plate and just start crushing up the

4196
02:59:07,359 --> 02:59:09,880
buds and you can just hear the seeds

4197
02:59:08,619 --> 02:59:11,409
fall out it's like you're smoking

4198
02:59:09,879 --> 02:59:12,879
old-school Mexican brick weed and all

4199
02:59:11,408 --> 02:59:15,488
those seeds respond tink tink tink tink

4200
02:59:12,879 --> 02:59:17,469
tink tink tink into the pie plate just

4201
02:59:15,488 --> 02:59:19,270
crumble them up with my fingers and then

4202
02:59:17,469 --> 02:59:20,799
I push all the wheat up to one side and

4203
02:59:19,270 --> 02:59:21,908
I tip the pan and all the seeds roll

4204
02:59:20,799 --> 02:59:23,978
down to the other side and I take those

4205
02:59:21,908 --> 02:59:26,379
out put them in a jar it gets carefully

4206
02:59:23,978 --> 02:59:27,908
labeled of what it is I leave the lid

4207
02:59:26,379 --> 02:59:29,408
open for a couple few days just so that

4208
02:59:27,908 --> 02:59:31,930
if there's any moisture in there that

4209
02:59:29,408 --> 02:59:33,939
those seeds will try out so now I've got

4210
02:59:31,930 --> 02:59:36,220
a mason jar full of well labelled seeds

4211
02:59:33,939 --> 02:59:38,050
and then once I've got all of them I'll

4212
02:59:36,219 --> 02:59:39,908
weigh the seeds get a good estimate of

4213
02:59:38,049 --> 02:59:42,099
how many seeds I've got then I'll send a

4214
02:59:39,908 --> 02:59:43,568
lot of those seeds out to friends of

4215
02:59:42,100 --> 02:59:45,850

4216
02:59:43,568 --> 02:59:47,709

weeks before anything will even be done

4226
