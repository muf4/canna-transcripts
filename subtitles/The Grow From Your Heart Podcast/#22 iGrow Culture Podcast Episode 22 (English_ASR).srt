145
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,840
of me it is

146
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,399
$550 for for one tote of soil I talked

147
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,638
about this last week a tote of soil

148
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,399
that's if you pick it up at the store

149
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,879
it's

150
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:11,638
$550 it comes in one bag it's Roots

151
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:14,478
organic soil it's good [ __ ] uh how much

152
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:17,478
is a tote that is approximately in my

153
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:21,199
measurements I think that is about 28 or

154
00:05:17,478 --> 00:05:23,199
uh is about 48 to 50 7 gallon pots so

155
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,560
you can run an eight light setup pretty

156
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,879
decently with this one package of soil

157
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,000
if you need it delivered it is $600 it

158
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:31,279
comes on a FedEx truck to your house

159
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,600
so it's not like the hydro shop is

160
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,000
showing up with a truck or anything it's

161
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,400
actually FedEx it looks like you got a

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,160
package that's [ __ ] huge uh that's

163
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:39,439

226
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,680
is because I use their stuff because

227
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,519
it's necessity it's useful if you're

228
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,240
dabbing you need some oil s products you

229
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,639
need something to keep your hash in it

230
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,918

239
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:58,038
magnetic sides too where you can just

240
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,439
put your slab in I'm going to have to

241
00:07:58,038 --> 00:08:00,478
[ __ ] Google that cuz I'm not sure if

242
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,120
that's actually their product or if

243
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,318
somebody's making that uh modified

244
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,360
version cuz I can't find it on their

245
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:06,439
website but hey oil if you're listening

246
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,080
no no no we're going to have to find out

247
00:08:06,439 --> 00:08:09,800
cuz that's a good idea you guys if you

248
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,719
have a miniature size slab you can take

249
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,280
two of these uh oil slick uh uh mini

250
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,680
pads slick pad Minis and you can rubber

251
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,878
band them together with your slab in the

252
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,959
middle or you can find other ways to

253
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:20,319
stick them together and just have your

254
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,359
slab right in the middle make it easily

255
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,720
accessible uh they're great things I

256
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,439
actually use it almost as a uh I wipe my

257
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,879
Dabber off on it that's why it's all

258
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,680
sticky on this Edge near me uh so I take

259
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,519
another dab wipe it off on there my next

260
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,200
dab doesn't have residue of my last dab

261
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,879
on there every dab is fresh and not only

262
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,879
that but I've I've you know I've seen

263
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,038
you use them to set pipes down on Just

264
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,000
for I usually try to have it like a

265
00:08:40,038 --> 00:08:43,360
coaster because the table's wood and I

266
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,080
think it's just a little better than

267
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,639
[ __ ] dropping my glass onto the table

different kind of chocolate I would

00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,880
almost kind of imagine that it's you see

how right there there's like a big

544

dark chocolate over peanut butter with

549
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,079
this peanut butter chocolate uh it's a

550
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,359
thick mousse a light fudge sort of a

551
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:55,599
texture all right it's uh I can eat it

552
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,918
quickly enough it does it's not so

553
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,399
peanut buttery that I'm stuck while I'm

554
00:18:56,919 --> 00:18:59,720
trying to talk but it does take a little

555
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,720
effort to clean up the face while you're

556
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,319
grubbing it and in the summer time eat

557
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,600
this in the air conditioner don't try to

558
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:07,158
take this out anywhere she told you to

559
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,959
kind of put it in the fridge like for 5

560
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:10,640
or 10 minutes beforehand or she said

561
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,798
actually put it in the microwave or warm

562
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,360
it up first oh yeah she did no this

563
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,279
would have been uh that I don't know

564
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:18,119
that i' recomend this would just be a

565
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:21,319
puddle she didn't say long she said like

566
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:23,399
1 second two seconds you know but I'm

567
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:24,839
take a couple more bites out I think

568
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,159
maybe uh just putting in the

569
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,798
refrigerator would be even better just

570
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,000
was there a strain natural Mystic

571
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:31,200
cannabis caregivers that got your

572
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,960
attention cuz they had some great

573
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,279
looking herbs I smelled a couple of them

574
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,400
uh there was only one of them that I

575
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,399
really knew what the smell was so you

576
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,798
know that was my only com comparison uh

577
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,440
they had Harlequin there that was I I

578
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:47,879
haven't smelled that yet and it was wow

579
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,519
it was really potent uh what was the

580
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:52,039
what was the other one that we got uh or

581
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:54,400
that you got that day that they had the

582
00:19:52,038 --> 00:19:56,279
strain there the torab Bora no no not

583
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,400
the Tor Bora the was it the Super Lemon

584
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,960
Haze no I can't remember which was they

585
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,720
had one that just stunk to high hell and

586
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,919
it was great yeah yeah yeah that's

587
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,798
that's the one I'm talking about the one

588
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:07,038
where it's that's what we got some of

589
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,480
the Shadow oh the guava yeah the guava

590
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,000
guava that really impressed me dude that

591
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,519
she opened the jar and it was like a

592
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,319
punch in the face before she handed it

593
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,839
to me and I mean like I said there was

594
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:19,759
no small nugs in the jar and everything

595
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:21,000
was Frosty everything was right to that

596
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,400
point where I feel like I could have

597
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,119
brought it home and kept it in my jar

598
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,480
for a couple days and it would have been

599
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,759
like you know I could have judged where

600
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,519
how dry

601
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,679
we tend to like Adam tends to like his

602
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:34,639
weed a little crispier than most folk

603
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,000
Adam likes it a little drier we like uh

604
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,799
so we'll cure it perfectly and then give

605
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,400
it to Adam to destroy for us yeah

606
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:43,679
exactly but still it's it's nice to have

607
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,880
that option instead of where I'm from

608
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,519
It's Always dry so you know you get

609
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,960
something wet you're like what is this

610

I said keep your veg plants on 1212

676
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,159
don't [ __ ] do that I [ __ ] up I said

677
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,759
something wrong this is me being a man

678
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,360
and telling you I [ __ ] said that

679
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,720
wrong I'm correcting myself right now on

680
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,000
the air where I have the chance I

681
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,440
apologize I am the captain of this ship

682
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,679
and I almost drove it into the wall I

683
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,120
and see now I feel kind of like an

684
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,559
[ __ ] because I forgot it was about

685
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:21,199
that I thought it was something else

686
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:22,798
because I thought you corrected about

687
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,519
that last week or the last podcast

688
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:25,679
episode you did so uh no that was

689
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:27,558
correcting my now you're pointing out

690
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,038
that I [ __ ] up twice dude oh my god

691
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:31,119

692
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:34,079

693
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,239
awesome we're awesome uh no uh I did I

694
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,480
that's why I said I'm being a man about

695
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,599
it I could just be all no [ __ ] that

696
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,839
we'll just keep talking like that didn't

697
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,839
happen no we got to correct it because

698
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:42,480
we're I'm the captain of this [ __ ]

699
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:43,759
pirate ship right here yeah this is my

700
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,480
ship that I'm driving and I got to guide

701
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,879
you guys into the right way or we're all

702
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,038
going to fail together and I want you to

703
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,960
win is why I'm doing a show I'm trying

704
00:23:48,038 --> 00:23:50,919
to improve your growing no [ __ ] it up

705
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,200
sorry I'm trying to adjust the music

706
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:55,000
task got a little loud for me but I want

707
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,720
to make her growing better so yeah my

708
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,640
first mistake was I don't even know if I

709
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,400
said it on the podcast or in a personal

710
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,080
conversation but I mentioned the red

711
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,080
light spectrum and I got it totally

712
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,918
backwards and then my second mistake was

713
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,960
saying to keep your vegging plants on

714
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:12,038
1212 do not do this keep your vegging

715
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,558
plants on at least 18 hours of at least

716
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:15,919
16 hours of light uh 18 would be better

717
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,678
24 is what I

718
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:22,000
do to be perfectly fair you didn't say

719
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,840
it like uh by the way put your plants no

720
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,240
it was at the end of your sentence at

721
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:29,199
the end of your lesson at the end of

722
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,240
your ramble of

723
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,960
how lights work so it's probably high

724
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,558
yeah yeah you were definitely back from

725
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,840
probably been doing it doing a show for

726
00:24:35,558 --> 00:24:39,599
an hour so excuse me I apologize but I

727
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,759
admit it I [ __ ] up and I'm driving

821

825
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,640
manage dabs so dishing out dabs I'm

826
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:58,879
getting buzzed I think from that my had

827
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,038

828

829
00:28:00,038 --> 00:28:04,879
too we'll slowly Watch Jeff degrade I'll

830
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,240
start melting here if anybody's got that

831
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,840
weed if you've seen that commercial that

832
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,480
that girl smoked and she [ __ ] melts

833
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,798
into the couch and becomes like Play-Doh

834
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,159
if you have any of that weed Andor hash

835
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:15,679
hit me up at I gr culture on Twitter

836
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,000

837
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,519
lying to you that was photosho they

838
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,839

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,440
great [ __ ] it's that pink stuff in that

842
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:27,240
in

843
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,159
that so I think we dished out probably 7

844
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:30,798
to 10 g a live resin last night to the

845
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,399
wedding party some people kept coming

846
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:36,000
back and coming back we uh we probably

847
00:28:33,398 --> 00:28:38,518
broke the dab record for peblo County in

848
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,880
one building at one time with a certain

849
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,919
amount of people I don't know what the

850
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:46,278
[ __ ] the logistics were but dude we

851
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,600
we won I'm guessing go team uh on an

852
00:28:46,278 --> 00:28:50,359
average day and people are going to [ __ ]

853
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:53,398
their pants I take 25 dabs no problem on

854
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:55,798
an average day uh maybe 30 or 40 on a

855
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,199
heavy dab day uh I've gone to secret

856
00:28:55,798 --> 00:29:00,200
cups and we've had the judge 42 samples

857
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,960
and I've done those all in one day and

858
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,360
was okay and went back for seconds on a

859
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,558
couple so I'm I'm in the 25 to 50 dabs

860
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,199
per day range which I don't know if

861
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:13,639
that's sounds like a lot um and when you

862
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,679
see the size of dabs he does it is a lot

863
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,120
so and what's odd is I'll uh I'll wake

864
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,759
up and I'll rock for a few hours before

865
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,199
I take a dab I try to do a couple things

866
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,519
like I try to get food and water in my

867
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,759
body and [ __ ] check my EMA get too

868
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:26,640
dabed 7:00 at night and you yeah I

869
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:28,640
haven't taken a dab yet because well if

870
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,360
you take that if you get up a reasonable

871
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,679
time somewhere between 800 and 10 you

872
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:34,079
know do your day get some food in you

873
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,919
get functional get your blood moving and

874
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,199
don't take a dab till 710 in the

875
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,880
afternoon or in the evening you get

876
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,840
[ __ ] higher than you would so yeah

877
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,519
but what I was going to say is I wait

878
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,519
until like 6 or s or 4:20 lately it's

879
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:48,240
been too hot to get dabbed out all day

880
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:49,960
so you got to wait until [ __ ] 6:00

881
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:52,079
and the Sun starts going down and by 9:

882
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,440
you get dabbed the [ __ ] out then I'll

883
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:57,519
take [ __ ] seven dabs per hour I'll

884
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,200
sit down and take six dabs in succession

885
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,519
you know in 20 or 30 minutes yeah you're

886
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,360
shaking your head because I ruin you

887
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:06,519
doing it right yeah I just uh I feel bad

888
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:08,639
for you you know I feel bad for your

889
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,000
lungs that's all you know I'm sitting

890
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,759
here shaking my head think imagine if I

891
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,919
was doing bong hits of flower that much

892
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,398
though and see that but that's what I'm

893
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:17,440
thinking though is you know I smoke

894
00:30:15,398 --> 00:30:20,398
flour most of the time so it's not

895
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,159
sitting there smoking you know 10 bong

896
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,839
hits of flour where if I'm just sitting

897
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,600
there smoking by myself it's two then

898
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:29,359
another four or five hours later two

899
00:30:26,599 --> 00:30:31,678
more you know know uh so I get what

900
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,678
you're saying I I go slower with the

901
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,000
dabs than I do with the flower

902
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,120
so less uh your lungs probably uh your

903
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,599
lungs are like any anything I think I'm

904
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,479
a smoker too so they've got a certain

905
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:44,038
amount of inhales and exhales your lungs

906
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,399
are going to give you before they start

907
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:47,599
to burn out just like any sort of

908
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:49,038
equipment or [ __ ] device or moving

909
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,558
anything that moves is going to break

910
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:54,599
eventually MH and uh if I've only got 72

911
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:56,918
billion ins and outs I'd rather spend

912
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:59,319
half of those on a dab than 34s of them

913
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:01,159
trying to smoke herb maybe I should just

914
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:02,678
get half of those on oxygen at least

915
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:04,440
half but you know what I mean I'm trying

916
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:06,679
to hey no I get what you're saying and

917
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,639
and you know it it's understandable my

918
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:09,559
vapor to smoke ratio hey tonight would

919
00:31:08,638 --> 00:31:12,158
have been the night that we would have

920
00:31:09,558 --> 00:31:13,440
done that event at the uh the Mary Janes

921
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,960
and at the hook bar I want to give an

922
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,038
apology to everybody that was excited

923
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,880
about that I myself was excited me too

924
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,638
there were some uh bureaucracy

925
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,120
discrepancies and some stuff that

926
00:31:20,638 --> 00:31:24,319
happened and I'm no longer a member of

927
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,638
the uh citizens for the responsible

928
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:26,879
regulation of cannabis I don't know if

929
00:31:25,638 --> 00:31:29,319
that even exists anymore to tell you the

930
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,720
truth backed out of that uh just going

931
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,480
to stick with being a breeder and a

932
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,558
podcast host and doing what I know I'm

933
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,880
good at um I don't like the I used to go

934
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:38,960
to City Council meetings and stuff when

935
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,919
I was with another dispensary group I

936
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,480
don't like being in that realm that's a

937
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,880
little uncomfortable to me uh I don't

938
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,000
know I'd rather just kind of it's one

939
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,480
thing going there when you have to you

940
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,119
know uh but when you know you're just

941
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:55,278
voluntar you voluntarily going there and

942
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:57,479
it still feels like Court yeah you what

943
00:31:55,278 --> 00:31:59,240
I mean once you've been to court in the

944
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,200
courtroom type building it still feels

945
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,480
like court and I don't just they're

946
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,200
judging you oh completely yeah and they

947
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,558
don't I don't feel I backed out of going

948
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,200
to those meetings because I felt like I

949
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:11,359
was a hindrance to the group because I'm

950
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,038
just a cliche looking pod and I didn't

951
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:14,359
speak anyway we had spokespeople for the

952
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:15,759
group so I just quit going and you want

953
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:19,000
to know the worst thing that I think

954
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:22,480
about courtrooms is can't wear the hat

955
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,880
no hat yeah so you know your long hair

956
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,919
you can't hide it from anyone oh I can't

957
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,600
hide I can't hide my dreadlocks anyway

958
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:29,880
um there's no hiding these dreads you

959
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:31,798
know what yeah I was talking about the

960
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,720

little bit of live resin super

1014
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:15,878
awesome uh I heat the torch or heat the

1015
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:17,199
nail a little bit less heat and make

1016
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:18,519
sure to use the carb cap with a live

1017
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,199
resin I don't want to burn it up because

1018
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:21,960
it's a lot more turpy it's more

1019
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:23,878
terpenoids if you know about tpps that's

1020
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:26,720
what mostly gives you the flavor they're

1021
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:28,799
flavonoids and paleet that uh contribute

1022
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,039
to that but mostly uh it's the

1023
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,280
terpenoids that you want to taste and

1024
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,719
it's very

1025
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,200
clean yeah you can see the cleanliness

1026
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,158

18 or 14 mm mail joint sticking out of

1049
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,079
it I recommend the Dual Tha nail that's

1050
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,719
probably the way to go uh there it's

1051
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,160
going to fit if you've got a 10 mm there

1052
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:50,598
is a 10 mm domeless that works perfectly

1053
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:52,799
as well I'm catching my breath get

1054
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:54,519
yourself a carb cap carb caps are the

1055
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,560
new [ __ ] and they're

1056
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:59,318
awesome uh you you don't have to heat

1057
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,519
your nail as hot you start you drop your

1058
00:35:59,318 --> 00:36:01,679
dab in there you let it puddle up a

1059
00:36:00,519 --> 00:36:04,079
little bit you cover it with the carb

1060
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,559
cap and it requires less heat so you

1061
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,519
choke less and your dab tastes a little

1062
00:36:05,559 --> 00:36:08,920
bit better you'll need a little more

1063
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,358
Heat next time bro that wasn't too bad

1064
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,119
you got to dab but a little more heat

1065
00:36:10,358 --> 00:36:15,199
will be better for you try not to heat

1066
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,920
it up because of what you just said yeah

1067
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,559
there's that you'll find it I usually

1068
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,880
heat it I counted the T I usually heat

1069
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,119
it for you when you're here but uh once

1070
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,519
your nail gets a little bit older you'll

1071
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:24,599
need to give it a little bit more heat

1072
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,358
is something that you guys will learn

1073
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:28,838

1086
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,838
much uh take a plant that is growing

1087
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,920
shop it down at Harvest time it's been

1088
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:59,719
flushed you know you've been flushing

1089
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:03,280
for 10 or 14 days chop it down it's

1090
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:05,358
harvest time uh maybe a couple of days

1091
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,839
ago you went through and pull off all

1092
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:09,039
the big fan leaves all right uh if not

1093
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:11,119
uh hang the plant upside down and take

1094
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,000
off all the fan leaves right now let it

1095
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,079
dry for like and you know some guys are

1096
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,358
leaving the fan leaves on I should

1097
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,440
mention that some guys leave the fan

1098
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:19,679
leaves on especially Frosty strands uh

1099
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,480
let it dry up for like 3 to four hours

1100
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:23,919
then chop it up into Buds and other guys

1101
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,599
are this is one method I've seen and it

1102
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,800
varies a little bit but this is

1103
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,920
basically it chop the buds off the

1104
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,318
sticks so you just have the buds and

1105
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,559
leaves you don't have all the stems so

1106
00:37:31,318 --> 00:37:35,480
now you got like a [ __ ] 5 gallon

1107
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:37,000
bucket or so whatever uh put that in a

1108
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,079
freezer if you need to use bags put them

1109
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,519
in bags and put them in your normal

1110
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,440
freezer we've got a fancy freezer we'd

1111
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,079
be using uh so freeze your buds get them

1112
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,760
nice and Frozen uh they've been putting

1113
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,400
them in a deep freeze is what I've been

1114
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,480
seeing then it's ran through a closed

1115
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,800
loop system uh I'm not there for that

1116
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,039
part most of the time not I'm not a hash

1117
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,760
maker dried and cured no fresh you cut

1118
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:01,960
down the plants okay good question I'll

1119
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,160
emphasize that again you cut them down

1120
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,358
you let them hang for like three to four

1121
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,719
hours and take off the leaves and then

1122
00:38:06,358 --> 00:38:11,639
freeze them okay that's all they hang to

1123
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:15,279
dry right boom Frozen chop down Frozen

1124
00:38:11,639 --> 00:38:17,440
and then blasted in the uh closed loop

1125
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,040
system taken out of the closed loop

1126
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,358
system and vacuum purge really really

1127
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,239
gently and I'm not the hash maker this

1128
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:26,078
is the process I've observed and

1129
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:27,799
gathered from hanging out with all of my

1130
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,560
friends that are extract artists all

1131
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,240
right all right that's that's the basics

1132
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:35,719
you know don't don't rush out

1133
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:37,479
and you most people and I sound like an

1134
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:39,399
[ __ ] most people don't have access to

1135
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,039
the machine you need to do this right on

1136
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,480
you're not going to have the machine

1137
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:43,599
there are a couple of specific machines

1138
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,358
that you need to do this there are only

1139
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,160
a couple Brands and I don't know exactly

1140
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:50,400
which two everybody would recommend to

1141
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,440
fight over if one of them wants to uh

1142
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,160
sponsor the show hit me up we'll start

1143
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,639
talking about your machine on the show

1144
00:38:54,159 --> 00:39:00,318
so maybe someone close to us maybe where

1145
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,920
would they even start to look once this

1146
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:04,039
this develops where would they look for

1147
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,720
it Denver uh yeah Denver is the only

1148
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:08,559
place I know if you can get live resin

1149
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:09,959
right now uh there was and it's gone now

1150
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,279
so I'm sorry you guys but it was there

1151
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,760
it went [ __ ] quickly there was Tangi

1152
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:17,359
live resin at the clinic it was 250

1153
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,040
bucks for three grams for one of our

1154
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:21,799
friends that bought some I think that's

1155
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,159
$85 a gram is roughly what that comes to

1156
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,920
but it's you got to than you're paying

1157
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,598
for the

1158
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,159
machine well and it's kind of the hype

1159
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,000
uh that's part of I mean how many people

1160
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,960
have you seen on Facebook or anywhere

1161
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:36,318
yeah right and it's our crew pretty much

1162
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,679
the Denver crew has got it figured out

1163
00:39:36,318 --> 00:39:40,079
the Denver crew is smoking the live

1164
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:41,919
resin I'm not sure who came up with it I

1165
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,560
don't have any of I think uh I think it

1166
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,920
was gidy up is one of the first people

1167
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:48,639
that I ever saw smoking live

1168
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,318
resin I've seen it online but it didn't

1169
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,078
look anything I'm going give giddy up

1170
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:54,159
and

1171
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,400
uh do I even want to say the other

1172
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,279
people so it's like Giddy Up Garden of

1173
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,760
Weeden maybe some Greener Side Empire

1174
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,599
that crew I'm going to give them credit

1175
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,040
for inventing the bare naked and the

1176
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,400
butt naked right here on the show pretty

1177
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:07,480
sure those guys invented that [ __ ] that

1178
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,200
was their idea gidy up was definitely

1179
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,599
one of the pioneers of that [ __ ] and now

1180
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:14,118
that I've recovered from my dab let me

1181
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:16,880
tell you wow isn't that smooth so the

1182
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:18,880
live resin uh people are arguing that

1183
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,680
it's not cured so it can't be as good

1184
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,760
that the [ __ ] weed isn't as good cuz

1185
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:26,960
it's not cured before it's blasted is

1186
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:31,480
the Taste not incredible it is more

1187
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,720
flavorful than anything if that any any

1188
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:37,599
shatter that I've had here if an apple

1189
00:40:33,719 --> 00:40:39,519
tasted like uh some dank weed this is

1190
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,240
Girl Scout cookies weed we're dabbing if

1191
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,838
you had a Girl Scout cookies flavored

1192
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:45,639
apple and you bid into it you know how

1193
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:47,039
apples take a second for that juice to

1194
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:49,679
come out of the fiber of the apple and

1195
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:52,440
then drip into your mouth is that what

1196
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:54,078
like a Weedle if you had a Weedle a weed

1197
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,599
apple is that what it would taste like

1198
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,039
that's what that is where compared to

1199
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:00,200
shatter would be like buying slices from

1200
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:02,400
a bag you know what I'm saying like it's

1201
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:04,480
it's already preut it's got that air on

1202
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,838
the on the it's not as we're not

1203
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,079

00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:52,759
may be talking about I know I was

1227
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,118
waiting for you to catch that that's why

1228
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,440
I paused oh dude one more thing one more

1229
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:58,920
thing uh I'm going toot some horns so

1230
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,559
live resin guys I hope we explained that

1231
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,159
enough we're blasting fresh frozen

1232
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,559
plants don't dry them blast them fresh

1233
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,118
frozen boom that's it vacuum purge it

1234
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,318
really lightly because the vacuum purge

1235
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,000
[ __ ] up your terpenoids and it

1236
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:12,440
collapses a lot of things uh if you're

1237
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,838
doing this process you should know what

1238
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,559
I'm talking about all the vacuum purge

1239
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,119
lighter and a little longer uh just go

1240
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:21,199
lighter and longer less heat don't

1241
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,680
expect to get shatter through the same

1242
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,159
process no no you kind of it's it's not

1243
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,679
supposed to won come out like that some

1244
00:42:25,159 --> 00:42:28,159
of it came out shatter some it is what

1245
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:29,440
we're calling sugary and it looks like

1246
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,920
we [ __ ] up it looks like old school

1247
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,559
hash that we [ __ ] up but it's almost

1248
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,240
clear it tastes so [ __ ] good oh my

effective I'll get him to slow down a

1532
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,639
little bit it's [ __ ] working yeah

1533
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,639
Adam will help us out so I'll even turn

1534
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:37,960
down the music CU it's highly

1535
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:39,920
distracting because I love these songs

1536
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:42,639
task Rock's awesome in my

1537
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:45,519
opinion uh dry

1538
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:47,279
trim wear rubber gloves for almost all

1539
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:51,719
of everything that I'm talking

1540
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:53,319
about uh get the uh the blue nitr gloves

1541
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:54,439
those are those are great they're cheap

1542
00:52:53,318 --> 00:52:57,000
they got them at like Walmart and

1543
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,838
Walgreens they're affordable woo I'm

1544
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,199
high here we go uh

1545
00:52:58,838 --> 00:53:02,759
so uh pull the plant out of the room I

1546
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:05,039
guess and just chop it down to the base

1547
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:06,599
and then hang it upside down I use uh

1548
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:08,039
that bottom Branch the very bottom

1549
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:11,440
Branch where the first [ __ ] set of

1550
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:12,798
buds are I hang that over uh sometimes

1551
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,519
you could string up a line across the

1552
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:16,000
room or maybe use like a coat hanger

1553
00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:17,480
depending on how many you have going on

1554
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,798
but wherever you're hanging it that's

1555
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:20,159
your new little hanger that little y

1556
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:22,440
that first intersection and then I'll

1557
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:23,838
grab like a uh a fuzzy stick pack of

1558
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,920
fuzzy sticks from Walmart it's kind of

1559
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:29,119
like a pipe cleaner

1560
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,680
uh anything like that uh [ __ ] the the

1561
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,640
thing around your bread bag they got a

1562
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:33,480
bunch of those kind of things little

1563
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:35,199
twisty tie sort of thing wrap out around

1564
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,480
the stock and just kind of secure it

1565
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,519
onto whatever you're hanging it to a

1566
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,760
little bit because sometimes that Branch

1567
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:41,920
will break if you got a heavy plant if

1568
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,799
you want to go to the second Branch go

1569
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,358
for that uh secure it on there a little

1570
00:53:43,798 --> 00:53:47,079
bit I like to secure it either way just

1571
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,239
cuz I'm [ __ ] OCD I don't want my

1572
00:53:47,079 --> 00:53:50,920
plants falling in the floor after

1573
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:53,279

00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:26,919
I mean you literally told me I want I

1590
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,000
wish we could play some Grateful Dead

1591
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,440
music without getting the show in

1592
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,239
trouble right now that's where I am high

1593
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,559
I want to listen to Jack straw if

1594
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:34,118
anybody's a dead head out there you know

1595
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,200
where I am if I say I just need to hear

1596
00:54:34,119 --> 00:54:37,640
Jack straw man somebody knows where you

1597
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:39,239
are somebody knows where I am somebody

1598
00:54:37,639 --> 00:54:40,558
wearing a [ __ ] tiedyed shirt is out

1599
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:44,000
there going yeah man and they're GNA

1600
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:45,400
play Jack straw for me all right so we

1601
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,480
got the plant it's hanging upside down

1602
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,680
right uh you need to get off the fan

1603
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:51,119
leaves uh now is a good time to do that

1604
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,558
maybe you did that some Growers do that

1605
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,318
a few days before Harvest maybe I should

1606
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,599
have recommended that uh maybe a few

1607
00:54:54,318 --> 00:54:57,679
days before Harvest go in there and take

1608
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:59,240
off all your big fan leaves uh or you

1609
00:54:57,679 --> 00:55:00,480
can do that right as you harvest or you

1610
00:54:59,239 --> 00:55:01,838
can do it as it's hanging up just get

1611
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,039
those big fan leaves

1612
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,759
off now your plants are hanging upside

1613
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:09,599
down in a room uh you want that room at

1614
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:11,240
like uh [ __ ] I should have wrote this

1615
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:12,200
down because I'm getting really high uh

1616
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:15,000
you don't want a lot of humidity in

1617
00:55:12,199 --> 00:55:16,879
there maybe like 25 to 30% Max maximum

1618
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,239
humidity and then uh and you want to

1619
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,960
have some air moving but not like your

1620
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:22,279
fans blowing directly on the plants

1621
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,440
that'll crisp them up a little too

1622
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,720
quickly you want them to dry a little

1623
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,358
bit slowly while they're hanging upside

1624
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:27,679
down so you got a whole plants hanging

1625
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:29,558
upside down minus fan leaves just

1626
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:31,558
hanging upside down the humidity is kind

1627
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:33,319
of low uh keep your

1628
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:35,160
temperatures uh you don't want to go

1629
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:38,239
cold uh but you don't want to go hot

1630
00:55:35,159 --> 00:55:40,000
either so like 70 75 is like right you

1631
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,519
know right the same that's a good area

1632
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:44,599
for like what they like yeah yeah where

1633
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:46,199
you are is where they're cool um yeah

1634
00:55:44,599 --> 00:55:47,920
might hang kind of like in a work area

1635
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:50,399
where it's a little dark keep it dark in

1636
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:53,720
there uh and I could I would imagine it

1637
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,680
could go to possibly 80 you know like it

1638
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:58,759
80 would probably be up a little faster

1639
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,960
than you want but you know closet if you

1640
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,000
have to you know like that type of thing

1641
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,599
just make sure you're getting air to

1642
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,679
them if you are doing like closet or

1643
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,920
something air because uh moving air

1644
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:10,399
prevents mold just remember that in

1645
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,000
every grow situation moving more air

1646
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,480
prevents mold that's like one of the and

1647
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,119
growing is humid you may not even

1648
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,280
realize how much water is involved in

1649
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:20,720
growing but every gallon you pour in is

1650
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,440
coming back out somewhere and you got to

1651
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:24,679
move that you got to get rid of it or

1652
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:26,039
utilize it somehow so you got these

1653
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:27,318
plant are upside down they're in the

1654
00:56:26,039 --> 00:56:28,640
room with the right humidity they're in

1655
00:56:27,318 --> 00:56:31,719
the room with the right temperature

1656
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:34,118
hopefully it's dark right uh as dark as

1657
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:35,439
you can get it uh you got to dedicate

1658
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:37,358
space you got a lot of air moving so you

1659
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,400
don't get moldy now just let them dry up

1660
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:41,318
for uh [ __ ] I've got some that have been

1661
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:44,240
hanging uh the plants we trim tonight

1662
00:56:41,318 --> 00:56:45,920
were cut down uh on a Monday so they've

1663
00:56:44,239 --> 00:56:47,479
almost been going for two weeks hanging

1664
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,920
up there and it's been a little uh a

1665
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:51,119
little humid because we've had a swamp

1666
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,039
cooler going in that area uh not in that

1667
00:56:51,119 --> 00:56:55,838
area but in a room like three a hallway

1668
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:56,839
down I guess there's a swamp cooler in

1669
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:58,400
there just because that's what that room

1670
00:56:56,838 --> 00:57:00,558
came equipped with so we gotta run that

1671
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,160
enclosed area yeah but uh it's still

1672
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,559
getting it's still it still makes a

1673
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:05,318
little humidity in the rest of the the

1674
00:57:03,559 --> 00:57:08,280
grow environment so whe they're sitting

1675
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:09,599
there hanging for about uh 14 days is

1676
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:11,200
where they've been and they don't have

1677
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,720
any fan leaves on them you might want to

1678
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:15,399
check them every other day uh every day

1679
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:17,279
like start checking about four days 5

1680
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,519
days six days give them a little squeeze

1681
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,280
and when those fan leaves or the little

1682
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:22,038
sugar leaves start crisping right off

1683
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,920
just by hitting them with your finger

1684
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:26,319
grab those plants and just take like

1685
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,760
I've have these long bins and I just

1686
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:29,159
take branches off the I have the plants

1687
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,640
hanging I cut branches off and lay them

1688
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:32,440
into the bins and once my bins are full

1689
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,838
I go to a seated area cuz you got to sit

1690

1724
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:50,199
make chus and it you'll figure out real

1725
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,559
quick yeah so the buds are pretty much

1726
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:54,399
dry right uh we've got them in the room

1727
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:56,280
they hung they're crispy now we're hand

1728
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:58,079
trimming them so cut off like you got a

1729
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,200
bunch of sticks in a band you take that

1730
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:01,000
[ __ ] stick you cut off little

1731
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,480
individual Buds and you just knock the

1732
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,679
leaves off with your thumbs you can use

1733
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,679
scissors now if you want but it's kind

1734
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,798
of pointless I am faster just thumbing

1735
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,318
it it looks like you're playing Nintendo

1736
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:10,038
with the butt in your hand you're like

1737
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:11,920
just going up it should just take you a

1738
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:13,480
couple seconds to get each bud and you

1739
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,358
can see like I said you can see the

1740
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,240
finished result and what's really cool

1741
00:59:15,358 --> 00:59:20,000
is if you wet trim uh you got to trim it

1742
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,879
and you're all sticky and it [ __ ] up

1743
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,719
your scissors and it takes so long and

1744
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,599
every time you set a butt down or touch

1745
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:29,759
a butt it [ __ ] sticky there and

1746
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:32,880
stickier and sticky here uh dry trimming

1747
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,720
is way cleaner uh and this may sound

1748
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,280
weird but as soon as you're done

1749
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:39,118
trimming you can weigh your [ __ ]

1750
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,920
like and this is how much I have yay and

1751
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:42,880
it's done at that the leaves not pull

1752
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:44,680
out moisture anyways I mean they're

1753
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,798
essentially yeah it's ideal to leave

1754
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:48,679
them you know like they're they're ducks

1755
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,159
to for the the place they're they're

1756
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:52,078
what's struggling to suck up the

1757
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,118
moisture not the the bud really I would

1758
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,000
imagine that's yeah that's mostly right

1759
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:58,519
but also it helps slow it down because

1760
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,159
you want the water to leave more slowly

1761
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:02,480
okay because that let the the

1762
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:03,879
chlorophyll evaporates with the water so

1763
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:05,519
once the water's gone you can't take

1764
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:07,119
away any more chlorophyll but if you let

1765
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:08,639
the water come out slowly then that

1766
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,599
chlorophyll dissolves with the water and

1767
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:12,078
goes away oh okay yeah and then it

1768
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:14,200
happens in The Cure process also you

1769
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,640
start uh the gases start convert we're

1770
01:00:14,199 --> 01:00:18,118
getting into cure that's different we'll

1771
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:21,038
go yeah yeah we'll go there later I yeah

1772
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:22,358
it's just um I can tell you now like

1773
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:24,000
most of the videos that I've seen I made

1774
01:00:22,358 --> 01:00:26,000
it an hour and I'm high as [ __ ] on that

1775
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,719
edible it only took like 45 minutes to

1776
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,358
kick in I'm a little better now I've

1777
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:31,759
calmed down but for a minute there I was

1778
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,519
really high your hands are still like on

1779
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,039
your chair like you're holding yourself

1780
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:37,119

1827
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:12,480
cool thing about dry trim as soon as

1828
01:02:10,199 --> 01:02:13,879
you're done dry trimming you can haul

1829

that trim off over to your extract

1830
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,200
artist guy and he can do his thing with

1831

different yeah you couldn't tell the

1834

01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:56,559
time period

1987
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:00,079

1992
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:14,599

is illuminates this purple blue spectrum

1994
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:18,520

1995
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:20,400
the craziest looking [ __ ] thing ever

1996
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:21,920

2002
01:08:31,158 --> 01:08:35,879
really [ __ ] wreck her and take her

2003

them and ask them what time the UFO

2011

the podcast we've been going at it for

2129
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:04,198
an hour and 13 minutes you got anything

2130
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:05,799
cool to say it's your podcast you wanted

2131
01:13:04,198 --> 01:13:07,319
to hang out and do a random episode so I

2132
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,480
wanted to [ __ ] kind of roll with that

2133
01:13:07,319 --> 01:13:09,920
I want to know if we got enough random

2134
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:11,198
in it feels random I feel like I [ __ ]

2135
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:14,399
up a grow L and people count on me and

2136
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:16,119
I'm super high so well ask for details

2137
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:17,158
so what do we do after we got the leaves

2138
01:13:16,119 --> 01:13:18,439
bucked off you throw them in a bucket

2139
01:13:17,158 --> 01:13:19,638
and let them sit there for a couple days

2140
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:22,039
crisp up and then after that you put

2141
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:23,960
them in a jar and start curing that's

2142
01:13:22,039 --> 01:13:26,560
from there is curing and uh I don't know

2143
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:28,198
if I want to get into curing yet that's

2144
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,320
I want to talk about that when I'm not

2145
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:31,759
wrecked so I'm going to write that down

2146
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:33,679
and [ __ ] in two or three episodes

2147
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:37,119
from now guess what we'll do curing cure

2148
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:38,440
some weed that's right I mean that's a I

2149
01:13:37,119 --> 01:13:39,880
know we went way out of order because

2150
01:13:38,439 --> 01:13:41,319
we're only in veg and that actual

2151
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,920
lessons but I was trimming weed tonight

2152
01:13:41,319 --> 01:13:44,840
so it's crispy in my bra a lot of people

2153
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:46,239
don't even know you know what I'm saying

2154
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,000
they literally think you dry it and

2155
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:49,799
that's it no it's got to get cured a

2156
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,760
little bit from now I mean you could I

2157
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,840
understand that you could if you're

2158
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:54,159
sending it out of town you just [ __ ]

2159
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,199
do it but you're going to smoke yourself

2160
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:56,439
or with your homies or use it for

2161
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,158
medical purposes we got to cure right

2162
01:13:56,439 --> 01:14:00,919
now you want to be proud of

2163
01:13:58,158 --> 01:14:02,279
it you know holy crap that edible is uh

2164
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:03,760
bubbling up in my stomach it made me

2165
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:07,599
burp all kinds and it tastes like

2166
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:09,840
[ __ ] weed and [ __ ] peanut

2167
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:11,560
butter yeah all right let's end this

2168
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:14,119
podcast up while we're uh still all

2169
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,840
saying by the way uh I ate 350 milligram

2170
01:14:14,119 --> 01:14:17,439
of cannabis Edibles and I'm okay but I

2171
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:19,360
don't recommend that you do that I can't

2172
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:21,559
Advocate that type of use I recommend uh

2173
01:14:19,359 --> 01:14:24,279
this package says 50 Mig uh I'm going to

2174
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:26,159
say start with 25 or 50 Mig

2175
01:14:24,279 --> 01:14:28,759
technical I dared you to do it so it was

2176
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:29,879
a dare you had to do it I [ __ ] would

2177
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,679
have done it without your dare I'm pry

2178
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:34,319
sure I like to eat a lot of Edibles uh

2179
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:37,920
this thing got me high good uh it comes

2180
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:42,519
in waves is it worth

2181
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:44,239
$11 to me yes um it depends see that's

2182
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:46,320
hard to say because some people like

2183
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:47,799
their spending habits are different like

2184
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:48,960
where you choose to put your money I

2185
01:14:47,800 --> 01:14:50,800
could understand that and this is a

2186
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,520
weird rant but my mom will say

2187
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,480
everything is expensive how much is it

2188
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:56,120
it's two pennies God that's so expensive

2189
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:57,839
because she's from back in the day when

2190
01:14:56,119 --> 01:14:59,800
that was a quarter of a penny so now

2191
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,600
it's a [ __ ] she just sees it oh my

2192
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,840
God so yeah it's just so it's going to

2193
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,480
your but for me that well worth 11 bucks

2194
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,760
is is my [ __ ] really short answer of

2195
01:15:05,479 --> 01:15:09,638
a lot of long

2196
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:12,679
words um I'm just saying usually things

2197
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:14,319
on that level are a lot more if you well

2198
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:15,719
an edible yeah an edible is 10 to 15

2199
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,000
bucks maybe 20 bucks or something really

2200
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,920
potent if you're going to a concert or

2201
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,319
something and you want to get [ __ ]

2202
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,960
high as [ __ ] and not have to worry about

2203
01:15:19,319 --> 01:15:22,639
smoking through it cuz that's why I like

2204
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,560
Edibles I go to a comedy show and you

2205
01:15:22,639 --> 01:15:26,400
can't smoke at The Comedy Works they

2206
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:27,960
will throw you the [ __ ] out and you're

2207
01:15:26,399 --> 01:15:30,279
highly visible in there that place is

2208
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:31,719
Tiny yeah uh so eat a fat edible and

2209
01:15:30,279 --> 01:15:34,238
just sit in there and grin like a [ __ ]

2210
01:15:31,719 --> 01:15:36,520
the whole night [ __ ] this would be

2211
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:40,319
beautiful for that someone likes to say

that's just mine um but this was yeah it

2223
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,079
was worth 11 bucks so if you're going I

2224
01:15:59,238 --> 01:16:02,599
was I was going to go at least I want to

2225
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:04,800
go up there and get some weed and then

2226

and you know what that $11 includeed tax

2227

something I don't know what their option

2231
01:16:16,359 --> 01:16:19,920
is for you because that's super chocy

2232
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:22,039
and if you're diabetic you're going to

2233
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:23,199
have to be careful with that but of
