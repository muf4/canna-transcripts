there excuse me for clearing the throat

78
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,519
i did just take a fat dab right before i

79
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,878
pressed record here took a fat dab of a

80
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,319
concentrate when i bought it i was

81
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:16,878
confused um it is it looks like it says

82
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,238
roig biv red and then luckily i've got a

83
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,239
lot of friends with a lot of cool jobs

84
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,280
somebody told me that this reub i'm

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,640
going to show that to the camera i don't

86
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,719
know if it'll pick it up from that far

87
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:29,039
away but it is the letters r o y g b i v

88
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:31,120
and then the word red i'd read it as roy

89
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,878
biv red one of our good friends told me

90
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,959
that that is actually stan it stands for

91
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,959
red orange yellow green blue indigo and

92
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
violet and red which makes a lot of

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,759
sense because this is a blend of

94
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,360
headbanger and rainbow belts and on the

95
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,719
package the flavor is of school of

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,159
course described as gassy rainbows so i

97
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:49,359
just took a big old fat dab of this it's

98
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,519
got me a little bit choked up it's got

99
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
me coffee so i do apologize for the the

100
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,158
funky throat here at the start of the

101
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:56,080
show that will go away that's what you

102
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:57,919
get when you listen to a dab and a grow

103
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,040
podcast anyway i wanted to let you know

104
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,878
what i'm smoking to let you know why i

105
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,798
sound like like i'm clogged up here at

106
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,878
the start we'll get through that

107
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,560
talking about the dude grow show and the

108
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:08,959
dude grows cup while i was on the dude

109
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,719
grow show i did drop some hints some

110
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,640
information some details that you guys

111
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,400
may not know that i think i should share

112
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,560
here with my audience since i said it on

113
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,959
the dude grow show i recently told you

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,439
that i put the plants out in the

115
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,918
greenhouse to do a breeding project in

116
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,839
the greenhouse i have not revealed what

117
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:29,359
plants are out there but i did say on

118
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,918
the dude grows show that i put a jack

119
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,840
the ripper male outside so the outdoor

120
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,758
pollen donor will be the jack the ripper

121
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,119
plant there are two clones of the jack

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,319
the ripper they're in different places

123
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,439
in the grove of course different places

124
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,360
they can't be both in the same spot

125
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,759
right they're too strategically placed

126
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,240
to jack the ripper males uh the same cut

127
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,919
the same male just two plants uh two

128
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,519
clones of the same plant in different

129
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,439
locations that way we can maximize

130
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,039
pollen uh we know how the air moves in

131
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:54,560
there we know where plants are gonna get

132
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
the most pollen we got it set up how we

133
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,280
want it but the male plants that are in

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,120
there are the jack the ripper so all of

135
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:02,719
the crosses they come from there will be

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
the jack the ripper crosses they will of

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
course all be regular crosses these are

138
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,600
not going to be feminized seeds they

139
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
will be rags so some of the jack the

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
ripper crosses that you have seen may be

141
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,600
being remade restocked with the outdoor

142
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,680
also there may be some brand new stuff

143
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,680
coming keep listening to future episodes

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,280

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,120
everybody a bunch of a great collection

165
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:03,359
of personalities uh ladies and gentlemen

166
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
from across the uh the nation uh great

167
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,639
accents and great people all over the

168
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,720
place good vibes the whole crew is great

169
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,519
but i was on their show and in their

170
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
show

171
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,359
we did fall into a conversation about

172
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,839
flowering times and i do believe that in

173
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,720
that episode i said that flowering times

174
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,638
are often like a speed limit i do make

175
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,280
seeds maybe you're not fully aware i am

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,360
the uh the soul breeder sole proprietor

177
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,799
for ivory genetics premium seeds maybe i

178
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,199
can't say soul anymore because we do

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,120
have the greenhouse and uh but i'm the

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
the lead breeder i guess for ivory

181
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,120
genetics premium seeds everything is

182
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,800
done under my my supervision but what

183
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,478
i'm leaning at is i make the seeds i

184
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,319
make the packaging i put the labels on

185
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,560
the packaging when it comes time to

186
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
determining how long a plant should be

187
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,240
flowered i am the one that writes the

188
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,079
flowering time on the package of seeds

189
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,598
when you get a pack of seeds it's very

190
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,839
common that we'll say

191
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,038
strawberry starburst nine to ten weeks

192
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,959
flowering time that's something that it

193
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,399
would typically say on a seed package

194
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,318
some of them don't say that but it is

195
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,918
listed on the website and if it doesn't

196
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
say that i just have to update the

197
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,079
packaging anyway i am the one that puts

198
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,680
that flowering time on there how do i

199
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,000
determine that flowering time i've

200
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,000
determined that by sending out a lot of

201
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,399
testers of those seeds by growing a lot

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,720
of those seeds myself and taking them to

203
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:16,318
full flower i have a pretty good idea of

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,240
how long they're going to take to flower

205
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,560
because i've grown them enough to have

206
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,720
experience with them history notes

207
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,000
basically experience so i write down

208
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,360
this time it took eight weeks this

209
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,439
phenotype took eight weeks this

210
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,879
phenotype took nine weeks now i put an

211
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,439
average together i put that on the back

212
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:33,598
of the package

213
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,439
it is my suggestion that you flower

214
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,519
those plants for that long that's why i

215
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,639
put that on there now keep in mind there

216
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,879
will be

217
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,560
most of the phenotypes probably 70 to 80

218
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,800
percent of the phenotypes that you find

219
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,560
in those seed packs will fall within the

220
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
time frame that i recommended if i said

221
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
eight to nine weeks or nine to ten weeks

222
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
most of your phenotypes are going to

223
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,479
fall within that window there will be

224
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:56,719
outliers there will be some that most

225
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,159
likely i am not even going to try to say

226
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,599
that some will finish earlier that's

227
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,520
very uncommon people that say their

228
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:03,120
plants finish super early i don't like

229
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,399
that i like later finishing plants i'm

230
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,918
not going to try to hype you up and make

231
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,079
you think they finish earlier than they

232
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:10,159
do they're going to take 9 maybe 10

233
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,598
weeks there may be some phenotypes in

234
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,960
there that do go a little bit longer

235
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,560
than the 9 to 10 weeks that i

236
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,239
recommended on the package but it will

237
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,639
be unlikely that you'll get earlier

238
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,560
finishers but the 10 to 20 percent they

239
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
may go longer you may get 11 you may get

240
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,399
a 12 week finisher that is just how

241
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,399
genetics work sometimes there are

242
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,478
outliers that pop up in population that

243
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:31,120
is just how it goes so it's my

244
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,958
recommendation that you go the time that

245
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,158
i wrote on the package when i say go

246
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,079
nine weeks i don't mean go uh the end of

247
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,158
eight week eight weeks and the start of

248
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
the ninth week i mean finish the ninth

249
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,958
week if i say nine to ten weeks i'm

250
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,200
recommending to finish that 10th week 70

251
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,119
full days and i definitely recommend

252
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,879
going longer on your first run with the

253
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,000
plant this is the first time you're

254
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,759
growing it

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,200
not the last time we need to build a

256
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,879
relationship with this plant and see

257
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,240
what its potential is and what it does

258
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,519
and what it likes and what it doesn't

259
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:04,320
like so the first run why not go 70 days

260
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:10,240
or why not take a few clones and run one

261
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:13,120
60 163 165 167 and 170 and then 172 and

262
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,959
75 i know i'm being that's a dream life

263
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,639
right that's everybody's dream but why

264
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,799
do do what you can to see how long that

265
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,639
plant can go take it the full term and

266
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,879
see what it does it may get really good

267
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,399
at the end some plants beef up bulk up

268
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,919
put on different flavors right at the

269
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,320
end they get super potent right at the

270
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,759
end so give it the opportunity to finish

271
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,399
when i write 9 to 10 weeks i mean 9 full

272
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:36,639
weeks maybe 10 weeks possibly 11 is what

273
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,360
i really mean on there think about it as

274
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,958
a speed limit the speed limit um

275
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,399
it's cool if you go the speed limit but

276
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:44,639
you could go a little slower you could

277
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,639
definitely go a little bit faster there

278
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,000
are exceptions there are there are

279
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:50,720
variables you could do it you could

280
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,919
adjust to traffic also you have to

281
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,519
adjust for phenotypes if i took the same

282
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,039
plant so if i found a plant that

283
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,600
finished i dialed it into where i know

284
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:02,559
that every time 74 days it's done if i

285
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,639
put it in your grow it could take 69 or

286
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,479
it could take 79 days it could take five

287
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,799
days either direction to take a little

288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,039
bit longer or earlier to finish because

289
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,958
of the environment because maybe you're

290
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,519
growing i'm in let's say hypothetically

291
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,278
i'm in cocoa maybe you're in living soil

292
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,480
maybe i'm running hps maybe you're

293
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,399
running led

294
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399
maybe it's really humid in my room maybe

295
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,759
it's really dry and really hot in your

296
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,879
room i don't know the differences but

297
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,879
there could be

298
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,120
all of the variables in our rooms create

299
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,559
more variables within the plant so that

300
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,519
is also going to contribute to the

301
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:35,599
flowering time it may take 74 in my room

302
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
74 it may be overdone dry dead and

303
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,200
crispy in your room maybe it's lights

304
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,440
maybe it's air maybe it's water maybe

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,959
it's soil maybe you sprayed yours maybe

306
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
we're playing different music maybe you

307
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,439
touch yours in a different way it could

308
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,120
be

309
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,200
any kind of different thing that is

310
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,679
making our plans happen every variable

311
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,079
is a variable that you will see in the

312
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:56,078
end so you'll have to adjust four

313
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,919
phenotypes some things may take longer

314
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,759
in different rooms keep in mind i said

315
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,679
it is like the speed limit you don't

316
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,838
have to go the full speed limit you can

317
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,078
go a little bit faster if you would like

318
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,560
so when i put the 9 to 10 weeks on there

319
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,359
i fully recommend you go at least nine

320
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,679
full

321
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,919
weeks maybe go all the way up to 10

322
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,599
maybe 11 weeks all right let's jump into

323
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,958
the next part of the podcast because i

324
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,959
do have another great topic that we

325
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,278
should talk about before i start talking

326
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,359
about it i want to say that i am

327
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,600
i'm not a scientist i don't understand

328
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,680
viruses i don't understand all of the

329
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,800
scientific doctor talk that comes along

330
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,759
with that

331
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,278
i am not a biology major i am a cannabis

332
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,360
grower i learned most of what i know

333
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,278
about cannabis growing by growing

334
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,600
cannabis a lot of people go to school

335
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,720
for it i've got mad respect for you

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,399
for the people that paid for an

337
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,399
education that went to school that is

338
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,480
not how i learn i'm a hands-on learner

339
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,958
so there are some areas where

340
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,120
i am not qualified to teach in a

341
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,879
scientific manner i'm going to teach you

342
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,879
about the hoplate and viroid in the way

343
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,360
that i understand and we'll talk about

344
00:11:54,879 --> 00:12:00,240
the important parts that us as growers

345
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,000
need to do understand and know about so

346
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,480
um where i'm not even going to try to

347
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,320
identify or explain what this virus is

348
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,839
there is a virus that is going around

349
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,839
the cannabis community our plants are

350
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,720
getting infected and getting sick it is

351
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,120
known as the hop latent viroid or hlv is

352
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,800
what i see it listed as all the time uh

353
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
it is decimating crops it is killing

354
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,639
plants once it gets in the plant i don't

355
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,720
know of a way to get rid of it other

356
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,278
than tissue culture that is the only way

357
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,440
you can and that's expensive and also uh

358
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:29,600
not available to everybody so

359
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,920
hop late and viroid how do we prevent

360
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,320
this virus from getting into our plants

361
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,159
a lot of times this virus is transferred

362
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,760
when we are cutting clones or doing work

363
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,159
in the garden like lollipopping and

364
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,639
bottoming if you are working with more

365
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,399
than one i'd like to say change gloves

366
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,159
and clean your scissors between every

367
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,159
plant but i understand sometimes in a

368
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,399
commercial application that is not

369
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,958
viable maybe change gloves and change

370
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,399
clean your scissors between every row or

371
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,919
at least if you're working with like a

372
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,919
row of blueberry and then a row of

373
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,000
strawberry change your gloves and

374
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,240
scissors between those rows so that way

375
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,399
maybe you only infect one row try to

376
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,879
keep the virus contained if you do have

377
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,958
it so what we've got to think about is

378
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,120
be careful not to transfer this virus

379
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,958
from one plant to the other from one

380
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,278
road to the other from one bed to the

381
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,359
other from one section to the other try

382
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,838
to minimize the risk of moving a virus

383
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,240
around the things that we can do is we

384
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:24,000
can clean our scissors i've talked

385
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,560
before about this on the podcast i was

386
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,799
corrected we can use bleach to clean the

387
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,239
scissors rubbing alcohol will not work

388
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,399
clean all of your tools i don't know if

389
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,159
you're using a scalpel a razor blade

390
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,919
scissors maybe just get a bottle of

391
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,600
bleach water and spray everything down

392
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,919
occasionally definitely soak your

393
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,440
scissors in some bleach sterilize clean

394
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,958
everything get it super clean now was

395
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
the time remember when there was a

396
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,239
pandemic and we all went crazy and we

397
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,600
started not everybody but a lot of

398
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,839
people and crazy wearing masks and

399
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,600
gloves now there's a pandemic in the

400
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,279
grow industry in the grow environment

401
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,120
for a while there it was the russet

402
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,120
mites now it seems to be the hoplite and

403
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
viroid so now we've got to prepare and

404
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,799
protect ourselves from that so let's

405
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
clean all of our equipment very

406
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,559
thoroughly very cleanly cleanly is that

407
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,879
the word whatever i'm sticking with it

408
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,119
clean your [ __ ] up real good also change

409
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,720
your gloves uh gloves are hard to get

410
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,919
sometimes i've ordered a lot of gloves

411
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,360
and they seem to be coming in and

412
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,719
they're trickling in all the boxes i

413
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,720
ordered are coming in in small batches

414
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,600
not all at one time so change your

415
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,360
gloves as often as you uh economically

416
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,480
can and as you seem reasonable if you

417
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
work at a commercial grow and you're

418
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,079
changing too much somebody may say

419
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,240
something if you're a home grower try to

420
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:30,879
keep those gloves fresh especially from

421
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,278
like row to row definitely from room to

422
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,039
room so keep yourself clean anytime

423
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,439
you're cutting the plant tearing the

424
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,120
plant removing a leaf make sure that you

425
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,040
are protecting yourself in some sort of

426
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
way the next thing i want to talk about

427
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,319
is are you getting clogged where are you

428
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,600
getting your clones from who are they

429
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,360
coming from are they coming from a

430
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,560
friend are they coming from the mail

431
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,480
there are a lot of services now that

432
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,638
offer clones through the mail

433
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,320
if you do get a clone that comes from

434
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,399
that service and i'm not accusing or

435
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
blaming i'm just saying possibility this

436
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,399
is what could happen if you get that

437
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
clone

438
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,159
that comes from a company that you don't

439
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,278
know or they don't have any you don't

440
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,480
you don't know them you don't what are

441
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,159
you going to do if they send you a clone

442
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,720
with a virus you're not going to find

443
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:10,799
out for 30 60 maybe 90 days that you've

444
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,959
even got a virus by then you've spread

445
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,559
it to your entire grow and your whole

446
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,319
grows got a virus and you paid money for

447
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,000
that clone probably good money for that

448
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,639
clone so where are you getting your

449
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
clones i currently am not accepting

450
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,759
clones from other friends or other

451
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,120
people if you if you're like hey bro i

452
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,439
want to send you a cut and i'm like not

453
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,360
right now it's nothing personal it's

454
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,360
just personal i don't want to get the

455
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,519
virus it's we've got to be careful right

456
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,440
now this stuff i my plants are precious

457
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,759
to me i own a seed company i own a

458
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,000
breeding company i've got to have

459
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,480
imagine if you wiped out my arise mail

460
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
imagine if you wiped out my strawberry

461
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,639
female imagine if he took out my

462
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,240
grateful dog keeper like i don't have

463
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,000
that again it'd be gone so if i got a

464
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
virus it could ruin everything so i've

465
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,919
got to keep everything clean i recommend

466
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,000
you take the same precautions love your

467
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,360
garden love your plants as much as i do

468
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,679
protect that stuff now that being said

469
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,480
do you have backups of your favorite

470
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,399
plants um some of my plants are my

471
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,480
livelihood also some of my plants are my

472
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,039
pride and joy i've made a lot of great

473
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,879
stuff i've got so since i'm limited on

474
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,198
plant count here's where i'll branch off

475
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,879
since i'm limited on plant count i've oh

476
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,799
it took a long time but i've loosened up

477
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:21,600
and i've given clones of some of my

478
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,679
prized possessions to friends of mine to

479
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,440
hold on for me and i really hope and ask

480
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:26,958
them not to spread those clones out but

481
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,199
i'm i'm sure they're gonna end up

482
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,879
somewhere but i tell my friends like hey

483
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,359
i know that you've got a good grow i

484
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,198
don't want to lose this so i give them a

485
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,560
backup the lemon skunk is somewhere in a

486
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,319
grow the golden goats somewhere in a

487
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,239
grow the golden goats all over the place

488
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,759
but the original clone that i've got

489
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,039
it's been shared with friends so they've

490
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,720
got it

491
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,039
a lot of things are a lot of places so

492
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,560
that if things do go wrong if i do get a

493
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,719
virus and things have to get wiped out

494
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,479
and cleaned up hopefully i can email a

495
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,560
few people make a few text messages and

496
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,440
calls and get a lot of my original

497
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,359
lineup back hopefully if they don't get

498
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,759
the virus as well hopefully if i sent

499
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,278
them the plants before i did get the

500
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,480
virus which i don't have so that's fine

501
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,880
they've got the plants but that's how it

502
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,959
would have to go so do you have a backup

503
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,959
plan have you sent your clones somewhere

504
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,240
or have you made s-ones of all of your

505
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,318
favorite plants so that you've got

506
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,240
keepers do you have an idea and a

507
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,279
strategy because this could wipe out

508
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,959
your growth there are a lot of things

509
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,199
that could decimate your grow

510
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,798
but right now the focus is the virus but

511
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,400
do you have a plan do you have a backup

512
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:25,759
for your clones your seeds what's going

513
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,919
on there could be a flood there could be

514
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,679
a power outage one of my biggest fears

515
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,840
is fire all kinds of [ __ ] like that

516
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,679
could wipe out your preserve so do you

517
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,959
have a backup somewhere that's what i

518
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,759
would start thinking about all right

519
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,440
that is my quick ramble on the hlv i

520
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,400
told you i wasn't a scientologist a

521
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,080
biologist but i do know enough to help

522
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,919
protect us as a grower i know what we

523
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,319
should do as growers and farmers to make

524
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:50,480
sure we don't get this into our gardens

525
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,480
i do have one quick email that i will

526
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,558
cover then we're gonna wrap up this show

527
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,960
this email came from our friend who

528
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:59,359
calls themselves aussie dank grower

529
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,360

bro thank you for the love it says

534
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,160
two-part question and i do like that it

535
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,558
says i'm here in prohibition land in

536
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,720
australia the house i live in i am

537
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:19,038
renting and i have a house inspection

538
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,440
coming up i have a five by ten flower

539
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:24,079
room currently in week three and a five

540
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,480
by five and veg what would be the best

541
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,439
way to hide all of these plants that's a

542
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,720
really good uh entertaining question

543
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,320
um

544
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,919
so my first answer would be i would have

545
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,319
kind of planned around this i would have

546
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,160
done a little bit of uh strategy around

547
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,678
the inspections but who knows when the

548
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,759
inspections are coming and it's too late

549
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
to prepare for that now but you guys if

550
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,640
you're thinking about growing setting up

551
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,558
a growth this is the kind of thing that

552
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,480
you need to worry about will there be an

553
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,399
inspection will there be like a housing

554
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,240
inspection a landlord inspection who's

555
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,160
coming in there is there somebody coming

556
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,480
to visit each grove is going to take

557
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,400
about 120 days for completion do you

558
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,640
have that much time without somebody

559
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,120
coming into the home uh the office the

560
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,880
warehouse the garage the shed wherever

561
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,558
you're doing it do you have that much

562
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,760
security it's too late to think about

563
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:09,440
that now the plants are already here

564
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,119
they're already growing you're going to

565
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,000
have to get those plants out of there my

566
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:13,519
dude

567
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
it says what would be the best way to

568
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,839
hide it do i hire a van or a truck or do

569
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,160
i hide them all in a crawl space in the

570
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,879
roof or do you have any other sneaky

571
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,240
ideas then it says because i'm a renter

572
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,120
i'm unable this is the second part of

573
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,640
the question okay sneaky ideas i think

574
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,558
putting them in the crawl space or

575
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,000
something they're gonna stink too bad

576
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:33,359
that's the easy way out that is

577
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,519
definitely the easy way if you can

578
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,119
prevent the aroma i would just drag them

579
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,319
all to another space

580
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,079
but i don't know if you've got the

581
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,399
ability to hide these plants and hide

582
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,480
the aroma from the it's a home

583
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,480
inspection from the you're renting so

584
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,919
it's the landlord probably i don't know

585
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,798
how thorough their inspection is going

586
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,679
to be

587
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,798
sometimes um it depends on the rest of

588
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,400
the house you know what i mean if you

589
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:55,918
walk in and the living room looks really

590
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,440
good and it's all vacuumed and there's a

591
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,960
blanket over the couch and pillows on

592
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,919
the couch like civilized humans live

593
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,279
there uh there's not piles of beer cans

594
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,559
and [ __ ] cigarette butts everywhere

595
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:05,599
and i'm not i mean you can have a beer

596
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:06,639
can and a cigarette but i mean like

597
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,038
piled up in the corner you shouldn't

598
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
have [ __ ] recyclable cans just piled

599
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,000
up over there like it's a [ __ ]

600
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,039
sculpture that's when the landlord's

601
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
going to want to look around and see

602
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:15,839
more they're like how much are they

603
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,839
ruining my house but if you go in and

604
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,759
you got like some house plants that look

605
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,038
decent you got like i said a blanket on

606
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,720
the couch that's folded you know what i

607
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,400
mean like like nice people put a blanket

608
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,759
over the top of the couch and just clean

609
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,280
it up don't clean up the toilet so

610
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,640
there's not piss everywhere just make

611
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:29,918
them think that you're doing a little

612
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,960
bit of work on the house keeping it

613
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,240
looking good when they walk through

614
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,240
they'll go yeah we're out here this

615
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,759
looks good but who knows what they're

616
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,919
gonna do they could climb under

617
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,480
everything they could get in stuff so

618
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,000
i would consider renting uh a moving van

619
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,279
here we call it a u-haul i don't know

620
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,960
what you call it there but that's

621
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,798
probably something similar a penske or

622
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,840
something the big box truck just load

623
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,519
them in there maybe you can rent

624
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,959
something smaller throw them in there

625
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,558
for the time being

626
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,400
but you got to think about climate and

627
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,918
temperature control in there

628
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,600
you also have to think about security of

629
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,200
the plants while they're in there you

630
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,119
got to pay for the truck there's a lot

631
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,679
of things to think about there so

632
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:05,439
i probably would rent that truck and

633
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,120
throw them in there this is why i

634
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,880
recommend grow tents a lot of people are

635
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:11,038
not fans of grow tents but if you had

636
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,400
two grow tents uh you could just move

637
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,000
the plants move the tents take

638
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,360
everything out then put it all back

639
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,359
right now what you've got to do is get

640
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,798
rid of the plants then all the gear

641
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,479
possibly you got to move all the gear

642
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,720
too they can't see the equipment then

643
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,159
you got to clean up the floor

644
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,679
you got to clean up all of the evidence

645
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,919
you can't have any leaves no nutrient

646
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,519
bottles get rid of all of it so be very

647
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,600
strategic

648
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,038
the more i talk about it the more i see

649
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,359
you putting all of this into a moving

650
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,440
fan because you gotta load up everything

651
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,678
all the gear nothing can be spotted

652
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:41,038
because one small thing will make them

653
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,280
think that you're growing in there if

654
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,119
they do a deep enough of an inspection

655
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,558
so that's the first part i'd go with the

656
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,399
truck if that's an option go rent the

657
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,079
moving van and do that then it says

658
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,640
because i'm a renter i'm unable to scrog

659
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,480
my plants in case of having to move them

660
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,440
would a scrog method be more beneficial

661
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,279
or would you recommend another technique

662
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,880
um what you already know that you may

663
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,158
have to move these plants

664
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
excuse me for the throat clearing i do

665
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,440
apologize it's very unprofessional but

666
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,319
it's already happening so what am i

667
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,080
going to do

668
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,918
um we already know that you may have to

669
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,119
move the plants you've got to do it so a

670
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,320
scrog would have screwed you you would

671
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,599
have been [ __ ] you couldn't get the

672
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,359
plant you would not be able to get them

673
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,000
out of there to move them so that would

674
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:20,399
have caused you uh much more problems so

675
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
i think maybe if you can individually

676
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,840
scrog each plant i don't know how big

677
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,919
your pots are if you've got something

678
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,839
bigger than a seven or a ten gallon pot

679
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,600
you can put sticks in the corners and

680
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,038
make like a scrog out of those sticks

681
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,439
and kind of control the plant with that

682
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,359
one or use a tomato cage or start

683
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,798
topping it but you absolutely are

684
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:38,558
correct that a scrog may not be

685
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:40,400
beneficial

686
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:42,558
another technique maybe just tomato

687
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,240
cages tomato cages are great i've seen

688
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,440
people use tomato cages on your

689
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,839
australian so i don't know if you call

690
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,840
them the same thing it's three hoops

691
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:51,839
with three legs and you just shove the

692
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,519
legs down into the soil the plants start

693
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,918
to grow up and then you just pull the

694
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,279
branches underneath the horizontal hoops

695
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
just pull the branches underneath there

696
00:22:57,279 --> 00:22:59,839
so that it gets more space and more

697
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,919
airflow

698
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,918
or you can also flip that tomato cage

699
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,280
upside down be careful with that pointy

700
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,200
and those will go in your eye cut those

701
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:09,038
off and you can use those hoops the same

702
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,960
way to spread it out you can also use a

703
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,879
lot of bamboo sticks i see people put

704
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,038
bamboo sticks around the pot and then

705
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,480
just use that to tie the uh tie the

706
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,480
branches down to the sticks or just to

707
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,919
fix it to the sticks also they make a

708
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,240
lot of those new

709
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,759
lst clips is what i think they call them

710
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,359
we can bend the branch over and just put

711
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:26,960
a little clip on it and you can shape

712
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,240
the branches by using these little clips

713
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,640
those are great tools if you learn how

714
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,679
to use those but we definitely know that

715
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:35,440
scrogging is not part of the options

716
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,919
let's see it wraps up it says i love the
