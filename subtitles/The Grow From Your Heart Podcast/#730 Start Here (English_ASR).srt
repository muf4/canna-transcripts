108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
uh cannabis related content one of the

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,959
things i wanted to talk about on this

110
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,119
episode was simply be careful on social

111
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,199
media i have noticed that there are

112
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,080
several instagram accounts that are

113
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,158
mimicking my instagram account i am irie

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,000
underscore genetics that is me that's

115
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,839
the only account that i'm using there is

116
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
the grow from your heart podcast account

117
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,599
there is the rosta jeff account i rarely

118
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,519
log into those just once in a while when

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
i realize i've got so many messages i

120
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,159
should check don't check those very

121
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,478
often

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,199
i am irie underscore genetics i am not

123
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,758
the other accounts i'm not

124
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:35,439
irie.genetics i'm not irie

125
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:37,600
genetic.s i'm none of those accounts

126
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,160
those accounts have been attempting to

127
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,400
sell seeds to people on instagram i do

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,439
not do that don't fall for the scam

129
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,638
be very careful also one of the things i

130
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,560
wanted to talk about somebody was

131
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,079
telling me that they take great photos

132
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
uh they're a great grower but they are

133
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,240
afraid to post because of their location

134
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,600
and their legality and they don't really

135
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,759
want their face out there they just

136
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,919
wanted their plants to be seen my advice

137
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,600
to them was just don't post bro if you

138
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,198
really are that worried about it if

139
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,639
you're that sketched out about it

140
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,319
there's no need to post if you're not

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,840
gonna put your face on there if you're

142
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,439
not gonna link up with people and do

143
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:10,799
business through the instagram which i

144
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,918
don't recommend anyway that's a good way

145
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,439
to get robbed that's a good way to get

146
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,038
your money taken if you're the buyer the

147
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:17,038
seller it will go wrong for you if

148
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,399
you're doing drug deals on instagram but

149
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,079
if you're not trying to do something

150
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,679
where you need to be known remain

151
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,079
anonymous remain in the shadows my

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,879
friend is a uh a free market grower

153
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,560
allegedly and nothing he does uh gets

154
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,000
left behind it all goes somewhere so i

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,000
was like bro don't even post to social

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,680
media there's no need to open up that

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
pandora's box if you're not out there

158
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,759
don't be out there

159
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,360
so be careful on social media one of the

160
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,319
things i wanted to segue into is that

161
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,759
our phones do put a lot of data in our

162
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,159
photos when we take a picture of

163
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,919
something with our iphone with our any

164
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280

168
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,720
that photo your phone is marking down

169
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,879

184
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,478
i did not do it the phone did that it

185
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,478
knew i was at meow wolf so be careful

186
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,478
when you're taking pictures because that

187
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,079
data is stored in your phone i don't

188
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:33,918
know what you're going to do with that

189
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:35,758
photo once you have taken it i don't

190
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,399
know how much of that data travels with

191
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,319
that photo when you post it but that

192
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:43,120
data is in your phone that data is there

193
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,039
that picture the location the time the

194
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,199
coordinates it is all right there so if

195
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,439
that phone perhaps could land in the

196
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,360
wrong hands or that info could land in

197
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,199
the wrong hands it could get you in some

198
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,479
sort of trouble especially if you

199
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,319
shouldn't be growing where you're

200
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,399
growing when you're growing why you're

201
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,639
growing be very careful now i don't

202
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:02,079
again i'm not the computer expert i

203
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,120
don't know about this part i don't know

204
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,519
how much

205
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,360
comes along with that photo when you

206
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,519
post it i don't know if instagram gets

207
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,120
the metadata i don't know if uh facebook

208
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:12,478
gets that data i don't know if cannabis

209
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,478
gets that data i don't know if any of

210
00:07:12,478 --> 00:07:15,918
those servers where we share our info

211
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,519
where we share the photos i don't know

212
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,560
if they get the data that is attached to

213
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,719
that photo

214
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,160
with the new photos app on the iphone

215
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,240
you can actually click on the photo and

216
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
you can see all of the data i can see

217
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,038
the location the time i can see what

218
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,360
settings my camera was on when i took

219
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,598
the photo if i dig deeper i can probably

220
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,840
see how far the subject was away what my

221
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,680
aperture setting was i can tell a lot of

222
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,918
stuff just digging into the phone just a

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,199

271

my real seeds there are a couple of

272
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,838
brands a couple of companies out there

273
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,600
that just buy buckets of random seeds

274
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,040
put them in labels and tell you that

275
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
they're my brand and sell them to you

276
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,039
they do it to a lot of other famous

277
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,159
popular brands so be careful out there

278
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:28,399
be careful where you are purchasing your

279
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,719
seeds i have a correction to make in a

280
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:33,039
previous episode i was talking about

281
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
autoflower seeds i talked about dads

282
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,559
yeah that was a quick segue i'm sorry if

283
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,039
i lost you i was in a previous episode i

284
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:42,239
was talking about daz making autoflower

285
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,399
seeds with some irie genetics lines

286
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,399
in that episode i mentioned that to the

287
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,440
best of my knowledge it takes

288
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:52,240
approximately five or six filial

289
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,160
generations to create an autoflower line

290
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,839
well after conversation with daz i

291
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,799
realized i'm wrong as [ __ ] and i don't

292
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,399
know what i'm talking about when it

293
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,159
comes to autoflowers which is fine with

294
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,078
me i've admitted that that's not what

295
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,879
i'm into but daz says

296
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,719
he can make autoflowers by the third

297
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:08,240
generation they'll be solid auto it'll

298
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,160
start popping up in the second it'll be

299
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,440
locked in by the third by that fourth

300
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,000
generation they're definitely

301
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,480
autoflowers so uh i needed to correct

302
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,799
that because i misspoke in a previous

303
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,959
episode another thing i should mention

304
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,559

336
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,600
have what you want if they don't have

337
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,519

338
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,600
to say than it looked just wait a little

339

they still don't when they do get the

341
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,799

that over there where do we go from here

345
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,838
i am making selections today i made

346
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,920
selections for the outdoor breeding run

347
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,519
which will happen this summer uh no i'm

348
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:49,919
not gonna tell you what i selected but i

349
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,639
am very excited to have made selections

350
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:56,000
to put in the outdoor breeding run this

351
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,600
summer fall season i am stoked i'll leak

352
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
some info i'll let you guys know what's

353
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,680
going on in the near future but i wanted

354
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,560
to say that i'm super excited to have

355
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,799
the outdoor plants prepared for the

356
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:09,838
summer and speaking of seeds the

357
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,679
feminized seed project is working that's

358
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,839
right uh if you've been following along

359
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,559
you know that recently i made a batch of

360
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:20,000
silver thio sulfate spray which i use to

361
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,679
reverse three female golden goat plants

362
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,480
those three golden goat plants will be

363
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,319
used to pollinate a lemon skunk and uh

364
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,399
platinum tangy and of course another

365
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,680
golden goat also several other female

366
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,958
plants in the room that don't need to be

367
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,838
mentioned right now

368
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,119
but my point is that the reversal is

369
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
working that

370
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,480
female plant is starting to make pollen

371
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:40,399
sacks i see the male parts on there

372
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,079
they're developing the balls are nice

373
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,000
and big they're turning purple doing

374
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,000
exactly what i want that golden goat

375
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,958
plant to do at this phase at this time

376
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,200
at this stage the pollen receiver plants

377
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,799
have been dragged into the room they are

378
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,839
now kicking into flower they're not too

379
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:55,599
far in there but they're starting to

380
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,320
show me pre-flower

381
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,079
the feminized project is well underway

382
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
so here and i don't want to say a time

383
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,519
frame because you guys will hold me too

384
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,838
closely to it i may need a few days

385
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,440
worth of leeway some time here some some

386
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,480
buffer zone what's it called the grace

387
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,320
period that's the word i'm trying to

388
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,959
think of i may need a brief grace period

389
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,120
however the lemon jeffery orange gasm

390
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,599
golden goat feminized and many more

391
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,399
femme seeds will be restocked here

392
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:23,120
in a short time uh once again short time

393
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,399
to a breeder is not as much time uh you

394
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,839
guys are gonna think it's been a long

395
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,078
time so be patient with me they're

396
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,399
coming that's my point femme seeds are

397
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,559
coming uh the reversal is looking good

398
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,600
the golden goat that i sprayed uh every

399
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,679
third day for up to day 21 at 70

400
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,199
dilution is the one that made uh it will

401
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,120
make the most paul and it looks like in

402
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,879
my opinion uh so far from what it looks

403
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,799
like with my observations but that is

404
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,559
the one that appears to uh be ready to

405
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,879
make the most pollen it worked the

406
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,799
silver was perfect in my opinion i did

407
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,958
the mix just right sprayed just right

408
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,319
i'm excited to get the femme seeds made

409
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,958
for you guys because you guys have been

410
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,720

416
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,440
com all right where do we go from here

417

418
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,720
to ramble about in this podcast then we

419
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,958
will wrap it up go take some dabs and

420
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,720
have a party i was talking with a friend

421
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,879
recently at an event and we were talking

422
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,360
about setting up a brand new grow and as

423
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,439
i was mentioning the parts the needs the

424
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,680
components uh the instructions and

425
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,279
details of a grow i could watch my

426
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,799
friends eyes kind of turn into the back

427
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,639
of their head and their face glazed over

428
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,559
and i saw them check out and i was like

429
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,079
you good bro and he's like

430
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,359
i can't afford half of the [ __ ] that you

431
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,759
just mentioned i don't have half that

432
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,199
much time and then i thought

433
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,559
you know

434
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:45,919
it shouldn't intimidate you what i'm

435
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,559
saying is how you grow top shelf uh cup

436
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,000
winning uh medical grade perfect weed

437
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,759
this is the best weed you can grow with

438
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,958
all of these details

439
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,439
you don't have to start off growing cup

440
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,799
winning championship weed you should not

441
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,560
start off growing cup winning

442
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,879
championship nobody starts off as a

443
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:04,479
black belt nobody starts off as a master

444
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,078
you've got to start off as a white belt

445
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,440
in any craft in which you start you got

446
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,120
to be a beginner

447
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
or you're going to fail later on if you

448
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,720
don't start off as a beginner learn the

449
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
basic steps the fundamentals you'll

450
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,278
never get truly good at anything so

451
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,879
sometimes when i'm talking about all of

452
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,159
the things that are needed to grow good

453
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,240
cannabis sometimes when i'm talking

454
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,639
about all the equipment the nutrients

455
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,839
the purchases the cost of entry uh the

456
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,919
time that it's gonna require the

457
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,600
modifications and or adjustments to your

458
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,639
home

459
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,879
that is for top shelf grade a

460
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,519
award-winning best cannabis you could

461
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,838
possibly consume you can grow some

462
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,759
cannabis that you can smoke and enjoy

463
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,480
with very minimal equipment cost setup

464
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,639
time effort the time effort energy and

465
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,560
equipment that you've got will produce

466
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,320
cannabis it may not be

467
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,239
the way that i describe it

468
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,639
you can put a lot of effort into it so

469
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,440
think about it this way i'm 6'5 and i

470
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,680
weigh about 190 pounds i am super skinny

471
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,440
i obviously don't put a lot of time into

472
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,120
beefing up i'm not getting bulky i got

473
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,639
cardio for days i'm strong enough for

474
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,320
what i need to do i don't want to get

475
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,839
big and bulky that's just not for me

476
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,040
maybe one day but that's never been a

477
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,959
thing on my brand i don't need to be

478
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:15,120
huge but then you look at brock lesnar

479

right there's brock lesnar brock lesnar

480
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,879

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,959
lesnar uh if you want the plants that

490
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,639
look like brock lesnar plants you need

491
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,719
all of the nutrients all the equipment

492
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,799
the best lights the best seeds the best

493
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,199
soil you also have to be in that grow

494
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,439
space twice a day checking on everything

495
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,120
making sure that everything is fed

496
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,199
making sure that every leaf that needs

497
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,198
to be defoliated is defoliated making

498
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:54,559
sure that the stems and sticks are

499
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,159
popped and twisted and everything's

500
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,919
lollipop and if you're trellising it's

501
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,958
trellis correctly you're in there twice

502
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,559
a day you're in there right when the

503
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:01,679
lights come on and then once again right

504
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,558
before the lights go off here and

505
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,318
they're doing work every single day or

506
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:08,160
if you want to you could grow some

507
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,918
plants that look like me they're tall

508
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,759
they're skinny they're lanky but they'll

509
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,038
get the job done at the end of the day

510
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,640
you didn't have to spend a whole bunch

511
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,640
of time in the gym a whole bunch of time

512
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,038
on a diet plan and you'll accomplish the

513
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,240
goal but when you stand us next to each

514
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,759
other you'll go that dude right there

515
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,679
obviously spent more [ __ ] time in the

516
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,359
gym and that guy was playing video games

517
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,280
or recording podcasts or some [ __ ] over

518
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,279
there definitely not in the gym lifting

519
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,279
weights that's definitely not me you can

520
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,119
see that you'll see that in the grow now

521
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,279
with that being said

522
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,959
i don't want you to start off being the

523
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,200
best grower ever i want you to start off

524
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,919
with the equipment you can afford in the

525
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,360
space that you can afford with the best

526
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,038
light and the best genetics you can

527
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,798
afford and then piece it together after

528
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,319
that figure out how to control the light

529
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,240
cycle in the room once you've got a

530
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,240
space where you can control the light

531
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,759
cycle now you can focus on putting a

532
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,279
light in there putting some seeds in

533
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,640
there putting all of the better

534
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,960
equipment in there then you grow a

535
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,880
couple of crops read a few books before

536
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,480
you grow anything read a book then as

537
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,760
you grow you'll experience problems and

538
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,679
you'll see things you'll see things you

539
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,079
want to improve on keep reading more

540
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,919
books watch more podcasts learn things

541
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:12,079
but just like any hobby

542
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,640
most most people don't have the

543
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,558
advantage the blessing the uh they just

544
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,640
don't have the funding to go out and buy

545
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,399
the best equipment for a brand new hobby

546
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,640
if you're gonna start karate if you're

547
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,240
gonna buy the drums if you're gonna buy

548
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,600
baseball equipment if you're gonna get

549
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,919
into hockey if you're gonna be a new

550
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:30,319
podcaster most of us don't have the

551
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,480
blessings the advantage to go and just

552
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,000
buy the most expensive best [ __ ] which

553
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,679
is what we like to do for our grow room

554
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,038
that would be ideal you just go to the

555
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,038
grow store and you say i want the best

556
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:41,038
light the best tint the best [ __ ]

557
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,359
dehumidifier the best soil best

558
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,279
nutrients hit up rasta jeff get the best

559
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,959
genetics get all the best [ __ ] i

560
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,359
understand we can't all do that all of

561
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,840
the best [ __ ] costs a lot of money so

562
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:53,359
get the best light get a good tent get a

563
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,279
good environment something in which you

564
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,959
can control the light and dark cycles

565
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,119
that's going to be one of the main

566
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,360
elements which we need then after that

567
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,599
get a good light then get good genetics

568
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,439
i don't i'd recommend good seeds but you

569
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:06,879
can get clones clones are tried and true

570
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,000
maybe your friend grew them saved you a

571
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,520
step already you know they're good

572
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,599
clones but maybe also your friends

573
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,960
selected some [ __ ] maybe you need to

574
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,359
get some seeds and find the good [ __ ]

575
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,279
but spend the money on a good enclosure

576
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,918
a good tent to build something somewhere

577
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,918
you can control the light the dark and

578
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,160
the environment then spend money on a

579
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,759
good light then good genetics then from

580
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,279
there everything else will come into

581
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,400
place you're going to need fans

582
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,839
dehumidifier something to control the

583
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,519
climate and the room some sort of air

584
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,000
exchange a blower

585
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,759
stuff like that ph pen nutrients all

586
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,798
that stuff will come in line but by the

587
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,480
best

588
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,639
light and nutrients that you can get to

589
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,720
start off with then as you get better

590
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,400
you will buy more things if you are

591
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,480
growing for production if you're making

592
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,400
a profit off of this how about every

593
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,160
time you harvest you put a good portion

594
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,559
of that harvest back into your grow

595
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,600
space and into your skill if you're able

596
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:59,519
to pull a pound of ok weed this time how

597
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,918
about next time we pull a pound and a

598
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,759
quarter of even better weed and the next

599
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,600
time a pound and a half of even better

600
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,759
wheat and we work our way up until we're

601
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,399
pulling three pounds of light of [ __ ]

602
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,240
top shelf amazing impressive weed in

603
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,320
every grow this isn't your last grow

604
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,240
this first time when we build this this

605
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,158
is your first grow this is just the

606
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,919
starting run get a bike with some

607
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,280
training wheels get a helmet and just

608
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,200
start training you're going to crash a

609
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,879
couple of times find out if you're even

610
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,880
into it find out if you can dedicate the

611
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,559
time the energy the space

612
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
it's a commitment it's like getting a

613
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,079
puppy but at the end of it you get to

614
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,519
smoke it and take some dabs if you do it

615
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:35,599
right so you're gonna have to spend some

616
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,038
time some energy some love some money

617
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,678
some adjustments into there there are

618
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:42,480
some commitments uh some sacrifices some

619
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,400
dedication to be put into these plants

620
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,079
so just like any other hobby you start

621
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,240
you don't need to start off with the

622
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,439
best equipment uh when i got into

623
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,880
drumming i've been playing the drums i

624
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,480
like to use the drums for a good example

625
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,640
because i've been playing the drums uh

626
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,240
for over i don't even want to say how

627
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,960
many years i feel old i've been playing

628
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,200
the drums for over 20 years 25 years

629
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,640
holy [ __ ] i've had a drum set for over

630
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,880
25 years

631
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,038
when i bought my first drum set i

632
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,559
thought i knew exactly what i wanted i

633
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,400
thought i wanted this here this here

634
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:13,440
these things here this this i thought i

635
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,360
wanted these pedals now my drum set is

636
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,240
nothing like what it was when i designed

637
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:20,479
it when i was 15. i understand that my

638
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,558
body my physical

639
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,279
needs my skill

640
00:21:22,558 --> 00:21:28,000
my setup for my body and my drums and my

641
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:30,000
budget and my ability it has all changed

642
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,519
and evolved in so many ways that the

643
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,038
idea of what i thought i was going to

644
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,319
play how i thought i was going to play

645
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:36,480
who where and when i thought i was going

646
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:39,279
to play with none of that is the same

647
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,159
now so my entire drum set is different

648
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:44,879
also my grow spaces have evolved

649
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,360
dramatically they also still continue to

650
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,840
evolve seasonally every season i change

651
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:51,678
stuff uh i've gotten to the point where

652
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,359
i can see what's happening to the plants

653
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,038
really quickly i can make changes on the

654
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,519
fly i'm not afraid to make some changes

655
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,919
and screw some [ __ ] up so now i try to

656
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,879
add or change or subtract or different

657
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,520
uh adjust modify uh change something

658
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,679
almost every run every other run so that

659
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,519
i can see where i can improve or see

660
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,679
what products work or see what doesn't

661
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,400
work sometimes if you've been following

662
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,320
along

663
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,640
you you learned that last winter i

664
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,918
learned that i should not switch to leds

665
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,159
right at the beginning of the [ __ ]

666
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,400
winter season i went from my hbs to

667
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,640
brand new leds that like a week later

668
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
was negative 17 degrees outside there

669
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
was no way to keep my grow space cold

670
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,599
because the hps lights that i had in

671
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,199
there were doing that so now i've

672
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,359
learned not to switch that [ __ ] in the

673
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,000
middle but my grow space is always

674
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,918
evolving ever changing new ideas new

675
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,359
equipment just like my drum set just

676
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,799
like your guitar setup just like your

677
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,199
hockey gear just like whatever you're

678
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,879
into all of our [ __ ] evolves so when

679
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,480
you're getting started

680
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,960
don't let all the stuff i talk about

681
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,200
intimidate you i say a lot of things you

682
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,240
need a light a tent

683
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,000
pots soil a dehumidifier possibly a

684
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,240
humidifier maybe an air conditioner

685
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,960
maybe a heater uh definitely some sort

686
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,798
of extraction fan to move humidity and

687
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,960
heat from the room then maybe a duct to

688
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,879
pull fresh air into the room then we

689
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,120
need some sort of ph monitor then we

690
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,720
need an ec monitor then we need all

691
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,798
kinds of mixing equipment then we need

692
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,120
nutrients also it'd be cool to have a

693
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,639
vpd monitor in the room there are so

694
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,439
many things to think about then i'd like

695
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,038
to add co2 and a co2 monitor then i want

696
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,558
to build an auto watering system and

697
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,158
then i want to do this and then all of

698
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,158
this and then i'm going to talk about

699
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,280
trichomes and terpenes and testing

700
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,520
numbers and

701
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,359
days and durations and [ __ ]

702
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,119
productivity of all kinds of things but

703
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,558
guess what that's just because i've been

704
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,719
doing it for a long time don't let all

705
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,639
that [ __ ] intimidate you nature grows

706
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,480
wheat outside every year all the time

707
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,480
without us nobody gets involved and that

708
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,159
[ __ ] happens beautifully just the way

709
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,919
that whatever you believe in the way

710
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,278
that nature the way that jaw the way

711
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,759
that buddha the way that the flying

712
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:51,519
spaghetti monster intended it to happen

713
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,000
it happens outside so it can definitely

714
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,679
happen indoors just let it happen screw

715
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,519
it up as little as you can stay out of

716
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,278
the way and you don't need all the fancy

717
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,839
[ __ ] you can start off with a little bit

718
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,119
of [ __ ] build up as you go and then i

719
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,480
didn't start off with the greatest stuff

720
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,319
i had a little tiny light that kind of

721
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,679
flickered sometimes when it came on it

722
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,720
hummed and made a weird noise and i was

723
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,640
afraid i was going to burn down the

724
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,400
freaking house i had a little tent that

725
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,679
had light leaks i put duct tape all over

726
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,080
the light leaks

727
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,400
i grew two good rounds in that the first

728
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,839
one we smoked all of it the second run i

729
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,759
sold it and made enough money out of

730
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,199
that second run allegedly possibly there

731
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:26,240
was medical marijuana then so this was

732
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,720
legit maybe possibly uh sold that second

733
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,200
crop and bought another tent that was

734
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,558
twice the size and bought another light

735
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,038
bought an air conditioner bought a

736
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:36,798
blower and had two grow spaces now and

737
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:39,440
turned one into a veg space one into a

738
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,200
flower space started production then

739
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,640
every time i would harvest another crop

740
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,240
i would just buy another piece of gear

741
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,559
another piece of gear a better piece of

742
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,000
gear uh that piece sucks let's buy a new

743
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,678
one when we harvest and get another one

744
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,960
and just make a wish list when you

745
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,720
harvest you're going to have some money

746
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,319
if you do it right you're either going

747
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,679
to save the money you've been spending

748
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,319
on product or you're going to flip some

749
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,000
of it and make a profit reinvest in your

750
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,000
business your grow is now your business

751
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,440
your hobby your passion put some money

752
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,359
into it it's going to put some love back

753
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,120
into you spend some energy some time

754
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,119
some effort on it and you will learn you

755
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,879
