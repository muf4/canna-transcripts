that with the content that you are used

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,640
to so I think that is all of the

94
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,199
business where do I want to go now let's

95
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,079
talk about some really cool [ __ ] that's

96
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,060
been happening in my garden recently I

97
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,680
popped a few new seeds that's right I

98
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:49,378
moved some plants out time to move some

99
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,360
new [ __ ] in so I popped some new seeds I

100
00:03:49,378 --> 00:03:52,979
have got some of my own crosses going

101
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,379
and I've got crosses from some other

102
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,179
people going I wanted to run some of my

103
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:59,399
seeds so that I can open up my breeding

104
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,260
projects and add some of my lines to the

105
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,539
mix and I also wanted to introduce brand

106
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,979
new stuff so what would we talk about

107
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:08,039
let's tell you that I put some Double

108
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,658
Dragon seeds in my bedroom their

109
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,519
seedlings they're about this tall at

110
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:12,979
this point if you're only listening I

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,180
think that's six or eight inches tall

112
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:16,620
they're little tiny babies but they're

113
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,660
looking good there's some double dragon

114
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,798
babies in there uh what else could I

115
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,260
tell you about there are big mountain

116
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,879
fudge cake babies in there those both

117
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:26,879
came from my lineup I think those are

118
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:30,478
two great strains then also there is

119
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:32,339
some banana God version 2 from my buddy

120
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,139
Masonic smoker big shout out to mace

121
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,418
also big shout out to my buddy Billy

122
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,918
bunk smoking for giving me the pack uh

123
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:39,478
also shout out to my buddy Terps there

124
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,698
was a conspiracy involved there in

125
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,099
getting me that pack of banana God uh

126
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,840
Terps and Billy bong conspired said that

127
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,180
I should breed with the banana God Terps

128
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,459
told Billy to buy me the pack Billy got

129
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,199
the pack from mace Billy handed me the

130
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:53,399
pack in an event with a big smile on his

131
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,439
face and I knew what was supposed to

132
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,478
happen from there have no fear you guys

133
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,100
the banana God has been germinated it is

134
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:01,139
growing strong and it looks really good

135
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,460
there should be some great winners in

136
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:04,319
that pack I don't know if we'll find a

137
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,819
male or a female hopefully there's a

138
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,978
breeding candidate in there so we can do

139
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,079
some breeding with the banana in the

140
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:13,379
future also in this same run of seeds

141
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,000
are some Jamaican Lamb's bread f4s that

142
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,978
are growing but they don't look as

143
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,959
vigorous as the rest of the batch I need

144
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:20,459
to let them go a little longer we'll see

145
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,258
if they come around I've recently fed

146
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:25,079
them a little more heavily I've also

147
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,520
increased the DLI in that room uh to get

148
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:28,740
them a little bit more light we can see

149
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,060
if we could turn those plants up just a

150
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,038
little bit but so far the Jamaican

151
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,199
Lamb's bread those are kind of older

152
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:36,478
seeds that were kind of smaller and

153
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,160
those seeds aren't looking as good as

154
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,300
the rest of the room but those are the

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,039
strains I'm going to tell you about in

156
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,600
that room right now there's the uh the

157
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,579
Double Dragon there's big mountain fudge

158
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,199
cake there's banana God and there's the

159
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:47,819
Jamaican Lamb's bread there might also

160
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,500
be something else Secret in that room

161
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,478
because I don't share everything I gotta

162
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,978
have some Secrets but I like to let you

163
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:55,439
know kind of what's going on in that

164
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,000
grow room also an update on that grow

165
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,339
room here's something I really wanted to

166
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,918
talk about recently I purchased an

167
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:03,119
iPhone app that is called Photon let me

168
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,859
make sure that's really what it's called

169
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,120
because I just wrote down Photon off of

170
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,220
memory I want to make sure that I'm

171
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,680
giving you the correct info yes it is

172
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,600
Photon

173
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,240
p-h-o-t-o-n-e it is the photon app in my

174
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,939
iPhone so the photon app is basically a

175
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,579
par meter or a DLI meter you download

176
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,439
the app the application is free then you

177
00:06:20,579 --> 00:06:24,659
will need to buy an add-on for the app

178
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:27,120
depending on what kind of light you have

179
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:28,979
you have to buy an add-on for that spec

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,600
Trump not every Spectrum comes for free

181
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:31,859
but it's like somewhere between three

182
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,720
and five bucks I don't remember what I

183
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,759
paid it didn't hurt at all I just paid a

184
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,319
couple of bucks to buy a download to

185
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,699
have the appropriate Spectrum for the

186
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:40,740
lights I'm running in my room so I

187
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:42,780
downloaded the the appropriate LED

188
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,280
Spectrum then it teaches you how to make

189
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,779
a little light diffuser for your phone

190
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,758
you basically just wrap a piece of paper

191
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:49,500
around your phone and then you can use

192
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,538
your phone as a light meter you hold the

193
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,120
light right at canopy level and it will

194
00:06:51,538 --> 00:06:56,339
tell you your DLI then you can also use

195
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,100
the internet or books or your common

196
00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:01,978
knowledge to dial in your lights to the

197
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,259
appropriate DLI I did notice once I got

198
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:05,879
that DLI dialed in on my seedlings they

199
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,000
quit stretching they started bushing out

200
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,159
and they look much better so I highly

201
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,959
recommend the photon app for your iPhone

202
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,340
it was free other than the download it

203
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,379
was like somewhere between four and five

204
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:17,638
dollars for the download I just double

205
00:07:16,379 --> 00:07:19,978
tap on the side of your phone you'll

206
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,300
download it it installs right away it's

207
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:23,399
pretty quick it only took a minute or

208
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,319
two the diffuser only took a few seconds

209
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,598
to make the uh taping it together was

210
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:28,860
the hardest part because I'm clumsy and

211
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:30,959
then you just get in there and read the

212
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,000
settings I hold the phone at canopy

213
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,439
level I say oh it's too low and then I

214
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,240
go up to the LED light and I crank up

215
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,160
the knob and the LED light until it gets

216
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,019
to the reading which I want it on my

217
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,880
meter it was super simple

218
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:44,579
um I started off at 13 and over the past

219
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,139
few days I've slowly adjusted to 20. uh

220
00:07:44,579 --> 00:07:47,939
the plants are adjusting very well with

221
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:49,620
the light once the plants get a little

222
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,660
bit bigger I'll turn it to 25 when they

223
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,160
get bigger I'll go to 30. uh we'll just

224
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:55,439
slowly increase and then by the end of

225
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:59,400
flower I should be somewhere between 45

226
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:01,620
and 55 DLI is what I expect I will hit

227
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:03,899
by the end of flower but I really do see

228
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,780
an improved performance in my seedlings

229
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:08,219
since I've got that DLI dialed in so if

230
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:11,038
you are experiencing things like

231
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:12,539
stretchy laggy seeds or if the seeds are

232
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,360
just growing too tall and tipping over

233
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:17,219
maybe just maybe probably most likely

234
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,900
you need more light and the way to

235
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,300
determine that would be some sort of a

236
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:23,638
light meter light meters are very

237
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,680
expensive they're not cheap at all the

238
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:27,960
photon app is working very well with my

239
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,360
iPhone and it was like I keep saying it

240
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:31,799
was about four or five dollars if you

241
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,060
were burning the tops of your plants if

242
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,379
your plants are looking yellow and

243
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:36,478
crispy or if they're getting bleached

244
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:37,860
and turning white up at the Top If the

245
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,839
top leaves are getting crispy but

246
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,879
nothing else is you may be giving those

247
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,440
plants too much light which doesn't seem

248
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:44,939
possible because they go outside in the

249
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,380
sun right but our grow lights are

250
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,519
indoors they're just a few feet away

251
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:50,100
from the plants so they're really

252
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,080
punishing that plant all day long so

253
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,120
maybe just maybe perhaps you were giving

254
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,639
your plant too much light and a light

255
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,500
meter would definitely be an easy way to

256
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,240
tell you if those plants are getting too

257
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,278
much light another thing I recommend

258
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,959
when you play with a light meter write

259
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,179
it down I've got an app in my phone it's

260
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,278
just basically the notes app I've got a

261
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:10,079
note in my phone all about that grow

262
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,899
room everything I do in that grow room

263
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,060
gets documented in that note so I know

264
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:18,000
that on this day I fed it this much food

265
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:20,759
on this day I defoliated on this day I

266
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,399
increased the DLI from 13 to 14 on the

267
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,379
next day increased it from 14 to 17.

268
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,720
document all of the things that you do

269
00:09:25,379 --> 00:09:29,100
in that room especially when you were

270
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,660
adjusting the light that way if you see

271
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,339
him starting to act weird you can look

272
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:33,600
back and say four days ago I changed

273
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,820
this light and now things are going

274
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,259
weird take as many notes as you possibly

275
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,760
can all right I feel like I've been

276
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:40,740
rambling on for a few minutes and we

277
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,539
have not gotten to everybody's favorite

278
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,480
portion of the podcast which of course

279
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:47,639
is the grow help portion of the podcast

280
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,159
this is where I read your grow questions

281
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:53,159
and I do my best to give you some useful

282
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,719
advice on how to improve your grow now I

283
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,519
did say earlier in the podcast that I'm

284
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,080
going to give away free seeds that's

285
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,240
right I'm going to give away free seeds

286
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,040
and the way to win free seeds is to send

287
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,100
me a grow question if you go to my

288
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,778
website iregenetics.com there is a tab

289
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,240
that says grow help if you click on that

290
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:10,860
grow help tab you send me a question if

291
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,860
I read that question here on the podcast

292
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:16,259
I will send you a free pack of irie

293
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,720

299
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,740
friend we hang out on Discord we take

300

dabs together we talk about life pig

301
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,399
poop is just one really cool dude so

302
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:37,860
shout out to my buddy pig poop Piggy's

303
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,259
question goes a lot like this it says

304
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,778
Rasta Jeff I recently heard a theory

305
00:10:40,259 --> 00:10:45,600
that the sex of our plants is determined

306
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:47,338
during the germination process and that

307
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,680
cooler temperatures will give out more

308
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,019
females I've always believed that the

309
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:54,059
seed sex has been genetically coated at

310
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,278
the time of the breeding as the seeds

311
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:58,319
are developing what are your thoughts on

312
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,600
this and then it goes on it says can we

313
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,579
germinate in cooler temperatures to get

314
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,459
more females or even just have our

315
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:07,679
breeding tints cooler to get more female

316
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:09,119
seeds that is a very good question I've

317
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,399
heard a lot of different opinions on

318
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,100
this I've seen people say that

319
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,778
germinating in lower humidity gives you

320
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,459
more males or germinating and lower

321
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:19,078
humidity will give you more females I've

322
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,458
heard the opposite I've heard about

323
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:23,099
higher temperatures I've heard about

324
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:25,379
lower temperatures however all kinds I

325
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,540
have heard all kinds of gimmicks and

326
00:11:25,379 --> 00:11:30,360
ideas and tricks and Bro Science behind

327
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:32,278
this here is my two cents and this is

328
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,600
just my understanding based on my

329
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:35,939
experience if you've got a different

330
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,740
idea a different approach different Bro

331
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,560
Science different white papers than me

332
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,079
hook me up let me know I am very open to

333
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,059
ideas and feedback argue about it in the

334
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:48,299
comments right down below or send me an

335
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,399
email at growfromyourheart hotmail.com I

336
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:53,219
love feedback I love the conversation

337
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,278
keep it going but here is my two cents

338
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:59,940
and here is why I think that I strongly

339
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:03,000
believe that the pollen determines the

340
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:04,620
sex of the seed now why do I say that

341
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,940
what is my supporting evidence every

342
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,919
statement should have some supporting

343
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,980
statements right why do I believe that

344
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,838
because I make feminized seeds when I

345
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,360
make feminized seeds what am I making

346
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:18,120
what is the main ingredient feminized

347
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,159
pollen the pollen I'm starting with is a

348
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,560
female that is the feminized ingredient

349
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,299
so that makes me think that the pollen

350
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,699
is the one deciding the sex of the plant

351
00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,979
it could be before the pollen something

352
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,379
before the pollen could be determining

353
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,180
that but from what I see what I am

354
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:35,278
making Femme seeds by creating female

355
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:37,739
pollen by creating pollen from a plant

356
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,958
with only female chromosomes so I feel

357
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,720
like if I can make female pollen and put

358
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:44,458
that on a female plant any female plant

359
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,519
I put that on I'm going to create female

360
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:50,578
seeds right so in my mind in my theory

361
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,860
that says to me that the pollen is doing

362
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:54,899
the selection the pollen contains that

363
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,778
female chromosome or the male chromosome

364
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,759
the pollen is the one carrying the uh

365
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:01,980
the deciding factor the gender reveal

366
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,600
comes with the pollen now like I said I

367
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,000
don't have any real science behind that

368
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,980
my science is that I make Femme seeds

369
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,720
I'm making Femme pollen I'm not doing

370
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:12,000
anything to the female plants that

371
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,639
receive the pollen I am manipulating the

372
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,519
pollen donor to give me female pollen so

373
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,980
in my mind it's the pollen if you have

374
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,659
some sort of different varying opinion I

375
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,920
am very open to hearing that I'd love to

376
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:25,620
be educated if there's a different

377
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:27,479
education on this like I said get at it

378
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,879
in the comments or send me an email grow

379
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,320
from your heart at hotmail.com so now

380
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:32,578
let me make another supporting statement

381
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,079
since I talked about breeding with

382
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:36,539
Femmes if I breed with another plant

383
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,819
that is not feminized it is spitting out

384
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:41,099
pollen right and that pollen will hit

385
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,720
plants and it will make males and

386
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,060
females right most of the time you get

387
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,100
50 50. so that that says that that

388
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,899
pollen is making male and female plants

389
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,519
to me and that the feminized pollen is

390
00:13:48,899 --> 00:13:52,259
not so again that just supports my

391
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,879
statement so I really do believe that

392
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,620
the pollen is the one carrying the

393
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:57,120
chromosome and like I said a moment ago

394
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,860
the pollen is the one with the big

395
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,240
gender reveal that's the one that lets

396
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:02,339
you know if you're a boy or a girl when

397
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,899
it hits that stamen climbs down into the

398
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:05,880
ovule and it goes boy or girl and it

399
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,139
starts making that in there uh fills up

400
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,700
your back with the seed and then you get

401
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:10,259
to grow and find out later but I've been

402
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:12,300
rambling on long enough about that one

403
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:14,399
my dude pig poop I really do believe

404
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:16,919
that it is the pollen and like I said

405
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,500
I'm very open to arguments conversation

406
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,659
and education pig poop I do owe you

418
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:48,839
goes a lot like this it says yo Ross to

419
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:51,059
Jeff how would you go about reversing an

420
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,339
outdoor plant since things become to

421
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,979
bloom slower Outdoors I'm just wondering

422
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:57,720
about the timing of my silver

423
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,879
thiosulfate sprays the plants have been

424
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,759
stretching Outdoors the bud should be

425
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:04,379
showing before too long thank you for

426
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:07,078
your help this is a very good question

427
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,539
uh they're asking about making feminized

428
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:12,059
seeds in an outdoor garden and an

429
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:14,458
outdoor run they said how would you go

430
00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:16,799
about reversing an outdoor plant my

431
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:19,319
quick answer is I wouldn't I just simply

432
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:21,899
wouldn't do that reversed plants don't

433
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,060
make enough pollen in my opinion to

434
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:25,679
really make it worth reversing an

435
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:27,899
outdoor plant that's a project I would

436
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,519
rather keep indoors because Outdoors a

437
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,740
lot of that pollen is just going to blow

438
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,778
away in the wind and I need as much of

439
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,419
that feminized reversed pollen as I can

440
00:15:33,778 --> 00:15:38,759
get because the plants don't make as

441
00:15:36,419 --> 00:15:41,039
much as a regular male plant would make

442
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,899
when it dumps we're manipulating a plant

443
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,639
uh depending on how much you spray it

444
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,198
it's plant dependent but you're not

445
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,019
going to make as much pollen in my

446
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:51,059
experience so I would not do it but let

447
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:53,399
me try to help you out and tell you if

448
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:55,859
you insist this is how it would probably

449
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:57,839
work the best for you when we are

450
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,120
applying silver thiosulfate to a plant

451
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:03,120
for a reversal we need to start applying

452
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,339
that solution about 10 days before that

453
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,078
plant goes into flower so the only way

454
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,660
to really determine that is to grow that

455
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:12,000
plant last year and mark down the date

456
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:14,639
when you started seeing it show signs of

457
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,578
flour and then about 10 days before that

458
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,959
then maybe 10 days before that start

459
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:20,939
spraying that plant because if you're

460
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,638
seeing signs of flour you're about 10 to

461
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,800
14 maybe 15 days in that tells you two

462
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:27,839
weeks ago I went into flour which means

463
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:30,539
10 days before that is when you need to

464
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,040
spray gray so I would document what you

465
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,480
did last year hopefully you wrote it

466
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:36,059
down when did the plant go into flower

467
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,680
last year or write down when you noticed

468
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:40,018
the plant was showing signs of flour

469
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,638
this year here in Colorado it's fairly

470
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:44,039
easy for us a lot of the plants will

471
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,620
start showing signs of pre-flower just

472
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:49,259
going into flour around August 15th

473
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:51,899
which means flowering day one is usually

474
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,399
August 1st in some plants in some

475
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:54,600
cultivars it takes till the end of

476
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,820
August to show a little bit of

477
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,220
pre-flower but many of them most of them

478
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,560
they start August 15th you can really

479
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,600
see that pre-flower coming on that tells

480
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,639
me that August 1st was probably the day

481
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:08,099
they really started to flower which

482
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,140
means 10 days before that was when I

483
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,359
needed to apply my silver thiosulfate

484
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,939
solution for the first time you're gonna

485
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,619
need to hit it day negative 10 is what

486
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:21,779
we're going to call that and then day

487
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:23,578
one and then also 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 and

488
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:26,519
if you're Outdoors I'd probably go day

489
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:27,959
24 also but the timing of that is going

490
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,839
to be weird because the problem outdoor

491
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:32,580
doors is because now your male is

492
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:35,339
spitting pollen

493
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:37,019
um around day 32 it would have been

494
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:39,000
nicer to have the females a little

495
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,500
further along in the flower to receive

496
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,558
more pollen they're not going to have

497
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,419
the ideal amount of pistols to receive

498
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:46,918
that pollen they will impregnate they

499
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,080
will make seeds but you could have made

500
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,538
more if the timing was better that's why

501
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,339
I recommend doing this indoors first of

502
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:55,379
all that pollen is going to get away and

503
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:58,019
then second of all the timing isn't

504
00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:00,240
going to be as good as it could have if

505
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:01,918
you did it indoors making rag seeds

506
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,900
Outdoors isn't as critical because you

507
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,759
dump so much more pollen Outdoors that

508
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,980
male plant's ready to go he's just

509
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,379
dumping right away the female plant cell

510
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:12,000
every granule of pollen will make a seed

511
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,620
it's hard to make enough pollen unless

512
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,259
you're reversing multiple plants reverse

513
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:17,759
every for every one male you would do do

514
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:19,859
two reversals that way you get enough

515
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,720
pollen out there to make it worth it so

516
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:22,740
where was I got off on a nice ramble

517
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,240
there

518
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,058
um I Wouldn't Do It Outdoors but if you

519
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,440
do uh spray it day negative 10 I know if

520
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:29,639
you didn't flower it out last last year

521
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,220
you don't know when that date will be

522
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:34,080
maybe ask around maybe ask local ganja

523
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,298
Farmers around there say hey when do we

524
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,279
go into flower here use your best

525
00:18:36,298 --> 00:18:40,740
judgment and adjust from what they did

526
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:43,740
what they say whenever day one they say

527
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:45,538
is Go that negative 10 spray then and

528
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,179
then start your routine every third day

529
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:49,740
for about 24 days then you're gonna have

530
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:51,780
the problem of the pollen flying away

531
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,460
then we're gonna have the problem of a

532
00:18:51,779 --> 00:18:55,319
bird is going to land on that plant and

533
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,640
[ __ ] Shake all of your pollen off too

534
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:58,379
early you're gonna pollinate all the

535
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,179
girls too early

536
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,820
um I would keep the feminized breeding

537
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:04,080
projects indoors unless you insist on

538
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:05,339
doing this if you've got a greenhouse

539
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,460
environment where you control the

540
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:10,619
airflow and control things that may be

541
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,558
more ideal but what I would almost

542
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:15,479
recommend is flowering the reversal

543
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:17,759
indoors collecting the pollen and then

544
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,500
putting it on those plants Outdoors if

545
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,960
that's really what you insist on doing

546
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,058
anyway my friend giant grasses I really

547
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,440
do hope I helped you out here this was a

548
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:27,839
fun question I love talking about

549
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,640

00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:41,759
don't have to send seeds to somebody

556
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,500

557
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,879

to say thank you for all of the great

583
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:38,579
genetics you have created and all of the

584
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:40,379
great content which you have put out

585

dude you are so welcome thank you for

586
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,100

587
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:47,460
keeps me moving thank you thank you

588
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:49,439
thank you a lot it goes on it says uh

589
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,960
you truly are a teacher when it comes to

590
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,419
cannabis I appreciate that then it says

591
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,220
now to my question I have several

592
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,919
Keepers from a few different breeders

593
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,679
some have it all bag of Peel smell

594
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:04,020
potency and some are just good for their

595
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,538
medicinal values that that matters also

596
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:08,339
it says one of my favorites is your Dark

597
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:11,400
Hollow that is such a great strain if

598
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:14,519
you like that funky garlicky mashed

599
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,798
potatoey bar trash can funky sort of

600
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:18,900
terp that is a great one it says I am

601
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:21,119
not a breeder and not even really a

602
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,100
pollen chucker but I would like to cross

603
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,859
the Dark Hollow into some of the other

604
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:28,139
Keepers just to see how they will turn

605
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:30,119
out I love it when I inspire people with

606
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,740
a good strain it inspires them to want

607
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,019
to Chuck that pollen that's how you know

608
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,700
sometimes people are like how do I pick

609
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:37,500
a plant to breed with this is how you

610
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,538
just [ __ ] know you're like this plant

611
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,859
right here bro it talks to you it says

612
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,658
something to you like a crazy person

613
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:44,399
that's how you know to breed with that

614
00:21:42,659 --> 00:21:47,700
one follow that intuition you guys that

615
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,600
always works it goes on it says I want

616
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,919
to

617
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,678
um I really like to cross the Dark

618
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,240
Hollow uh if you were to look for a Dark

619
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,580
Hollow male to breed with what

620
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,679
attributes would you look for I know

621
00:21:56,579 --> 00:22:01,379
what to look for in a female but judging

622
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:02,940
males is a whole different deal I know

623
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:05,520
that's probably just going to be a trial

624
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,259
and error kind of deal but I figure the

625
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,879
best way to start would be to ask the

626
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,220
man himself this is a very good question

627
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,020
I really like this one it says anyway my

628
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,819
man thanks for your time and all you do

629
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,339
for the community I look forward to any

630
00:22:14,819 --> 00:22:19,200
advice you may be able to give thanks in

631
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:21,058
advance my bro I've got a lot of male

632
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,700
selection advice first of all I've done

633
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:25,859
a full podcast on selecting male plants

634
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,080
it's like a 40 minute episode just on

635
00:22:25,859 --> 00:22:29,939
selecting males I would give that quick

636
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,158
listen or maybe a 45 minute listen

637
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:34,320
unless you can time travel put it on 2x

638
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,419
make it a 27 minute listen right anyway

639
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,579
I am rambling but I would recommend

640
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:40,200
checking out the mail selection podcast

641
00:22:38,579 --> 00:22:41,879
I'm not trying to shine you on I'm not

642
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,400
trying to blow you off but that podcast

643
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,919
has been done and it was very good with

644
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,679
a lot of great info now let's focus here

645
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:51,600
specifically on the breeding with Dark

646
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,038
Hollow because that is a great plant to

647
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,379
breed with and to work with it's going

648
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:58,558
to pass along a lot of great traits Dark

649
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:01,260
Hollow is a GMO female GMO is known to

650
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,960
get fairly tall kind of stretchy a lot

651
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:06,240
of long internode spacing and a lot of

652
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:09,058
big giant leaves with a lot of dark

653
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,940
colors and the Aromas and flavors are so

654
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:13,918
disgustingly delicious on the GMO I love

655
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,659
it but it does get kind of tall and it's

656
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,280
super potent it does get kind of tall

657
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:19,799
and it needs a lot of attention when you

658
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,859
grow it so I crossed that one to my

659
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:25,319
Arise My King Solomon cut of a rise that

660
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:27,599
is a Golden Goat to daybreaker my arise

661
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:30,178
plant my King Solomon plant is very well

662
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,519
known as a male breeding plant he adds

663
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:35,640
Vigor he adds structure he adds potency

664
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,379
he adds Aroma he adds flavor he adds

665
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,140
everything you're missing from any cross

666
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,600
you could ever need so I crossed the GMO

667
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:44,038
to the arise that made Dark Hollow some

668
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:45,480
of those phenotypes are going to be kind

669
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:47,640
of taller if you're going to breed with

670
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,279
it I would find one that is not super

671
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:52,200
tall I'd find one of the shorter a wider

672
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:54,960
branching phenotypes so you can pass on

673
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:57,179
that shorter more branchy phenotype that

674
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,440
more branchy trait to the progeny

675
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:00,720
because that tall one is going to make

676
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,400
even taller plants so one of the first

677
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,100
traits I would look for is a shorter

678
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,840
branchier plant with closer internodal

679
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:09,119
spacing compared to the tall stretchier

680
00:24:06,839 --> 00:24:11,759
plants the tall stretchy one is going to

681
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,739
be a way more GMO dominant the shorter

682
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:15,779
squatty one is going to be a rise GMO

683
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,400
cross it'll have some Golden Goat traits

684
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:19,619
in there it will breed very beautifully

685
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,259
also look for the one with the really

686
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:23,819
big dark colored leaves there will be

687
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:26,099
leaves on some phenotypes that are as

688
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,859
big as my hand that'll turn like plum

689
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:30,899
purple colors use that phenotype for

690
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:32,759
breeding and I would also give it a nice

691
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,559
stem rub and look for the one that kind

692
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,440
of smells like early in flour it should

693
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:39,839
smell like like baby [ __ ] and vomit and

694
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:42,659
bar trash can and as it gets older it

695
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:45,178
should turn into like uh garlic and fuel

696
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:46,740
garlic and jet fuel garlic and gas kind

697
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,679
of is the aroma that I would look for

698
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:51,900
for a breeding a potential breeding male

699
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,460
from the Dark Hollow progeny now once

700
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,440
you've selected that Dark Hollow mail

701
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,779
what I would recommend is to breed it to

702
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,120
multiple females and try to find female

703
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:02,399
plants that are as far different in

704
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:05,158
traits like in structure Aroma flavor

705
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,860
Leaf size and shape even color of the

706
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,960
plant read it to stuff as far away from

707
00:25:07,859 --> 00:25:11,639
those traits as you can that way when we

708
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,620
grow out those seeds we can see what

709
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:16,080
they did together and then grow out

710
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,219
multiple seeds of each cross like if you

711
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:18,538
did what else do you have in the room

712
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,500
did you tell me what other strains no

713
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:22,079
you didn't tell me what else you have

714
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,579
but if you've got Dark Hollow to ice

715
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,859
cream cake and Dark Hollow to Cherry

716
00:25:23,579 --> 00:25:27,480
Paloma and Dark Hollow 2 Big Mountain

717
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,819
fudge cake

718
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,640
grow all those out and see what traits

719
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:34,918
from the Dark Hollow crossed carried

720
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,480
into each cross and see how much ice

721
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:38,820
cream cake you get in this cross see

722
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,679
which Dark Hollow ice cream cake traits

723
00:25:38,819 --> 00:25:42,720
sort of mixed and then see what else did

724
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,400
I say cherry Paloma see what Dark Hollow

725
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,778
and Cherry Paloma did I think somebody

726
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,340
may have bred that already that's going

727
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:49,019
to be fire but see how much of that

728
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,579
garlic comes out how much of that cherry

729
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:52,319
or how much of that orange Turf comes

730
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:54,538
out and then the other one that I forgot

731
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,980
what I even [ __ ] said over here uh

732
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:58,558
see what traits and flavors come out

733
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,380
then we can see what the boy is doing to

734
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,298
different crosses we can see uh if the

735
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:05,278
short structure comes through on all of

736
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:06,778
these that means he's passing that if

737
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,519
some of them are really tall and really

738
00:26:06,778 --> 00:26:10,679
short that means that he's not passing a

739
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,658
lot of his height trait to the progeny

740
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,179
if they all smell like mashed potatoes

741
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:17,700
he's passing that trait this way we can

742
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,440
learn what traits he gives to his mix

743
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:21,179
and then we can see if he mixes well

744
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,278
with others if he plays well with others

745
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,140
then we can continue breeding with that

746
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,960
once we kind of see what it does it's

747
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,059
like finding out uh it's like like

748
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,319
tasting the first batch of the mix by

749
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:32,940
tasting the first half of the batter

750
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:34,558
does it taste like chocolate vanilla

751
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,240
cinnamon if it tastes like chocolate

752
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,099
don't breed it to more chocolate breed

753
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,419
it to vanilla if it tastes like vanilla

754
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,619
breed it to Cinnamon you know what I

755
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:42,419
mean find out what you're working with

756
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:44,459
then learn where to go from there with

757
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:46,140
your breeding bro I got super rambling

758
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,000
on this question I hope I helped you out

759
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,880
I would look for the short one with the

760
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,940
tighter node spacing uh the giant dark

761
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,159
leaves the colorful leaves the bar trash

762
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,278
can smell that puke accurate gross kind

763
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,620
of Aroma one that dumps a lot of pollen

764
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,298
and if it makes trichomes that is the

765
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,918
one to work with all right my dude

766
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:06,900
