i want to stay on track on this episode

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,879
because i have got a lot of ground

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,400
to cover i do like to start the show by

37
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,319
talking about what i'm smoking

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,600
i am still smoking through this jar of

39
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,000
garlic grove

40
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,319
live batter from green dot labs again it

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,319
is a blend of gmo cookies and loa

42
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,919
f2 on the package the flavor is

43
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:36,399
described as general soa

44
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,000
garlic and orange soda i said i

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,719
completely agree with that on the last

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,959
episode

47
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:42,798
i also mentioned that this should have a

48
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:44,078
warning label on it that it has got a

49
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,360
punch in the face it's like a

50
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,478
jack-in-the-box i feel like when i

51
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:47,920
unscrew this lid

52
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,599
just a fist should come out and just

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,478
punch me right in the face but also give

54
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,478
me a hug

55
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:53,840
it's like the most pleasant punch in the

56
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,438
face you could ever imagine well i've

57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,118
got the jar open i'll show you

58
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:58,639
uh beautiful color i like the way the

59
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,399
light shines and reflects off of there a

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,079
little bit of sheen a little shimmer

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,399
a really delicious concentrate it is

62
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,639
like a a thick cheesecake batter

63
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,639
or maybe a real thick butter i'm really

64
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,199
digging the texture and flavor and

65
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,679
consistency of this it dabs very nicely

66
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,280
obviously it's got me nice and rambly i

67
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,640
did get another jar of this i had to

68
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
visit the dispensary to get some

69
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:19,679
supplies

70
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,040
this one does have a potency label on

71
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,800
the back of this one it says

72
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:27,919
it contains 68.24 thc and

73
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,840

of concentrates on the table

173
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,199

174
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,879

175

181
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,600
paid off immediately

182

i've got a plethora of concentrates here

183
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,800
i'll try to go through each jar or at

184
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,000
least most of the jars

185
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,400
and i will post a picture of this table

186
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,759
on the grow from your heart podcast

187
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,879
instagram page i'm going to write that

188
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,639
down to remember that

189
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,079
i'll try to do it as i'm editing the

190
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,960
show but post

191
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:52,159
ig 2 ig that's going to be a better note

192
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:53,758
so i know what that means but then you

193
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,120
can see what this table looks like

194
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,160
it is beautiful chaos um

195
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,680
2 4 6 8 10 12 14

concentrates on the table then we're

202
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,879

225
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
look at the number 710 write the number

226
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:58,319
710 on a piece of paper and turn it

227
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,439
upside down it says

228
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,039
oil so what do we do at 710 we smoke oil

229
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,000
what kind of oil we smoke

230
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,598
hash oil what kind of hash oil butane

231
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,639
honey oil bho

232
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,319
butane processed honey oil um

233
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,840
i'm not going to go too far but in this

234
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,280
episode i'm not going to teach you how

235
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,399
to make concentrates that is not

236
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,399
something i will cover i'm not a

237
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,719
concentrate maker i am a concentrate

238
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,159
consumer a concentrate connoisseur if

239
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,440
you will we're not going to talk too

240
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,560
much about making it

241
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,160
uh but butane honey oil is made with

242
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,199
butane i know that sounds dangerous if

243
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,639
you don't know a lot about the

244
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,560
concentrates the butane is

245
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,918
easily removed we've figured out systems

246
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,038
to remove the concentrate we'll talk

247
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,318
more about that

248
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,759
but butane honey oil is what bho stands

249
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,160
for that's where the oil

250
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,280
in 710 comes from you turn 710 upside

251
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,160
down it says oil

252
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,598
we're smoking butane honey oil bho if

253
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,520
you've seen bho around

254
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:50,719
those letters some of this may be old

255
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:52,000
info for some of you

256
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
but i want to start at the beginning

257
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,199
we're going to do the evolution here

258
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,918
this is page 1 of the book

259
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,800
so you've got bho we're smoking butane

260
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:02,079
hash oil

261
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,199
that's the oil in 710 i really believe

262
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:08,719
that the phrase 710 was coined by

263
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,919
task rock of highly educated titanium

264
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,919
i'm going to give task

265
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,000
most of the credit i know he was on a

266
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,758
chat with other folks i believe the guy

267
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,120

268
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,639

00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:07,919
at the forefront of the

296
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,399
evolution of a lot of this stuff so i've

297

ways of dabbing and then we'll talk

302
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,800

it's got all these state regulations uh

332
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,000
printed on the side here

333
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:17,519
it's got a bunch of just store stuff

334
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,278
retail stuff uh potency 66.7 percent

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
there's thc and something else in there

338
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,278

uh thc a they didn't list it very well

340
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:30,720
but

341
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,039
there's other stuff in there other

342
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,480

369
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,560
apothecary

370
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,240
so i'm going to unfold this i'm going to

371
00:11:18,559 --> 00:11:21,119
try not to drop it while i show it to

372
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,399
the camera

373
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,000
sometimes it sticks to the paper

374
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,958
sometimes it slides off the paper this

375
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,278
one's stuck

376
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,319
so this is what shatter looks like it'll

377
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,399
be in different

378
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,680
um colors and consistencies but mainly

379
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,360
this is what you're going to find this

380
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,439
is close to the right color that

381
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,278
is the right color it may be lighter or

382
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,399
darker in color that's not a huge deal

383
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:41,600
this is right in the middle

384
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,799
this is kind of the color that you'd

385
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,079
expect a little bit lighter would be

386
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:44,639
better a little bit darker i wouldn't

387
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,559
have bought it

388
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,799
but i got this for the show this is

389
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,199
shatter if it were not

390
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,838
warm this is a warm day in colorado so

391
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,800
right now

392
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,959
it's more uh bendy than it should be but

393
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,319
if this were warm when i did that move

394
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,838
it would just break it would just be a

395
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,040
piece of shatter that's where it got the

396
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,760
name shatter

397
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,078
so this was kind of the uh the start of

398
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,078
the bho oil movement this is the [ __ ]

399
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,239
that got it all going

400
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:12,638
um i could probably dab this whole thing

401
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,320
right now and not be amazingly high i

402
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,560
would not recommend you do that

403
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,000
but i have moved on to uh we're gonna

404
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,759
show the evolution and show you where we

405
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,679
are now but this is old school

406
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,519
i don't buy this stuff anymore uh but

407
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,838
this is available this is shatter

408
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,159
i should show you uh if you were going

409
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,360
to dab some shatter i've got a

410
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,559
dab tool here i'm just going to show you

411
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,919
what the end of it looks like without

412
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,799
any concentrate on it

413
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,919
i'll put a little dab on here this is

414
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,599
what i would recommend

415
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,360
for a beginner dabber and you're going

416
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,560
to think i'm crazy because

417
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,159
it is a tiny dab that may be more than

418
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,039
enough to make somebody cough and get

419
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,439
them really high

420
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,399
you guys what i put on the dabber is

421
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,720
less than

422
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
0.1 of a gram of a dab you can't tell

423
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,680
that i took anything off the dab

424
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,278
i could still give this gram to matt or

425
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,879
mike and say here's a gram and they're

426
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,679
thinking they got a full gram this

427
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,000
you'll never notice that is missing so

428
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:01,359
that

429
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,958
if you're looking at the video that

430
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,680
little tiny piece is what i would

431
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,638
recommend

432
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,519
you take a dab of it is smaller than a

433
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,000
grain of rice

434
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,519
if that's your first dab do that you can

435
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,919
always take a bigger dab

436
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,078
you can't un-dab the dab that you just

437
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,879
took when you take your first dab

438
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,000
it may be tremendous you may get a heavy

439
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,480
feeling in your lungs

440
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,240
you may get the sweats uh you may cough

441
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,519
you should cough i like the cough that

442
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
comes with the dab that

443
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,879
rush that redness your face turns red

444
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,920
you get the sweats you cough a little

445
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,000
bit

446
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,639
sometimes that'll give some people a

447
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,159
panic attack write it bro that's what

448
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,919
you're there for that's what i'm there

449
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:39,600
for i just took a giant dab i paid money

450
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,559
for it i just [ __ ] myself up i want to

451
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,159
feel something

452
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,638
i don't want to take a dab and feel the

453
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,319
same that's that's a ripoff so

454
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,159
take a little dab and if you don't get

455
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,040
what you want from that first dab take

456
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,078
another one

457
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:51,838
and if you don't get what you want from

458
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,120
that one take a bigger dab next time but

459
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,440
don't go in like i do

460
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,959
and take a monster dab on the first rib

461
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,800
that's my advice so this is

462
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,719
shatter this is what basically started

463
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,679
the game i showed you how big of a dab

464
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,959
that you should take

465
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,078
i'll show you how big of a dab i would

466
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,278
take i'm not trying to show off i've

467
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,638
just been at this for a while

468
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,559
i'll show you how i go in on some

469
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,399
shatter i would probably do

470
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,239
at least that big of a dab right there

471
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,879
that's how i would get the party started

472
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,320
for some shatter so probably do the

473
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:17,759
whole gram and cough a couple of times

474
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,760
if that's what we had to do

475
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,799
but i think i'm going to pass this on to

476
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,559
a couple of friends who

477
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:24,240
smoke more shatter than me now the next

478
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,518
thing i want to talk about

479
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,560
is also shatter but this is the new

480
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,560
fad and shatter technology this is a

481
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,838
gram of strawberry milk shatter this is

482
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:35,679
one gram i don't know who made the

483
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,399
strawberry milk i apologize

484
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:42,000
uh the potency label says it is 82.1

485
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,799
percent total thc and 93.4

486
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,600
total cannabinoids so we do have more

487
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,000
potency

488
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,278
in this one on the label than we do in

489
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,639
the other shatter

490
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:55,360
but this one is what is known as crc

491
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,399
shatter so it has been color it is color

492
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,879
remediation

493
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,159
column and i think the c could also be

494
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,399
chromatography

495
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,000
because i am not a concentrate maker i

496
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,839
am not a scientist

497
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,519
this is not my area of expertise what

498
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,480
i'm talking about right now

499
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,240
i posted to social media please teach me

500
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,360
about crc

501
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,799
i got a lot of feedback a lot of it i'm

502
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,919
trying to open this pack there we go a

503
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,679
lot of it was straight up

504
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,559
bickering and [ __ ] between

505
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:26,319
concentrate makers and smokers

506
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,879
from what i understand

507
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,000
color remediated concentrate or color

508
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,679
remediation

509
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,759
columns or color remediation

510
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,638
chromatography all of those were typed

511
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,079
in my responses

512
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,560
in in social media when i asked to be

513
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,679
taught about it

514
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:44,239
basically there are two sides of the

515
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,039
uh opinionated forum here some people

516
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,079
say that it is

517
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,159
polished turds they think that the

518
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,638
color remediation was required because

519
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,159
the starting product was not up to par

520
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,680
so when they ran the material that came

521
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,000
out dark or kind of funky or

522
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,799
smelled bad or tasted weird so then it

523
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,198
is color

524
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,479
remediated to take out all of the crap

525
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,399
then it comes out different

526
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,320
and it is cleaner now there are two

527
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,000
sides two schools of thought here like i

528
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,639
said some people think that that is

529
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
amazing

530
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,759
you're cleaning up all product you're

531
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,519
making it safer you're making it cleaner

532
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,600
for patients and consumers

533
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,720
which is a good thing a lot of people

534
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,680
also say that that is

535
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,399
allowing growers and producers to create

536
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,399
a sub

537
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,198
par product because we're just going to

538
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,078
clean it up anyway

539
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,958
so there's a very fine line in crowds uh

540
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,159
on how people

541
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,439
feel about the crc excuse me for the

542
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:34,559
throat clearing i took a lot of dabs i'm

543
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,360
not even going to edit that this is a

544
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,198
real 710 show um i'm going to show you

545
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,159
oh this is pretty i just now opened this

546
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,679
i should have showed you more of the

547
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,278
opening i'll refold it that's all i did

548
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,879
i pulled the package out of the uh the

549
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,039
main package and then i've got the

550
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,919
parchment the customized apothecary

551
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:49,360
parchment here

552
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,958
i've got to be careful when i show this

553
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
to the camera because this

554
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,958
is more shatter like and it is also

555
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,320
falling out of the parchment because of

556
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,599
the way that i'm tipping it

557
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,040
i'm going to pick it up with my bare

558
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,320
hand that's a bad idea it's going to

559
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,439
melt and stick but this is for the

560
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,199
show's case

561
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,038
that's what the crc looks like if you're

562
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,838
looking at that on the podcast

563
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,160
it is on the video it's much more clear

564
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:11,198
than the non-remediated product i'll

565
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,120
show it again

566
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,640
and then i will take a photo side by

567
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,798
side and post that

568
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,559
so here's the non-remediated and then

569
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,119
here's the remediated product you can

570
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,359
see

571
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,958
obviously see color differences uh this

572
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,399
one's bright bright yellow this one has

573
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,558
got an amber color

574
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,079
nothing wrong with the amber shader back

575
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:28,798
in the day the amber shadow is what we

576
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,399
all wanted

577
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,119
is what we were going for now we've got

578
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,080
this crc like i said you guys there are

579
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,798
two camps

580
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,240
people love it or hate it it is polished

581
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,480
turds in some people's mind

582
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,319
it is also a really clean and refined

583
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
product in some people's mind

584
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,399
i am not going to go too far down that

585
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,000
rabbit hole i will take a dab of it

586
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,759
after this show or maybe later in the

587
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,200
episode i may leave the video running

588
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,839
i want to develop an opinion on this

589
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,679
myself i should smell it

590
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,038
i should smell it because i hear a lot

591
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,480
about it doesn't have any smell or

592
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,759
flavor or it all smells and tastes the

593
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,319
same i'm going to lean away from the mic

594
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,319
and smell it

595
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,000
yeah there's no smell i don't smell [ __ ]

596
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,759
it smells like the paper and my fingers

597
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,679
that's all it smells like

598
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,839
but that is the crc you guys i will

599
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,200
leave the decision making up to you i'm

600
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,199
not trying to be biased here

601
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,960
i'm telling you that there are two camps

602
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,720
uh some people say that it's great

603
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,400
because we can clean up a product we can

604
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,839
take things out they got left in in the

605
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,600
extraction process

606
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,959
what may have gotten left in i'm not

607
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:25,678
sure what it can take out but i read

608
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,079
chlorophyll

609
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,679
i also read pesticides they argued that

610
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,839
it could take out pesticides

611
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,600
so i'm not sure you guys there was a lot

612
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,678
of bickering and a lot of uh

613
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,719
controversy in the group when i asked

614
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,360
about that so

615
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,960
that is color remediated shatter we

616
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,879
started smoking shatter

617
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,798
then eventually appeared a product

618
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,760
called wax

619
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:49,599
wax happens um when so when you make

620
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,440
shatter you want it to sit still while

621
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,639
it purges you put it under a heat source

622
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,360
over a heat source you put heat

623
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,840
underneath it

624
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,479
or in a vacuum oven and you let the

625
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,119
shatter

626
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,400
purge so that the residual butane comes

627
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,479
out of it

628
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
we've learned that if you disturb the

629
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,319
shatter while it's sitting there

630
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
if you whip it and put air into it it

631
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:08,879
would make a fluffier consistency and

632
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,480
that would also

633
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,559
in some people's mind it was speeding up

634
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,519
the process of getting that butane out

635
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:14,798
of the mixture

636
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,038
because we wanted to remove all the

637
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,798
butane wanted a proper purge if you left

638
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:20,480
butane in there you got told you had

639
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,038
tane soup or poop soup

640
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,880
but eventually we learned how to whip

641
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,919
the product and by whipping shatter it

642
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,160
put air into it

643
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,120
and it turned it into what is known as a

644
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,558
wax

645
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,079
i was trying to pick some of this up but

646
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:32,798
it's real crumbly i'll try to get this

647
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,000
big chunk

648
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,279
you shouldn't touch your concentrates

649
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,319
with your fingers you guys but this is

650
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,399
for science

651
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,399
so here we go this is wax you can see

652
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,798
it's a little bit dark in color it's not

653
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,960
as

654
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,319
clear as the remediated stuff not quite

655
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,400
as dark as the shatter

656
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,480
it's got a little bit of air in it i

657
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,000
liked back in the day i really liked

658
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,558
clean shatter i thought the clean

659
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,599
shatter

660
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:55,918
hit well and tasted good i liked

661
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,519
some wax it depends on how it was made

662
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,559
and what the consistency was and what it

663
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,038
tasted like

664
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,599
back in the day we had not mastered the

665
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:05,200
art

666
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,038
of um removing and removing

667
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,480
uh the terps and processing things

668
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,000
properly and getting the or not not

669
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,798
removing the terps i apologize removing

670
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,159
the butane

671
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:13,679
preserving the terps my brain was

672
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,039
tripping i had so many thoughts we

673
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,038
weren't pros at it yet so it didn't

674
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:19,919
taste amazing yet proper wax

675
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,279
was [ __ ] delicious so something i

676
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,200
think i should note about

677
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,399
this wax and the shatter is these are

678
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,480
made from

679
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,519
dried products these can be made from

680
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,240
dried buds

681
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,519
or dried trim once you harvest and you

682
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,400
cut off the sugar leaf

683
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,599
that dry stuff can be used to make wax

684
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,240
and the shatter

685
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:39,038
so um we got through wax we got you

686
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,798
through shatter

687
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,000
i'll show you this is a white widow wax

688
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,359
i should give a shout out to the people

689
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
i got it's white widow wax from

690
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,678
apothecary

691
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:50,480
the label says 64.1 percent thc

692
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,840
and 76.5 total cannabinoids i'll show

693
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,279
you in the jar without my

694
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,599
grubby fingers on it so you can see what

695
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,240
it looks like uh try not to spill it

696
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,719
there we go

697
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,120
that is the wax for you so it went

698
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,000
shatter and wax

699
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,558
and then we started seeing another

700
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,519
product

701
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:09,678
called batter batter was kind of between

702
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,480
the shatter and the wax it was

703
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,200
softer and it didn't wax up like the wax

704
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,519
but

705
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,880
it didn't shatter like shatter and it

706
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,798
looked more i'm gonna show you

707
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,320
just so you can get a view of it it

708
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,319
looks like just a little dollop of

709
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,158
cheesecake batter or cake batter or

710
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,879
maybe some thick butter in the bottom of

711
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,559
the jar

712
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,000
you can see at the if i turn the jar

713
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:29,359
just right you can see how they doll up

714
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,440
to that right into the container

715
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,879
it just has like a little like a thing

716
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,159
of whipped cream or something

717
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,600
it's got that cool little whip at the

718
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,960
top of it the tail it's got that looks

719
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,038
like a hershey kiss in there

720
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,120
so that is batter this is black water

721
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,359
batter from apothecary farms on the

722
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,558
package it says 67.6

723
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:49,839
total thc and 79.9 percent

724
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,200
total cannabinoids i like batter i like

725
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,959
the batter because

726
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,038
i feel like it expands in my lungs a

727
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,400
little bit i get a big fat dab out of a

728
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:59,279
little bit of batter

729
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,759
and i feel like it's super terpy most of

730
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:01,678
the time

731
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:02,798
terpy flavorful terps are flavor when

732
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,000
i'm talking about terps i'm talking

733
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,480
about the flavor you guys

734
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,599
i usually find the batter to be the most

735
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,079
uh preserved

736
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:12,719
terps of this type of concentrate that

737
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,599
we've reviewed so far so we started off

738
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,159
with the shatter

739
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,678
then we moved to wax i'd show you let's

740
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,280
show you how big of a dab of the wax to

741
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,159
do because i showed you the shatter

742
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,279
just again little tiny dab of the wax

743
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,440
gonna show you

744
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,359
that that's enough wax to do a fat dab

745
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,759
you guys that's a big dab of wax right

746
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:29,199
there

747
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,798
that's bigger than you should do that's

748
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,798
going to get you going so

749
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,960
that's the wax now i'll show you how

750
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,319
much batter that you should dab

751
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,000
if you're new at dabbing i'm going to

752
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,558
bust out some of this batter this is

753
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,919
black water dabber from apothecary farms

754
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,440
i'm gonna throw the dabber around just

755
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,080
for good luck then we'll put a dab on

756
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,519
there

757
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,960
just gonna go kind of light just want to

758
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,639
just dip it into there that's why they

759
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,400
call it a dab you guys you just need a

760
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,200
dab not you don't need a [ __ ] dollop

761
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,679
or a glob

762
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,120
you just need a dab that's enough that's

763
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,000
more than enough now that i hold it up

764
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,158
to the camera

765
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,519
that would make mike cough that's enough

766
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,200
to get matt or mike

767
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,359
plenty stoned and they are dabbers you

768
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,120
guys so maybe half of that

769
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,479
and this is again about the size of a

770
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:07,519
piece of rice i'm going to knock it in

771
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,360
half

772
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,038
it's just hard for me to it just feels

773
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:11,839
silly the way that i dab it feels silly

774
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,960
to offer

775
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,199
somebody that much concentrate but it's

776
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,400
about half of a piece of rice

777
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,919
that's all you got there so

778
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
that is how much of a dab i think you

779
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,919
should do of wax or batter so we've

780
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:27,439
covered the first three basics

781
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,280
uh those are the first three things that

782
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,480
we kind of fell in love with

783
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,000
that we were dabbing on that was

784
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,599
available that were really popular here

785
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,919
for dabbers that were available

786
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,839
uh in stores then people started

787
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,520
developing new technology

788
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,599
um there was a company i talk about

789
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,400
apothecary farms a lot they did a little

790
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,558
bit of

791
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,840
pioneering in the industry they came up

792
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,359
with their own product

793
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,240
that they called ambrosia ambrosia is a

794
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:52,479
blend

795
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,720
basically a blend of two different

796
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,319
concentrates in my opinion from my

797
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,759
experience

798
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,639
they made a product called hcfse and

799
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,079
that stands for

800
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:06,159
high cannabinoid full spectrum extract

801
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:07,519
i'm going to show you some tropicana

802
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,840
tropicana cookies

803
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:14,400
full spectrum extract um this is

804
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:16,639
79.1 percent thc 91

805
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,919
total cannabinoids this is what we call

806
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,600
diamonds you guys i'm going to try to

807
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,520
get this on the camera

808
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,639
that is diamonds basic diamonds

809
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,000
trying to move my notes out of the

810
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
screen here so you guys can't see what's

811
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,000
coming up next on the show

812
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:31,599
those are diamonds you can see that it

813
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,119
looks they're hard i'll touch them with

814
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:34,079
my finger they move around they're not

815
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:36,558
soft and squishy

816
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:37,918
i shouldn't pick them up but i will uh

817
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,639
that's a that's falling apart on my

818
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,000
fingers but that's a diamond for you

819
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,200
that's a good size diamond right there

820
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,038
so that's what we're talking about when

821
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,640
we say diamonds i like diamonds diamonds

822
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,759
are a dabbers best friend

823
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,480
so those are the diamonds then you hear

824
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,919
us talk about

825
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,400
sauce diamonds and sauce the sauce is

826
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,038
the

827
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,559
high terpene full spectrum extract so

828
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,319
they've made a concentrate

829
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,839
and i don't know the science behind this

830
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,319
i'm not claiming to be a concentrate

831
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,240
maker i like to dab

832
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:08,079
they make a concentrate and they leave

833
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,839
it in solution under pressure that's

834
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,639
enough details there when they do that

835
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,959
the diamonds

836
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,559
sink to the bottom the terps float to

837
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,159
the top right you got the heavy diamonds

838
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,798
on the bottom the liquid up top

839
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,640
so this is the terp sauce i'm tipping

840
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:21,359
this jar toward the camera the best i

841
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,000
can

842
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,479
it is mostly liquid just pure terps this

843
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,400
is 10 grams of liquid terpenes

844
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,558
not just liquid terps but is mostly

845
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,440
terps uh let me see if there's a potency

846
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:37,200
label

847
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:39,440
this is uh 68.2 percent thc and 79.3

848
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,038
total cannabinoids the rest of that is

849
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,360
just terps you guys this is the terp

850
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:44,720
sauce from apothecary farms

851
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:47,519
try not to spill it but i want you to

852
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,200
see down in that jar

853
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,879
it's uh thicker than water but not as

854
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,120
thick as honey

855
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,320
almost maple syrup almost as thick as a

856
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,038
maple syrup you guys i don't want to

857
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,798
spill it

858
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,240
but i want you to see what i got going

859
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,798
on in there so

860
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,480
our friends at apothecary made the ht

861
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,278
and the hc but when they introduced

862
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,038
these things

863
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,880
they had mixed them together in what

864
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:11,200
they were considering the perfect

865
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,080
homogenized blend and they call it

866
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,240
ambrosia

867
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,278
and what i'm going to show you here is

868
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,400
the lost

869
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,960
tribe ambrosia and that is diamonds and

870
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,880
sauce

871
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,880
together you can see the diamonds in

872
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,360
there and you can see the sauce in there

873
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,200
now what i like about this when you dab

874
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:30,399
the diamonds by themselves

875
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,200
they are very high in thc excuse that

876
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,720
they are very very high in thc but

877
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,480
they're a little bit harsh

878
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,079
and they don't have a lot of flavor and

879
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,440
the high is not

880
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:44,240
perfectly desirable so in my opinion

881
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:46,000
the the thc diamonds the high

882
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,200
cannabinoid full spectrum extract the

883
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,000
thc diamonds

884
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,880
that type of concentrate makes you go up

885
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,480
the thc

886
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,320
makes your high go straight up like a

887
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,919
firework fourth of july just happened

888
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,359
makes your brain go up like a firework

889
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,759
then i think the terps

890
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,038
are what give your fireworks colors that

891
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,119
decides if you're gonna get

892
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,798
paranoid if you're gonna get giggles if

893
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,639
you're gonna get [ __ ] munchies

894
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,798
if you're going to get a panic attack so

895
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,799
the thc is going to make you get high

896
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:12,319
and the terpenes whichever terpenes are

897
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,000
present in your concentrate

898
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:15,759
are what are going to dictate the type

899
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,038
of high you experience and those

900
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:18,319
that buzz could be different for

901
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,119
different mind types different

902
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,038
chemistries

903
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,639
uh different people just different

904
00:27:21,038 --> 00:27:24,640
different people get different effects i

905
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,919
really like limonine i think limonene is

906
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,600
good for my brain

907
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,159
limonene gives some people a [ __ ]

908
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:33,278
panic attack i enjoy it so

909
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,360
um that is the ambrosia that is high

910
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,599
terpene full spectrum extract and that

911
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,839
is

912
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,439
high terpene full spectrum extract i

913
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:39,918
don't know if i told you that was lemon

914
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,798
g

915
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,278
high chirping full lemon og it smells

916
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,319
like

917
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,919
lemons and gas it's like lemon pledge a

918
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,519
lemon pledge and a skunk punched you

919
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,679
right in the face it's delicious

920
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,519
then we've got the tropicana cookies hc

921
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:55,440
diamonds and then we've got the lost

922
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,079
tribe ambrosia which is the blend

923
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,038
the homogenized blend of both together

924
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,480
so

925
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,879
we've gotten through the shatter the

926
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,759
batter the wax we've gotten all the way

927
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,679
up to the

928
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:10,640
terps and the ambrosias something that

929
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:11,038
a lot of people are into this is not my

930
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,278
thing

931
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,879
not my flavor not for me i'm not hating

932
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,480
it i've just decided that i like other

933
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,440
things better this one makes my lungs

934
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,399
feel heavy

935
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,960
i really like batters but when i smoke

936
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,678
the

937
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,319
sho which stands for solventless honey

938
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,200
oil

939
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,240
uh it is really heavy to my lungs this

940
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,679
one is a

941
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,200
jam band premium ambrosia show from

942
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,559
apothecary farms i'm going to show you

943
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
what it looks like then we'll talk about

944
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:36,879
it

945
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
you can see that we did smoke most of it

946
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,760
just because it's not that bad i mean i

947
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,038
paid for it and want to get high so we

948
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,480
smoked it but

949
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,000
again it looks like a little dollop of

950
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,599
cheesecake it's a little lighter in

951
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,359
color than all of the other

952
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,599
uh concentrates like this that i showed

953
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:53,119
you but

954
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:55,839
this came from rosin this was pressed

955
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,519
into rosin flowers were pressed into

956
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,519
rosin and then that rosin

957
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,440
was made into bubble hash they made

958
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:03,200
bubble hash out of the pressed rosin so

959
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,880
there's a big process to this

960
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,399
this is one of the more expensive

961
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,919
products on the market right now

962
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,359
these solventless concentrates are

963
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,320
definitely more expensive they're very

964
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,240
sought after

965
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,319
there's a big crew of concentrate heads

966
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,759
that just loves solventless concentrate

967
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,200
they will pay the premium

968
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,038
and they're they're after it all the

969
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,278
time so this sort of stuff sells out

970
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:22,798
uh this one is 82.1 percent total

971
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,880
cannabinoids

972
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,240
i love it i get really blazed from it

973
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,760
it's a heavy high you feel like you just

974
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,839
want to sit down and chill the [ __ ] out

975
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,278
it's a video game concentrate

976
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:33,359
but that's not what i'm going for and

977
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:36,798
it's also really really

978
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,479
heavy on my lungs um

979
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,158
something else i should talk about rosin

980
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,360
i just said that that came from pressed

981
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,919
rosin let's talk about

982
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:45,519
original rosin what i've got here is a

983
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,759
piece of parchment paper

984
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,038
what's inside is rosin i'm going to show

985
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:52,480
this to you

986
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:55,759
this was made with no chemicals no water

987
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:57,360
this was made with heat and pressure so

988
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:58,720
i've got a friend who takes buds and

989
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,359
there are several different methods of

990
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
doing this

991
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:01,759
i've seen it done with a hair

992
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,798
straightener i've seen it done with a

993
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,240
hydraulic press

994
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,319
i've seen it done with everything in

995
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,880
between uh shout out to my buddy pedro

996
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:09,918
for making the best [ __ ] rosin that i

997
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,480
have ever smoked

998
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,278
um this came from a local friend so they

999
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,360
take a bud

1000
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,720
and they put it in something with heat

1001
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,398
imagine the hair straightener it's got

1002
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,519
two hot plates you press it together

1003
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:21,439
whatever goes in the middle there is

1004
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,119
going to get squished and get hot put a

1005
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,480
bunch of pressure on it heat it up to

1006
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,079
just the right temperature

1007
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,240
fold up a bud and parchment paper and

1008
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:31,038
put it in between there and press it

1009
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,839
this is what comes out we call this hash

1010
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,319
rosin

1011
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,278
just flour rosin i'm sorry this is flour

1012
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,599
rosin

1013
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,278
this came out from a squished and heated

1014
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,240
bud it just dripped right out into the

1015
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:41,759
parchment paper

1016
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,599
you guys i don't make the product but i

1017
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,519
do know what it looks like and i do know

1018
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,000
how to smoke it and i am kind of excited

1019
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,839
about this

1020
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,599
it is not my favorite concentrate but to

1021
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:50,959
see people able to make their own

1022
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,359
concentrates at home without any

1023
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,720
dangerous products because making bho

1024
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,558
and all this other stuff you can put

1025
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,558
yourself in danger this was done with

1026
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,200
hot with just [ __ ] a hot [ __ ] hair

1027
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:01,599
straightener

1028
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,120
or maybe a hydraulic press so you're

1029
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,480
just squishing buds and some

1030
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,158
there's a lot of tech to it if you're

1031
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,839
gonna make your uh your roster make sure

1032
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,240
you do the research don't take my advice

1033
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:10,240
but

1034
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,679
this can be done at home for very

1035
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,120
affordable prices you just need to

1036
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,080
squish nugs you need nugs

1037
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:17,038
and a squish source they pressed it and

1038
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,439
there it is

1039
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,200
rosin is not my favorite because most of

1040
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,240
the time i think it tastes like a burnt

1041
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,240
popsicle stick

1042
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,759
or a popsicle stick or a burnt popcorn

1043
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,120
and it just doesn't dab right for me

1044
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,879
it's not what i like

1045
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,879
a lot of people love it don't let me

1046
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,399
sway you because i don't like it you may

1047
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,320
[ __ ] love it so

1048
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,398
that's how much roz and i would dab if i

1049
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,000
were going to dab a dab of rosin that's

1050
00:31:36,398 --> 00:31:39,359
all you need if you're a new dabber

1051
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,038
if you're an experienced dabber you know

1052
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:42,719
how much to take for yourself go in but

1053
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,038
if you're new i want you to go light

1054
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,000
like i said earlier you can't un-dab the

1055
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:47,278
dab you just took

1056
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,798
you gotta deal with it you gotta cough

1057
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,079
you gotta have that panic attack you

1058
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:51,440
gotta do all that [ __ ]

1059
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:52,720
i'm looking at my notes to make sure i

1060
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,440
covered all this stuff that i wanna

1061
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,480
cover

1062
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,919
um something i did not buy any of is

1063
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,759
distillate distillate is um it's

1064
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,880
distilled [ __ ] concentrates they make

1065
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,558
a concentrate

1066
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,720
and sometimes concentrates are not up to

1067
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:07,839
par or sometimes they want to do

1068
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,519
different things with different

1069
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:12,240
components of the concentrate they can

1070
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:14,240
separate each cannabinoid the thca

1071
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,839
the cbd whatever cannabinoid you're

1072
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,278
looking for they can pull it out in

1073
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:19,278
separate columns then

1074
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:21,200
they can take uh the terpenes and

1075
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:24,240
separate them into different columns

1076
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,399
when they sell just the thca or just the

1077
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,038
cbd in a liquid form after it's been

1078
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,359
distilled that is a distillate

1079
00:32:29,038 --> 00:32:34,079
a lot of times we refer to that as hot

1080
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:36,079
dog water it's quite the same as the crc

1081
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:37,759
tech people think it is polished turds

1082
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,798
you were taking concentrate that was not

1083
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,480
up to par

1084
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,639
go ahead and distill it clean it out

1085
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,038
separate all the [ __ ] then you can put

1086
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,759
your own very specific blend of terps

1087
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:47,919
and thc

1088
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,759
into the pens into your rigs into your

1089
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,559
vape carts and you can sell that however

1090
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,440
you'd like

1091
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:53,918
so that is distillate i did not buy any

1092
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,720
uh

1093
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,559
it is clear and it looks a lot like the

1094
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,319
uh terp sauce that i showed you

1095
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,158
i'm not into it didn't spend any money

1096
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:03,759
on it i used to really like it

1097
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,200
then companies started when it first

1098
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,640
came out i think the companies were

1099
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,640
using quality material

1100
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,640
as time went on it got funky it got

1101
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,640
worse it's like the bottom of the barrel

1102
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,240
we call it hot dog water now

1103
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,679
sorry if you're making distill it and i

1104
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,038
just [ __ ] all over your stuff hopefully

1105
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,080
you're making good stuff but be careful

1106
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,119
with the distillate

1107
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,359
all right um so most of what i showed

1108
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:24,239
you

1109
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:26,158
is made can be made from dry products a

1110
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,640
lot of things have to be made from a

1111
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,120
fresh

1112
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,200
frozen product um i didn't go over live

1113
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,038
resin i don't have any live resin

1114
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,278
live resin has a lot of different

1115
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,679
textures and consistencies that is made

1116
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,599
from fresh frozen concentrates you have

1117
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,960
to cut down or fresh frozen plants

1118
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,038
you have to cut down your plants take

1119
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,798
off the big leaves then freeze it

1120
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,640
then you run that through a butane

1121
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,480
extraction machine and it comes out

1122
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,720
super turpy and delicious you get the

1123
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,480
essence of that fresh plant because

1124
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,759
heat and light destroy terpenes when you

1125
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,558
cut it down and freeze it and then

1126
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:56,319
extract it

1127
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:57,759
you've just preserved all the magic and

1128
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,158
it tastes so delicious

1129
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:00,798
so that is live resin now i'm going to

1130
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,440
show you

1131
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,398
what i believe to be live batter this is

1132
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,120
batter that was made

1133
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:08,638
from fresh frozen plants this is the

1134
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,000
garlic grove i'm going to crack it open

1135
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,320
and show you that one again

1136
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,679
this is the live batter from yeah it

1137
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,639
says live batter so that means that

1138
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,159
gives me the

1139
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,480
opinion that it was made from fresh

1140
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,119
frozen plants so that's the live batter

1141
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,480
it's very similar to the non-live batter

1142
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,240
the other batter i showed you

1143
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,519
may have been a frozen batter as well

1144
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,838
and they don't indicate that on their

1145
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,280
package this one i know was fresh frozen

1146
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:31,358
um just because i showed you the

1147
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:33,519
apothecary diamonds and sauce i want to

1148
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:36,000
show you some green dot labs

1149
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:36,559
we call this full spectrum extract this

1150
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,519
is the

1151
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:39,838
high terpene full spectrum extract and

1152
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,079
the

1153
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,119
high cannabinoid full spectrum extract

1154
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,039
sold together

1155
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,879
from another company instead of using

1156
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,559
the proprietary ambrosia term

1157
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:49,918
at green dot labs they call it a full

1158
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,878
spectrum extract we say

1159
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,638
fse um i want to show you this one had a

1160
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:55,358
nice diamond in here this is the garlic

1161
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,039
banger

1162
00:34:55,358 --> 00:34:58,480
i really love the chunky diamonds in

1163
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,239
there you can see those diamonds if i

1164
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,639
tip it too long the terp sauce will run

1165
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,719
out

1166
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,239
but there's the diamonds in there uh

1167
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,598
that is the green dot labs i also want

1168
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:06,399
to show you this holy [ __ ] just because

1169
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,920
it's beautiful

1170
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,079
and it's called holy [ __ ] look it really

1171
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,838
says that on the jar holy [ __ ]

1172
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,119
from con from green dot labs full

1173
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:15,599
spectrum extract

1174
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,160
got a really cool logo i want to show

1175
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,800
you the

1176
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,239
concentrate see that that's a nice ratio

1177
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,000
of diamonds to sauce

1178
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:24,399
so that's what the diamonds and sauce

1179
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,838
the full spectrum extract looks like

1180
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,519
i think i've showed you most of the

1181
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:29,279
concentrates on the table i do have

1182
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:30,559
some head banger and some sexy peach but

1183
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
there's consistencies that you've

1184
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:33,920
already seen

1185
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,599
so i think now it is time to work our

1186
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,320
way toward talking about

1187
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,000
the equipment that we need and use when

1188
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,838
we are dabbing let me read my list to

1189
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,199
make sure i got it all shattered crc

1190
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:48,078
wax batter diamonds and sauce ambrosia

1191
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:48,719
fse show distillate rosin yeah we got it

1192
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,000
all you guys

1193
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:54,719
i feel secure moving on to the gear

1194
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,719
section um in the gear section of the

1195
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,118
podcast i want to start by showing you

1196
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,399
what has become my favorite dab setup

1197
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,880
this is nice and easy

1198
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,800
uh not super expensive this is something

1199
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,559
everybody has access to

1200
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
a lot of people like a really colorful

1201
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,799
fancy rig from a glass artist that they

1202
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,880
know

1203
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,560
i love that i like a rig that i know

1204
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,440
hits like a [ __ ] truck

1205
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,639
ran my face over this is my favorite rig

1206
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:18,240
it has got a big fat

1207
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:21,199
flared out mouthpiece so that when i put

1208
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:23,039
my mouth on it it fits perfectly

1209
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,879
my mouth goes in there instead of on the

1210
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,559
outside it's more like i'm blowing a

1211
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,440
trumpet instead of sucking a peepee

1212
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,838
it fits better uh when i take a giant

1213
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,599
dab

1214
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:33,039
if i've got a really small peepee shaped

1215
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,000
mouthpiece or something with an awkward

1216
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:35,759
hole in it

1217
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,760
i get a bunch of concentrate built up on

1218
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,599
my lips because i take big dabs

1219
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,520
this big flared out mouthpiece doesn't

1220
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,400
concentrate my dab my smoke into one

1221
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:44,239
tiny spot

1222
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,920
i really like that it's good for a

1223
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:47,199
mustache guy i got some some sort of

1224
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,280
facial hair all the time

1225
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,639
so i like the flared out mouthpiece

1226
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,560
you'll notice this rig

1227
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,000
is fairly small this is probably three

1228
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,039
and a half inches tall in the main

1229
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,119
can piece we don't need a big

1230
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:00,159
rig this is not a bong when you're

1231
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,760
smoking a bong

1232
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,358
you want to fill a big section with

1233
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,119
smoke and then pull the carb

1234
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,039
so you can get that all that smoke to

1235
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:07,680
your face we're not going to carve the

1236
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:08,960
dab rig

1237
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,078
you're going to put the dab on there

1238
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,280
you're going to put a cap on it you're

1239
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,800
going to spin it around and that smoke

1240
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,480
is going to go through the water to your

1241
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,480
face there's no chamber to fill

1242
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,240
there's no space you don't need that big

1243
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,719
dab that pull you don't need that i like

1244
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,399
a small

1245
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:23,279
rig you'll notice my nail or banger of

1246
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,160
choice today

1247
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,160
is just a basic this is called a banger

1248
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,719
just a basic banger it's a 90 degree

1249
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:30,399
banger

1250
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:31,919
uh we'll talk more about bangers in just

1251
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,358
a moment this is my

1252
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,200
weapon of choice when it comes to

1253
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,279
dabbing i heat this piece up until it's

1254
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,239
the desired temperature i set my i've

1255
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,400
got a dabber

1256
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:42,000
i place the dab in here using my dabber

1257
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,440
but dapper's got a hair on it beautiful

1258
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,358
timing couldn't have been better

1259
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,280
there we go put the dab right in there

1260
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:48,639
once the dab is in there i put a cap on

1261
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,680
it we'll talk about the cap and what it

1262
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,440
does in just a moment

1263
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,838
and then i just inhale slowly until i've

1264
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,679
got my dab um so that is my

1265
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,519
favorite rig right now i like the

1266
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:59,440
smaller rig better it's better than a

1267
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:00,639
bong in my opinion i like the flared

1268
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,200
mouthpiece

1269
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:04,559
um well let's talk about the perk i

1270
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:05,759
don't need a lot of water it's kind of

1271
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:07,440
dirty in there sorry i should have

1272
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,440
cleaned that but this is reality it's a

1273
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,720
[ __ ] 710 show i've been dabbing

1274
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,159
i like this one it's got a stem that

1275
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,838
goes straight down to the water then it

1276
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,639
splits off two directions they call that

1277
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:16,719
a hammerhead

1278
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:18,078
this is a hitman hammerhead sidecar is

1279
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:19,838
what this is known as

1280
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:21,359
but that two-way perk in there gives me

1281
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:22,960
plenty of good filtration

1282
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,719
just enough to cool down the smoke and

1283
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,079
make it not super hot by the time it

1284
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,439
gets to my lung i'll inhale through the

1285
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,760
rig and you can see the bubbles on both

1286
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,760
sides

1287
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,519
i'm not sure how clear that comes up on

1288
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,160
the camera but that is the hitman

1289
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:36,800
hammerhead sidecar my rig my weapon of

1290
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:38,399
choice

1291
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,960
let's talk more about some other

1292
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,358
equipment when i first got into dabbing

1293
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,960
the first real dab i started by dabbing

1294
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,159
by putting concentrates in a bowl and

1295
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,838
smoking it in a bowl

1296
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,679
and that was a waste it got me really

1297
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,039
high but it wasn't efficient and

1298
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:54,319
effective

1299
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:57,039
my first real dab off of a real dab rig

1300
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,079
came from daniel desai at the broadway

1301
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,159
wellness booth

1302
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,440
at the high times cannabis cup in denver

1303
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:05,279
colorado at the

1304
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,400
expo uh the endo what was that called

1305
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,160
[ __ ] expo mart expo

1306
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,440
i forget the name of the place a little

1307
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:13,440
tiny shitty place

1308
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:15,280
uh not the big place not the denver mart

1309
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,639
but x dough it was x dough is what i

1310
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,320
think the name of the place was

1311
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,799
but shout out to big d he gave me my

1312
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,519
first real dab i took that dab off of a

1313
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,359
device

1314
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,358
known as a skillet i don't have a

1315
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,199
skillet anymore mine was donated for

1316
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,358
science or history

1317
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:30,799
with the skill it was it fit inside of

1318
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:33,119
your bong or your rig

1319
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,400
your existing smoking apparatus and it

1320
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,480
had a piece that came up

1321
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,838
out of the the female part of the bowl

1322
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,400
wherever your bowl would slide into your

1323
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:39,920
bong

1324
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,519
it would slide into there just like your

1325
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,200
bowl and then it had

1326
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,880
it went straight up and then it curved

1327
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:46,960
down and hung upside down it looked like

1328
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,720
an upside down or a right side up bell

1329
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,760
actually the bell part flared

1330
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:53,759
and pointed down then it had a piece of

1331
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,119
like aluminum wrap wrapped around it

1332
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,119
looked like a hippie made it made you a

1333
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,680
wire wrap and i had one piece that

1334
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,519
extended to underneath that bell then

1335
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,318
underneath that bell would go

1336
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,440
a round piece of titanium and that was a

1337
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,279
skillet plate

1338
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,679
so you'd be able to swing it up since it

1339
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,839
was on the it's wrapped around

1340
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,799
the curved piece [ __ ] i'm messing this

1341
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:14,719
description all up

1342
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,720
so it goes up and it curves straight

1343
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:17,838
down so you got a [ __ ] 180 degree

1344
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:19,919
angle goes straight up

1345
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:21,440
goes it does a u-turn you turn peace at

1346
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,880
the middle of that u-turn you would wrap

1347
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,920
the titanium [ __ ]

1348
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,440
twine or wire and then you could spin it

1349
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,760
up and down to where you could move

1350
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,760
the plate in and out from underneath the

1351
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,680
bell i think that makes sense now so you

1352
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,599
got a u-turn the bottom of the u-turn

1353
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,719
is a bell at one end and it attaches to

1354
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,880
your bong at the other

1355
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,318
i've got some resin on my finger if you

1356
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,920
see that in the video

1357
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,519
just resin don't worry so you got your

1358
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,720
u-turn bell on one side goes into the

1359
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,239
rig on the other

1360
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:48,239
then they've got the skillet that swings

1361
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,919
up and down so you can swing it up

1362
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:51,759
heat it swing it back down it goes under

1363
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,639
the bell you would swing it up and heat

1364
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,319
it long enough

1365
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:55,920
then you would slide it under the bell

1366
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,119
and then you'd put your dab on there and

1367
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,358
then when the dab melts

1368
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,480
your bell is basically right above it

1369
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,960
and it would just go right into there

1370
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,358
when you inhale i think that makes sense

1371
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,720
that was the original way to dab i saw a

1372
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,400
lot of people put their dab on the

1373
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:10,318
skillet and tip the rig and the [ __ ]

1374
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,880
dab would run right off the skillet

1375
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,519
i saw a lot of carnage from that we were

1376
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,200
heating

1377
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:18,880
that [ __ ] skillet till it was glowing

1378
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:20,239
orange and then hitting it we've learned

1379
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,920
that that is not the way to do it

1380
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:23,358
we've evolved a little bit since then so

1381
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,119
the first dabs were coming

1382
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,880
off of a skillet i wish i had one here

1383
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,920
to show you like i said i donated that

1384
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,160
one to history

1385
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,960
but the thing we got right after that

1386
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,358
was the

1387
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,079
domed titanium nail i'm going to take a

1388
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:35,598
little sip of this

1389
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,560
water and then i'll show you a domed

1390
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:38,559
titanium nail

1391
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,000
so this rig is a little tiny rig from a

1392
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,279
local glass artist called solomino glass

1393
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,480
shout out to solomon i don't know if

1394
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
he's still around i think he may have

1395
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,280
gone to denver

1396
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,720
hope you're well bro haven't seen you in

1397
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,560
a minute but

1398
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:59,039
this is a little tiny rig known as a

1399
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,759
mini rig it's got a 14 millimeter

1400
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:02,480
male joint this joint is a male so you

1401
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,920
need a

1402
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,599
female dome to go on your male rig but

1403
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,680
what we would do is we would put this

1404
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,200
piece in there this is called a nail

1405
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,039
and if you're not watching the video

1406
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,078
i'll try to describe it it kind of looks

1407
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:16,318
like a screw

1408
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,760
it's got a long piece and then a top to

1409
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:19,759
it like a head of a screw

1410
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:21,040
but it's also would have a nut on it and

1411
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,440
you would use that nut

1412
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,800
to uh adjust the height so you put the

1413
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,119
long end of the screw

1414
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,359
into the rig and adjust the nut to where

1415
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,240
the head of the nut is sticking out

1416
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:33,838
and then you would heat it up you would

1417
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,279
heat up the head of the screw part i'm

1418
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:36,799
pointing at it on the video here we

1419
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,800
would heat this part up

1420
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,400
and then we would put the dome over it

1421
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,000
so that your dab doesn't get away

1422
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,160
and then you put your dab on the dabber

1423
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,679
and put your dab onto the nail through

1424
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,838
the dome so you've got

1425
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,358
your nail would basically sit where your

1426
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:50,559
slide would go into your bong but it

1427
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,400
fits inside of there

1428
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:54,400
this goes into the hole and rests on

1429
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,920
that this the nut part

1430
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,838
holds it in place so it doesn't go too

1431
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:58,559
deep you heat that part up so now it's

1432
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,559
nice and hot

1433
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,639
then you place your dome over it and

1434
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,159
then you put the dab onto the nail

1435
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:05,519
and now the dab doesn't disappear it

1436
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:06,559
doesn't just fly off into nowhere

1437
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:08,639
because it's got the dome

1438
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:10,159
then as you inhale if you choose to you

1439
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:11,519
can kind of cover the dome a little bit

1440
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:12,239
with your fingers and regulate the

1441
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:13,759
airflow

1442
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,519
and we'll talk about carb capping and

1443
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,599
that stuff here in a moment but

1444
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,440
that is where we evolved we went from

1445
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,160
the swing arm skillet to the

1446
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,599
domed nail a big shout out to taskrock

1447
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,199
for the nail that he made here i think

1448
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,000
this was called the flux nail this is a

1449
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:28,480
14 millimeter

1450
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,519
flux nail from highly educated big shout

1451
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,119
out this one is

1452
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,719
chased and burnt to [ __ ] it's time for a

1453
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,318
new one but i don't use this anymore

1454
00:43:32,719 --> 00:43:36,078
just had it around on the shelf for a

1455
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,079
good experiment so you throw this bad

1456
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,240
[ __ ] in here heat it up with the torch

1457
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,079
put that on there drop your dab in there

1458
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,000
then hit it cap it with your fingers

1459
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,359
that is how the dabbing evolved from the

1460
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,679
skillet

1461
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,838
then i think everybody got tired of

1462
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:51,440
taking the dome off and losing domes and

1463
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,199
dropping domes and having to carry a

1464
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,599
dome around

1465
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,719
also the dome would get stick stuck if

1466
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:58,240
you would take a dab

1467
00:43:56,719 --> 00:43:59,439
and the dab would drip down a little bit

1468
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,479
it would get [ __ ] stuck and you'd

1469
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,159
have to heat it up a little bit with

1470
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,318
your torch to get the dome off

1471
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:05,358
uh we got tired of the domes you guys so

1472
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,318
that is when

1473
00:44:05,358 --> 00:44:09,838
we found domeless nails big shout out to

1474
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:12,880
our friend taskrock once again

1475
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,960
highly educated for the domeless dab

1476
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,838
nail this looks like a rook from a chess

1477
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,000
piece

1478
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:19,599
it's got a tapered bottom it's got two

1479
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,800
heat sinks so that the heat doesn't get

1480
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,359
too much to your rig

1481
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,839
then it has got a big top with a big

1482
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:26,239
moat

1483
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:27,599
type dish in there and then it's got a

1484
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,519
cylinder down the middle

1485
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:30,640
so where your dab doesn't fall right

1486
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:32,480
down the middle hole it's got a

1487
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,239
cylindrical piece that sticks up

1488
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,079
kind of a chimney if you're watching the

1489
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,639
video it will all make sense to you

1490
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,640
this is a domeless nail this one is a

1491
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,879
female this one fits on the outside

1492
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:44,400
if it's right over there on the outside

1493
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,079
of that just like the dome does

1494
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,680
then you would heat this part up you'd

1495
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,880
use your dab tool to put your dab right

1496
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:51,279
in there cha-ching

1497
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,079
then that is where the carb cap comes

1498
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,839
into play

1499
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,440
the device i've got in my hand is known

1500
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,199
as a carb cap this is from highly

1501
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,800
educated titanium also

1502
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:00,559
it's got a couple of tips available i

1503
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,359
like the flat tip you can pick up some

1504
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:02,960
shatter

1505
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:04,559
then you put your shatter onto the

1506
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,880
dabber after you've heated it up

1507
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:08,318
then the carb cap fits right over the

1508
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,680
top of the domeless nail

1509
00:45:08,318 --> 00:45:11,679
i know we didn't have a dome now we're

1510
00:45:09,679 --> 00:45:12,318
just using a cap right but what you can

1511
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,799
do

1512
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,639
you can use this and turn it and it's

1513
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,240
got one hole inside of there

1514
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:19,679
i'm trying to get the hole on the camera

1515
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,039
there's the hole you turn this while

1516
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,318
it's on top of the nail and that will

1517
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,559
move the oil around

1518
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:25,920
on that nail to disperse the oil better

1519
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:27,519
and get it to fresh heat because

1520
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,559
sometimes the nail will cool as the oil

1521
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,159
hits on there

1522
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,719
if you take a big dab like i do it will

1523
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:34,239
cool over time so that is a carb cap

1524
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:35,679
uh we didn't have to take the dome off

1525
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:37,199
every time you could scoop up your dab

1526
00:45:35,679 --> 00:45:38,879
heat it up drop your dab on there put

1527
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:41,039
the cap on it and be ready to rock

1528
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,800
wasn't as much work very convenient that

1529
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,838
was the evolution

1530
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:47,280
so where do we go from uh domeless nails

1531
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,759
where am i where am i

1532
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,359
uh skillet dome domeless oh that is

1533
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,920
where we moved into

1534
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,039
bangers and carb caps let me get some of

1535
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,440
this stuff out of my way try to keep

1536
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:58,239
myself

1537
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,920
organized and on track bangers and carb

1538
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:00,719
caps these have become my favorite way

1539
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,920
to dab

1540
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:03,838
i'll show you a couple of different

1541
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:07,119
examples i showed you this one here

1542
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:09,440
this is a female banger

1543
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,680
it's got a the hole is on the bottom it

1544
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,280
fits onto a male rig that's a female

1545
00:46:11,679 --> 00:46:15,679
banger that's a 14

1546
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,480
a 14 millimeter is the size of the hole

1547
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,078
this is a

1548
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,599
male banger it's slightly stuck in the

1549
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,079
rig i may have to apply some heat there

1550
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:21,519
we go

1551
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,760
that's just resonating it gets stuck

1552
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,280
this is a male this one goes into the

1553
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,200
hole does that make sense to you guys

1554
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,280
the male goes into the hole the female

1555
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,118
receives the piece so the joint is a

1556
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,079
female the nail is a male

1557
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,440
this is a 14 millimeter banger as well

1558
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,960
uh neither one of these are very

1559
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,800
expensive bangers if you want to be the

1560
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,240
guy that buys the expensive stuff go for

1561
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,519
it if you want to buy something not

1562
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,959
overpriced

1563
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:44,559
go for that try to find something

1564
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,318
american-made that's my biggest

1565
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:49,039
recommendation but those are

1566
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,920
your dab bangers uh where do we have to

1567
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:52,880
go from there

1568
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:54,800
a bubble cap a banger isn't a banger

1569
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,400
without a good bubble cap so let me show

1570
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,599
you a carb cap and we'll talk about what

1571
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:59,119
a carb cap does

1572
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,880
and why we're using these things also

1573
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,880
big shout out to blissful glass

1574
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,559
for the grow from your heart podcast dab

1575
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,200
rig you did a wonderful job i [ __ ]

1576
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,719
love it

1577
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,559
thank you big shout out make sure you

1578
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:10,559
guys follow i'm 99

1579
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,880
sure that was blissful glass give them a

1580
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:14,159
follow so a carb cap

1581
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,599
i've talked about taking a dab you're

1582
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:16,799
gonna heat this up drop your dab in here

1583
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,318
we'll do that in a moment

1584
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,839
uh then you're gonna put a carb cap on

1585
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:22,000
it why and what

1586
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,199
what the [ __ ] does this carb cap do when

1587
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,800
you put the cap in here

1588
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,078
you'll notice it restricts the airflow

1589
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,440
when i inhale watch when i inhale

1590
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:30,480
without it

1591
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,159
now watch when i inhale with it

1592
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,760
you can hear and see the restricted

1593
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,118
airflow the hole is smaller not as much

1594
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,160
air can get in here

1595
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,800
that creates a vacuum and it creates

1596
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,759
a it requires that's what i want it

1597
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,200
requires

1598
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,280
less heat to make my dab uh

1599
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:49,358
vaporize or volatize whatever the word

1600
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,200
is it takes less heat to get my dab to

1601
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:52,000
turn into a vapor that i can get through

1602
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,480
the rig

1603
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,920
so without the intense heat i do not

1604
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,599
burn my dab off

1605
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,280
i don't burn off the terps i don't burn

1606
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,240
off the cannabinoids i can get a little

1607
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,160
lower temperature

1608
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,159
and i don't burn my throat my lungs my

1609
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,318
esophagus it's a smoother dab

1610
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,759
and it tastes a little bit a lot better

1611
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,279
honestly when you cap it so that's the

1612
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:11,520
reason of a carb cap

1613
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:13,040
i'm gonna veer off of my notes here

1614
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:16,159
because i forgot to talk

1615
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:18,318
about um cold start dabs some people

1616
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,199
will put their concentrate in the banger

1617
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:22,719
and then heat it up that's acceptable as

1618
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,838
well i like to heat the banger and then

1619
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:25,679
drop the dab in there

1620
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,279
the reason for the cold start dab and i

1621
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:28,960
didn't talk about inserts either let me

1622
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:30,640
make a note on this paper to talk about

1623
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,400
inserts i skipped that

1624
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,960
inserts hopefully i look down and see

1625
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:36,480
this um cold start dabs

1626
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,480
cold start dabs are closer is what some

1627
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,000
people prefer that way you don't scorch

1628
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,358
the dab you don't fry it up

1629
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,199
you're actually getting it as it's

1630
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:44,318
heating up instead of dropping it onto a

1631
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:46,159
hot surface

1632
00:48:44,318 --> 00:48:47,679
imagine if you drop something onto a

1633
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,239
scorching hot surface you just sing it

1634
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:49,519
right away

1635
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:51,519
if you bring it up to temperature and

1636
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:53,440
then smoke it as it reaches temperature

1637
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,280
you get it at that perfect boiling or

1638
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:56,318
volatizing or vaporizing point i don't

1639
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,040
know the correct term

1640
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:01,039
so a lot of people do cold start dabs um

1641
00:48:59,039 --> 00:49:02,159
insert dabs i don't have my inserts set

1642
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:03,039
up here in front of me i should have

1643
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,039
grabbed that

1644
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,960
an insert looks like a little tiny

1645
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:07,759
thimble and you put your concentrate in

1646
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,838
the glass

1647
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,119
thimble then you heat the banger and

1648
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:13,199
drop the insert

1649
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:14,240
into the banger and put the carb cap on

1650
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,078
it

1651
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,279
this is a very similar approach as a

1652
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,519
cold start dab

1653
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,119
you're not singing the dab right away

1654
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:22,559
it's sort of like a double boiler like

1655
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:24,079
if you're trying to melt chocolate

1656
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:25,200
if you put chocolate in a pan and turn

1657
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,640
up the heat the chocolate is going to

1658
00:49:25,199 --> 00:49:28,719
burn and stick to the pan

1659
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,078
if you put a pan of water on the stove

1660
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,399
and then put your pan of chocolate

1661
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:34,079
inside that water you'll slowly heat the

1662
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,240
chocolate and it won't burn itself and

1663
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,839
it doesn't scorch that's the same idea

1664
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,159
as doing an insert dab you're catching

1665
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:41,440
the dab as it heats up instead of at the

1666
00:49:40,159 --> 00:49:43,118
scorching temperature

1667
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,480
so that's an insert dab i had to make

1668
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,559
sure to include that because i did

1669
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,318
leave that out on my notes and shout out

1670
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,680
to my new mexico crew

1671
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,920
who's always killing me with those

1672
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,358
[ __ ] insert dabs love you for it but

1673
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,720
god my lungs are hurting

1674
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:56,558
uh where are we gonna go from there

1675
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:57,118
banger and bubble cap showed you the

1676
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,000
male

1677
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,280
and the female banger um now this is

1678
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,800
something fun you guys

1679
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,800
i've got a really fun device here in

1680
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,920
front of me that i may be able to move

1681
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,200
it a little bit but i don't want to get

1682
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,880
too crazy

1683
00:50:07,199 --> 00:50:11,759
eventually we got tired [ __ ] potheads

1684
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,760
we got lazy

1685
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,440
and got tired of heating up the dab nail

1686
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,960
constantly between dabs

1687
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,240
uh waiting for it to cool to the right

1688
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,119
temperature you heat it up you let it

1689
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,479
cool down

1690
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:22,720
then you put the dab on there you take

1691
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,559
your dab you set it down next guy scoops

1692
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,838
up his dab [ __ ] heats it repeats it

1693
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,800
it takes a little bit to get a couple of

1694
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:28,078
dabs in you

1695
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,359
and if you want to have a nice dab

1696
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:30,240
session you can go through a little bit

1697
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:32,239
of butane

1698
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,078
also some people didn't want us using

1699
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,598
butane in some places we were allowed to

1700
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:37,119
consume but we couldn't have a torch you

1701
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,000
couldn't be blasting the [ __ ] butane

1702
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,358
torch

1703
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,838
so that is where we became uh [ __ ]

1704
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:43,838
techno

1705
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:44,880
technologically advanced and we got

1706
00:50:43,838 --> 00:50:47,519
something called

1707
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:48,240
an email what i'm showing you here is a

1708
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:50,480
ceramic

1709
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:52,000
dab nail some dab nails were made out of

1710
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,800
ceramic some people feel that the

1711
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,719
ceramic

1712
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,480
preserves the flavor better than the

1713
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,239
titanium or the quartz

1714
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,159
i think the quartz is definitely better

1715
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:02,239
in flavor than the titanium that's why i

1716
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,719
liked it so i switched

1717
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,719
the ceramic is great but it's not my

1718
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,239
favorite i'm not 100 sold but you can

1719
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,558
see that i do have it and i do

1720
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,759
enjoy it it does give a nice flavor but

1721
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,400
it takes maintenance

1722
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,319
and it will break eventually i think but

1723
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,559
this is a quality ceramic nail

1724
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,759
and a quality ceramic email shout out to

1725
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:21,920
our friends at b nail

1726
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,839
a big shout out to ollie at b nails for

1727
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:25,519
a great hookup on the email

1728
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:27,119
i love this thing uh this has made

1729
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:28,960
quarantine easier

1730
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:30,640
i'm not bitching about the ceramic nail

1731
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,440
it's just not my favorite i'm honest

1732
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:34,078
with you guys

1733
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:35,519
if this was a quartz banger on this

1734
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,359
email i would be hitting this

1735
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:38,639
all of the time but the ceramic is

1736
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,199
simply not my favorite

1737
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,000
just being honest with you um it doesn't

1738
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,519
cap as well

1739
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,280
and it's just not for me i like the the

1740
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:48,639
banger with the bubble cap so

1741
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,000
this cord this is a heated element there

1742
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,000
is heat coming off of this right

1743
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
now you can't see it but this is hot

1744
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,519
this cord is running to a box right here

1745
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,199
i'll try to show you the box

1746
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:59,039
it's plugged in and it's also attached

1747
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,759
to this so i've got to be gingerly with

1748
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:02,159
this

1749
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,359
uh this box right here this end plugs

1750
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:05,118
into the wall

1751
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:06,960
this end right here is plugged in to

1752
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:09,760
here and you can see it's got the number

1753
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,880
715 on it it's set at 710 but it's

1754
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:14,400
about 712 sorry i'm dyslexic it's a 713

1755
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,160
now 714

1756
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,760
this is keeping a constant temperature

1757
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,838
on the top of this dab nail

1758
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,800
so right now if i decided to which why

1759
00:52:19,838 --> 00:52:22,639
the [ __ ] not

1760
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,240
i could scoot myself a dab of this

1761
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,480
garlic grove live batter

1762
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,919
and this is always hot there's no

1763
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,920
maintenance there's no prep

1764
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,200
all i got to do is get a dab put it on

1765
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:33,358
the dabber and i'll show you how we hit

1766
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,960
the email you guys

1767
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:36,480
just because why wouldn't i do it right

1768
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,079
i'm gonna move the mic out of my face

1769
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,838
we're gonna take a dab it's already hot

1770
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,559
it's ready to go i'll put a cap on it

1771
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:44,838
take a dab and we'll talk more if you're

1772
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:47,839
dabbing now's the time

1773
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:47,838
cheers

1774
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:08,159
you guys if you are new at dabbing do

1775
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:11,039
not take a dab that big

1776
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,318
that is a professional dabbers dab and

1777
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,800
i'm sure you noticed that when i dropped

1778
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,679
the cap

1779
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:17,039
on that nail the smoke got even thicker

1780
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,318
i've got the temperature to that nail

1781
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:19,759
set kind of low

1782
00:53:18,318 --> 00:53:21,119
and the concentrate just bubbles when

1783
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,040
you set it on there it doesn't volatize

1784
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:24,480
but as soon as you put that cap on there

1785
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,159
it's like putting a lid on a pan it just

1786
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,358
traps that heat just cooks it a little

1787
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,279
more quickly

1788
00:53:27,358 --> 00:53:30,880
it really gives you a solid dab that

1789
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,640
tasted delicious by the way shout out to

1790
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,160

1791

1801
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,079
showed you a lot of great [ __ ] where are

1802
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:54,480
we going to go from here oh i know

1803
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:55,760
where do we go now we will go to the

1804
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,838
terp pearls

1805
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,839
something that came really popular for a

1806
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:00,239
little while was a device known as the

1807
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:01,759
terp

1808
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,558
pearl i'll show you what a tert pearl is

1809
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,960
it's real simple it is

1810
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,000
these are little glass balls it's hard

1811
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,800
to show you on the camera without

1812
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,639
dropping them

1813
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,160
just little exactly what they sound like

1814
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:16,400
round perfectly round

1815
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:19,199
glass balls try to pick them up here

1816
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,559
there you go two round glass balls and

1817
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:22,480
what we do with the dirt pearls

1818
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,760
is you get your banger and you gently

1819
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,039
they're gonna make a tinky noise that i

1820
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,000
hate the sound of it but

1821
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:29,279
you drop them right in there and then

1822
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,239
when you take a dab

1823
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:33,119
the idea is that those terp pearls will

1824
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:35,039
spin around

1825
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:36,559
under the pressure of the carb cap and

1826
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,119
they move the oil around

1827
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,720
in your banger to where they touch more

1828
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:42,480
of the surface of the banger to where

1829
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:44,000
your oil doesn't sit in one spot and

1830
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,519
cool down one area

1831
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,920
it'll move it all over the place and

1832
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,679
keep the they also hold heat so they're

1833
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,280
melting your dab while they're doing it

1834
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:52,960
instead of your dab puddling up in one

1835
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,839
spot it just makes you get a longer

1836
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,880
cleaner better draw out of a dab and

1837
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:58,159
i'll show you what happens

1838
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,000
uh there's a certain you have to use a

1839
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:01,440
certain kind of carb cap to make it work

1840
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,960
uh here's the cap that works when you

1841
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,838
put it on here and then you draw through

1842
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,838
it if you watch on the camera

1843
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,358
i don't know if you could see it through

1844
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:13,838
the uh the murky part of that nail but

1845
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:15,759
those

1846
00:55:13,838 --> 00:55:17,599
little balls in there were rapidly

1847
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,599
spinning around the edges of that

1848
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:21,039
banger so if you suck at the right

1849
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,640
temperature and you've got oil in there

1850
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:24,079
it'll just keep that or not the right

1851
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:25,679
temperature the right pressure it'll

1852
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,599
keep those balls moving around that'll

1853
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:29,358
just keep your oil moving over the heat

1854
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,519
you don't burn the dab you don't create

1855
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:33,119
a puddle you get a bigger fatter dab for

1856
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,039
people who take big dabs that is

1857
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,039
definitely a good thing to do

1858
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:38,558
i don't do it i just use the bubble cap

1859
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,239
i take a big fat dab

1860
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,319
you've got to clean the turf pearls

1861
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,519
often i just more [ __ ] to clean it was a

1862
00:55:42,318 --> 00:55:45,039
fad for a little bit

1863
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:46,559
uh give it a try if you're into it you

1864
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:47,599
may love it some people love it just for

1865
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,798
the novelty

1866
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,240
some people are into it i'll show you

1867
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:52,239
one more time see if they spin in there

1868
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:01,280
you can definitely hear them oh it's

1869
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:02,000
intense when you take a dab with no dab

1870
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,839
and you're just sucking

1871
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,440
and sucking all right let me put these

1872
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:06,000
pearls away where are we gonna go from

1873
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,159
here

1874
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,280
i think that covers most of the dabbing

1875
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,558
equipment if you feel like i've

1876
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,839
forgotten any uh

1877
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,280
legends that should have been included

1878
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:14,838
in the list please send me an email the

1879
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,200
email address is grow from your heart

1880
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:18,159
hotmail.com now let's talk about some of

1881
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:21,039
the other things

1882
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,719
that are required for taking dabs oh i

1883
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,159
almost forgot to show you also

1884
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,879
i've got a titanium nail for the e-nail

1885
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:28,399
system this

1886
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,160
just a different cord you just plug this

1887
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,920
one in it's got a titanium nail

1888
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:34,000
this one again is from highly educated

1889
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,639
titanium so if i decided to switch up to

1890
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,639
the tie

1891
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,879
i can do that but i do prefer the

1892
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:39,759
ceramic over the titanium but i prefer

1893
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,240
the quartz

1894
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:43,040
over everything just my personal opinion

1895
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,558
you guys

1896
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:46,558
nobody really pays me to say any of this

1897
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,519
stuff so let's move on to

1898
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,599
the extra parts that we need for dabbing

1899
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:53,838
something you can't dab without

1900
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:55,119
the torch bro uh without an email you

1901
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:56,400
definitely need a torch

1902
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,318
so you're gonna have to be able to heat

1903
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,160
up your banger somehow so let's start

1904
00:56:58,318 --> 00:57:01,358
from the beginning you got a banger

1905
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,118
you got a rig you got a rig with a

1906
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:04,000
banger you need that part then you'll

1907
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:05,440
need a torch

1908
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,920
you'll need a torch to heat up the

1909
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,639
banger then you will need

1910
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:12,000
a dabber to put the dab into the banger

1911
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,400
then i highly recommend

1912
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:15,679
a carb cap i like a nice bubble carb cap

1913
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,039
if you're going to go with terp pearls

1914
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,118
make sure you get the appropriate carb

1915
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,039
cap that will make the turf pearl spin

1916
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,039
uh when you're shopping for your pearls

1917
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:24,318
the appropriate carb cat probably will

1918
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:26,000
be right next to them if you've got a

1919
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,920
good reputable reputable reliable

1920
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,280
head shop or if you're shopping online

1921
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,639
they should pop up in the same

1922
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,440
should be like people that bought that

1923
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:36,960
also bought this so your basics are

1924
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,119
uh your rig your torch your dabber your

1925
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,720
carb cap and a quality concentrate

1926
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,559
after that you're gonna need a few

1927
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,318
extras we're gonna need to fill

1928
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,319
the torch because a guy like me goes

1929
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:47,759
through a lot of butane

1930
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,838
and while we're talking about torches

1931
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,000

00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:59,279
that doesn't look like a big crack head

1937
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,480
torch

1938
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,160

butane is not expensive you don't need

1954
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:27,119
any fancy kind of butane don't let them

1955
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,960
really upsell you

1956
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,480
if you've got a normal torch the cheap

1957
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,079
butane is going to be fine if you buy an

1958
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,519
expensive torch you may want to get a

1959
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,039
little pricier butane

1960
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,199
they claim there are additives and other

1961
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:39,199
[ __ ] in the cheap butane i don't know

1962
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:40,558
i'm not an expert there but it could

1963
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:42,000
clog up your torch it could [ __ ] it up

1964
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,040
so if you get an expensive torch get

1965
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,960
good butane

1966
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:46,239
this thing was like 30 or 40 bucks i

1967
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,559
don't know if that's expensive or not to

1968
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:50,000
you

1969
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:51,519
it's got two flames and it says the name

1970
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,280
of the brand and it says the name of the

1971
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:54,880
brand they better work together

1972
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,400
these came from uh this one actually

1973
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:57,358
came from new mexico this one came from

1974
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,280
a local shop

1975
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:01,199
so you're gonna need some butane to keep

1976
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,599
the dab torch moving

1977
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,118
uh something else i recommend is a q-tip

1978
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:05,760
why do i recommend some q-tips i've

1979
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:07,838
always got a

1980
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,359
thing a glob mop sitting around because

1981
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:09,838
most of the time you can see that this

1982
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:11,039
banger

1983
00:59:09,838 --> 00:59:13,119
is a little bit cleaner than the other

1984
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:14,719
one after i take a dab once it's cooled

1985
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,760
off a little bit i'll take a q-tip or

1986
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,439
two

1987
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,119
and just mop out the crap right out of

1988
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:20,559
the banger just mop it up just

1989
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,720
clean it right on out so that the next

1990
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:24,798
time i dab it it doesn't taste like [ __ ]

1991
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:25,838
these q-tips have a pointed end and a

1992
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:27,440
rounded

1993
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:29,199
excuse me and get that pointed in down

1994
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,480
in there into the corner then use the

1995
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:31,838
round end to clean it up

1996
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:33,838
i also have another little container

1997
00:59:31,838 --> 00:59:35,119
over here that acts as a trash can

1998
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:37,119
every couple of days i gotta dump that

1999
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,760
out get rid of all my uh my

2000
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:41,280
dirty ass q-tips so q-tips are very

2001
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:42,079
useful if you're gonna use a banger i

2002
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,200
also q-tip

2003
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:46,798
out the uh quartz or the uh what's it

2004
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:48,558
called again the ceramic banger

2005
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:50,000
if i remember i didn't do it this time

2006
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,000
wasn't paying attention was just keep

2007
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,440
keeping the show moving so another thing

2008
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,280
i recommend

2009
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,280
it will come in very handy in your dab

2010
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,240
life which right now during the covid

2011
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,960
situation

2012
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,719
is kind of a commodity but some sort of

2013
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,760
isopropyl alcohol some

2014
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:08,639
91 or better rubbing alcohol

2015
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,240
when you're dabbing life will get sticky

2016
01:00:08,639 --> 01:00:10,879
i just set this dabber down right here

2017
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:12,318
on the table

2018
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,160
and the back of it is sticky from my

2019
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:16,239
dabs and i got a sticky spot

2020
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:17,440
my carb cap rolled across the table now

2021
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,039
i got a sticky spot

2022
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:21,679
now i'm gonna move it over here out of

2023
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:23,358
my way and now i've got two sticky spots

2024
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:24,558
uh everything is sticky and it's only

2025
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:26,159
been a few minutes since i've cleaned

2026
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,119
the table i cleaned up before i did this

2027
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,039
podcast

2028
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,720
everything is sticky over here now a

2029
01:00:29,039 --> 01:00:32,400
little bit of isopropyl alcohol will fix

2030
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,719
that right up it'll be your friend

2031
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:35,760
i also like to have alcohol wipes i

2032
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:37,679
don't have them out right now because

2033
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:39,920
i'm here by myself but the little square

2034
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,598
packets of alcohol wipes i like those if

2035
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,318
you happen to be dabbing with friends

2036
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,920
before and or after a covid situation i

2037
01:00:44,318 --> 01:00:47,599
would still clean the rig with those

2038
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,440
just clean the mouthpiece i got a

2039
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:50,720
mustache girls wear a lipstick

2040
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,400
just clean the [ __ ] mouthpiece

2041
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:53,679
occasionally every couple of dabbers if

2042
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,039
you don't know the guy before you don't

2043
01:00:53,679 --> 01:00:56,719
feel bad about cleaning the [ __ ]

2044
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:57,920
mouthpiece even if you do know him

2045
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,239
don't feel bad about cleaning the

2046
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,000
mouthpiece here see we're seeing why

2047
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,679
covet is why we should clean mouthpieces

2048
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:05,280
you can't trust anybody's

2049
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,798
spit or anything now you got to take

2050
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,280
care of ourselves but the little alcohol

2051
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:09,280
wipes

2052
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,880
are always handy i like to have those

2053
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,359
especially at events where we're smoking

2054
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,240
in a

2055
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:15,279
community fashion uh what else do we

2056
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:19,039
need to talk about

2057
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:21,440
an oil slick pad um

2058
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:22,798
most of this entire table is covered in

2059
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,000
a slick pad i'm gonna try to tip the

2060
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:24,960
camera down and show you what i'm

2061
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,440
talking about

2062
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,000
this green and white pad here is a slick

2063
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:30,400
pad

2064
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:31,760
nothing sticks to it uh it doesn't it's

2065
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,119
got a couple of burn marks on it from

2066
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:35,040
cleaning nails and [ __ ] but

2067
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,960
it's it keeps the table safe so that my

2068
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,719
table doesn't get real super sticky

2069
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,000
this part the stickiness wipes right off

2070
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:40,798
real easy with a little bit of rubbing

2071
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,480
alcohol

2072
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:44,159
i recommend a couple of slick mats or

2073
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,838
slick pads somewhere to store your

2074
01:01:44,159 --> 01:01:46,879
concentrates keep your computer desk or

2075
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:48,480
your dab in space

2076
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,079
sticky free don't get your mom's table

2077
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,920
all sticky whatever you're doing

2078
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,680
uh they're just a really good investment

2079
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,318
keeps it nice and clean for you

2080
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:57,679
um also some paper towels put them right

2081
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:58,480
next to your rubbing alcohol because

2082
01:01:57,679 --> 01:02:01,118
you're gonna need to

2083
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,199
need to clean the table quite often uh

2084
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,798
you'll see me sometimes doing a podcast

2085
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:06,960
reach my arm up and rub my forearm it's

2086
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,639
because i just stuck it in a [ __ ] dab

2087
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,358
so clean the table a lot

2088
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:13,118
all right i think that covers most of

2089
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,318
the concentrates i covered most of the

2090
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:16,079
gear i'm looking at all the [ __ ] on the

2091
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,960
table i think i covered that

2092
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,798
um a couple of different rig styles i

2093
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,798
should talk about this is your normal

2094
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:25,599
perk type rig it's got the down stem and

2095
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:28,239
the hammerhead we talked about that

2096
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:30,079
um i hit out of this one here this one's

2097
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:31,598
got like a honeycomb rig if you notice

2098
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:34,000
the smoke goes down and then through

2099
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,440
this then there is a disc in here

2100
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,280
with holes on the top that make the

2101
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:39,440
smoke go straight up so that's a really

2102
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:41,119
cool filtration system this bubble here

2103
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,559
prevents the water from going too high

2104
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,838
and splashing me in the face

2105
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:49,039
i'll give a little pull of that you can

2106
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:50,078
see the honeycomb style perk

2107
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,920
i don't know if you can see how that

2108
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,440
water just goes straight up gives it a

2109
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,960
whole lot of filtration a whole bunch of

2110
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,318
micro bubbles in there

2111
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,400
uh we've got of course the grow from

2112
01:02:56,318 --> 01:02:59,759
your heart podcast rig just got a little

2113
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,680
down stem with two holes

2114
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,960
call that a two hole diffie could be

2115
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:04,000
more than two holes now that i'm looking

2116
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,240
at it

2117
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,679
but it's got some holes in there uh nice

2118
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,279
and simple i like a nice i like this one

2119
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,279
because it's nice and small

2120
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,880
fits maybe it fits in the cup holder

2121
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:13,760
allegedly perfectly i don't know what

2122
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,599
i'm talking about

2123
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,440
i like a little mini rig these used to

2124
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:18,798
be all the rage this one went to a

2125
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,000
couple of cannabis cups because it's

2126
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:21,199
easy to carry around and it doesn't

2127
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,280
topple over

2128
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:24,399
then this one is a little bit unique

2129
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,160
this one uh

2130
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,160
it's known there's a company that makes

2131
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:31,038
rigs like this they call them a klein

2132
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:32,719
uh this company calls it an in-cycler if

2133
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:34,960
you look at it

2134
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:36,318
the smoke would go down this way then it

2135
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,400
would go in through here

2136
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:39,759
then it goes up like the other rig

2137
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,960
through the honeycomb

2138
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:44,400
but then as it goes up the water

2139
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,599
falls into these holes i don't know if

2140
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,119
yeah you can see there's a hole here

2141
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:49,280
there's a hole here in another hole

2142
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,119
on the inside of this rig there's a cone

2143
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:51,839
so the water would fall into the holes

2144
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,480
of the cone

2145
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,159
then it swirls like a tornado goes down

2146
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,639
then out of this drain on the back of

2147
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,399
the rig

2148
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,318
then back toward the bottom so the water

2149
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,720
is going up and then recycling through

2150
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:02,880
the

2151
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:03,919
condular shape then through the funnel

2152
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:05,760
then through the drain

2153
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,119
then back up so the water is moving as

2154
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:10,079
well it's known as an

2155
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:12,000
end cycler it's a recycler but inside of

2156
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,280
ourselves inside of itself

2157
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,599
i'll give a little pull so you can see

2158
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:17,280
what it does watch for the water to fill

2159
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:19,039
the holes at the top and then fill the

2160
01:04:17,280 --> 01:04:19,760
cylinder on the inside and swirl back

2161
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,760
down

2162
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,359
that's the neat part just a lot of cool

2163
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,640
filtration is why i like this one big

2164
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:26,000
nice smooth dabs

2165
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:28,400
but here we go i'll give it a pull so

2166
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,400
you can see

2167
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:41,759
you can see where the water drains back

2168
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:43,440
down in you guys i do encourage you if

2169

2181
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,760
cool rigs

2182
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:07,519
let's talk i talked a little bit about

2183

2185
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:12,960
that dab

2186
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:14,400
if you get too high you're not going to

2187
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,000
enjoy it you're not going to want to dab

2188
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,880
anymore you may get paranoid you'll get

2189
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,719
uncomfortable

2190

then work your way up you guys see me

2196

2197
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,920
me

2198
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,240
i'm not saying i'm cool i'm not saying

2199
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,159
i'm robocop i'm saying if you're new the

2200

up and you're not gonna enjoy it

2202
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:41,280
i've been doing this for a long time i'm

2203
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,798
a [ __ ] pothead i've been training i'm

2204
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,319
a black dog say that a lot

2205
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:46,719
not only am i a black belt and growing

2206
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:49,358
i'm a [ __ ] dab in black belt so

2207
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:50,399
be careful um that's not from my ego you

2208
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:52,078
guys that is from

2209
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:53,519
my heart caring about you i'm not trying

2210
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,880
to say i'm a monster dabber it sounds

2211
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:57,358
like i'm bragging or something

2212
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,798
it's i'm not i'm saying i do heroic

2213
01:05:57,358 --> 01:06:00,639
doses and i don't want to watch you try

2214
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:04,159
to be a hero and hurt yourself so

2215
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:07,199
do small dabs now let's talk about dab

2216
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:10,000
temperature i do kind of big dabs

2217
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:11,118
so my dabs are hotter than the average

2218
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,159
bearer

2219
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:15,838
when i heat up the nail i usually heat

2220
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:16,318
it up until it's almost to the point of

2221
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:17,920
glow

2222
01:06:16,318 --> 01:06:20,000
right now you don't need it to glow but

2223
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,240
i know right to where it's about to glow

2224
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,199
then i'll put my hand by it i hold my

2225
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:25,439
hand about

2226
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:26,558
it's probably a half an inch maybe yeah

2227
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:27,760
i'm going to say a good half an inch

2228
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:30,079
away from the nail

2229
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,680
i want to feel the heat of the nail kind

2230
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,798
of i don't want to touch it i know if i

2231
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:34,239
touch it at that temperature it's going

2232
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:36,079
to breath it's going to [ __ ] suck

2233
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:37,759
but i can get real close it's not going

2234
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,920
to cook my hand if i touch it

2235
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,839
but i want it to feel you can feel the

2236
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,960
moisture being cooked out of your skin

2237
01:06:41,838 --> 01:06:43,759
when you get close to it i know that

2238
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,440
sounds bad but

2239
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:47,039
it's just a pinch it's not a burn it's

2240
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,079
not a hurt but you can feel your skin

2241
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:49,839
kind of contract

2242
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,280
and go oh that's hot give me away from

2243
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:52,960
there and it's your skin it's the

2244
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,319
moisture in your skin just going i don't

2245
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:57,838
think you should do that bro

2246
01:06:54,318 --> 01:07:00,960
so kind of experiment with your dab heat

2247
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:01,759
my advice is to go too cool before you

2248
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,838
go too hot

2249
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:04,880
if you think it's not gonna melt then go

2250
01:07:03,838 --> 01:07:06,480
a little bit hotter

2251
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,599
put the cap on there and draw through it

2252
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,199
if you think you could have gotten a

2253
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,880
bigger dab if there's a puddle left you

2254
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,639
probably could have gotten hotter

2255
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,798
but i want you to start nice and cool

2256
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:16,879
don't go roasting your [ __ ] lungs

2257
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:18,719
something i should talk about emails

2258
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:21,119
they've got a number on the box

2259
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:22,239
that's an arbitrary number i do not

2260
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:24,160
believe that they have

2261
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,439
some of them may they're affordable and

2262
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:27,279
i don't think that they're using this

2263
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:29,920
technology because we can afford it

2264
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:30,640
i don't think there is a sensor running

2265
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,480
up the cord

2266
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:34,639
saying oh the surface of your nail is

2267
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:37,119
this temperature i will adjust

2268
01:07:34,639 --> 01:07:38,159
i think we are sending out an arbitrary

2269
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,039
number worth of

2270
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:42,000
heat a worth of electricity uh kilohertz

2271
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,319
or something down this

2272
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,838
cable to heat up this element and then

2273
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:46,558
that heat has to travel to the head of

2274
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,358
the nail

2275
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:51,680
so that is kind of an arbitrary number

2276
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:52,719
find the perfect setting on your email

2277
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:54,719
don't rely on

2278
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:56,719
my email number don't rely on anybody

2279
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:59,118
else's email number

2280
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:00,798
the manufacturer or who sent it to you

2281
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:02,880
may have a recommendation

2282
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:04,559
start there or a little bit lower and

2283
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:06,160
work your way up

2284
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:07,280
it's better to start with a dab that

2285
01:08:06,159 --> 01:08:08,399
won't melt you may have to waste a

2286
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,079
couple of dabs

2287
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,160
but that is all about the learning

2288
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,839
process just blow a couple of dabs off

2289
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:14,960
let them evaporate let them [ __ ] melt

2290
01:08:13,838 --> 01:08:16,238
let them waste

2291
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:18,079
but once you get to that perfect

2292
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:19,358
temperature it'll be magical every time

2293
01:08:18,079 --> 01:08:20,479
you reach for the email

2294
01:08:19,359 --> 01:08:22,640
you'll be able to get that [ __ ]

2295
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,358
perfect perfect dab and then clean it

2296
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,960
every time

2297
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:26,719
give it maintenance make sure to turn it

2298
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,640
off when you leave you have no

2299
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:30,079
idea how many times i've walked in the

2300
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,838
house and [ __ ]

2301
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:33,838
saw those numbers lit up on the box and

2302
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:35,439
went oh [ __ ]

2303
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,198
i don't think anything will go wrong but

2304
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:38,719
that's that's a hot thing just sitting

2305
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,879
here on the table while i'm away

2306
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,480
i don't have a cat but if i had a cat a

2307
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:43,920
cat i know a cat would come knock that

2308
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,358
over just to be a [ __ ] cat

2309
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,520
and then you'd have [ __ ] dab nail

2310
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:50,079
fire all by the kitty

2311
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,440
so uh dab temperature go low don't go

2312
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:53,198
too hot we don't want you to roast your

2313
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,798
lungs roast your esophagus

2314
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:56,879
don't burn your [ __ ] out you can go

2315
01:08:54,798 --> 01:08:58,158
hotter don't take too big of a dab you

2316
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,000
can go bigger

2317
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:01,278
uh where else are we don't hold your

2318
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,880
dabs in

2319
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,239
i see a lot of people try to take a big

2320
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,239
dab and then hold it in it's not

2321
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,838
necessary with the dab with a bong rip

2322
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:09,919
with the pipe rip there's no need

2323
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:10,960
to try to hold in your hit that will

2324
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,279
give you oh

2325
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:15,039
see no copd chronic obstructive

2326
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:17,359
pulmonary disorder

2327
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:19,278
that causes problems in your lungs that

2328
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,359
pressure is not good for your lungs

2329
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,640
your lungs work like a filter when you

2330
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,400
breathed in that smoke

2331
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,920
it got all of the cannabinoids all the

2332
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,639
terpenes it got all the [ __ ] that it was

2333
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:28,640
gonna get

2334
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,159
on the way back out it probably took a

2335
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,039
little bit more i'm not a super

2336
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:32,559
scientist

2337
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:34,640
but then you blow it out all the [ __ ]

2338
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,679
you don't want went into that cloud all

2339
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:37,600
the [ __ ] that you want

2340
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,798
stayed into your lungs don't hold it

2341
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,880
it's not good for you

2342
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:42,560
you'll give yourself lung problems heart

2343
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,920
problems chest problems

2344
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,920
you'll get a head rush out of it but

2345
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:48,798
it's not worth it in the long run so

2346
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:49,600
uh do not hold your dabs in i don't find

2347
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:52,960
it necessary

2348
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,960
it's not good for you um i think that is

2349
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,679
most of what i had written down we could

2350
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,640
cover

2351
01:09:55,679 --> 01:09:59,279
um some etiquette when you're done

2352
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:01,760
dabbing

2353
01:09:59,279 --> 01:10:03,039
take the carb cap off of the nail

2354
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:04,560
because you don't want to pass it like

2355
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:05,679
this to me and have it fall off on my

2356
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:08,239
table and break

2357
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:09,039
or if we are somewhere carpeted like a

2358
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:10,879
lot of cars

2359
01:10:09,039 --> 01:10:13,119
allegedly have carpet i don't want you

2360
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,279
to drop that carb cap onto my leather

2361
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:16,640
seats or onto my floor that's carpeted

2362
01:10:15,279 --> 01:10:17,599
and then get it all furry and we gotta

2363
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:19,600
[ __ ] clean it

2364
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:20,640
so when you're passing it take the carb

2365
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:22,880
cap off

2366
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:24,239
uh pass them as two separate things be

2367
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,640
careful that way

2368
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:28,479
especially with an e-nail do not leave

2369
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:29,520
this cap on top of the email let's look

2370
01:10:28,479 --> 01:10:30,479
at what's gonna happen here you're going

2371
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,920
to take your dab

2372
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:33,119
like a [ __ ] stone bro and you set

2373
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,480
these two down together and you just

2374
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:36,319
leave it there what are we doing

2375
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:37,919
we're heating up this carb cap the

2376
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:39,279
heat's going to climb up to here

2377
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:41,119
mike is going to come over and be like i

2378
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:42,399
need a dab he'll grab this and burn the

2379
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:44,000
[ __ ] out of himself because it's been

2380
01:10:42,399 --> 01:10:45,679
sitting here all day heating up

2381
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:48,000
let's not do that to our friends take

2382
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:49,760
the carb cap off of the rig

2383
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,279
also if you dab out of somebody else's

2384
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,280
rig and you're not

2385
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:55,039
familiar with how to q-tip that [ __ ]

2386
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:56,719
out ask them politely

2387
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:57,760
hey bro will you show me how to q-tip

2388
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,600
this thing because i don't want to leave

2389
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,280
your banger all dirty and chased

2390
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,039
feel free to ask for help with somebody

2391
01:11:01,279 --> 01:11:04,960
else's equipment a lot of the rigs

2392
01:11:03,039 --> 01:11:06,560
a lot of the bangers we're using are not

2393
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,039
cheap you guys i buy

2394
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,480
production glass because i'd rather get

2395
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:12,000
the hit than the art

2396
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:13,919
i want the punch to the face more than a

2397
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,238
colorful rig but a lot of our friends

2398
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,880
make

2399
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:18,639
beautiful colorful custom art don't

2400
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:20,079
don't break it don't be disrespectful

2401
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:21,119
with your friend's glass that's another

2402
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,119
thing i should mention when you've got

2403
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:25,279
your buddy's expensive glass

2404
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:27,279
don't be boisterous and expressive and

2405
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:28,719
too much like like this rig here

2406
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:30,000
i wouldn't i wouldn't want you doing

2407
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:30,880
that with my rig right there i know it's

2408
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:32,719
there it's mine

2409
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,119
but if that's your buddies maybe move it

2410
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:37,039
over here before you start [ __ ]

2411
01:11:35,119 --> 01:11:38,238
talking with your hands and [ __ ] so keep

2412
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:40,960
[ __ ] like that in mind

2413
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:43,039
uh some of our rigs are quite pricey i

2414
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:45,600
wouldn't be uncommon to be at a sesh

2415
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:47,119
in denver in colorado in la wherever you

2416
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,400
are and come across a 10

2417
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:52,319
15 20 000 dab rig that people just pass

2418
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:54,399
around so keep that kind of [ __ ] in mind

2419
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,359
uh don't break people [ __ ] have respect

2420
01:11:54,399 --> 01:11:57,920
for it

2421
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:59,119
um i think that is all i've got for you

2422
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,560
guys

2423
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:01,599
showed you all the gear gave you some

2424
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,719
tips we talked about all the

2425
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,120
concentrates

2426
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,000
i think now it is time to take some

2427
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,359
[ __ ] dabs

2428
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,960
uh let's wrap up the show and then i'm

2429
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:10,399
gonna take a couple of dabs out of the

2430
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:12,079
banger i'll take a dab out of the banger

2431
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,359
and that'll probably be the end of it oh

2432
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:15,840
i should hit the crc

2433
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:17,198
also i got some homework to do so i'm

2434
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:18,719
gonna do this part i'll keep the video

2435
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,559
recording while i take some dabs

2436
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:21,520
maybe i'll play uh some of the music or

2437
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,640
something at the end of there i'm not

2438
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,080
sure how this will work but

2439
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,920
we'll make it happen [ __ ] it we'll do it

2440
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:27,198
live um

2441
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:28,960
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls

to hit the crc

2507
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:24,479
first because i've never tried this and

2508
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:26,639
it's new to me

2509
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,399
and then i'll probably hit some batter

2510
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,480
all right here we go

2511
01:14:28,399 --> 01:14:32,479
all right my first review of crc here on

2512
01:14:30,479 --> 01:14:36,399
the show uh it doesn't have

2513
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:38,718
uh any desirable flavor it was kind of

2514
01:14:36,399 --> 01:14:40,079
uh it was like dabbing hospital product

2515
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,760
it felt very sterile

2516
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:44,158
it didn't have much flavor the high got

2517
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:45,039
me immediately but it already feels like

2518
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:46,399
it's wearing off

2519
01:14:45,039 --> 01:14:48,640
it punched me and then it was like

2520
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,920
exhale high high

2521
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:51,520
i'm not high anymore i don't know if you

2522
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,239
can tell it didn't really do much and

2523
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,960
took a good dab

2524
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:56,000
