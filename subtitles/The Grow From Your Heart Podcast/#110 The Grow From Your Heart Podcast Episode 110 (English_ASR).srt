they got a little turf sloppy yeah we

178
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,829
might do that so I've got a bunch of

179
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,718
notes here in the phone I should

180
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:37,430
probably open that stuff up and start

181
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:38,728
getting on it first before we get too

182
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,769
far I need to learn a little

183
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:42,180
bit about the dude it's Gatsby

184
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:47,728
Invitational you guys want to tell me

185
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:51,269
all about that I'm sure so I've kind of

186
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:53,308
been organizing these like shoot fests

187
00:06:51,269 --> 00:06:55,348
for a few years I used to do it for a

188
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:57,449
different company I'm gonna bring a

189
00:06:55,348 --> 00:07:00,028
bunch of girls and photographers to

190
00:06:57,449 --> 00:07:01,650
different locations and we would make a

191
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:03,870
whole bunch of art and have a really

192
00:07:01,649 --> 00:07:05,998
good time and there was kind of an

193
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,158
excuse for all of us to get together

194
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:12,838
even though we are spread across the

195
00:07:08,158 --> 00:07:15,509
country and I thought why not do that

196
00:07:12,838 --> 00:07:21,120
for cannabis products and for businesses

197
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:23,639
and so we kind of jet I kind of ran the

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,168
idea pass went and he was like that

199
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:27,389
could actually happened it was kind of

200
00:07:25,168 --> 00:07:29,158
just an idea wouldn't it be cool I

201
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,418
really just wanted an excuse to bring my

202
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:34,699
friends somewhere and watch them run

203
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:40,769
around naked but he said that we could

204
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:43,499
make it a real thing and and lots of

205
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:47,639
hard work and planning and some sweet

206
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:50,430
sponsors later and a lot of these guys

207
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,718
here teaching me how to be a boss you

208
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:54,899
already knew that to be a boss before I

209
00:07:51,718 --> 00:07:57,269
met you well maybe I mean I think

210
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:59,430
lifestyle marketing and kind of like

211
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:02,490
content creation in general is something

212
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:04,499
that numerous businesses whether big or

213
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:08,038
small are utilizing in different aspects

214
00:08:04,499 --> 00:08:10,110
and so with you know the the GG fam and

215
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:14,088
different kind of aspects and I actually

216
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:17,520
met damsel at one of those shoots before

217
00:08:14,088 --> 00:08:19,379
giving cannabis class until like the

218
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,620
photo shooting and kind of doing some

219
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,569
cannabis consulting but with the people

220
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,300
that are in the room now there's a

221
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:29,939
massive imprint and footprint so to

222
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,528
speak on like how social media and

223
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,440
social engineering and lifestyle

224
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:36,328
marketing comes to be very effective and

225
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,209
so it was kind of a double-edged sword

226
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:41,158
with bringing the right people together

227
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:42,509
but also getting the right brands

228
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,000
together to be able to like represent

229
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:46,799
what damsel does really well and what we

230
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,720
can put together and what brands were a

231
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,709

00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,950
hunt put me in touch with Miss damsel

292
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,509
and she asked me if I would breed a

293
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,400
strain for her so a lot of what's been

294
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:53,889
going on this weekend is we have all

295

00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:21,700

00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,059
in doing this but the one that's gone

307
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:30,299
first there's always the true the one

308
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:32,919
that everybody's smoked was gone fever

309
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,509

since you got your notes right in front

316
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,899

00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:52,330
little bit like pineapple with a hint of

318
00:12:49,899 --> 00:12:53,259
citrus but the taste was a little bit

319
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:56,530
more

320
00:12:53,259 --> 00:13:02,319
I was so high when I did this I drew a

321
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:04,750
campfire floral with the hint of birch

322
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,640
and then it was nature II I said it kind

323

love before the [ __ ] can I call you

329
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:37,230
guys the [ __ ] for the length of the

330
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:42,028
show and I'll stop right after I found

331
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,339
my boundary all right so did anybody

332
00:13:42,028 --> 00:13:45,958
else in the room get a campfire or just

333
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:49,220
tastes like camping aroma I'm just

334
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,289
curious about that totally all right

335
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,550
aren't you a chef you've been cooking

336
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,799
the entire time I've been here that's

337
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:59,159
the first time you haven't been cooking

338
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,539
yeah well thank you I appreciate it and

339
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,509
you caught you say it does kind of taste

340
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,588
like campfire in a good way yes okay all

341
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,700
right because when I think you can't

342
00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:07,500
fire I think like when you go camping

343
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:11,940
and your hair smells like campfire not

344
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:13,649
like that that's yes is hey what kind of

345
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:19,860
dreadlock joke is that mama grab a mic

346
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:21,600
if you're gonna talk but it heard you

347
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:26,570
all right so before I was there a

348
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:31,589
runner-up yeah I also really enjoyed the

349
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:33,540
a 383 all right which I thought it

350
00:14:31,589 --> 00:14:36,180
smelled like fruity pebbles

351
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:38,759
a little bit like black cherry but it

352
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:43,139
tasted a little more diesel II but that

353
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:45,809
one had super sparkly chirps on it and I

354
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:48,389
described the overall highest sway feels

355
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:50,159
you know and you like get super high and

356
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:56,159
you just like start swaying in the

357
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:59,189
kitchen nice just kind of leaning yeah

358
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,809
this Way's all right so does anybody

359
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,839
want to know what was in these crosses I

360
00:15:00,809 --> 00:15:05,609
know all the boys tell me what's in

361
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,529
there

362
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:09,089
yeah this was fun to mess with everybody

363
00:15:07,528 --> 00:15:16,860
did anybody try any of the number the

364
00:15:09,089 --> 00:15:18,839
letter C did any of that get tasted it

365
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,149
was no good that's why there were three

366
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:24,360
that were from that selection I didn't

367
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:26,490
bring them so the way I did this I ran I

368
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,470
think I started with 20 seeds of three

369
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:30,329
different strains and I narrowed it down

370
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:33,570
through the veg phase and through flower

371
00:15:30,328 --> 00:15:35,039
I ended up with three of letter A and I

372
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,028
just labeled the seeds so that nobody

373
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,708
knew what they were I've just this is

374
00:15:36,028 --> 00:15:40,110
Brandi this is Brandi this is Brandi I

375
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:42,629
had three of letter A four of B and

376
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:43,980
three of C Cesar Dukey just got rid of

377
00:15:42,629 --> 00:15:45,059
them we don't need that it's crap I'm

378
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,200
not even gonna grow any more of those

379
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:51,809
seeds throw it all the way a C was a

380
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:54,810
transformer two-day breaker from gage

381
00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:59,939
drain genetics transformers inferno haze

382
00:15:54,809 --> 00:16:01,979
and Kim D and then the what's the other

383
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,019
one I said it is sorry I'm lost now Kim

384
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:08,009
D that's inferno haze' and Daybreaker

385
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:09,899
Daybreakers Kim D and Joseph Oh G

386
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,250
all right yeah so many genetics in my

387
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,250
head that I get confused but the winners

388
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,679
are PIRG I am kind of a Terp nerd I'll

389
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:18,448
take that a is space Queen crossed a

390
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,698
grateful dog I used a female space clean

391
00:16:18,448 --> 00:16:22,799
and a male a reverse male grateful dog

392
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,240
so it's a feminized seeds space

393
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:26,159
yeah space cleaned a grateful dog is

394
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,810
what that is so it's my space cool or am

395
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,809
i grateful dog that I made two sub cool

396
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:31,649
space Queen a real tall stretchy

397
00:16:29,809 --> 00:16:33,268
phenotype of the space Queen that's

398
00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:35,190
where that fruity funky moldy smell

399
00:16:33,269 --> 00:16:36,870
comes from as a space Queen and it's the

400
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,810
Romulan that makes it grow those orange

401
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:42,209
real orange pistols the real fingery

402
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:43,588
calyx is that's from Romulan okay so be

403
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,939
the one that everybody loves

404
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:46,949
everybody's guessed it so many times

405
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,630
accurately its lemon skunk from Arion

406
00:16:46,948 --> 00:16:51,299
its greenhouse seeds lemon skunk its

407
00:16:48,629 --> 00:16:53,100
ourian's from lemon man and then it's

408
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:55,139
crossed to the day breaker from gage

409
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,440
brain genetics with the joseph OG and

410
00:16:55,139 --> 00:17:01,559
the chem D in there so that's what that

411
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,329
one is lemon skunk and day breaker needs

412
00:17:01,559 --> 00:17:05,639
a good name if it's so what I've heard

413
00:17:03,328 --> 00:17:08,490
you might not decide that this is gonna

414
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:11,850
be the keeper you know they were all

415
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:14,970
super super good but I feel like there's

416
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:17,000
just another strain that I compared all

417
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,380
of my eyes to

418
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,009
don't say the name of it cuz we're gonna

419
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,079
keep I think we should try to put that

420
00:17:22,009 --> 00:17:27,799
in the mix and maybe do the process over

421
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:29,480
but there were so many good what was the

422
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,220
b1 that was another really really good

423
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,930
one that's the lemon skunk Daybreaker

424
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,519
cross so all of the bees will be lemon

425
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:36,470
skunk today breaker and all of the A's

426
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:38,990
are grateful dog in space Queen Holy

427
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,279
See's were trash okay so the ones that

428
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,960
you guys really liked we're gonna work

429
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,309
on getting those on the shelf at green

430
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:48,319
and healthy wellness it'll take a while

431
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:50,599
yeah that's the a3 a3 we'll get that

432
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:57,049
there before and before maybe even be

433
00:17:50,599 --> 00:17:59,179
one boys are across the room and when I

434
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:00,889
said b1 I got two thumbs ups on the b1

435
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,090
so there will be some new stuff showing

436
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,770
up the green and healthy wellness you

437
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:04,879
guys that'll be a little bit be a couple

438
00:18:03,769 --> 00:18:12,339
harvest but we'll make it happen

439
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,340
I mean it all got smoked it's great yeah

440
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,890
really high it's when they don't smoke

441
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:23,440
like the Colorado folk do they come and

442
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:27,080
get rekt and it's pretty entertaining

443
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,490
not making funny you I love it the

444
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,769
turkey boys have just been smoking all

445
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:53,539
the B 1 and B for like champions what

446
00:18:30,769 --> 00:19:08,509
you feel and just for appearance she

447
00:18:53,539 --> 00:19:10,430
wrote green she's all blushing that's

448
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:12,259
cute I like it I have more notes a week

449
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:17,450
ago over unless anybody has more stuff

450
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:18,799
to say about this weed what so talk to

451
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:21,190
us about what's up with that fee know

452
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,379
how long is before how high does it get

453
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,220
so B 1 and B all of the B's were very

454
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:27,110
very similar

455
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:28,640
ok growth you could barely see a

456
00:19:27,109 --> 00:19:30,229
difference in them they kind of stretch

457
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,670
the limits gunk make some stretch pretty

458
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,170
well

459
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:35,019
they grow real dense they grow real

460
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,880
chunky they take they could take 70 days

461
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:38,289
these went 63 I think it could have gone

462
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,740
another week but I was pressed for time

463
00:19:38,289 --> 00:19:43,930
what about top the a was done at eight

464
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,730
weeks finished at 8 weeks one of them

465
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,810
started to herm you could probably see

466
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,190
it if you guys are experienced weed

467
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:49,750
growers and if you got one of the top

468
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:53,980
buds you could see her flowers in there

469
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,269
it was just yeah Mon so I can't I can't

470
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,470
work I don't remember which one it is I

471
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:57,670
took pictures and mark it down to the

472
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,680
photos and stuff but I don't remember

473
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:02,200
off the top of my head but I marked down

474
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,200
which one was a herb that one brought in

475
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,660
the most the most flower yeah be one

476
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,430
well be one brought in just yeah there

477
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,509
was most of them there are little plants

478
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,860
they harvested about an ounce and a half

479
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:15,339
B one was about two and a half ounces

480
00:20:11,859 --> 00:20:16,869
yes yeah yes

481
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:20,230
I got another roster on the microphone

482
00:20:16,869 --> 00:20:21,309
that's always nice yeah you know what

483
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:23,799
your favorite strain is basically

484
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:26,079
D'Angela you figured that out we're

485
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,059
gonna cross something of mine to that

486
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,500
strain some of our friends in the room

487
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:30,750
actually have a clone of your favorite

488
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,250

stolen yesterday morning and you talked

657
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:35,570
about the irony of this welcome to bring

658
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,430
up the fact that I got paid to be a car

659
00:28:35,569 --> 00:28:41,089
thief model for the Department of police

660
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:44,690
and DMV about identity theft and getting

661
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:47,119
your car stolen and that was on every

662
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,910
red rock ticket in every DMV Department

663
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:52,819
banner for like a year or so so how many

664
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:56,660
Facebook and Instagram and text messages

665
00:28:52,819 --> 00:28:58,159
did you give oh yeah so like five

666
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,190
o'clock in the morning I started my car

667
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:02,720
whatever in these guys got it while I

668
00:29:01,190 --> 00:29:04,220
was coming out the front door and I

669
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,460
chased them and all this other [ __ ] that

670
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:11,990
occurred and then three or four hours

671
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:19,910
later we got our car back so that was a

672
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:24,380
double Mike in him all this stuff I

673
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:26,000
think the day yesterday yeah so two days

674
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:27,770
ago whenever it happened on Thursday I

675
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,529
think I got about like 15 to 20 text

676
00:29:27,769 --> 00:29:32,720
messages of some sort of image of myself

677
00:29:30,529 --> 00:29:34,789
as a car thief saying that your car was

678
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,670
easy to steal and taking your identity

679
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:39,319
was even easier and there's one that's

680
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:41,029
like a really big close up with me and

681
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,369
it just says did like you know something

682
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:46,069
about me taking your ID or some [ __ ]

683
00:29:43,369 --> 00:29:50,149
so I'm mad at myself for not making the

684
00:29:46,069 --> 00:29:52,549
