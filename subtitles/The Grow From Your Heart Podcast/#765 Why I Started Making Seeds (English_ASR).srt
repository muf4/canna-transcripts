back but i can't just get rid of this

57

you can hear it in my voice i can hear

58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,959
it it's much much more exaggerated when

59
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,359
i get the microphone and headphones

60
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,439

73
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,679
one episode uh my lungs get really tired

74

just talking through a whole podcast

75
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,680

for my lungs to get tired doing a

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,280
podcast feels uh ridiculous to me

80
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,039
honestly so i've got to take my time

81
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280

92
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:16,399

93
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,079

john at lollipop farms beautiful people

97
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:24,479
up there i don't need to mention their

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,759
location or anything else about them

99
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,119
they know who they are they know that i

100
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,719
got nothing but love and respect for

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,560
everybody up there

102
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,000
they asked me and maybe a pot they sent

103
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,158
me a text message and said it may be a

104
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,400
good idea if you talk about how and why

105
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,560
you got into breeding i realize i've

106
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,080
probably done that on this podcast but

107
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,598
there are 765 episodes up and maybe you

108
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
didn't see the episode where i talked

109
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,959
about it it's probably been 300 episodes

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,318
or so

111
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,158
so here we are i don't want to try to

112
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,560
put out a lot of grow information right

113
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,959
now because uh since uh the plague hit

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,239
me my attention span is not where it

115
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,840
should be so i don't want to try to give

116
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,759
you grow information

117
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,680
lots of detailed information with weeks

118
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,199
and numbers and times and things like

119
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,959
that that i could definitely flub and

120
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:06,719
mess up right now so i want to just kind

121
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
of ramble for another episode or two and

122
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,318
just talk about things that i can flow

123
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,000
about and i can talk about so i'm going

124
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,438
to just talk about how i got into

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,360
breeding on this episode this is a

126
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,358
personal story we can't make mistakes

127
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,359
here if i do make errors or mistakes

128
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,519
somebody do correct me and remind me of

129
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,959
how the story really went but this won't

130
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,720
mess up your garden in any way and it

131
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,638
will be a fun episode for everybody to

132
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,880
be involved in so with no further ado

133
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,918
let's jump into a little bit about how

134
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,000
and why

135
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:34,240
i got into growing and breeding and how

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,560
we got where we are

137
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,199
many many years ago

138
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,560
i was around growing before i should

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,319
should have been before i should

140
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,399
probably admit it probably statue of

141
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,360
limitations are over but i remember

142
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,839
being a little kid and one of my uncles

143
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,680

144
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:54,079
another uncle said hey bro tonight when

145
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,680

146

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
messages and google and [ __ ] we didn't

167
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,800
have none of that this was the 80s bro

168
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,560
so we had to just trust and rely on that

169
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,560
when i said that was wrong and i said

170
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,240
the correct way like he is right

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,839
that was the first time i remember being

172
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
around somebody growing cannabis i

173
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,359
didn't realize at the time what was

174
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,360
happening but they were growing cannabis

175
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,479
in the backyard at that time

176
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,038
um

177
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,318
fast forward to i moved to another

178
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,240
location i don't want to give too many

179
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,319
details because um i moved to a place

180
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,120
where cultivating cannabis was illegal

181
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,759
and i

182
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,918
accidentally spotted a friend's

183
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
cultivation in their

184
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,680
um their place they had a place i don't

185
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,800
want to give too many details but i was

186
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
somewhere

187
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,400
and from above light hit me in the eye

188
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:17,359
that shouldn't have been coming from

189
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:19,279
somewhere and i was like what the [ __ ]

190
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,560
was that and so i just kind of i was

191
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:21,839
playing the drums to tell you the truth

192
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,959
i was playing the drums so i was

193
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,879
obviously in a place where we played the

194
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,478
drums and light hit me where i shouldn't

195
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,560
have and then i realized i was like oh

196
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,318
that's a [ __ ] grow light so after we

197
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,519
were [ __ ] after we got done i can't

198
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,879
give too many details i don't want to

199
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,279
bust anybody after we got done playing

200
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,800
music i guess is what i could say um i

201
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,318
told my friend i was like hey bro i can

202
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,759
kind of tell that you got lights coming

203
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,039
from up there you might want to

204
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,560
seal that up a little bit and he goes

205
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,240
bro do you know what you're doing i go i

206
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,280
kind of know about growing and he goes

207
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,038
come here i got to show you some [ __ ]

208
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:48,478
and he showed me his grow and i was like

209
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,318
oh this is what i think is wrong and so

210
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,519
i helped him so we go up there we take a

211
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,199
look at the girl i kind of helped him

212
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,959
figure out what was wrong and then he

213
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,800
needed a helper he just was in over his

214
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:58,159
head he needed a buddy they could do it

215
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,000
since i'd already discovered it and i

216
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,400
was cool about it he just decided that

217
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,839
we were also friends also so he decided

218
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,159
that i was going to be his his bucket

219
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,638
helper his bucket monkey uh basically i

220
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,960
carried buckets up a ladder to upstairs

221
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,400
and did weird [ __ ] like that and then he

222
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,680
had to go out of town surprisingly and

223
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,918
when he went out of town i just took

224
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,000
over and ran that grow he came back for

225
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,598
harvest and then paid me pretty well but

226
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,439
that was one of my first experiences of

227
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,879
running a grow by myself is when he went

228
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,879
out of town shout out bro if you hear

229
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,800
this hope things are well i hope you're

230
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:28,800
killing it um but that dude went out of

231
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,079
town i kind of took over that grow so

232
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,759
eventually i had to leave that

233
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:34,478
prohibition state and i had to come back

234
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,919
to colorado when i came back to colorado

235
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,079
everybody was talking about medical

236
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,680
marijuana one of the first things i did

237
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,519
was get my medical marijuana

238
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,280
recommendation from a doctor and get all

239
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,439
set up to be able to shop at

240
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,918
dispensaries having this medical

241
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,719
marijuana card also gave me the ability

242
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,399
to grow my own cannabis i'd already been

243
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
growing with my friends in another state

244
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,359
i'd grown a little bit when i was

245
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,279
younger so i had some experience i

246
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,439
thought i could definitely do this and

247
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,598
it was a huge market here in colorado

248
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,199
everybody needed medical marijuana but

249
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,560
there weren't enough people growing it

250
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,319
and if you could grow a good product

251
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,360
reliably people would be knocking down

252
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,960
your door

253
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,840
in a good way that sounds bad but it was

254
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,560
a good way this time so i was i decided

255
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,638
i'm going to grow some medical marijuana

256
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
unfortunately it takes a little while to

257
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,598
grow some medical marijuana you can't

258
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,439
just start growing you got to get some

259
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,878
clones from somewhere so this is where

260
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,639
the story kind of branches off and a

261
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,039
couple of different things happen

262
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,400
um i ordered seeds from a seed bank

263
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,240
shout out to the seed banks out there

264
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,120
the key people supplied with seeds

265
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,158
wanted to grow ordered seeds

266
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
had

267
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,479
somewhat okay somewhat not okay

268
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,639
experiences with seeds also at the same

269
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,320
time since it's taking a while to grow

270
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,240
i'm shopping at dispensaries and i'm

271
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,399
looking for quality products and i'm

272
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,159
just shopping around while i'm shopping

273
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,559
around i realize there's not a quality

274
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,679
dispensary in my area so this branches

275
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,000
out how

276
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,319
buying seeds and being dissatisfied

277
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,240
leads me to making my own seeds and then

278
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,640
at the same time shopping dispensaries

279
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,799
looking for quality products leads me to

280
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:05,278
finding a group of friends where i was

281
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,879
part of opening the first dispensary in

282
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,559
the city of pueblo so that's two

283
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,799
different branches of this story that

284
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,719
kind of put us where we are on the map

285
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,039
of being a breeder and a commercial

286
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,800
grower so let's go the way of i've got

287
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:18,719
some notes here let's talk about it this

288
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,479
way i was growing for myself then i

289
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,720
found this group of friends that wanted

290
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,879
to start a dispensary they had a great

291
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,360
idea they had a good strategy but they

292
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,720
just didn't have the the umph they

293
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,240
didn't know they were older than me as

294
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,879
the bottom line no disrespect to the

295
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,440
elders this was prob this was in 2008 so

296
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,879
it's been several years i am their age

297
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,320
now so i've grown into that but they

298
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,399
were older and didn't have the energy

299
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,920
the hipness the enthusiasm that they

300
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,039
needed but they had most of the other

301
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,079
things they had the product and the

302
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,399
building

303
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,080
they needed a guy like myself i've been

304
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,000
going to dispensaries all over the state

305
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,440
of colorado i've seen things that i

306
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,039
liked i've seen things that i did not

307
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
like i've seen what i thought worked and

308
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,799
did not work i come from a retail

309
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,799
background so i understood this going to

310
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,479
the dispensaries i understood what i was

311
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,159
looking at what i was seeing how i

312
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,000
interacted with people what i liked in

313
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,439
the interactions and didn't like how the

314
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,278
stores were set up the products i

315
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,880
enjoyed i learned all this so when i

316
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:10,240
discovered this group of people in my

317
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,159
neighborhood that wanted to start a

318
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,159
dispensary and they were a little slow

319
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,919
about i was like i'm the guy you need

320
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,919
and then i put my young

321
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,559
energy my young creativity into that and

322
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,719
we started a very flourishing dispensary

323
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,719
we had a great facility here in colorado

324
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,000
uh here in pueblo unfortunately we were

325
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,040
shut down for

326
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,360
uh illegal zoning but they built that

327
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,799
rule around us they zoned us out because

328
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,839
they did not want us there in that part

329
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:35,519
of town

330
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,360
that's a whole other story i may talk

331
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,440
about that at another part of the show

332
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,959
but i was growing c i was growing for

333
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,399
this dispensary and i was growing for

334
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,359
myself

335
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,120
um

336
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,480
if you so i did acquire some clones i

337
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,240
got some clones from some neighborhood

338
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,399
friends and i grew those

339
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,919
i ordered some seeds they came so what

340
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,440
inspired me to get seeds was the

341
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,439
dispensary and everybody in my

342
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,680
neighborhood had the same clones my

343
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,519
dispensary was selling clones to people

344
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:01,359
so the dispensary had all the same weed

345
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,039
and the neighborhood all had the same

346
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,039
weed because we were just selling clones

347
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,719
like crazy so all the growers in the

348
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,719
neighborhood came to my dispensary and

349
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
got clones of the same [ __ ] that i was

350
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
growing at work so it was just all the

351
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,160
same [ __ ] and i was trying to sell on

352
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,839
the black market as well i had my own

353
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,838
side hustle going and we wanted to stay

354
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,440
fresh at the dispensary so we had to

355
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,160
separate ourselves the way to do that

356
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,079
was to get a bunch of seeds so i bought

357
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,919
a lot of seeds i used my own money and

358
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,519
did my own final hunts at home in my own

359
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,439
personal grow then i would take the

360
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,919
winners from that to the commercial grow

361
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,920
that we had at the store

362
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,159
which route do we talk about that right

363
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,599
now um i would just buy seeds and grow

364
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,439
them i started growing at home and the

365
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,879
seeds would come and i would grow them

366
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,640
at home and i would pheno hunt them i'd

367
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,159
get a pack of seeds and find the best

368
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,720
one then i would take that to the

369
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,639
commercial grow that commercial grow is

370
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,200
where i learned how to grow on a big

371
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,919
level it wasn't necessarily a commercial

372
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,440
building it wasn't set up right it was

373
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,879
before commercial grows were really

374
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
happening it was kind of right before

375
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,200
that but it was as big as i had been in

376
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,119
and we made a lot of flour come out of

377
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,879
that room so i had to run a lot of

378
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,639
lights a lot of plants by myself that

379
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,159
started me in a big grow i had that one

380
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,079
i had the one at home

381
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,759
allegedly maybe possibly had a couple

382
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,599
others in other places we shouldn't talk

383
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,679
about but that's what got me going on

384
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,959
commercial growing and in a dispensary

385
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,199
environment

386
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,119
then ordering those seeds is another

387
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,639
part of this big story some of those

388
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:27,440
seeds i bought were awesome um some were

389
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,680
terrible the ratio of [ __ ] awesome to

390
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,399
[ __ ] terrible seeds was not worth

391
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,319
buying more seeds so i did what any good

392
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,320
grower would do i took some of the best

393
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,360
seeds i actually made friends with some

394
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,200
growers

395
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,039
some other breeders online i would start

396
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,560
posting pictures of my grow of my stuff

397
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,639
that i was growing from seed and from

398
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,199
clone and people took notice and other

399
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,120
people started sending me seeds i took

400
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,360
some seeds from some other really

401
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,959
reputable popular breeders and i would

402
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,278
cross them and make other things and

403
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,958
then i realized i can make better seeds

404
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,399
than what i am buying i just have to do

405
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,399
research i have to do a little bit of

406
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,879
work and i can make enough seeds for

407
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,799
myself to grow and have better seeds

408
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,720
than what i'm spending hundreds of

409
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,719
dollars for coming from websites back

410
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,560
then you had to buy all the seed banks

411
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,959
were in canada or in europe and you'd

412
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,399
have to hope your [ __ ] got over the over

413
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,000
the border through customs they'd go

414
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
through your package a lot of times

415
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,799
you'd get a package that had been cut

416
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
open and there's a letter inside of it

417
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,319
that said nice try we took your seeds

418
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,240
you can't have those sometimes you'd get

419
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,839
your [ __ ] sometimes you would sometimes

420
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
you pay for the money back guarantee and

421
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,639
you'd get your money back and you

422
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,399
wouldn't get the shipping fees and you

423
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,759
wouldn't get a half your [ __ ] back but

424
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,839
that's just how it went back in the day

425
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,000
so i made my own seeds i didn't want to

426
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,920
keep spending money on seeds when i knew

427
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,519
i could do it myself just as good as the

428
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,039
guys on the internet why couldn't i'm a

429
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,759
smart dude i had the experience the

430
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,439
space uh the encouragement the [ __ ]

431
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,399
the drive to do it so i made my own

432
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,000
seeds

433
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,240
um so i did it i made a few crosses i

434
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,958
made a feminized cross i made a batch of

435
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,320
feminized seeds that i grew and when i

436
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,759
started posting pictures people were

437
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,199
like dude that's fire that looks really

438
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,240
good when my friends would smoke it and

439
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:04,319
grow it so i bred some grateful dog and

440
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,839
i took it to a party here and it was the

441
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,440
first batch that i thought was dried and

442
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,680
cured properly enough to take some more

443
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,600
and smoking i cracked open the jar and

444
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,439
everybody at the outside of the party on

445
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,519
the back porch where i was everybody for

446
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,279
about a 10 or 12 maybe 15 foot radius

447
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,799
just came right to me like a bunch of

448
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,958
cockroaches like what kind of wheat is

449
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,039
that bro and i cracked it open i rolled

450
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,958
a fat bowl i rolled a fat joint packed a

451
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,480
couple of bowls and we all smoked and i

452
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,559
knew that that weed was super special

453
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,159
and i'd made seeds of that so i had some

454
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,159
seeds of it i packaged up a bunch of

455
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,399
those and there was a cannabis cup

456
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,639
coming to denver i don't remember i

457
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,559
think it may have been the first one at

458
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,919
that place with the outdoor maybe it was

459
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,119
denver mart it could have been the x

460
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,879
though i don't remember what year it was

461
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,720
i've got a brain injury in this [ __ ] i

462
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,679
didn't know to document this i didn't

463
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,759
know it was going to be some sort of

464
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,278
historical event for me i was just doing

465
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:50,720
what i was doing so

466
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,399
i made a bunch of seeds and i took them

467
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,360
to the cannabis cup

468
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,120
and on those seed packages i just put

469
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,800
i was calling myself irie genetics

470
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,959
already i just decided it was that was a

471
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,399
cool name so i put irie genetics and

472
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,479
then i put the name of the strain on the

473
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,600
cross and i put my email address on

474
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,839
there because i didn't have a website

475
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,680
yet and at the cannabis cup anybody that

476
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,920
had if you're walking around with like a

477
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,159
bottle of nutrients or a grow light or

478
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,919
like a pot or maybe some soil anything

479
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:17,838
that indicated to me that you were going

480
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,439
to go home and attempt to grow cannabis

481
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,760
i gave you seeds i thought that was a

482
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
great just a freebie for me to give to

483
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:25,600
you i didn't ask for money it was a good

484
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,120
way to get seeds in people's hands my

485
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,360
idea was just i made a lot of these

486
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,679
seeds i need to grow maybe 100 of them

487
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,120
you guys can have the other 2400 that i

488
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,239
made and i put them out there for the

489
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,679
world

490
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,839
so i gave a bunch of those away with my

491
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,278
info on the packages

492
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,639
it took a while

493
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:41,838
i think a lot of those people sat on

494
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,639
those seeds for a minute but then

495
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,920
eventually it takes four five maybe six

496
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,399
months to get the growth finished

497
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,759
eventually six eight months later people

498
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,759
started messaging me and they're like

499
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,120
hey bro i grew these seeds here's

500
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,278
pictures and the pictures would look

501
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,720
stellar and those people would say can i

502
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,838
get more seeds from you and i would

503
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,000
politely say yes you can but this time

504
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,320
they may cost a little bit of money so i

505
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,919
started posting around social media

506
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,079
i started going to more cannabis cups

507
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,838
and more events and started breeding

508
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,359
more learning more about breeding people

509
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,800
started giving me plants they thought

510
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,199
would breed well breeders started

511
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,679
sending me seeds and cuts i made a name

512
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,519
for myself in that industry then when i

513
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,519
went to more cannabis cups people would

514
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,360
hunt me down and try to give me money

515
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,600
for seeds i actually got

516
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,199
politely asked to stop selling or leave

517
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,040
a cannabis cup i had a backpack filled

518
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,399
with seeds people would run up and i

519
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,240
just take their money give them seeds

520
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,600
and then some of the high time staff

521
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,839
thought that that was bad that i was

522
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,278
selling without a booth i agree should

523
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,560
get my own booth and sell so that's what

524
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,799
i'm doing now i get the boots at the

525
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,278
events sell seeds there

526
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,198
um eventually i built a website and it

527
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,120
wasn't the best website but that was my

528
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,758
way of starting to build a brand i built

529
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,600
a website and a social media presence uh

530
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,120
started doing a lot of online and live

531
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,480
stuff and that's a lot of why i think

532
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,839
that's why people trust me is because

533
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,199
i'm right here you can see my face i'm

534
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,120
wearing a bright yellow shirt with a

535
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,120
purple background i'm 6'5 with

536
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,240
dreadlocks to my knees to my ankles

537
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,919
they're almost touching the floor right

538
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,759
now i'm in like a bar stool high chair

539
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,078
and they they're touching my shoes i can

540
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,240
feel it but i'm right here that's why i

541
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,678
think a lot of people support the brand

542
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,919
and support me because i support you

543
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,959
back and i don't hide a lot of breeders

544
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,720
you don't even know who they are you

545
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,640
have no idea what they're about you know

546
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,078
me i'm friendly i'm peaceful i think

547
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
building an audience with the social

548
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,759
media folks doing a podcast that really

549
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,119
helps out just showing you that i'm a

550
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,838
normal person i'm passionate for

551
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,599
cannabis and uh kind of opening up the

552
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,119
the window the curtain i guess so that

553
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,879
you can see what i'm doing i talk about

554
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,038
my breeding i share a lot with you i

555
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,039
think that really helps with my brand

556
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,640
so um that's a lot of what got me here i

557
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,798
started doing events i got my own booth

558
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,038
set up started selling at shows

559
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:45,359
and then um still sell the events when

560
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:47,200
they do happen uh the indo-expo got

561
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,798
cancelled and then the next event that

562
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,880
was lined up was the dude gross cup

563
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,119
unfortunately i had to skip that because

564
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,120
i had the vid i did send mike in place

565
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:56,558
uh to do work for me great job mike i am

566
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,319
rambling like crazy but i'm telling a

567
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:00,558
story bro this is story time with ross

568
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:02,798
to jeff so now i make a lot of feminized

569
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,879
and regular seeds my femme seeds seem to

570
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:08,319
be quite reliable my regular seeds seem

571
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,160
to be quite potent um i don't follow a

572
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,918
lot of the trends and the hype of what i

573
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,640
see in the market you don't usually see

574
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,480
me work with i hate to be naming things

575
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,160
but like the skittles and the cake and

576
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,319
the gelato you never saw me do stuff

577
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,798
with a lot of that i try to stay away

578
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,240
from the trends and i just do um my

579
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,079
motto has always been grow from your

580
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,480
heart and breed with love when i see two

581
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,240
plants i just know that this plant needs

582
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,079
to donate pollen to this plant they need

583
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,798
to make little babies i could just see

584
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,720
it

585
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,639
maybe i'm a matchmaker maybe i'm a plant

586
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,720
porn director either way it just feels

587
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,320
natural it's what i think i was

588
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,480
part of what i was born to do one of the

589
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,079
things i was put here to do so that's

590
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,480
how we got started that's how i became

591
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,558
rosta jeff the breeder i was basically

592
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,279
tired of buying seeds

593
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:53,279
that were not quality that did not reach

594
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:55,119
my expectations and for paying

595
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,798
ridiculous prices for things that had to

596
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,798
get shipped from another country that

597
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,720
are being made in america us the

598
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,960
companies would be that have california

599
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:05,038
and the name and they'd say like new

600
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,440
york and the name and those people would

601
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:08,798
ship their seeds overseas and then i

602
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,320
would pay money to have them [ __ ]

603
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,000
shipped back to me and then half of them

604
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,079
wouldn't be good i'm not dissing either

605
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,200
of those companies i'm just saying they

606
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:16,480
would we know they're coming from

607
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
america and they're shipping it to

608
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,919
another country then shipping it right

609
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:21,359
back and i've gotta it gets taken in

610
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,320
customs and that was just a pain in the

611
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:26,319
ass so um that's a lot of what led me to

612
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,079
making my own seeds i could do it we can

613
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,759
all do it i encourage you i'm a seed

614
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,279
maker i'm a seed seller but still if you

615
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,519

620
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,959
fart one day and have fresh seeds i

621
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:44,720
didn't sneeze and make a clone i started

622
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,400
with other people's genetics just like

623
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,720
all other breeders do so you've got my

624

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,280
about how i got into it basically i was

639
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,360
buying seeds not happy with them

640
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,038
got into the dispensary life let's talk

641
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:26,399
a little bit about that the commercial

642
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,240
growing started at a dispensary we had a

643
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,320
multi-level building the bottom was a

644
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,319
dispensary the next two levels or

645
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,240
straight up a production grow we do

646
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:37,119
smaller stuff in one area carry it up to

647
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,279
another area flower it up there uh that

648
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,319
was an amazing um experience it was an

649
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:44,558
amazing uh cultivation facility made out

650
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,359
of a retail store is basically what that

651
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:47,599
was

652
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:50,319
so eventually that place did get closed

653
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,319
down unfortunately um the city attorney

654
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,879
and some law enforcement came handed us

655
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,558
some documents and said we had to close

656
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
a lot of people when those people when

657
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,678
the law enforcement came in they did not

658
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,320
have their firearms out they were not

659
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,080
doing a raid they were simply escorting

660
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,558
the law enforcement was escorting the

661
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,000
city attorney city attorney handed paper

662
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:10,240
paper was signed and they said you guys

663
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,798
are now not allowed to sell any cannabis

664
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,038
related products the next question was

665
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,400
well can we sell non well what about no

666
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,400
they said they have you have to lock the

667
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,519
door and stop selling cannabis related

668
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,679
products and i said what about the

669
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,960
people in line and they said we don't

670
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,798
know about them we don't know what to

671
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,240
tell you and they left after we signed

672
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,319
the papers those last few people that

673
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,159
didn't get up and run when the cops came

674
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,000
in when the city attorney came in guess

675
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,360
how much cannabis they got for the money

676
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,359
that they brought that day they came to

677
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,119
buy a 20 bag they probably left with an

678
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,959
ounce each for very cheap because they

679
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,558
stuck around when the cops walked in

680
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,880
they didn't get up and bail we thought

681
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,558
that was respectable respectful and

682
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,000
commendable so they got hooked up but

683
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,319
they did close us they closed this like

684
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,359
i said earlier for zoning violations

685
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:50,960
um

686
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,959
so at that point we had to figure out

687
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,120
stuff on our own and that's kind of when

688
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,440
i started doing uh commercial growing at

689
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,038
other places drifting around i worked at

690
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,320
a another commercial growth that never

691
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:01,919
really got off the ground we helped him

692
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,599
build it uh but they always had

693
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,440
technical difficulties then i got called

694
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,279
to go work at green and healthy kind of

695
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,519
helped get that grow going then from

696
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:12,319
there i think i ended up over at uh

697
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,679
three rivers then i built a commercial

698
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,839
um what's it called a commercial

699
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,080
consulting reputation and just started

700
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,158
doing consulting at several facilities

701
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,678
uh those few places i mentioned were

702
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,200
public i was they're i'm allowed to talk

703
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:24,798
about them a lot of them we signed

704
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,000
non-disclosure agreements to where they

705
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:27,759
i can't even tell you that i worked

706
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,519
there but i worked a lot of cool places

707
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,519
in colorado so that's where i got to the

708
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,119
commercial cultivation learning how to

709
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,279
do things on a totally different scale

710
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,599
different level uh fighting pests in a

711
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:40,000
different way so i think i rambled about

712
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,240
the question the question was um how and

713
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
why did i get into breeding i went quite

714
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,440
a ways into that honestly the bottom

715
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,440
line was i was not satisfied with what i

716
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,000
was buying and i knew that i could

717
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,919
create a quality product for myself one

718
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,359
day the people at the dispensary

719
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,640

720
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,079
