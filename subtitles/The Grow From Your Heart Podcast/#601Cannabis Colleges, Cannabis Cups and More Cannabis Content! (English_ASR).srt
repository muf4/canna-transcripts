00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,118
what a year i have developed a pair of

72
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,118

73
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,040

it says i was 24 when i was diagnosed

76
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,919

77
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,840

now having over 18 months without any

81
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,719
form of pain pills

82
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:23,119
so it sounds like with cannabis we have

83
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,800
eliminated pain pills from mr's life and

84
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319

92
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,439
this music and get right to mister's

93
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,680
questions because he does have a lot of

94
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:46,318
them this could take a minute it says

95
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,519
for 2021 i'm i am interested in

96
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,839
obtaining a cannabis

97
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,239
horticultural certificate something like

98
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,680
oaksterdam live or an online class

99
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
and i'm interested in your thoughts

100
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,800
about a novice cultivator

101
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
or someone wanting to get into the

102
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,439
cannabis industry and looking into any

103
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,079
cannabis college that is a great

104
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,560
question there are a lot of online uh

105
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,080
cannabis education programs available uh

106
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,759
during coven i'm sure all of them are

107
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,840
online before covid you could go to

108
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,199
cloverleaf you could go to oaksterdam

109
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,640
there are a couple other accredited

110
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:15,359
cannabis universities which you could

111
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,158
attend

112
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,840
and get a cannabis education you can get

113
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,479
a general cannabis education then they

114
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,080
do have

115
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:24,238
more focused classes where you can learn

116
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,159
about bud tending cultivating

117
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,920
the back end of the business the tax end

118
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,560
of the business the legal aspects of the

119
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,238
business

120
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
they will teach you so many things in

121
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,120
these college classes

122
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,239
i am all about continuing education i'm

123
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,239
here to educate

124
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,920
i'm here to teach people i'm all about

125
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,959
furthering your education broadening

126
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:43,119
your horizons

127
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,719
setting yourself up for success uh

128
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,878
education is key

129
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:48,318
however sometimes those places will

130
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,359
teach you bad habits

131
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,798
so go to those classes with an open mind

132
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,120
understand that the things they are not

133
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,640
teaching you are not the only way to do

134
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,840
things that is a problem i see a lot of

135
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,518
cultivators have

136
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
that come from those types of facilities

137
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,599
or come from even college courses

138
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,438
or another facility they were taught

139
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,158
that this is how i cut clones

140
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:08,878
so this is the only way we can cut

141
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:10,639
clones

142
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,560
and if you come to work for me you're

143
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,000
going to cut clones the way i teach you

144
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,598
and the way they taught you in amsterdam

145
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,120
may be way different and i don't want to

146
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,879
hear you arguing with me that well in

147
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,918
amsterdam we did are at oaksterdam we

148
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:21,358
did it this way

149
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,719
i'm gonna fire you because i don't care

150
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,680
we do it this way at my girl and it

151
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
works this way

152
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,199
i'll listen to you once uh we did it

153
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,879
this way at oaksterdam

154
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
cool i've heard you now quit trying to

155
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,759
change our ways and let's do it the way

156
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,120
we've written sops for

157
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,879
and the way we've got it dialed in here

158
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,160
in this cultivation facility so i do

159
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:38,240
like the schooling

160
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,160
but keep an open mind that it is not the

161
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
only way to do things what they teach

162
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,840
you there is a way to do things

163
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
you'll get a very vast and deep

164
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,119
understanding of the plants of the plant

165
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
functions of ways to take care of the

166
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,840
plants

167
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,439
the processes of the plants uh

168
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,918
environmental tips and all kinds of

169
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,600
things

170
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,959
that i probably don't even know but at

171
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,879
the same time

172
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,239
i like to be able to train somebody that

173
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,399
comes into a facility

174
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,840
to work in my facility the way i need it

175
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,959
done a little bit of plant knowledge is

176
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,719
cool but if you go to one of those

177
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,399
universities and learn too much

178
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,919
you know just enough to [ __ ] something

179
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,319
up in micro so

180
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,599
if you do go to that remember that

181
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,639
you're not getting the

182
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,240
uh the total 100 only way answer you're

183
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,000
getting a very good education but you've

184
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,000
got to keep yourself open-minded that

185
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
there are other things to learn

186
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,160
if you do go to something like that i

187
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,600
recommend focusing on something find

188
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,560
your niche in cannabis what are you

189
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,320
going to do

190
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,399
everybody starts off they want to become

191
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,759
a good grower they understand the plants

192
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,359
then they understand the environment

193
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,038
then we all kind of branch off into our

194
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
own direction i obviously became

195
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,478
a breeder and a podcaster some other

196
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,360
people are really good in the grow

197
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,879
also became hvac technicians some people

198
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
also became electricians

199
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,560
some people also become carpenters some

200
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:47,680
people are really good at cloning some

201
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,839
people are all about

202
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,840
pheno hunting find your niche in the

203
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,359
cannabis industry and if you can focus

204
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,879
your classes on that that will

205
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,720
definitely help you out

206
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,319
maybe learn about pesticides and

207
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,319
pesticide applications

208
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,080
learn everything you can about pests be

209
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,199
the pest guy the guy that eradicates

210
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,038
problems

211
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,680
i said a moment ago maybe learn about

212
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:09,918
hvac or electricity or even be a plumber

213
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,879
or maybe you need to learn about the the

214
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,318
tax laws

215
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,680
and the back end of the business all the

216
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,280
technical stuff all the uh the

217

accounting and the bookkeeping and all

218
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,399
that stuff maybe you need to learn all

219
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,160
the logistics of that part

220
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,918
maybe you're a salesman maybe you're in

221
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
sales in the cannabis industry

222
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,399
whatever you do find your niche and try

223
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:26,959
to find the cannabis schooling that will

224
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,519
dial in

225
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,318
your niche and give you a solid uh

226
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,639
foundation

227
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,759
and some more to shine if you want so it

228
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,120
sounds like you're trying to get into

229
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
the industry

230
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,879
what are you going to do to shine in the

231
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:40,879
industry do you have a goal do you have

232
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,319
something you can bring to the industry

233
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:44,319
are you a salesperson are you a

234
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,080
craftsperson are you a plumber

235
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
an electrician an hvac tech or do you

236
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,199
simply want to grow the cannabis find

237
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:51,439
what you want to do

238
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,120
and get those classes and specialize in

239
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,160
that stuff but then when you go to work

240
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
for somebody

241
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,919
don't be so stubborn that we have to

242
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,598
fire you i've had amazing

243
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,120
cultivators work in cultivation

244
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:02,478
facilities with me i've worked with some

245
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,319
amazing cultivators

246
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,240
and i've had to fire them because i

247
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,199
catch them doing it their way and not

248
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,519
our way

249
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,439
your way works in your garden but i've

250
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:13,038
got a strategy i've got the map

251
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,478
with the key and the legend and the

252
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:15,598
starting point and the ending point i've

253
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:17,359
got that on paper

254
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,038
and if we don't follow my map we're not

255
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,960
all going to get to the same goal

256
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,879
so if you're doing your weird [ __ ] in my

257
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,239
garden i come in i'm like hey why did

258
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,918
this happen you're like oh i decided i

259
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,439
would top the plants and do this

260
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:28,879
we weren't going to top those plants i

261
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,719
had a strategy now you just [ __ ] up

262
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,319
the whole garden keep in mind that

263
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
you've got to go adapt to somebody

264
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,360
else's grow once you're hired it will

265
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,959
give you a solid foundation if you want

266
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,759
to run your own stuff this is a good way

267
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,159
to start

268
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,840
you'll get a full education that way but

269
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,479
keep in mind there's always more to

270
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,000
learn

271
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:45,199
once you think you've learned it all

272
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,639
that's when you [ __ ] yourself from

273
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,840
learning anymore so

274
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,439
um you asked my thoughts about these non

275
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,198
novice cultivator or someone wanting to

276
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,719
get into the industry and looking into

277
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,439
any cannabis college i think i covered

278
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
that

279
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,519
do it educate yourself but keep in mind

280
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,120
you did not learn everything and you've

281
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:02,478
got to be open to the teachings i'm

282
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
going to give you the training i'm going

283
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,439
to give you

284
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,038
when you work with me alright there is

285
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,160
another question it says

286
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:11,839
i am a cannabis cup virgin

287
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,680
any word about the status of cannabis

288
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,439
cups in 2021

289
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,038
this question brings up a thought on

290
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,879
judging these events

291
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,878
what was the criteria used to judge the

292
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,960
cannabis entries at these events

293
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,160
also a couple thoughts on possible ways

294
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,198
to prevent someone

295
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,680
buying or swaying votes is using oh

296
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,598
another way of swaying that is by using

297
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,080
a double-blind panel approach

298
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,000
then there's my favorite a veterans only

299
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,959
panel a veterans only panel would be

300
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,479
pretty awesome

301
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,000
if you got like the veterans choice or

302
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:41,680
something at one of those events that

303
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
would be a cool new category to add to

304
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,519
it

305
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
and the only people able to vote in that

306
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,799
were the veterans that'd be [ __ ]

307
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,120
pretty cool i like that category

308
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,519
if i ever do throw a cup or i'm involved

309
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,480
in a cup i will mention a veterans only

310
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,200
category

311
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,639
veterans choice uh yeah veterans choice

312
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,160
we get to try all the veterans get to

313
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,559
trial decided i mean to include myself

314
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,919
in that

315
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:01,439
the veterans get to try all of the

316
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,439
samples that were donated and the

317
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,000
veterans get to say sample 42 was the

318
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,760
winner

319
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,600
i like that veterans choice award that's

320
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,559
kind of cool now let me focus on the

321
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,080
question because i

322
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,079
am a little bit rambly today it says

323
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,000
um any word on the status of cannabis

324
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,639
cups in 2021

325
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,240
so far no word uh no updates on any

326
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,720
events like that i think everybody is

327
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,000
waiting

328
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,920
a lot of people are waiting for a

329
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,360
vaccine and word from

330
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:26,719
our [ __ ] government we don't even

331
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,000
know what we're allowed to do what we

332
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,560
can do at this time

333
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,720
so i don't see any cannabis events in

334
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,518
2021 coming up

335
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,440
especially consumption events i think it

336
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,240
will be a very long time before we are

337
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,519
smoking

338
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,600
anything together in a room together uh

339
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,919
i am on the fence about how i feel about

340
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,480
the future of events with covet and

341
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,838

342
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,600
part of me wants to get out there and

355
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,519
know that i want to get some weird

356
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,399
[ __ ] disease and get sick and get

357
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,600
other people sick

358
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,360
anyway i'm gonna get away from that

359
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,959
political talk because we hear enough

360
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,278
about that [ __ ] but i don't think there

361
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,159
are going to be any events in 2021 that

362
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:19,759
i am aware of

363
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,120
i did see a couple of things in a couple

364
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:22,720
of places but i will not be attending

365
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,320
them and they were very small

366
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,480
events compared to like cannabis cups

367
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,519
and things but there are very tiny smoke

368
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
gatherings happening but i'll be

369
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,399
avoiding those for

370
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,278
the time being um judging these events

371
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,559
um i do have some notes on that let's

372
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,360
see let me jump into my notes

373
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:41,199
judging uh it's been long rumored that

374
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,278
many of the larger cups are for sale to

375
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,040
be quite honest with you you do hear

376
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,799
any event you go to anything where

377
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,799
there's a prize you always hear

378
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:51,120
that the cups the prizes and the awards

379
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,278
are for sale and i did say rumored it is

380
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,799
a rumor it's hearsay allegedly that some

381
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,639
of those cups are for sale

382
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,159
with that being said i know people

383
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,919
personally who have sat

384
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,439
uh not at this table but at the table

385
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,078
that used to be in this spot

386
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
that have sat here who have won cannabis

387
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,239
cups from high times

388
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
and have won other uh first place awards

389
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,919
from other prestigious

390
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,120
uh cannabis and concentrate events and

391
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,000
competitions

392
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,480
and i know that those people that won

393
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
simply

394
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,639
don't have the money to buy an award so

395
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,320
i feel like those people won those

396
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,399
awards fair and square

397
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,360
i know them i know their business i'm

398
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,600
friends with them

399
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,959
i know what allegedly it would cost to

400
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,159
win a cup and i know they don't have

401
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,719
that kind of money so

402
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,319
i know that my friends won those

403
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
categories fair and square they won

404
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,320
those events

405
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,600
but sometimes some of the bigger ones

406
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,959
it is questionable i don't want to point

407
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,399
any fingers or anything but it has

408
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,679
definitely been questionable sometimes

409
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,000
you see the guys with

410
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,799
the larger booths uh the largest

411
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,559
presents

412
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,838
they win and it seems like they just

413
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,278
threw a bunch of money at the event in

414
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,880
the event went well yeah you gave us

415
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:54,399
enough money to host this whole event so

416
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,919
we're just gonna give you the awards

417
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
sometimes that's what it feels like

418
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,000
allegedly i have no evidence toward that

419
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,759
i'm gonna talk myself out of that hole

420
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,240
really quickly now um

421
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,838
ideally judging is based on categories

422
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,759
and subcategories

423
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:09,519
so you're gonna have uh obviously a

424
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,759
flower category right and that's buds

425
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,519
flowers buds dried buds uh people are

426
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,278
gonna have a flower category in that

427
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,639
category you're gonna find indica

428
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,958
you're gonna find a sativa and you're

429
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,200
gonna find a hybrid category

430
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,159
then you're gonna judge those categories

431
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,759
on

432
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,278
basically looks smell flavor aromas

433
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,759
the buzz you get from that when you

434
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,439
smoke it how the how does it burn how is

435
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:32,958
the burn ability does the ash come out

436
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,760
chunky and black does the ash come out

437
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,359
nice and white

438
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,200
did it burn your throat when you smoked

439
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,000
it did it make you cough did it give you

440
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,480
weird cottonmouth

441
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,159
did it have a weird flavor to it a lot

442
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
of that is going to matter then

443
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:46,719
also we're going to give it give it to a

444
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,799
lab and let the lab test it

445
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,200
i agree and disagree with labs testing

446
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:53,278
our cannabis for competitions because

447
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,800
i didn't grow my flower for a machine to

448
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,240
smoke it i don't really care what the

449
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,919
gas chromatography or liquid

450
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,839
chromatography machine says

451
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,360
i care what you say when you smoke it

452
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,079
i've never seen a computer

453
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,480
take a rip off a joint and go damn that

454
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,799
was good

455
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,320
[ __ ] or nah that's not as good but i've

456
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:08,958
seen some of my friends hit a joint and

457
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,399
go

458
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,039
that's not bad and i've seen them hit

459
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,078
another joint and go damn that's the one

460
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,519
those are the ones we're trying to

461
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,359
impress i'm not worried too much about

462
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,000
the machines but they do send samples to

463
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,320
the lab

464
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,240
they do terpene analysis they do thc and

465
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,200
cbd analysis they also check for

466
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,959
pesticides

467
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,480
and heavy metals and then they announce

468
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,159
all of that along with the winners

469
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,600
oftentimes they will do a highest

470
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,278
terpene winner which is done with the

471
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,800
labs they'll do a highest thc winner

472
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,039
which is done with the lab tests

473
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,319
so that's another criteria for testing

474
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:37,039
so it starts off with the flower

475
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,800
category

476
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,319
then it breaks down into subcategories

477
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,958
you got your indica your sativa your

478
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
hybrid

479
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,000
and then we judge those based on the

480
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,240
criteria that i spoke of

481
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,240
in some events they will do an indoor

482
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,480
category an outdoor category

483
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,560
a greenhouse category and a fully

484
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,199
organic category as well

485
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,638
i don't know what's to stop people from

486
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,639
saying that their indoor was grown

487
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,079
outdoor their outdoor was grown indoor

488
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
hopefully everyone's just honest with

489
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,838
that but those are other opportunities

490
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,198
and other categories that are available

491
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,880
another thing you see at the events a

492
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,319
lot is concentrates

493
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,240
we judge concentrates there's a

494
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,040
concentrate competition usually

495
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,919
uh best concentrate highest uh cbd

496
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,919
concentrate

497
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,439
and then a lot of these also there is a

498
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,278
a crowd's choice or a

499
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,360
crowd favorite they give that a war out

500
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,198
as well so when they do the concentrates

501
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,199
we basically judge it off of what it

502
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,240
looks like what it smells like what it

503
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,719
tastes like

504
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,759
um then the buzz is very important

505
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,680
because you're smoking

506
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,120
40 samples in a day did two of them

507
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:35,039
stick out to you did one get you

508
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,480
super buzz compared to the others that's

509
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,399
something you're looking for

510
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,240
then how does it react when you put it

511
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,120
on the banger on the nail however you

512
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,278
consume it

513
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,039
does it sparkle up did it splatter up

514
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:45,838
did it make a bunch of weird noises did

515
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:47,919
it sizzle

516
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
uh did it leave any char or residue on

517
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:50,639
the banger that is something to think

518
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,040
about i like a

519
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,399
a good clean looking concentrate i know

520
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,480
what it's supposed to look like a nice

521
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,320
color a nice texture a good aroma

522
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,240
i want it to burn nicely on the rig i

523
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
don't want it to leave any residue

524
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,519
i don't want it to taste funny i don't

525
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,240
want it to leave any weird aftertaste

526
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,159
i wanted to have good pleasant uh only

527
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,399
cannabis derived terpenes left

528
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,838
terpenes they leave good flavors in my

529
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,120
mouth is all i want to taste at the end

530
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,880
of that i don't want any

531
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
weird additives or weird flavor

532
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,759
enhancers or anything i don't want it to

533
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
leave weird [ __ ] on my banger

534
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,120
i want my rig to be clean and ready for

535
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,720
another dab after that dab

536
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,240
that is a winning concentrate if i hit

537
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,040
it and i go damn that tastes good i'm

538
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,720
high as [ __ ]

539
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,559
and my rig isn't all dirty from it

540
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,759
that's a good concentrate right there so

541
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:31,919
that's what we're looking for when it

542
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,000
comes to judging judging concentrates

543
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:35,759
you will find several categories of

544
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,320
concentrates based on

545
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,959
your uh your location the region of the

546
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,639
event

547
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,559
in some newer places you're gonna get

548
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,839
like solvent and non-solvent

549
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,399
concentrates that's what you're gonna

550
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
find

551
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,879
and that's gonna be um solvent is

552
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,278
anything like bho

553
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,240
or uh hexane or propane derived

554
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,078
concentrates

555
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,440
that's all solvent derived concentrates

556
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,239
when they say non-solvent

557
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,399
that does include water hash and sift

558
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,079
and any type of bubble hash and maybe

559
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,879
even prestash at this point would go

560
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:04,559
into there

561
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,360
now let me give a disclaimer i did just

562
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,000
say that non-solvent hash is water hash

563
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,480
and people are going

564
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,679
to say but rosta jeff water is a solvent

565
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,680
our friend nika t

566
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,838
taught us that in the process of making

567
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,439
bubble hash water is not used as a

568
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,600
solvent because it is not dissolving the

569
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,519
trichomes it is used as an agitator

570
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,839
a separating agent and it is washing the

571
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,440
trichomes from the product so yes i do

572
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,240
understand the science that water is a

573
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,000
solvent

574
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,240
in this case the product we are using is

575
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,159
not water soluble so it is not being a

576
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,480
solvent type product in this option

577
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,000
it is washing is being used as an

578
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,600
agitator as a separating

579
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,278
agent a little bit different than a

580
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
solvent there so it does count as a

581
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,399
non-solvent product

582
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,679
shout out to nicotine for teaching us

583
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,198
the difference between solvent and

584
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,000
non-solvent concentrates

585
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:48,559
and why water is not a solvent all right

586
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,039
also

587
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,119
in that category you may see diamonds

588
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,958
you may see sauce you may see a lot of

589
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,120
other different types of concentrates i

590
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,078
said based on based on your location and

591
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,240
your region

592
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,278
here in colorado we've had legalization

593
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,879
for quite a while

594
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,558
the race is on we've all been trying to

595
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:06,480
find the best concentrates everyone's

596
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,678
trying to make the best concentrates

597
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,519
so here you're gonna see different

598
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,360
categories because it's available

599
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,879
maybe in a newer market all the

600
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,240
concentrates haven't evolved because

601
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,760
legalization hasn't been there the

602
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,959
technology hasn't been there

603
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,119
people haven't been striving and

604
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,959
learning as much so you may just find

605
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,798
smaller options you'll get your solvent

606
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,160
and non-solvent concentrates

607
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:28,000
also you may see uh carts

608
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,600
cartridges cartridges filled with

609
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,880
concentrates you'll find your best car

610
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,199
your highest terp car

611
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,919
and highest thc and cbd carts will be

612
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,519
available

613
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,759
at a lot of the competitions now because

614
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,798
cartridges are becoming very popular i

615
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,200
think cartridges

616
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,319
are about 50 to 70 percent of sales here

617
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,000
in colorado

618
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,599
uh so there are a lot of carts out there

619
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,079
carts are getting real popular

620
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,918
also you will see edibles they will have

621
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,558
the best edible and highest

622
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,280
cbd edible at the cannabis cups that's

623
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:57,839
another competition that they will have

624
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,759
also they will have best overall cbd

625
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:01,599
product is something you'll also see

626
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:03,359
so those are a lot of the con the

627
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,558
categories that you see at a cannabis

628
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:05,519
cup i'm gonna make sure i covered your

629
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,000
questions

630
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,359
um what are the criteria yeah we smoke

631
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,720
it we look at it we make sure it's

632
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,558
enjoyable basically

633
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,240
uh ways to prevent someone buying or

634
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,240
swaying votes

635
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,000
unfortunately i don't know that that

636
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,640
does not happen and i don't know how to

637
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,919
stop it

638
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,400
the best way to do it is to make

639
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,799
everything based on public votes

640
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,440
but we've seen what happens with voting

641
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,038
and

642
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
welcome to 2021 we're just going to move

643
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,279
forward from that statement um

644
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,038
uh the veterans panel that's a [ __ ]

645
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,160
cool idea like i said before i agree

646
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:35,839
with the veterans panel

647
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,360
i would put you on the veterans panel

648
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:38,720
and i would make sure that we had

649
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,839
plenty of good concentrates for the

650
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,120
veterans and then you guys would leave

651
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,480
with all the leftovers

652
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,599
and all these competitions usually the

653
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,558
people that throw it leave with the

654
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,639
leftovers

655
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,720
we'll send it home with the veterans all

656
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,640
right that is part two of a

657
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,400
long question let's jump into part three

658
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,000
and see how far we get through this

659
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,360
i may have to save a couple for another

660
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,079
episode because this is getting quite

661
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,240
long

662
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:00,159
number three on mister's question says

663
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,000
your thoughts about kovid's impact on

664
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,120
the cannabis industry and the future of

665
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,200
cannabis cups

666
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,879
are you noticing any pandemic proof

667
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,919
aspects in the industry

668
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,240
in the cannabis business or community um

669
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,080
so

670
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,120
my thoughts on kovid's impact on the

671
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:17,678
cannabis industry and the future of cups

672
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:18,399
the impact on the industry we have been

673
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,720
selling

674
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,840
record numbers of cannabis people when

675
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
they were stuck at home during

676
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,079
quarantine

677
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,559
when they couldn't go out and do things

678
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,599
people were smoking tremendous amounts

679
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,079
of cannabis so

680
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,279
in the industry uh we saw a lot of

681
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,519
cannabis sold now

682
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,359
uh the future of cannabis cups i said

683
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,480
before i don't know how long until

684
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,079
people are going to be comfortable

685
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,759
especially myself going out

686
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,199
and smoking and doing stuff like that

687
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:44,319
i'd love to get out there

688
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,679
but i've got mixed emotions um an event

689
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,439
would draw a large crowd

690
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,640
and large crowds are kind of what we're

691
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,360
against so i wouldn't be there for a

692
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,520
while

693
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:53,279
um also at the start of the pandemic a

694
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,918
lot of people started growing

695
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,279
so a lot of people started buying seeds

696
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,720
i don't want to say that anything is

697
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,038
recession-proof

698
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,000
but it feels like when things go things

699
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,079
go weird

700
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,679
people turn to things that make them

701
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,439
feel better and cannabis is one of the

702
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,798
things that makes people feel better

703
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
also people had to think about their

704
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:11,599
budgets they can't buy as much cannabis

705
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,159
they want to smoke more

706
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:15,279
they turn to growing so i did see an

707
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,240
influx of

708
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,639
new growers and seed buyers at the start

709
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,240
so

710
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
i can't say anything's recession proof

711
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,960
but the seed business did not slow down

712
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,559
we are still adjusting uh nothing is

713
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,400
stable at this point so

714
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,639
i don't want to say that the industry is

715
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,519
recession proof i don't want to say that

716
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,880
the seed business will keep going but as

717
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,679
the adjustment has happened things have

718
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,600
been well for

719
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,240
my end of the industry but what works

720
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,439
this month uh may not work next month we

721
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,480
one day we're able to go eat at

722
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,679
restaurants the next day we're not

723
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,120
allowed to eat at restaurants one day

724
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,960
we're allowed to shop in the dispensary

725
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,599
the next day we have to do it outside

726
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,440
things are weird so i don't know um the

727
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,279
whole idea of job security

728
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,200
disappeared so i don't know things are

729
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,480
kind of weird like kind of rambling on

730
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
that one

731
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,038
um podcasting seems to be pandemic proof

732
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,279
you asked if there's anything

733
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,798
pandemic proof in the cannabis industry

734
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:05,200
the only thing i can think of that has

735
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,158
been

736
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,600
pandemic proof is podcasting i have not

737
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,440
missed a single episode

738
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,439
i have stepped up the quality of my show

739
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,880
i've stepped up the uh everything the

740
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,558
gear the technology the

741
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,159
show is way better i've been trying to

742
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:18,558
put more time energy and effort into the

743
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,720
show

744
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,240
since we can't go anywhere i'm gonna be

745
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,400
here so i think the

746
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,519
podcast has basically been pandemic

747
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,200
proof as long as

748
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,119
i don't get sick as long as i don't get

749
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,120
the covet the show must go

750
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:32,479
on i'll still come record with kovid

751
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:33,839
because i can cough right into the damn

752
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,960
microphone in the camera and you guys

753
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,798
will be safe

754
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,319
uh knock on wood a lot to make sure i

755
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,918
don't get the the vid but

756
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:41,599
i've also been protecting myself making

757
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,080
sure i don't but um

758
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,599
i think that the pandemic the only thing

759
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,918
is pandy proof here

760
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,918
is podcasting and i don't want to jinx

761
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,080
myself so let's move forward from that

762
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,919
let's see question number four explain

763
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:54,399
how you personally develop a sense and

764
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,880
taste

765
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
profile for your strains i says for

766
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,840
example my strain smells like wet

767
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,319
diapers dirty feet stored next to

768
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:03,519
mothballs and an old gasoline canister

769
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,119
bro that sounds like something i would

770
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,240
say you've been listening to the show so

771
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:10,000
how do i explain

772
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,679
my flavors and aromas um basically

773
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,640
i have got a very strong ah

774
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,280
aroma memory bank i guess is the way to

775
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,080
put that

776
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,960
and i associate aromas and flavors and

777
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,000
foods

778
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,960
with places and times and locations and

779
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,759
people

780
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,480
i think that our aroma our sense of

781
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,359
smell

782
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,400
is very uh very strong and it has a very

783
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:34,240
long memory

784
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,559
i don't forget smells and aromas i can

785
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,480
forget names i can forget faces i can

786
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,678
forget directions to places i can forget

787
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,319
what i'm saying in the middle of a

788
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,679
sentence

789
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,599
but if i smell something like oh that's

790
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,840
that's that perfume that grandma used to

791
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,279
wear called this from this year and she

792
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,480
wore it at that one event and i'll never

793
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:52,079
forget the smell

794
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,360
grandma and that event just because of

795
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,000
aromas i know that was a really weird

796
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:55,519
example to pick

797
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,839
but just trying to try to pick something

798
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,440
random smells will trigger memories for

799
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,678
me and they don't go away

800
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,880
and they're really vivid in my nose and

801
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,320
i almost

802
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,000
sounds i may sound like i need mental

803
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,720
help maybe i do i almost

804
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,240
smell in colors that's why the red pill

805
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,880
and blue pill got called red pill and

806
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,480
blue pill

807
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,400
that's why a lot of my strain names have

808
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,079
colors in the names

809
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,080
that's why they're related to fruits

810
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,558
that have a color that you'll recognize

811
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,519
i smell in color as weird as that may

812
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:23,200
sound

813
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,119
ah it sounds weird as i say it but i

814
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,840
smell in color i smell

815
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,879
visually if i smell like this weird dank

816
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,798
musty smell

817
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,000
i can see the the basement where i used

818
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:33,918
to learn the drums

819
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,200
like weird [ __ ] like that i can just i

820
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,720
can my so

821
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,720
what i'm doing when i'm telling you that

822
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,880
this smells or this

823
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,720
this product tastes or smells like uh

824
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,320
dirty feet stored next to mothballs in

825
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,400
an old gasoline container

826
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,439
what i'm basically doing is i'm smoking

827
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,440
it and i'm going

828
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,720
huh there's this flavor what is that oh

829
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,600
that's mothballs

830
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,200
okay mothballs then i exhale what is

831
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:57,199
that oh it left gas

832
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,798
and like dryness on my tongue so it

833
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,319
tastes like mothballs

834
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:04,158
and chalky gas that's just what my brain

835
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,558
associated those flavors with

836
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,679
and also i'm trying to find familiar

837
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,359
words for you

838
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,880
things that you have eaten smelled

839
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,359
smoked drank tasted

840
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,960
that i can relate that flavor to you so

841
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,798
that when you smoke it you can go

842
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,558
holy [ __ ] that does taste like oranges

843
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,079
and dirty feet something that you're

844
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:20,960
familiar with something that my brain is

845
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:23,759
familiar with

846
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,480
and just try to articulate that from uh

847
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,278
just from

848
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,880
my mental memory i've got a rolodex of

849
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,000
flavors and aromas in my nose that i

850
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,760
will never forget

851
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,679
and when i smell them i can recall them

852
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,519
quite quickly you could probably

853
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,720
blindfold me and take me to a few places

854
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,079
i've been quite often

855
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,079
and just let me go in there and smell it

856
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,079
and i could probably tell you where i am

857
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:43,199
there are a couple of commercial grows

858
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,839
in colorado

859
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,880
that when i walk into them i can smell

860
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:48,798
that grow

861
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,960
very specifically i know that sounds

862
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:52,400
crazy but i know the smell

863
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,000
of i'm not even going to say the names

864
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,519
of the few of the cultivation facilities

865
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,278
but they've all got a very

866
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,278
distinct smell and if i walked in you

867
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,000
blindfolded me i could say oh we're over

868
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:01,359
here at this place

869
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,759
and i can say oh we're over here at this

870
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,639
place by the smell of the facility

871
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,158
maybe it's crazy maybe it's bionic uh

872
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
whatever it is i think it's a blessing

873
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,440
as a seed breeder

874
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,360
to be able to identify flavors and

875
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,400
aromas in that manner

876
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,399
all right i'm going to keep moving

877
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,240
forward there are two more questions i'm

878
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,519
going to fit them both in it says

879
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,440
number five is there anything to

880
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,599
harvesting by the full moon lunar cycle

881
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,400
or is this faux grow science

882
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:27,678
there are two major solar events in 2021

883
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,759
have you observed these types of

884
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:32,000
celestial events having any beneficial

885
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,000
effects on a harvest

886
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,200
my first response to this was no because

887
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,079
i'm not a hippie

888
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,600
but honestly i grow indoors on an indoor

889
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:40,639
commercial production cultivation

890
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,798
schedule

891
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,759
and i don't even know if it's sunshine

892
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:47,119
or rainy or

893
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,000
snowy or daylight or nighttime or an

894
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,558
eclipse

895
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,558
or a riot or a fire outside when i'm

896
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,319
working in the cultivation facility

897
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:55,678
it is the lights come on at this time

898
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,200
the lights go off at this time the

899
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,200
plants are on this schedule

900
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,319
i don't know what's going on with the

901
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,240
sun and the moon

902
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,240
and the hippie lunar calendar i don't

903
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,079
have any clue what's happening i don't

904
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,919
pay any attention to that

905
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:09,599
if i had an outdoor grow i would

906
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,840
probably adjust and learn

907
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,359
that hippie science stuff i would do all

908
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:14,720
of that if i had an outdoor girl but

909
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:17,359
being an indoor farmer

910
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,319
i do not pay any any attention to any of

911
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,479
that stuff

912
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,918
um if you've got hate mail for that or

913
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,278
any questions or updates for that my

914
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,000
email address is grow from your heart at

915
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:25,839
hotmail.com

916
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,079
i'd love to hear from anybody who's got

917
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:28,959
input on that honestly being an indoor

918
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:30,639
cultivator

919
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,880
running on a commercial cultivation

920
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,360
schedule the sun the moon

921
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,720
lunar cycles eclipses that doesn't make

922
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,639
any difference in my grow

923
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,159
i like to go watch the eclipses myself

924
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,240
i'll check them out

925
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,840
but the grow i don't think the grow

926
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:46,240
cares at all

927
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,599
um all right the last part number six

928
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,038
and lastly

929
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,798
uh you mentioned someone's name i'm not

930
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:52,079
gonna say their name somebody dropped

931
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,079
off some presents early

932
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:55,439
for my divas i'm using two of these

933
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,759
items already i've got a

934
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,759
handheld infrared thermometer and a

935
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:00,400
desktop monthly planner that monthly

936
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:02,079
planner

937
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,840
will be invaluable it's one of the best

938
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,639
things you can have

939
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,240
then it says my question is about the

940
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,080
infrared thermometer

941
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,400
this thermometer has a laser used for

942
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:15,519
pinpoint accuracy however i'm wondering

943
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,159
if said laser can damage the leaves even

944
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,158
if

945
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,520
the grow lights are on after all we're

946
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,159
not supposed to look into that same

947
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:22,398
laser

948
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,200
do you implement an infrared thermometer

949
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,278
if so

950
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,399
where on the plant do you take your

951
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,359
readings

952
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,359
i do not think that the infrared dot on

953
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,879
that thermometer is going to disrupt

954
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,719
your plants in any way

955
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,159
uh as long as you don't hit it in the

956
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,440
plant's eye and i don't know where the

957
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,120
plants eyes are

958
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,720
i don't think they have rods and cones

959
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,719
to worry about i think they've got

960
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,000
uh we're not even going to go into that

961
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,360
what all that shit's called i was going

962
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,398
to go down a long rabbit hole we're

963
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,879
going to skip that

964
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,558
they've got leaves uh you can put that

965
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,840
red dot on the leaves and i think it

966
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:53,200
will tell you the leaf surface

967
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,720
temperature of those leaves without

968
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,319
doing any damage

969
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,319
where do i take those readings i don't

970
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:59,918
play with the infrared thermometer quite

971
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,038
often i don't find it to be completely

972
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,440
necessary

973
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,119
uh but i would hit about the top of the

974
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,480
canopy where the lights are shining and

975
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,000
then about a third of the way down

976
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,839
and then toward the bottom just to have

977
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,119
a nice comparison what's happening at

978
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,959
different points of the room

979
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:14,639
and you will notice that the leaf

980
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,200
surface temperature will be vastly

981
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,799
different

982
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,120
than the air temperature of the room

983
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,558
especially when using leds

984
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,239
i'm not going to go too far into that

985
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:23,599
because i do have somebody that i want

986
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,640
to get on the show to teach us about

987
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,319
that a little bit

988
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,919
but when you're using leds the leaf

989
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,439
surface temperature will be drastically

990
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,399
different when you're using

991
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,600
metal halide or hps lights so that is

992
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,278
something to think about

993
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,038
but i check in about three different

994
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,000
spots up at the top where the light's

995
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:39,200
really intense

996
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,119
down in the middle where the light's not

997
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,200
so intense and then down lower

998
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,038
where we're not getting much light right

999
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,440
right at the top of where we defoliated

1000
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:49,440
that's where i would check also and see

1001
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,720
make a note of it write down what the

1002
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,558
