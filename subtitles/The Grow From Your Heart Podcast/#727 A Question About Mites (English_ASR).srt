neighborhood i did the thing where i

52
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:06,718
just say that occasionally here we just

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,959
trade trash cans usually it's uh that

54
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,560
neighbor gets my trash cans and i get

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,159
that neighbor's trash kit we just do the

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,840
trash cans we all shift trash against to

57
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,598
the left uh it feels like this week

58
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,680
we're shifting two or three trash cans

59
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,280
to the left uh just exchanging of the

60
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,959
cans is happening i apologize if you

61

68
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,400

81
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,079
birthday that's right for my birthday i

82
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,479
did buy myself a brand new rig i left

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,840
myself a nice budget i went to a one of

84
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,759
my favorite glass shops i went to a few

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,080
glass shops i looked around for a little

86
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,399
bit and i saw a rig that was not super

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,239
expensive but it super caught my eye i

88
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,319
do like a rig that is super functional i

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,000
like a rig that hits more than uh lots

90
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,039
of water flow and lots of movement i

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,719
want the

92
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,799
smoke to hit the banger and then go

93
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,039
through some water to cool down then i

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,480
want it to go to my lungs to my brain i

95
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,560
don't need a lot of movement not a lot

96
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,079
of fanciness i prefer a rig that

97
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,759
functions super well so i will show you

98
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,239
now i will debut for the show the rig

99
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,759
that i have chosen ah this is the color

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,280
here it doesn't show up super great i

101
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,560
can't tell if the color is coming up on

102
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
the camera with the weird lighting in

103
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,920
the room i'll try to correct it uh in

104
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,239
the post production here also may post a

105
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,759
photograph of this in the video feed but

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
if you're watching the video this color

107
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,560
is called ghost it's kind of a light

108
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,878
baby blue kind of close to the unc blue

109
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,280
if you're a sneaker head um i really

110
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,120
love it it is a it's a bottle shape with

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,878
a uh it's got kind of a donut in the

112
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,400
middle here this donut the piece where

113
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,479
it separates here actually works as a

114
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,840
splash guard so if i pull real hard i'll

115
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,079
give you an example here if i dab real

116
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,759
hard

117
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,799
that water will not splash up into my

118
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:13,039
face i do like that um so we've got a

119
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,599
glass rig here it is a 10 millimeter

120
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,279
joint on this rig the rig itself is by

121
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:18,719
brody glass

122
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,239
the um

123
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,919
banger here is from dcs quartz uh it's

124
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,360
really super deep it holds heat real

125
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,279
well i like this i'm going to do my best

126
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,840
to keep this cleaner than i have

127
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,839
most of my glass from the past and also

128
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,679
we've got a beautiful carb cap here this

129
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,679
one came from bowman glass i really like

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,959
this carb cap funny as i pick it up i

131
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,000
noticed there's a hair stuck to it i

132
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,039
just said i was going to keep things

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,120
cleaner

134
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,479
that happened when i set it in here this

135
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,478
carb cap i really like this it's a

136
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:45,839
bubble cap it's got a hole here uh the

137
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:47,039
air will travel through here you'd cap

138
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,359
the banger let me just show you where it

139
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,720
goes it goes here so that the air can

140
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,919
travel through here restrict the

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,440
movement of the air through here give

142
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,039
you a better rip it's got this nice

143
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:57,279
handle on it i tend to hold it with

144
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,479
these fingers put my middle finger over

145
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,758
the hole to kind of restrict the air a

146
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:00,639
little bit better spin it around a

147
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,080
little bit

148
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,478
these are both just a touch stick you

149
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:05,758
need to be cleaned up i'm a bad look bad

150
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,639
dabber i should be cleaning this much

151
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,560
better

152
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,400
speaking of cleaning things better i did

153
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,800
invite our friend pedro

154
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,038
uh mr rosen's neighborhood pedro's grow

155
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,319
room rosin is legal [ __ ] whatever you

156

157
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,560
pedro what up bro hope you're watching

158
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,439
this i did ask pedro to make us a quick

159
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,120
video on how to keep our banger clean

160
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,279
because i did see pedro complain on

161
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,759
social media rightly so that somebody

162
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,918
hit his expensive banger stained it left

163
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,439
it dirty so i politely said hey pedro

164
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,599
would you like to do a quick video that

queen like royalty in there as well

187
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,360
sometimes when you take your girlfriend

188
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,639
to places they don't talk to her they

189
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
only talk to me and they kind of ignore

190
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
her they're really cool they make sure

191
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,079
to include her make her feel included

192
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,879
which is important to me

193
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,240
um

194
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,319
so speaking of the new rig i bought a

195
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,240
couple of new bangers i got a terp

196
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,080
slurper i got a different style banger i

197
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,160
got a taller banger a shorter banger i

198
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,399
got a banger with some i got some dirt

199
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
pearls i got a different carb cap i am

200
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,918
still experimenting to see what kind of

201
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,600
banger i like best on here i like this

202
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,079
banger a lot however it's a little bit

203
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,840
deep so i do have to get a different

204
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:45,519
carb cap i ordered it it's on the way it

205
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:47,038
should show up you may hear the doorbell

206
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,799
ringing while we're recording apparently

207
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,279
it's out for delivery today i should get

208
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,520
that uh but i'm learning i'm adjusting

209
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:55,119
what i've noticed is um with the new

210
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,639
banger and the new turb slurper and

211
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,879
everything my heating and timing is a

212
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,199
little bit off i'm relearning uh how

213
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,038
long to heat how long to cool how long i

214
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,280
need each banger before i hit it that's

215
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,079
a new uh new uh what is it a learning

216
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:10,079
curve that i'm going through there um

217
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,240
also i don't know that i like the terp

218
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,758
slurper i feel like the terp slurper

219
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,199
i'll put a picture of a turp slurper and

220
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,560
a normal banger up on the screen so you

221
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,759
could tell the difference

222
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,079
i'm not sure i'm enjoying the terp

223
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,240
slurper i like the restriction of the

224
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,399
carb cap on top of the bucket or banger

225
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,598
the turp slurper seems to since the

226
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,198
holes are down there at the bottom

227
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:28,800
there's no way to restrict them i don't

228
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,879
feel like i can restrict it and get the

229
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,879
dab flow that i want that is just my

230
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,639
personal um experience personal

231
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,120
preference i think i'm going to be

232
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,160
sticking with the bucket banger type

233
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,000
style

234
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
i'm not sure if i like the terp pearls

235
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,839
inside the banger or not

236
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,240
my new banger is a little deeper so it

237
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,159
will require a spinner cap and terp

238
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,360
pearls for this to work properly i've

239
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,520
been putting the pearls in there and

240
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,038
using a normal cap it works pretty good

241
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,318
when this new cap gets here i will give

242
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:55,839
you an update i bet you it's gonna

243
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,759
freaking rock it's gonna rip it's gonna

244
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:59,439
shred so i'm still learning how to heat

245
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,439
it how long to heat it how long to let

246
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,800
it cool uh it's a learning process i've

247
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:04,160
been talking for a long time about just

248
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,400
heat it and hit it and you'll figure it

249
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,680
out um what i'm learning is you're gonna

250
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,198
have to kind of waste a couple of dabs

251
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,319
you're gonna kind of let a couple uh not

252
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,598
get hot enough you're gonna make a

253
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,720
couple of too hot dabs you're going to

254
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,199
burn your lungs you're going to roast

255
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,720
your throat have fun figure it out and

256
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,680
then take a lot of notes and also if you

257
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,280
really

258
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,639
want to get critical they do sell some

259
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:22,799
devices that you can measure the

260
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,160
temperature of your banger you can get

261
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,680
it to the right temp that people will

262
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,120
make recommendations for you you can get

263
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,199
your banger to the perfect temp every

264
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,038
time making note of what that is repeat

265
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,560
that you'll have an sop for taking dabs

266
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,199
that'll be beautiful

267
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,879
where am i in my notes um i'm not sure

268
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,000
i'm convinced over the uh the terp

269
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:39,918
slurper that's one of the things i

270
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
wanted to mention i'm not sure i don't

271
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,679
like that airflow and man things are

272
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
really expensive to do a lot of testing

273
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,958
buying a couple of bangers a turp surfer

274
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,839
some pearls a couple of different carb

275
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,439
caps

276
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,720
that really did add up quickly but it

277
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,440
was worth it for the show worth it for

278
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,440
the experiment for the experience i will

279
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,440
let you know what i learn and once i get

280
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,920
more things figured out i will do sort

281
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,680
of an updated video i know i've done a

282
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,599
dabbing video we've talked about taking

283
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,639
dabs but we did miss a few things i'm

284
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,159
going to continue because that will

285
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,000
bring me back to what i'm going to talk

286
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,199
about here this is going to loop around

287
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,278
uh also

288
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,959
why am i so rambly why am i so stoned

289
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,439
because one of my friends met me

290
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:19,199
somewhere recently and he passed me a

291

she decided that it smelled so good that

312
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,519
she had to take a little dab of the

313
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,599
lemon jeffrey and she really enjoyed her

314
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,759
buzz she giggled she smiled she laughed

315
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,920

she had to take a dab anyway let me loot

318
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,440
back to where i was

319
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,440
i was at a store yesterday i went to go

320
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,519
pick up some other smoking accessories

321
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
at a local shop and there was a couple

322
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,519
in there that was asking the uh the

323
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,439
person in the shop the clerk i guess the

324
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,440
the person working asking a lot of

325
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,519
questions about dabbing about uh how

326
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
long to heat things how to let it cool

327
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,278
uh how much to dab how to get the dab

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,440
into the banger they were asking a lot

329
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,278
of questions and it made me realize how

330
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,959
much more i could be teaching i need to

331
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,399
just pop in randomly to these head shops

332
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,159
and dispensaries and just listen to the

333
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,000
questions that people are asking and it

334
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,759
gave me some ideas of things that i

335
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,559
could teach you guys

336
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,319
um

337
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,000
one thing that i want to recommend i am

338
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,440
going to do another dabbing video i've

339
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,440
said this just a moment ago i'm going to

340
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,640
do another video where i teach you about

341
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,920
different bangers i'm going to put a

342
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,000
terp slurper in there because i didn't

343
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,078
have a slurper in the last video

344
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,519
we'll put some pearls in the banger

345
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:08,639
we'll use a spinner cap we'll do

346
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,959
different things like that we'll talk

347
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,639
about heat we may even buy a dab right

348
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:13,919
maybe we could use that as a if i buy it

349
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,919
for the podcast maybe it's a tax

350
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,360
write-off we could get a dab right

351
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,519
or maybe somebody from dab right or

352
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,440
positively vibe wants to uh sponsor the

353
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,919
show and send us a dab right or some

354
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,120
sort of a terp thermometer so we can

355
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,199
take dabs with that we'll teach you guys

356
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,799
how to use that also so you can get that

357
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,800
perfect dab every time then also we're

358
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,958
going to talk about things like uh

359
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,799
nectar collectors and puffcoes and dab

360
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,439
straws and new things that are coming

361
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,039
out and also um there's other tech and

362
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,320
other things other toys and other tools

363
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,759
that i've seen now at the shops that

364
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,000
i've never talked about some things i've

365
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,519
never even experienced so going there

366
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,679
yesterday and having to wait on the

367
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,879
clerk to help that couple before me

368
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,719
really showed me there's some things

369
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,360
that i'm slacking on teaching you on so

370
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,800
that will inspire a new dab episode to

371
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,399
come out in the future i'll learn a lot

372
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,399
more we'll do a lot more stuff

373
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,078
i'll try not to make you wait until 7 10

374
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,078
for that but that could be what happens

375
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,759
honestly uh the episodes go by so

376
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,439
quickly and time travels really quickly

377
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,360
right now anyway what i'm saying is i

378
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,880
know you another episode about dabbing

379
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,320
the one thing i want to make sure to say

380
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:14,799
right now is if you're buying a device

381
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,160
if it's a dab rig if it's a nectar

382
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,000
collector

383
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,480
whatever you intend on smoking your

384
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,399
concentrates through i highly recommend

385
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
that it's got water in it to make some

386
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,159
bubbles water and bubbles are your

387
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,959
friend when you were smoking concentrate

388
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,439
so we're going to heat these

389
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:31,278
concentrates up whether it's your nectar

390
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,959
collector or your dab rig if you're

391
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,559
hitting a nail a banger a nectar

392
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:35,759
collector i said that one already a terp

393
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,439
surprise what i'm trying to say the word

394
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,639
that won't come to my brain whatever

395
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,639
you're hitting you've got to heat it up

396
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,720
quite hot and if it doesn't go through

397
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,079
some water and some filtration it's

398
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,680
going to kind of roast your lungs your

399
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,120
throat your esophagus it's not going to

400
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,278
feel super pleasant you're not going to

401
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,959
enjoy it as much as you could so my

402
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:53,278
first recommendation my number one

403
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:56,239
advice is when you're buying uh any sort

404
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,559
of smoking apparatus for concentrates is

405
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,919
that it does pass through water uh this

406
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,119
rig right here it doesn't have a lot of

407
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,559
water and it's got this little tiny

408
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
downstem but this this little bit of

409
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,879
water

410
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,040
that really saves your throat uh saves

411
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,559
your lungs your esophagus everything in

412
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,480
between there i think it makes a much

413
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,799
more enjoyable experience

414
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,039
um also when it comes to smoking devices

415
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,278
i don't want a big bong i don't want a

416
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,120
giant smoking device for concentrates i

417
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,799
want a little piece i don't need so the

418
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,240
idea with the bong you'd fill the whole

419
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:26,159
bong with all that smoke and you pull

420
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,440
the carb and then the [ __ ] smoke all

421
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:28,559
goes to your head and you get a big rip

422
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,639
right with the dab you don't have to

423
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,559
carve it uh that way necessarily you

424
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,680
don't fill it as much i do a little carb

425
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:35,439
work with the carb cat but i'm not

426
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,879
trying to get philip fill it clear it

427
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,480
fill it fill it clear it i'm just going

428
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,320
straight to the dome we got the carb cap

429
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,159
work in that action i don't need such a

430
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,600
big device a smaller device is better

431
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,480
for dabs in

432
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,759
my humble opinion all right let me check

433
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,680
my notes and see where we are talking

434
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,198
about the dab rig and then we are going

435
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,479
to jump into a couple of these emails

436
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,240
that i've got here in front of me let me

437
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,199
make sure i covered everything

438
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,639
uh had to get new stuff i had to get

439
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,240
some dirt pearls because the banger was

440
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
too deep had to get a spinner cap we're

441
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,278
going to talk about spinner caps and

442
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,040
slurpers in the future

443
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,120
i do understand how quickly things can

444
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:08,559
add up how quickly it gets expensive so

445
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,600
let me go spend some money do some

446
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,719
experiments and then i'll teach you

447
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,639
about it so you guys don't have to waste

448
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,879
all the money is what i'm trying to do

449
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,560
um always use water for filtration and

450
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:18,399
in the future we'll do an episode

451
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,119
talking about nectar collectors dab

452
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639

00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,558
growers come in very confused on what to

605
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,640
do and me and the store owner direct

606

the grow store bro thank you for the

610
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,079
huge compliments by the way i'm not

611
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,000
gonna glaze over that thank you now the

612
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,079
question says my friend that owns a

613
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,640
growth store is having major issues with

614
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,678
spider mites i come and visit him a few

615
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,360
times a month maybe more and now i'm

616
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,440
apprehensive to do so because i do not

617
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,959
want to drag them into my grow he is my

618
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,320
friend and i don't think it's the

619
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,840
coolest thing to do to him and i don't

620
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,918
want to do that i thought about this

621
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,558
today when i saw a leaf all beat up

622
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,320
while foliar feeding um it's not spider

623
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,079
mites but it got me thinking there are

624
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,480
obvious precautions i can take but being

625
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,000
a new grower there might be some not so

626
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:09,120
obvious precautions i can take and i

627
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,200
wanted to ask for your great advice

628
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,119
thanks again keep it going you're doing

629
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,279

630
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:17,759
your friend jamie jamie this is a great

631
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,879
question uh how do we not trade spider

632
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:20,319
mites your friend that owns the grow

633
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,240
store is having a major issue with

634
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,798
spider mites isn't that funny that the

635
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,880
guy that owns the store that has every

636
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,839
single product available to him that has

637
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,360
every single vendor on speed dial has

638
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:33,119
not figured out how to eradicate the

639
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:34,879
spider mites that's really funny every

640
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,158
product that he could imagine he can

641
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,000
order it he could get it he could

642
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
probably reach right there it's probably

643
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,798
right there he could read the

644
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,240
instructions he could apply everything

645
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,440
he could do something every other day if

646
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,720
he wanted to and he still hasn't beat

647
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,080
the spider mites

648
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,600
that to me is funny that's like when

649
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,119
they say that the mechanics car is

650
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:51,119
always the last one to get the work

651
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,798
isn't that the damn truth all right so

652
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,558
your buddy's got a major issue with

653
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,200
spider mites and you are apprehensive to

654
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,879
go over there that is um

655
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,720
that's that's not a problem that's a

656
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,760
very wise move that's a very smart thing

657
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,200
to think

658
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:04,400
you don't want to put your crop at risk

659
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
by hanging out with your friend who's

660
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,640
got a problematic crop

661
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,158
i would first of all be a bro and kind

662
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,919
of encourage your friend to get those

663
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,679
mites under control i would think of a

664
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,360
strategy i'd be like bro we've got to

665
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,280
fix this

666
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,439
you own the store you're better than

667
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,960
this we're better than this it's 2022

668
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,200
we've got better tools we can do

669
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,640
research we've got to beat this i'd help

670
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,319
him develop an integrated pest

671
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,320
management strategy that will get rid of

672
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,079
those bugs he works at the store there

673
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,678
are probably 82 different products there

674
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,158
that he could use in a rotation in

675
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,840
conjunction to knock out any [ __ ]

676
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,600
problem really quickly so let's

677
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,319
encourage him to get a strategy to beat

678
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,918
those bugs now the hardest part in life

679
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,079
is making other people do what we want

680
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,280
and that's not even cool anyway so let's

681
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,960
talk about what you can do um

682
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,558
i would just have this is what you

683
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,240
should do you should have not should

684
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,279
this is what i would recommend i can't

685
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,279
tell you what you should do i can tell

686
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,200
you what you could do uh you could set

687
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:00,158
up an integrated pest management

688
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,360
strategy that will outpower his pest

689
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,799
problem that's what you're probably

690
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,558
going to need to do

691
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,720
when you go to his place if you go to

692
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,240
his place when you come back home

693
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,400
change your clothes before you go into

694
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,440
your grow space change everything

695
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,519
the shoes socks pants undies if you can

696
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,798
shirt hoodie i've got dreadlocks bro so

697
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:18,480
i'd be in there [ __ ] shaking my

698
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,879
dreads out i'd wrap the dreads up in a

699
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,038
hat when i go to vacro or his house i'd

700
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
come home take off that hat

701
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,240
shake that dreads out put them in a

702
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,679
different hat put on different clothes

703
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,519
if you can rinse everything off and take

704
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,038
a shower i would do that put on

705
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,440
different clothes before you go into

706
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,119
your grow space at this time all those

707
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,679
clothes with the bugs should be in the

708
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,359
laundry room and a dirty clothes area

709
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,480
maybe already in the washer maybe you

710
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,399
dropped them in the dryer so you could

711
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,839
heat them up and cook all the bugs uh

712
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,600
get rid of those clothes and put on

713
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,158
fresh clothes before you go into the

714
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,678
grow space don't take anything to his

715
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,679
place that's going to go into your grow

716
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,600
is what i think i'm trying to say then

717
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,759
the next step is a responsible farmer is

718
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,359
to have an integrated pest management

719
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,038
strategy

720
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,399
i don't know if you're an organic grower

721
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,720
i don't know if you're a salt grower i

722
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
don't know if you're a guy doing both if

723
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,319
you're a hybrid style grower i don't

724
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,319
know what you're doing but i would work

725
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,639
on a strategy to make sure you don't get

726
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:13,038
those bugs it can be a pesticide

727
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:15,679
rotation a sprayed pesticide application

728
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,200
rotation i would choose two or three

729
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,120
three or four different products maybe

730
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,440
find a few things you can mix

731
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,359
apply those every monday if you start

732
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,279
seeing a problem step up your game and

733
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,759
apply every monday and thursday i would

734
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,279
rotate i would do one product on monday

735
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,558
a different product on thursday a

736
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,639
different product on monday and if you

737
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,798
only have three start the rotation over

738
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,240
if you can mix a couple of things mix

739
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,000
two things hit them on monday hit them

740
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,079
with a third product on thursday if you

741
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
can do what i'm saying is they will

742
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,278
build resistance to the same product if

743
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,038
you hit them more than two or three

744
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,880
times with the same product they'll

745
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,158
start saying oh i know how to take that

746
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,919
you throw a left hook they know how to

747
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,320
block the left hook you got to go left

748
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,840
hook right cross uppercut or some [ __ ]

749
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,359
mix them up so they don't know how to

750
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,519
block you every day they will build

751
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,199
resistance get in there with multiple

752
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,639
modes of attack

753
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,720
different products different plans

754
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,559
different strategies for different bugs

755
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,558
but have a plan have a strategy have a

756
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,240
rotation of pesticides

757
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,639
keep your room clean keep your clothes

758
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,480
clean keep your tools clean clean all of

759
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,919
your equipment when you're done

760
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,679
let's talk about you're talking about

761
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,440
bugs let's talk about viruses right now

762
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,759
everybody's getting the

763
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
dreaded tobacco mosaic virus there's

764
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,440
another hopulate and viroid is also out

765
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:24,798
there everybody's getting that let's

766
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,840
talk about how to prevent the spread of

767
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,519
the virus in our room between uh it's

768
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,158
really hard to do it if you can clean

769
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,798
your scissors between every single plant

770
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,799
i recommend cleaning scissors with iso

771
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,038
with rubbing alcohol between every

772
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,720
single plant if possible if you've got a

773
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,640
mom plant you're cutting clones off of

774
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,640
it you're going to move to another plant

775
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,600
clean your scissors that way we don't

776
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,038
take the virus from plant a to plant b

777
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,839
clean the plants between clean the

778
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,960
scissors between every plant if possible

779
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:54,399
it's going to slow you down it's going

780
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,400
to take time

781
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,919
but viruses will take a lot more time

782
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,278
and slow you down a lot more so do the

783
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,038
preventative work

784
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,319
if you're working in rows if you're

785
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:04,319
doing long rows if you're in a

786
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,079
commercial grow maybe maybe change your

787
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,439
scissors clean your scissors after every

788
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:08,879
row i understand the boss is going to

789
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,558
get crazy if you're [ __ ] cutting a

790
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,919
plant clean your scissors cut a plant

791
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:12,720
clean your scissors i get it it takes

792
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,038
time

793
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,720
but we don't want to ruin crops so clean

794
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,038
up after yourself

795
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,278
get a pest management strategy clean up

796
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,000
after yourself clean yourself before you

797
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,440
go in there and seal up the room where

798
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,960
are the bugs going to come in into that

799
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,278
room have you sealed all the cracks the

800
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,038
crevices the nooks and crannies is there

801
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,400
debris is there junk is there trash in

802
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,519
the grow space that will really

803
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,759
encourage bugs to be around how about uh

804
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,359
if let's hypothetically save it on the

805
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,558
other side of this that's a backyard

806
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,918
back there behind that just full

807
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,678
disclosure nobody probably knows what's

808
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,759
behind that curtain that's the backyard

809
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,120
let's hypothetically say that's a grow

810
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,200
room just it's not but we're going to

811
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:50,719
invent a grow room back there let's just

812
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,240
say that's a growth space i would clean

813
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,200
up all of right here as well there would

814
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,400
be no junk no debris no boxes no trash

815
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,919
no paper

816
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,278
i wouldn't have it looking like the

817
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,278
garage i wouldn't have it looking like

818
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,278
the basement where you got [ __ ] stored

819
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,119
or the old drum sets are sitting where

820
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,359
there's especially like clothing and

821
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:10,158
blankets and trinkets and [ __ ] like that

822
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,678
soft things where bugs like to hide um

823
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,278
wood things that smell good some wood

824
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,200
doesn't smell good somewhat is inviting

825
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:16,960
to bugs things like dirt and things like

826
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,640
that places where bugs and spiders want

827
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,278
to go don't have that type of

828
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,480
environment have a clean organized swept

829
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,720
environment that you can clean up and

830
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,798
make sure there's no bugs no pests every

831
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
little nook and cranny and hiding spot

832
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,639
is a place for a bug to hide uh they'll

833
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,759
make a party if you got leaves on the

834
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,520
floor they're gonna go eat up those

835
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,359
leaves on the floor they're gonna breed

836
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:36,720
then as soon as you disrupt those leaves

837
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,558
they're gonna go scattering in the room

838
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,839
guess where they're going your plants

839
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,440
they're going to go right to those fresh

840
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,399
green plants they're going to head to

841
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,840
the weakest leaves they're going to

842
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,519
start chewing up those weak leaves on

843
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,278
your plants then they're going to breed

844
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,359
they're going to have a party so

845
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,519
the main thing you should do is when you

846
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:54,240
go to that house or that friends grow or

847
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:56,639
even that growth store where he is um

848
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,319
remember he's infected he's contaminated

849
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,679
when you leave don't take clothes there

850
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:00,960
that you're gonna wear into your grow i

851
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,278
would maybe have a separate set of

852
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,798
clothes to go see that person ah then

853
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,960
when you go see that person change

854
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,720
clothes right after take a shower before

855
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,240
you go into your grow space maybe have

856
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,400
dedicated shoes pants a shirt a hoodie a

857
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,798
hat glasses and gloves and whatever else

858
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,480
you need for your grow space don't take

859
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,879
that other stuff into there have

860
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,278
dedicated tools don't move tools from

861
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,120
that grow area to another grow area to

862
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,200
the outdoor to the indoor just buy the

863
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,719
extra buy one tool for every space you

864
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,960
need scissors and that grow that grow

865
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,319
that grow a ph pin for every grow don't

866
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,120
move the [ __ ] around you're just moving

867
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,200
problems around that way and then

868
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,119
think about like just basic pest

869
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,720
