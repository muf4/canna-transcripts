45
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:51,359
sale that's right if you listen to the

46
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:54,060
last episode I did mention a Black

47
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,618
Friday sale at iredirect that sale has

48
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:57,478
been great it will continue for a couple

49
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,459
of days after this episode comes out

50
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,560
there will be Black Friday Cyber Monday

51
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,059
and then it'll just be kind of Stoner

52
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,500
Tuesday and lingering Wednesday then

53
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,659
we'll probably have to wrap up the sale

54
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,280
pretty quickly after that but thank you

55
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:10,439
for the huge support the sale is still

56
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,300
going on everybody that did purchase

57
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:14,039
beans from that sale did get freebies

58
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,260
everybody gets freebies every time you

59
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,019
order from iridirect a lot of those

60
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:20,639
people will get freebies that are tester

61
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,560
seeds they are clearly labeled that they

62
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,359
are tester seeds a lot of them will come

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,039
with a plant a pamphlet that tells you

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,900
what I hope will happen and what I

65
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:29,699
expect of those testers see needs it's

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,739
not a requirement it's nothing I really

67
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,598
require you to do but it would be cool

68
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:35,039
if when you get those tester seeds if

69
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:36,840
you go to my Discord and post some

70
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,639
pictures of the progress post some

71
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,680
pictures to social media of those tester

72
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,359
beans they are a free gift to you but in

73
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,519
return I would love some photography

74
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,840
maybe a grow report so if you did get

75
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,640
those tester beans in the package

76
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,560
without the pamphlet please join the

77
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:51,119
Discord all the info will be there if

78
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,500
you did get the pamphlet that I recently

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,060
got printed it took a while to get that

80
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,800
here because of holiday shipping but

81
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,539
most of the orders did come with a

82
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,819
tester pamphlet if you got testers

83
00:02:57,539 --> 00:03:01,799
please join the Discord and post your

84
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,259
pictures and I guess that is a good way

85
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,840
to segue into talking about my new

86
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:09,120
method of doing tester seeds I have been

87
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,039
overwhelmed with tester applications a

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,319
lot of people want to run tester seeds

89
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,598
for me I appreciate it I enjoy that you

90
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,979
are so enthusiastic about my brand and

91
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,119
that you've got so much trust in my

92
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,859
product that you're willing to run

93
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,719
testers before I've even tried them

94
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,940
we're putting out brand new [ __ ] thank

95
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:25,739
you for the enthusiasm one of the things

96
00:03:23,939 --> 00:03:28,199
that happens is I select a lot of

97
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:30,480
testers I send them seeds and only about

98
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:33,299
maybe 50 or 60 percent of those testers

99
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,280
will actually reply and put pictures and

100
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:37,620
post pictures of the progress of the

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,539
plants on any form of social media it's

102
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,280
like a I make a lot of donations with

103
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,139
brand new seeds is kind of what it feels

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,459
like since I was making a lot of

105
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,199
donations with the seeds and people

106
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,060
would fail to continue correspondence

107
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:49,859
I've decided just to give the testers

108
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:51,840
away with orders if you're purchasing

109
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,640
seeds from iridirect there's a good

110
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,039
chance you'll get a pack of tester seeds

111
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:57,539
in that order those are free you've got

112
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:59,219
some brand new stuff you've got things

113
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:00,840
that a lot of people do not have you've

114
00:03:59,219 --> 00:04:02,639
got things that are not for sale at this

115
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,560
time if you've got testers you're

116
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,119
getting those because I want those ran

117
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,979
you can run them at your leisure you can

118
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,080
run them now you can run them later but

119
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:12,238
when you run them just tag me post some

120
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,099
pictures maybe join the Discord that

121
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,420
will help me determine if those seeds

122
00:04:14,098 --> 00:04:17,159
are worth putting out to the general

123
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:19,259
public I can grow them I know they grow

124
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,939
well for me but what do they do for you

125
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,800
are they successful in your garden are

126
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,540
there any problems is there anything I

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,699
should notice anything that may make me

128
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,199
not want to put those seeds out I need a

129
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,120
bunch of people to grow those in the

130
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,860
easiest way is to include them with paid

131
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,500
orders and let people get them as a free

132
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,419
gift as a free thank you in the future I

133
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,459
may add test receipts to the website for

134
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:40,799
a very low price I've learned that

135
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,478
people respect things they pay for a lot

136
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,879
more than free things so I will get more

137
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,978
communication more correspondence more

138
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,019
feedback if I just give them to you as a

139
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:50,939
gift with your paid order or if I charge

140
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:52,680
you just a minimum price for those

141
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:54,719
tester seeds so we will be changing up

142
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,280
the way we do testers here if you are

143
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,139
testing if you're running test seeds if

144
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:59,939
you've been involved I still want all of

145
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,340

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,139
something terrible in a c line that I

159
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,179
gave you as a test or or please report

160
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,220
that I don't just want good feedback

don't worry about the ego this is real

162
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:36,300
testing we need to know if those seeds

163
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:38,219
are worth worthy and worthwhile to send

164
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,139
to other Growers if they don't work well

165
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,639
for you let us know so I can consider

166
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,379
holding them back and not putting them

167
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,538
out to the public that is what a

168
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,279
responsible breeder should do so that is

169
00:05:45,538 --> 00:05:49,259
a long Ramble On you're going to get

170
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,059
some testers in your packages and the

171
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:53,340
testers may appear on the website in the

172
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,680
near future for a small price all I'm

173
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:57,418
asking for in return is photos and grow

174
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,699
reports you're going to get really low

175
00:05:57,418 --> 00:06:01,620
priced and basically free seeds in

176
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,538
exchange for Quality grow reports and

177
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,879
high quality photos that's all I ask of

178
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,259
so please help me out all right well

179
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:09,000
let's move forward that felt like that

180
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,979
took a lot longer than it should have

181
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,319
did I mention that every order at I

182
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:14,639
redirect does get free beans I think I

183
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:16,439
said that but that is on the notes

184
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,939
wanted to make sure oh one more thing I

185
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:20,160
should mention I hope everybody had a

186
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:22,500
happy holiday season I am recording

187
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,120
right after the Thanksgiving holiday I

188
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,800
don't know if you celebrate that but my

189
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,300
family had a great holiday gathering we

190
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,978
had some good food some good time times

191
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,500
shout out to everybody who gathered for

192
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:34,620
that also after that I was gifted a

193
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,699
piece of medicated pumpkin pie when one

194
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,259
of my friends said that they made

195
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,300
pumpkin pie and they infused it with

196
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:41,340
ganja you know that I had to take a fat

197
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,079
slice of that I ate that about 40

198
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:45,000
minutes ago and I can honestly feel it

199
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,219
starting to work now as I'm doing the

200
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,720
intro to the show here I have no idea

201
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,880
how long I've been recording it could

202
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,620
have been 15 minutes or it could have

203
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,360
been three hours at this point I really

204
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:57,060
do not know but it's going to be a great

205
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,919

206
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,300

207
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,918

got dreadlocks Big Jay oakerson did

234
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:58,318
about an hour worth of material I think

235
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,680
the first 15 or 20 minutes of that was

236
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,020
just him roasting myself and Miss dread

237
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,900

239
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:10,138
bunch of great jokes about our

240
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:12,538
dreadlocks about just cliche dreadlock

241
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,280
[ __ ] um that's the second time that I've

242
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:15,719
seen Big Jay oakerson in the front row

243
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:16,978
at comedy work so I should mention I was

244
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,900
in the front row thank you to Comedy

245
00:08:16,978 --> 00:08:20,399
Works um I was in the front row for that

00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:22,978
show that was the second time that I've

247
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,659
seen big J in the front row and he

248
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,639
actually asked me a couple of the same

249
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,439
questions as he did last time I was

250
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,939
giving him similar answers and hoping it

251
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,158
would trigger some memories but the dude

252
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,838
was so stoned there was no way he was

253
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,158
going to even remember any of that so

254
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,599
big shout out to Comedy Works for

255
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,338

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,980
right that wraps up the rasta Jeff

266
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,679
portion of the podcast let's move in to

267
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,659
the email portion of this show I've got

268
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,979
a great email here in front of me this

269
00:09:03,659 --> 00:09:06,838
one I don't know if they want their name

270
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,180
set but it goes a lot like this it came

271
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,800
from the patreon patreon.com forward

272
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,379
slash grow from your heart it says here

273
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,240
is a good podcast question I agree with

274
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,458
you brother this was a great question it

275
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,440
says I was just thinking about this I'm

276
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:22,018
growing some stuff from another breeder

277
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,760
and some of the machine in the same tent

278
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,278
you have stated that the machine has a

279
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,439
very strong odor can that odor actually

280
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,439
change the flavor profile of other

281
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,940
strains being grown in a 4x4 tent the

282
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,459
other cultivars have a very different

283
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,920
profile than your machine they are more

284
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,899
fruity smelling that is a really good

285
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,819
question I have mentioned before that

286
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:43,679
the machine does make gassy chemical

287
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,600
Aromas that are very potent and very

288
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,879
pungent looks like you're growing other

289
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,399
stuff that makes a fruity terp profile a

290
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,838
fruity flavor and Aroma you're more

291
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,179
you're kind of concerned about those

292
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,339
flavors intermingling and Crossing you

293
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:58,079
don't want that stinky nasty machine to

294
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:59,640
mess up the fruit candy of the other

295
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,379
thing that you were growing that is

296
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,419
understandable I do not think that

297
00:10:01,379 --> 00:10:05,759
you've got to worry about that during

298
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:07,319
the grow during the growth cycle I do

299
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:08,519
not think those Terps are and will

300
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,260
intermingle I don't think they'll

301
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,940
contaminate each other I don't think

302
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,679
that that will be a problem during the

303
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,480
grow phase that's nothing to worry about

304
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,639
the plants are going to produce Terps

305
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,620
the Terps revolatize the plant will

306
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,539
continue to produce terpenes as it grows

307
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:24,060
now when we shift into the dry and cure

308
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:26,159
phase at that point you can absolutely

309
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:28,979
contaminate and cross flavor the things

310
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,480
in the room by having maybe if you put

311
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,278
the machine next to a strawberry

312
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,019
flavored plant some of that chemical

313
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,879
Aroma and some of that strawberry Aroma

314
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:37,740
that may travel over and that's just the

315
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:38,639
aroma getting stuck into the dried buds

316
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,980
that's a little bit of a different

317
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,539
phenomenon there so I wouldn't worry

318
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,220
about it so much in the grow but when

319
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:46,199
it's when it comes to drying and cure it

320
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,180
keep those separate if you can don't put

321
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,560
them in the same container together you

322
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,359
can dry them in the same room in the

323
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:53,039
same space but when it comes to cure

324
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,480
them and you're sealing them that's when

325
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,278
I would keep them separate that's when

326
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,079
the aroma is going to transfer over and

327
00:10:56,278 --> 00:10:59,578
it's not really uh it's not it's just

328
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:00,899
the aroma sticking in the other one like

329
00:10:59,578 --> 00:11:02,699
if you've been around weed and it gets

330
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,379
in your shirt that weed smell is going

331
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:06,540
to stick in the other buds just like the

332
00:11:04,379 --> 00:11:08,220
weed smell sticks in your shirt that is

333
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,799
my theory I don't have absolute science

334
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,440
on that but in my opinion I would not be

335
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,819
worried I've grown 20 different kinds of

336
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,680
plants in the same room in a warehouse

337
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,839
environment we'll run 20 or 30 different

338
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,939
strains in one room the Aromas and

339
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:22,680
flavors do not mix that way but when it

340
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,180
comes to drying and curing I would keep

341
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:25,919
them separate when you put them into

342
00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:27,539
containers because that's when your

343
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,819
Aromas and flavors could get a little

344
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:31,439
muddled be very careful with the drying

345
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,440
and curing process that's where most of

346
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,120
the flavor and Aroma mistakes do occur

347
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,680
I'm not going to say your name but that

348
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,778
was a great question my dude thank you

349
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,699
for the patreon support let's keep it

350
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:44,939
moving I've got two questions here that

351
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,220
are going to segue us into a nice long

352
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,839
ramble here I'm going to read both of

353
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,000
these messages and then I will kind of

354
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,820
address them this one came from the

355
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,578
patreon and it says yo Ross to Jeff what

356
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,260
episode can I hear more about 18 6 in

357
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:00,899
late flower I'm very interested in

358
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,879
learning more thanks the answer to that

359
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:04,980
one is this episode my dude I'm going to

360
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,480
talk about it in just a second there's

361
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,000
another question it says quickish

362
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,860
question do you think plants finish more

363
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,179
quickly in the last two weeks of flour

364
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,278
if you switch to 18 6 or 10 14 that's a

365
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:18,958
very good question I think you once said

366
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,179
reducing light helps them finish more

367
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,939
quickly but in the most recent show you

368
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:26,039
said 18 6 helps them finish more quickly

369
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:28,079
I was surprised to hear this I've done

370
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,240
18-6 Mini many times and it definitely

371
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,120
helps re-vege and maybe more flower

372
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,919
development but faster finish which is

373
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,778
faster thanks again for the great shows

374
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,338
still hoping for more strain reviews

375
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,379
don't worry my dude more strain reviews

376
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,980
are coming but let's jump into this one

377
00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:45,539
for now this is a good case of uh me

378
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,700
having been growing for quite a while

379
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:49,259
I've grown for a long time now I've been

380
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,540
in commercial environments I've been in

381
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:53,039
home grows I've been in giant grows and

382
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:56,338
small grows have been intense I've been

383
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:58,439
in garages LEDs HPS every kind of

384
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:00,480
lighting you could imagine one of the

385
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,399
things to notice here is that

386
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,899
um I've changed I've adapted things I'm

387
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,419
doing things differently than I have

388
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:08,940
before don't be afraid to adjust and

389
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:10,439
adapt and try new things so let's focus

390
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,019
more on the main part of this question

391
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,700
here this is about light cycles the

392
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,039
first question is talking more about 18

393
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,440
6 in late flour then we hear another

394
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,078
listener mentioned the 10 hours on and

395
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,060
14 hours off let's talk a little bit

396
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,399
about flowering cycles and flowering

397
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:28,619
times why we do the times we do and what

398
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,200
we're hoping to achieve by altering

399
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,899
these flowering Cycles now most commonly

400
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,120
we are using 12 hours on and 12 hours

401
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:38,940
off to flower our plants we're doing 12

402
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:40,919
12. that is equal amount of on as off

403
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:42,779
time the reason that we are running that

404
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:46,019
12 12 is because that's what we have

405
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:47,578
noticed works for most plants this is

406
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:49,980
what is called the critical period

407
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:52,379
plants need a certain amount of dark

408
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,659
time to initiate flowering now some

409
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,879
plants that may be 10 hours of Darkness

410
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:58,559
some plants that may be closer to 13

411
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,958
hours of Darkness but what we have

412
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:03,119
learned from what we are breeding from

413
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,679
what we have bred for indoor use most of

414
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,740
the plants we are working with flour

415
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,439
very well with a 12 hour on and 12 hour

416
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,839
off cycle so that works very well for

417
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,880
most of the plants now a long time ago a

418
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,160
breeder known as DJ Short came and he

419
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,320
taught us that we can see more

420
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,419
phenotypical expression and more

421
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,940
variation if we adjust our light timer

422
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:26,639
to give those plants a little bit more

423
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,920
darkness that extra hour of Darkness

424
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,079
we'll show you like I said a moment ago

425
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:33,599
more phenotypical expression more

426
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,838
variation in your plants sometimes more

427
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,360
Aromas sometimes different Aromas so

428
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,699
there are advantages to running an 11 on

429
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,620
and 13 off cycle that's very similar to

430
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:47,278
our 10 and 14 which our friend mentioned

431
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:49,019
here 11 13 10 14 very similar we're

432
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,939
going to get very similar results we're

433
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:52,320
going to get very similar effects the

434
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:54,240
plants are going to get more sleeping

435
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,220
time less daytime they'll be able to

436
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,139
express their characteristics a little

437
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,720
bit differently so we've got our basic

438
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:02,278
1212 cycle that most people run we know

439
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,959
that works that's been tried and true

440
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,338
for most of the plants that we've been

441
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:07,018
breeding for a few years we've been

442
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:08,579
breeding indoors with these plants that

443
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,919
works well for the stock we have been

444
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:12,299
working with we've adjusted our rooms to

445
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:14,219
work with the plants we've adjusted the

446
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,659
plants to work in our rooms most things

447
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,579
that take longer or shorter than that

448
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:19,319
have simply been eliminated by breeders

449
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:22,078
most of the plants are going to work in

450
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,000
12 12. now we've got our 11 13 or 1014

451
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,219
which is going to show you a little bit

452
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,220
more phenotypical expression now the new

453
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:32,339
thing that I have been working with is I

454
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,259
do 12 hours on and 12 hours off for most

455
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:36,180
of the flowering cycle just like most of

456
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,100
you guys are doing then at the end of

457
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:39,419
that cycle when I begin to flush my

458
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,980
plants which is a whole nother

459
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:42,899
controversial topic which we'll talk

460
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,000
about in the future when I begin to

461
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:48,659
flush my plants I will put my light

462
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,179
cycle back on 18 hours on and six hours

463
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:53,159
off now that sounds crazy to a lot of

464
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:54,838
people a lot of people have given me uh

465
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:56,819
negative feedback and a lot of criticism

466
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,320
about that but guess what the people

467
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:00,480
that said I'm crazy and that it's a

468
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,040
[ __ ] up idea have never tried it they

469
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
haven't done it because the only

470
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:05,939
feedback I've gotten from people who do

471
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,740
this is they say my Bud's finished more

472
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,779
quickly and they're more dense thank you

473
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,278
that was a great idea so I'm only

474
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,559
getting negative feedback from people

475
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,379
who refuse to try it the people who have

476
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:18,359
tried it are liking the idea so why am I

477
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:20,759
doing this what is my my goal what's my

478
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,459
intention what the [ __ ] was I thinking

479
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:26,578
light is the main source of energy for

480
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:29,458
our plants I am mostly making seeds in

481
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:31,799
most of my runs I discovered that I can

482
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:34,018
pollinate a plant after that pollination

483
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:37,139
is successful I can put my light cycle

484
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:38,879
back on 18 6 and I can use my veg room

485
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,919
as a veg room and I don't have to

486
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,019
continue flowering plants in there to

487
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,838
make those seeds come to full maturation

488
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:48,060
my seeds will finish under a veg light

489
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,639
those seeds will reach full maturation

490
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:52,379
under that 18 6 light I'm not trying to

491
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,600
grow flowers here I was trying to make

492
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:57,360
seeds in this run so I turned my light

493
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,920
cycle back to 18-6 I moved other plants

494
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,539
into that room so that they could veg so

495
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,639
I could have my next flower run ready

496
00:17:00,539 --> 00:17:05,338
and at the same time I let those seeds

497
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,099
harden up under 18 hours on and six off

498
00:17:05,338 --> 00:17:09,958
what I did notice was my buds where the

499
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:12,058
seeds would be they look like total [ __ ]

500
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,519
but guess what I did not care I was not

501
00:17:12,058 --> 00:17:17,578
growing consumable smokable buds I was

502
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:20,099
solely focused on seed production so I

503
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:22,678
turned my lights on to 18 6. I noticed

504
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:24,779
my seeds were done a lot earlier than

505
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:27,000
normal these seeds took about 10 to 14

506
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:29,700
days less time to finish than they

507
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,919
normally did I had more viable seeds I

508
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,319
had a better average of germination I

509
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:37,259
had thicker fatter better looking seeds

510
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,359
from using the 18 on and six off light

511
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,220
cycle my theory behind this is that

512
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,619
light is the number one source of energy

513
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,839
for my plant if I can feed that plant

514
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:48,000
more light it will photosynthesize more

515
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,639
it will metabolize more it will make

516
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,619
bigger better faster seeds and that is

517
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,020
exactly what I achieved with that ideal

518
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:56,699
with that method so I thought since I'm

519
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:58,980
doing this with my seeds couldn't I

520
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,360
increase my lifetime a little bit in my

521
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,860
flower room and kind of bang them out

522
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,199
make them a little more dense get them

523
00:18:01,859 --> 00:18:05,939
out here a little bit quicker so I

524
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,519
decided to try this when I started

525
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,620
flushing because we all know if we

526
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,779
change the light cycle too early you do

527
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:15,538
run the risk of re-veging your plants

528
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:18,538
that will happen if you let them go for

529
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:20,279
too long with this cycle that is why I

530
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:22,679
don't do this until I am flushing I know

531
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:24,480
it's the end and we've got 10 maybe 12

532
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:27,059
maybe 14 days before I'm going to cut

533
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,919
them there will be no re-veg opportunity

534
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:31,019
the hormones will not have that much

535
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,419
time to shift over it will not happen

536
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:35,700
that quickly so what I would do when I

537
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:39,000
begin to flush I simply adjust my timer

538
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,160
to 18 hours on six hours off and flush

539
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,140
my plants then I pay close attention to

540
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,460
the trichomes this is where it gets

541
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,200
really important when the trichomes are

542
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,700
ready cut down the plants you have to

543
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,440
pay close attention because they're not

544
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,240
going to be ready at the time they were

545
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,100
before they're going to finish sooner

546
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,660
than they did last time

547
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:56,399
they're also going to be a little bit

548
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,080
more dense there's going to be more

549
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,460
weight to your product so it's going to

550
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,619
be more dense and it's going to be done

551
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:03,240
earlier why wouldn't you want to do that

552
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:05,459
in my opinion that is a great thing to

553
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:07,740
do also if you do want the idea of

554
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:09,779
re-veging that plant you've already sped

555
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:12,240
up your re-veging process you're 10 to

556
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:13,740
14 days ahead of the game of reveging

557
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,538
that plant you can cut down the majority

558
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,640
of the plant leave a couple of thumb

559
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:19,079
size nuggets and re-vege those you're

560
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,299
already way ahead of the game because

561
00:19:19,079 --> 00:19:23,519
you've been on a re-veg light cycle for

562
00:19:21,298 --> 00:19:25,918
10 days all right so we have covered the

563
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,200
three main light schedules which I would

564
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,960
work with we've got 12 12. we've got 11

565
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,058
13 and we've got 18 6 for the end of

566
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,819
flower now let's talk about why I would

567
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:37,918
do each of those different Cycles 12 12

568
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:39,599
that's basic we know it works that's

569
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,580
what most of my commercial rooms run on

570
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:43,079
when they're in flower 12 12. that's

571
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:44,639
going to work for almost everything that

572
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:46,379
we have bread everything that's been

573
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,360
designed to put in an indoor cultivation

574
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,080
facility now let's talk about when I

575
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:54,000
would use 11 on and 13 off 11 on and 13

576
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,519
off is great like like I've said before

577
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,319
for showing different characteristics of

578
00:19:56,519 --> 00:20:00,900
different phenotypes if I was doing a

579
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,960
pheno hunt of a seed pack I may consider

580
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:07,019
doing 11 on 13 off in my flowering cycle

581
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:08,759
because I will see more variation more

582
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,379
specific characteristics of those

583
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:12,480
phenotypes it allows the plants to

584
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,880
express themselves just a little bit

585
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,558
more that extra hour of sleep lets them

586
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,299
do different things maybe one will get

587
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,460
Fox taily one will get a little bit

588
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:22,918
fingery maybe one will turn purple you

589
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,019
never know what it may do but I see more

590
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,559
variation so when I'm doing a final hunt

591
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:30,298
I may do that 11 on and 13 off if I were

592
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,339
running something from DJ Short with the

593
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:36,240
blueberry in it I may consider that 11

594
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:39,178
on 13 off Flo responded very well to 11

595
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,640
on 13 off a lot of strains will like

596
00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:44,280
this some strains may not react as well

597
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,900
but the only way to find that out is by

598
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:48,599
growing The Strain under that light

599
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,460
cycle so I would do the first run when

600
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:53,038
you grow something I would either do 12

601
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,740
12 or 11 13. so the first time you run a

602
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:58,500
pack of seeds either do that 12 12 or 11

603
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,319
13 both will be effective but you may

604
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,700
see some differences in that 11 13. I

605
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:04,859
understand we can't all change our

606
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,240
schedules our rooms that one hour May

607
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:07,678
mess something up for you that one hour

608
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,480
May throw everything else in your

609
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,700
schedule off you might not be able to

610
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,058
adjust timers I understand that but give

611
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,740
it a run at 12 12 or 11 13 for the first

612
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:20,279
time that you run a plant let's talk

613
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:23,519
about 18 6 now I never recommend running

614
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:26,700
18 hours on and 16 hours off on the

615
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:29,579
first try that you grow any plant ever

616
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,080
don't do that that's not my advice I

617
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,819
want you to do that the second third

618
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,699
maybe fourth time that you've run this

619
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,619
cultivar don't do it the first try the

620
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,340
first try I always recommend doing that

621
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:43,439
12 12 or 11 13 so we can see what the

622
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:45,119
plan expresses then we'll learn the plan

623
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,580
we'll see how long does it take to

624
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:49,619
flower when should I begin flushing then

625
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:51,119
once you know when to begin flushing the

626
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:52,798
next couple of times you run it you can

627
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,959
decide that is when I want to turn that

628
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,960
plan to 18 6. don't do that on the first

629
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,240
run you don't know when to do it so the

630
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,519
12-12 works always commercial grows I'll

631
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,240
probably do 12 12. final hunts I'm gonna

632
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:08,158
do 11 on 13 off the 18 6 comes in on

633
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,079
that second or third run don't do that

634
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,539
on the first try we need to learn these

635
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,759
plants then I will do the 18 6 and I

636
00:22:12,538 --> 00:22:16,980
will see how the plants respond to that

637
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:19,379
like I said before some plants love it

638
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,720
some plants will not react well to it at

639
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,700
all plants that naturally grow dense and

640
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,700
they get big dense fat buds they're

641
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,140
going to get more dense fat buds the

642
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,759
buds that get a little bit larfy a

643
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,679
little bit fluffy they will tend to

644
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,900
dense up and get a little bit harder and

645
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,538
pack on a little bit more weight toward

646
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,640
the end if you use that 18 6. another

647
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:40,619
great advantage of the 18 6 is I think

648
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,600
that they do finish a little bit early

649
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:44,219
when you run that light cycle they're

650
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:46,259
just metabolizing more they're

651
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,179
photosynthesizing more they're able to

652
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:49,558
speed up the process when they do sleep

653
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:51,780
they go hey I've only got a few hours

654
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:54,058
let's get some [ __ ] done so they speed

655
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:56,940
up so that is part of why I recommend

656
00:22:54,058 --> 00:22:58,558
using that 18 6 light cycle not on the

657
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,600
first run we need to find out how long

658
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,460
to flower them on the first couple of

659
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:04,500
runs then we can play with the modified

660
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,880
light cycle at the end so now let me

661
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,140
back up and actually answer the main

662
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,059
part of the question now that we

663
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,080
understand these uh optional light

664
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:11,639
cycles

665
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,759
um the main question was which is

666
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,020
quicker 18 6 or 10 14 and again I'm

667
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:17,339
going to recap and I'm going to go right

668
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,200
back to where I started with all this

669
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:21,058
and I'm going to say that's probably

670
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,460
strain specific you're going to get

671
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:25,500
different results from each light cycle

672
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,058
you're going to get sped up results from

673
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,240
both light cycles but it's going to be

674
00:23:27,058 --> 00:23:33,960
plant specific on which works best for

675
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,179
your plants I've never done 11 13 into

676
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,038
18 6. I bet that would be extreme that

677
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,559
extra hour going to the extra hours

678
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:43,919
would be crazy I've always done 12 12 to

679
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:46,798
18 6 maybe try 11 13 to 18 6 at the end

680
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,900
to see how that does for you but

681
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:51,599
um really I'm not sure which light cycle

682
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,860
is faster if you could do the 1014 and

683
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,019
then switch it to 18 6 you're going to

684
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:56,879
to see huge results there but I have

685
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,579
never done that so it's going to be

686
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,860
plant specific strain specific cultivar

687
00:23:59,579 --> 00:24:04,019
possibly phenotype specific is going to

688
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,339
be my answer for that one

689
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:08,879
