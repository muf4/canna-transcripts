73
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,659
that is all the business part we've got

74
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,160
here at the start of the show let's jump

75
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,739
into your favorite part of the podcast

76
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:54,598
The Listener email portion of the show

77
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,459
I've got a bunch of great emails here in

78
00:02:54,598 --> 00:02:58,139
front of me the first question here in

79
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,659
front of me came from our friend Shannon

80
00:02:58,139 --> 00:03:02,818
this one did come from the grow help tab

81
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:05,759
on the irie genetics website that's

82
00:03:02,818 --> 00:03:07,318
right if you go to iregenetics.com there

83
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,598
are a bunch of tabs at the top one of

84
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:11,818
them says questions or help click on

85
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,679
that tab you'll be able to answer a few

86
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:15,419
preliminary questions we ask what kind

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,099
of question do you have where are you

88
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,259
growing what kind of Lights what stage

89
00:03:17,098 --> 00:03:21,299
of are you in veg or flower what week

90
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:23,098
are you in we ask a few questions just

91
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,959
to help me answer your question a little

92
00:03:23,098 --> 00:03:27,000
bit more clearly I get some details so

93
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,500
this one came from our friend Shannon we

94
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,639
can skip all of the preliminary

95
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,680
questions they were answered because

96
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,779
these don't really affect my answer I do

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,180
understand this question and I do have a

98
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:38,459
good solution our friend Shannon says

99
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:40,379
Rasta Jeff I think I have a problem with

100
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,878
white flies and I've begun treatment as

101
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:44,518
such but I am wondering if there's

102
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,679
anything that can be mistaken for white

103
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,420
flies that's a really good question it

104
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,920
does go on to say however I do know the

105
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,139
difference between fungus gnats and

106
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,399
white flies it is definitely not fungus

107
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:55,859
gnats because I have done a podcast

108
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,959
recently in the past trying to talk

109
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,400
about fungus gnats and white flies we're

110
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,080
trying to treat for both I said it's

111
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,879
very important to identify the pests

112
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,099
which you are attacking that way we can

113
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,539
attack properly so they do know that it

114
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:08,699
is not fungus gnats there's a big

115
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:10,798
difference there It also says also I've

116
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,139
become quite a fan and I appreciate your

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,420
work and efforts in the pot world the

118
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,039
first episode I ever saw was number 713

119
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,599
about mother plants well I'm glad you

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
discovered the podcast I'm glad you're

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,900
watching thank you for joining us thank

122
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,160
you for Learning and extra thanks for

123
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:24,779
the great question here because this is

124
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,240
a great topic to talk about here on the

125
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:30,359
show it says PS you can use my name too

126
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,800
I'm digging your work from Canada so big

127
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,960
shout out to our friend Shannon from

128
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,100
Canada thank you for the great question

129
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,478
um it sounds like you do know the

130
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,460
difference between fungus gnats and

131
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:40,500
white flies there are not a lot of other

132
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,359
things that will be confused or look

133
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,800
like white flies sometimes an aphid can

134
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,979
look like a white fly but here is the

135
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,240
main difference aphids do not fly the

136
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:50,099
main difference is that these white

137
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,199
flies are going to fly if you take

138
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,540
something your hand your arm or maybe a

139
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,340
stick and you hit the plants do little

140
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:58,620
white things come flying up and out of

141
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:00,659
the plant that look like ashes if so

142
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,399
those are white flies they look like a

143
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,259
little piece of rice they look like an

144
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,478
ash and they fly around in the grow they

145
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:07,919
fly around a lot now if we have

146
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:09,659
definitely identified that those are

147
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,579
white flies let's talk a little bit

148
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,740
about treatment because just identifying

149
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,719
them is only the start of the mission

150
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,220
let me talk about one thing here A

151
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,680
friend of mine was facing white flies

152
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,500
and he said I put yellow sticky traps

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,000
all over the room but it is not working

154
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:26,819
absolutely yellow sticky traps are not

155
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,100
meant to eradicate a pest yellow sticky

156
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:31,019
traps are there to to indicate the

157
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,000
presence of a pest those yellow sticky

158
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:35,038
traps should be yellow and pest free

159
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,660
maybe one day you'll see a couple of

160
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,860
bugs on there you'll go hey there's

161
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,840
something in here I need to pay

162
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:41,879
attention you mark down how many you saw

163
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,099
make a mental note there were about 10

164
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:46,199
of these specific bugs on this yellow

165
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,939
sticky trap yesterday morning pay

166
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:49,319
attention how many there are there in

167
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:51,120
the evening how many are there tomorrow

168
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,279
morning how many are there the next day

169
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,720
are a couple Landing you're gonna get a

170
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,638
couple of bugs stuck to your yellow

171
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,120
sticky trap but if you've got

172
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,740
10 the first day 50 the next day 150 the

173
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,840
next day we've got an increasing problem

174
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,538
it is time to do something those yellow

175
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,978
sticky cards are only indicators of the

176
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:10,379
presence of pests they are not there to

177
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,779
eradicate eliminate or minimize a pest

178
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,000
infestation anyway that is to let you

179
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,559
know hey there's bugs here bro that's

180
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,600
like having some Footsteps in the snow

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,699
is all that those guys are so let's

182
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,900
start by identifying the white flies we

183
00:06:20,699 --> 00:06:23,639
know they're there we've seen them on

184
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:25,439
the yellow sticky traps now let's talk

185
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:27,379
about ways to eradicate these white

186
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,759
flies the first thing I would do is

187
00:06:27,379 --> 00:06:31,680
defoliate the white flies are on the

188
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,300
leaves let's take off the leaves any big

189
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,280
leaf you don't need any leaf with a

190
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,600
purple petiole let's get that leaf right

191
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,279
out of there let's strip the plants

192
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,139
clean it up let's put all of those

193
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,299
leaves into a sealed container and get

194
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,160
that as far from the grow as possible if

195
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,780
you could burn that [ __ ] that would be

196
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,520
ideal but I understand that is not

197
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,959
possible for everybody don't just go

198
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:50,579
throw it in the backyard don't throw

199
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,680
that bag of leaves in the basement don't

200
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:54,959
just abandon that bag that bag is

201
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,478
contaminated let's get that [ __ ] far far

202
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:59,519
from our ganja plants far far from The

203
00:06:57,478 --> 00:07:01,500
Grow then also once you're done doing

204
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,939
that change clothes clean up let's not

205
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,500
take a bunch of white flies right back

206
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,800
into the grill after we just did work

207
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,418
step number one let's heavily defoliate

208
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,939
any plant that is affected by the white

209
00:07:09,418 --> 00:07:13,560
flies and also consider defoliating the

210
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:15,360
other plants that may not be as heavily

211
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,740
affected let's minimize the

212
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,720
opportunities let's take away their

213
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:20,639
hangout spots let's not leave a lot of

214
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,199
opportunities for them to go so the

215
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,240
first thing we want to do is do some

216
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:26,098
defoliation so the next thing I would do

217
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,418
is kind of a wild idea it's super fun to

218
00:07:26,098 --> 00:07:29,159
watch somebody do this if you've got a

219
00:07:27,418 --> 00:07:30,959
buddy that can get you on camera record

220
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,180
this post it tag me it will be really

221
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,098
funny this sounds wild but I do this I

222
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,538
have done this this is how I get rid of

223
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:38,038
white flies I haven't had white flies in

224
00:07:36,538 --> 00:07:39,719
a long time I have done this there's

225
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,879
actually video somewhere on Instagram of

226
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,560
me doing this I get a long stick

227
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,000
whatever kind of long stick you've got a

228
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,939
couple of feet long is what I needed for

229
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,098
my grow space I also got a shop vac with

230
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:51,899
the long wand on it that way I can

231
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:53,159
control where I'm pointing you guys may

232
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,439
be able to see where I'm going with this

233
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,400
I turn on the shop vac I start smacking

234
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,139
the plants with the stick and then I

235
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,239
hold the shop vac up toward the light

236
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,439
guess what all those white flies fly out

237
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,019
of the plant they head up to the light

238
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,819
then guess what right into the shop vac

239
00:08:04,019 --> 00:08:07,799
and they're gone sometimes I'll kind of

240
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,300
wave that shop vac around the canopy be

241
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,098
careful not to suck up plant matter

242
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,139
don't get leaves stuck in there keep it

243
00:08:11,098 --> 00:08:14,579
moving be careful about it just kind of

244
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:16,620
feather across the top of the plants

245
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:18,000
brother and you will suck up a lot of

246
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,978
those white flies keep tapping they'll

247
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,079
keep flying give them a minute to settle

248
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:23,878
watch where they land get the uh the

249
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,139
vacuum kind of near there again and then

250
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,360
tap them and they'll go flying right

251
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:29,400
into the vacuum this is very effective

252
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,199
make sure that you've got a vacuum with

253
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,000
the filter in it some of the shop vacs

254
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,320
will shoot those white flies right out

255
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,458
of the other end of the shop vac and

256
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,740
just shoot them into your other grow

257
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:39,239
space don't do that have a filter on

258
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,680
there have some sort of way to catch

259
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,599
those white flies once they're sucked

260
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,759
into your shop vac if you don't have a

261
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:46,740
shop vac a normal house vacuum will work

262
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,879
put that attachment on it to where the

263
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,440
one you used to clean the curtains or

264
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,299
the corners or whatever put that

265
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,920
attachment on there get in there suck up

266
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,778
those white flies so now we have

267
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:57,240
defoliated we've taken away most of

268
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,919
their home now we have also shot which

269
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,419
was kind of an assassination we went in

270
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,919
there and just got rid of most of them

271
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,899
we took out a lot of them there's still

272
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,179
going to be a few uh stragglers people

273
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:08,700
are going to hang out let's talk about

274
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:11,278
spray applications that I would

275
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,379
recommend to help minimize and eradicate

276
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,120
this white fly infestation the first

277
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:17,100
product I'm going to recommend is

278
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,379
Evergreen Evergreen is a great product

279
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,940
it's a pyrethrin based product the

280
00:09:19,379 --> 00:09:22,559
reason Evergreen is going to work very

281
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,240
well for the white flies is because they

282
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,399
like to congregate on the bottoms of the

283
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,440
leaves if you spray the Evergreen on the

284
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,299
underside of the leaves it'll be sticky

285
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:32,339
it'll be an undesirable habitat and

286
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:34,319
undesirable environment for the white

287
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,360
flies they simply won't want to be there

288
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,680
also it's toxic to them they're not

289
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,720
going to want to hang out so get the

290
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,000
undersides of your leaves when you apply

291
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,639
the pesticide get it I'm going to

292
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,120
recommend somewhere between 15 and 30

293
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:50,100
milliliters of Evergreen per gallon of

294
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,080
water in a pump sprayer shake the [ __ ]

295
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:54,300
out of it and apply that to your plants

296
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,220
when you spray it start at the bottom of

297
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:57,958
the plant and work your way up and make

298
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,399
sure to spray the undersides of the

299
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,619
leaves and since we're dealing with

300
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,839
white flies also spray the main stock in

301
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,639
the stalks if you can what this is going

302
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,260
to do you need to spray the bottom of

303
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,179
the leaves because that is where the

304
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:10,919
pests hang out the most start at the

305
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:12,359
bottom and work your way up this way we

306
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:14,219
know that we're coating the entire plant

307
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,139
we're getting everything covered in

308
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,820
pesticide and by starting at the bottom

309
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:19,139
you spray it start at the bottom and it

310
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,519
doesn't drip from the top to the bottom

311
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:22,199
it'll actually work your way up and you

312
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,060
can see what where you've applied a

313
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,440
pesticide you can make it more effective

314
00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:27,599
that way by starting at the bottom and

315
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,399
get the undersides of the leaves is very

316
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,740
important so I would start off with an

317
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,839
evergreen spray then if that didn't work

318
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,639
or if that is not available to you the

319
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,160
spray product from Mammoth bio control

320
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,299
the mammoth pesticide spray I cannot

321
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:41,579
think of the name I think I wrote it

322
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,259
down what's it called Mammoth Canna

323
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,120
control is a great product that will

324
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:46,379
work for your white flies one thing

325
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,259
we're going to have to do we're going to

326
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,820
have to spray every third day until

327
00:10:49,259 --> 00:10:52,259
these white flies are gone you have to

328
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,778
be persistent they're not going to go in

329
00:10:52,259 --> 00:10:56,819
on the first application we'll defoliate

330
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:59,220
we'll shop vac we'll get rid of a nice

331
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,079
percentage been our first application of

332
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,579
Evergreen should get rid of a lot of

333
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:03,659
them there should be a few stragglers

334
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,099
they're going to be eggs they're going

335
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:06,719
to be babies they're going to reproduce

336
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,399
produce we got to kill them it's going

337
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,040
to take a couple of sprays

338
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,139
first spray I would go for is Evergreen

339
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,759
then in three days I would rotate I

340
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:16,439
would use the uh what is it called the

341
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,240
mammoth Canon control if that's

342
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,800
available to you if not go right back in

343
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,139
with that Evergreen and spray that again

344
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:24,240
that will get rid of them also botanic

345
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:26,578
garden Max is another great pot product

346
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,860
to put into the rotation here now let's

347
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:30,419
talk about some more uh gentle and

348
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,639
simpler products that we can use to

349
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:35,039
eradicate the white flies something that

350
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,860
works very good very well in my opinion

351
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,019
is a product known as mosquito dunks

352
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,000
they are sold at most places that sell

353
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:44,220
anything to do with plants or gardening

354
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,200
all of your big box stores your Lowe's

355
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,759
Your Home Depot whatever's in your

356
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,220
neighborhood they will have mosquito

357
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,659
dunks you can also get them at Target if

358
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,700
you can get them at a mom and pop

359
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:55,439
hardware shop in your area we always

360
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,120
recommend that go spend your money in

361
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,339
your community don't give it to the big

362
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,778
corporate box store but they got all the

363
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:02,399
[ __ ] that's why we go there so I

364
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:04,500
guarantee that those stores will have it

365
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,419
they're called mosquito dunks they're

366
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,100
sold on a red card and they look like

367
00:12:06,419 --> 00:12:10,319
little Donuts I think there's about six

368
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,240
Don Donuts in the package there could be

369
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,339
three three to six donuts in the package

370
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,019
they look like a little like a donut or

371
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:17,760
a hamster lick or a bird feed or

372
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:19,320
something like that don't eat it don't

373
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,480
lick it don't feed it to your pets we're

374
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,399
going to use this to kill white Flies

375
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,278
what I recommend you do with this

376
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:28,620
I put it in a baggie a thick baggie not

377
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,299
like a sandwich baggie a dope baggie I

378
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,220
use a gallon Ziploc bag it's kind of

379
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,259
thicker then I wrap that in newspaper

380
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:36,300
then I use a mallet to crush up the

381
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:38,039
mosquito dunk I want it into small bits

382
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,559
then it will take those small bits and

383
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:42,240
put that directly into water I'll stir

384
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,338
it up I'll let it sit I'll let that

385
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,720
mosquito dunk kind of break up after a

386
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:46,980
while it just starts to fall apart like

387
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,839
a turd in the water it'll just come

388
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,519
apart it'll become flaky and

389
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,440
disintegrate in there then I'll get a

390
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,060
stick and I'll stir it up then I'll add

391
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,620
my other nutrients to the mix I might

392
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:58,259
just put my nitrogen phosphorus

393
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,519
potassium calcium molybdenum I'll throw

394
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,319
it all in there whatever I'm feeding

395
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,600
might just go right into this mix right

396
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,459
along with my mosquito dunks then I will

397
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,560
water that into the soil and that will

398
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:09,059
definitely help get rid of all of those

399
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:10,619
white flies they will not want to go

400
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,778
back into the soil so at this point

401
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,339
we've defoliated we've shop vac now

402
00:13:12,778 --> 00:13:16,019
we've sprayed the leaves the leaves are

403
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:18,000
now undesirable for these white flies

404
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,500
and we've also drenched our soil with

405
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,240
the mosquito dunks which has got a

406
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,919
beneficial bacteria in there that

407
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:24,539
product will work very well to help get

408
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:26,759
rid of the wife flies it's very cost

409
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:28,919
effective it's very affordable and very

410
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:31,200
effective also another product that will

411
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:33,419
work very good for your white flies is

412
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,399
Monterey Garden spray Monterey Garden

413
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:37,740
spray contains a bacteria called

414
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:39,958
spinosad and spinosad is very effective

415
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,899
against most pests that we're going to

416
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:44,518
encounter in our cannabis grows so let's

417
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:46,139
recap a little bit because I feel like I

418
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:49,078
gave you a lot of information and I also

419
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:51,600
feel like I'm going super duper fast the

420
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,278
first thing I would do defoliate get rid

421
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,200
of the leaves if there are no hotel

422
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:57,120
rooms there's nowhere to stay the bugs

423
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,700
will leave then hit them with the shop

424
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,919
vac tap the plants shop vac those little

425
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:04,740
[ __ ] as they come flying out then hit

426
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,939
them with the pesticide then maybe also

427
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,919
get in there and hit them with the shop

428
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,019
vac again if you've got time why not

429
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,939
shop back the [ __ ] out of them then in

430
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,679
three days hit them with the pesticide

431
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:15,660
also the first time you hit them with

432
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:18,059
that pesticide give them a soil drench

433
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:20,100
from those mosquito donks now we've

434
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:22,319
taken away their hotels we've made it

435
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,060
undesirable we've shot backed the [ __ ]

436
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,980
out of them to eradicate okay most of

437
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,838
the population now we're spraying a

438
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,519
pesticide to make the leaves undesirable

439
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,260
and we're also drenching the soil

440
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,519
there's nowhere for the white flies to

441
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:34,139
go they're going to get the [ __ ] out of

442
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,940
there now our other option if you are

443
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,440
opposed to spraying a pesticide or maybe

444
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,300
you're too late into flour and you don't

445
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,760
want to do that the other option of

446
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,500
course is to release Predator bugs the

447
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,659
Predator bugs will come in and eradicate

448
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:47,879
those white flies and if you do choose

449
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:50,458
to go the beneficial insect route I

450
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,500
definitely recommend Green Lace Wings to

451
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:55,500
get rid of the white flies also there's

452
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:59,059
another Predator mic called the swirky

453
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:01,679
the swirky I want to say swirky

454
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:03,659
s-w-i-r-r-k-i very close to that that

455
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,179
guy will definitely get in there and

456
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,679
eradicate those white flies this worky

457
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:09,179
those guys do thrive in warm

458
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,159
environments so if you've got a hot grow

459
00:15:09,179 --> 00:15:12,958
space which you probably do which is

460
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:15,778
probably contributing to the white flies

461
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,338
the sworkies a DOT swirky those bad

462
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:18,600
[ __ ] will get in there and eat

463
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:21,300
the [ __ ] out of your white flies of

464
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,980
course my first recommendation is the

465
00:15:21,299 --> 00:15:25,919
Green Lace wings and if you do release

466
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,360
their lace wings I may go for the live

467
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:28,500
lace wings that are active already

468
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,778
because you've got a white fly

469
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,278
infestation any other time I recommend

470
00:15:30,778 --> 00:15:34,259
the cards I like when they hatch the

471
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:35,399
eggs come on the cards they hatch they

472
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,379
turn into these little dinosaur

473
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,820
alligators and those things are super

474
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,799
hungry and they're interesting to watch

475
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,480
most of the time that's what I recommend

476
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,219
I may go for straight for the living

477
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,079
lace wings at this point just to

478
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,459
eradicate these white flies that's what

479
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,319
I would use to eliminate these white

480
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,239
flies white flies are not a huge problem

481
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,339
but they can become a huge problem they

482
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,320
carry more pests if you've got a small

483
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,639
problem the white flies will compound

484
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,560
every problem and if you've got a

485
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,959
problem with one plant the white flies

486
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,299
will definitely move that problem to all

487
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,859
of your plants now I do understand that

488
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,198
a lot of us will be in different phases

489
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,419
of the Cannabis production we may be in

490
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:11,639
veg we may be in early flower mid flower

491
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:13,139
or late flower that does make a big

492
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,120
difference of course later in flower

493
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:18,000
that's when I recommend those beneficial

494
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,000
insects in veg early flower that's when

495
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,198
I will recommend the Evergreen or the uh

496
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,480
what else was the other one that I said

497
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:26,819
the botanic guard Max or the botanic

498
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
guard uh WP which has also got the

499
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,899
Bavaria bassiana in there which will be

500
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,519
very effective against the white flies

501
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:34,440
so early in flower I would go with the

502
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,959
Evergreen I would go with the mammoth

503
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,459
Canon Control Spray later in flower I

504
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,138
may go with the botanic garden Max

505
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:41,819
products the botanic garden products

506
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:44,278
because they don't have oils they're

507
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,839
focusing more on the beneficial bacteria

508
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:47,879
and the fungus which is in that product

509
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,759
and I would rather smoke that than the

510
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:52,919
oils honestly it's going to have a less

511
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,199
detrimental effect on flavor and less

512
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,879
detrimental effect on the final product

513
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,439
those beneficial bacterias will

514
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,299
dissipate they'll get destroyed by the

515
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,040
air they'll get destroyed by the wind

516
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:03,240
and the light those oils are going to

517
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,399
stay there they're going to taste

518
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,480
terrible in your final product so I

519
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,699
would recommend something like the

520
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,439
botanic Gard Max of course if you have

521
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:12,120
to go late in flour I never recommended

522
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:14,339
spraying Laden flour but sometimes

523
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,678
you've got to do what you have got to do

524
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:19,078
if the white flies are not destroying

525
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:20,640
your garden later in flower maybe write

526
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:22,198
it out unless of course you've got a

527
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,660
Perpetual cycle that's always something

528
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:26,519
to think about but earlier and earlier

529
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,140
in the phase I would go with Evergreen

530
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,179
as it gets a little bit later I would

531
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:32,520
work my way into the botanic guard and

532
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:35,160
the Bavaria bassiana beneficial

533
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,418
bacterias as my defense all right I

534
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,279
think I've covered this question the

535
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,660
main question was can I identify that

536
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:41,399
they are white flies I don't have a

537
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,620
picture but if they fly around like

538
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,538
ashes if they look like little uh just

539
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:47,579
white bugs flying around that's a white

540
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:49,440
fly bro we've got to treat for the white

541
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:51,178
flies all right my friend Shannon thank

00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,879

559
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,539
flaccid Jack

560
00:18:28,619 --> 00:18:32,459
that's an interesting name let's keep it

561
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:34,859
moving it says roster Jeff I just

562
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,480
discovered your podcast and I love it

563
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:38,279
thank you for listening bro there's a

564
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,839
lot of episodes to go catch up on so

565
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:41,639
head back toward the back of the catalog

566
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,439
and start listening and listen to all of

567
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,720
the episodes can't wait to see what you

568
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,519
think about some of the older content it

569
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,519
says you've got more actual grow talk

570
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:52,619
than most podcasts thank you I know I do

571
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:53,759
get rambly I cut out the shout outs at

572
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,079
the start of the show because I noticed

573
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,000
that was throwing people off and people

574
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:58,379
wouldn't listen but I try to stay

575
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,940
focused and talk about cannabis

576
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,980
cultivation I don't try to overload you

577
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,140
with commercials and [ __ ] to buy of

578
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,220
course I want you to buy my seeds but we

579
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,600
covered that at the start of the show

580
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:08,339
there's no reason to keep rambling about

581
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:10,259
that and I also feel like when you have

582
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:12,058
a problem and a grow I don't need to

583
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,379
sell you a product I need to give you of

584
00:19:12,058 --> 00:19:15,298
course I just told you things to spray

585
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,740
on your [ __ ] for the last problem but

586
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:18,359
I'm not sponsored by those companies

587
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,339
they don't pay me nobody gave me any

588
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:22,379
money to recommend those products I

589
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:24,298
recommend them because they work and

590
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,220
that's what matters I want you to grow

591
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:28,139
the best cannabis you can grow I've got

592
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,179
this gift of I can read something and

593
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,880
comprehend it and put it to use and I

594
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:34,860
feel like I can repeat and regurgitate

595
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,720
uh things that I've read and my

596
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:39,058
experiences in an educational way that

597
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,798
everybody can follow along so thanks for

598
00:19:39,058 --> 00:19:42,178
thinking there's more grow talk than

599
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,980
most other shows I'm not paid to

600
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:46,019
advertise anything but seeds here now

601
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:48,058
and of course I try to advertise my own

602
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,918
seed line because that's what I'm gonna

603
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:52,918
do but but you're right let's stay

604
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,080
focused and get to more actual grow talk

605
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:57,419
it says recently I started some Autos

606
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,339
which I've saved to make seeds so you've

607
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:01,740
got some Auto flowers going that is fun

608
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:03,899
I'm not an Autoflower grower or a

609
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,579
breeder but more power to everybody out

610
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,559
there working with autoflowers there's a

611
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:10,139
seed and a plant for everybody and a

612
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:12,779
grower for every seed is how I feel it

613
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:15,179
does go on it says I saved one seed from

614
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,099
each pack to do this I'm wondering if

615
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:19,860
you have any experience using colloidal

616
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:23,219
silver no I do not use colloidal silver

617
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:25,319
I strongly heavily highly prefer silver

618
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:27,120
thiosulfate it's much more effective it

619
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,500
works much better on the plants it

620
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,259
doesn't take as many spray applications

621
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:33,480
and I think it's less stressful overall

622
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:36,058
to the plant so I don't use colloidal

623
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,980
silver I make my own silver thiosulfate

624
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:41,399
which I've done a full podcast on making

625
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,140
STS it's called My STS mix or something

626
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,059
like that you can watch that episode

627
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,460
I'll put a link in the video description

628
00:20:45,058 --> 00:20:49,859
then it goes on it says I only want to

629
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,360
Herm one branch and not the whole plant

630
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:54,538
let me drop this paper and talk about

631
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,819
this if that plant is a Herm in any way

632
00:20:54,538 --> 00:20:58,679
you do not want to breed with it let me

633
00:20:56,819 --> 00:21:01,918
explain this when we're making feminized

634
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:04,679
seeds there is no hermaphrodite no

635
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,419
intersex that word does not exist when

636
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,700
it comes to making Femme seeds if you

637
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,340
are working with a plant that is a Herm

638
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,798
a hermaphrodite an intersex plant you're

639
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,839
going to have a failure of a feminized

640
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,519
project I know in being very critical

641
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:20,279
but I want to make this clear a lot of

642
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:22,619
people think that Femme seeds have some

643
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,660
sort of intersex or hermaphrodite trait

644
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:28,500
or gene or magic to them that is very

645
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:31,380
untrue let me explain this when I I make

646
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,240
seeds I make a lot of Femme seeds I sell

647
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,460
a lot of Femme seeds you guys grow my

648
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:37,740
Femme seeds you're very satisfied with

649
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,360
them that tells me that I'm doing it

650
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:42,599
right so here's what I'm doing

651
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,879
before I use a plant to make Femme seeds

652
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:47,819
or any seeds with it I grow that plant

653
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,679
and I purposefully stress the [ __ ] out

654
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:52,139
of that plant I want to cause that plant

655
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,600
problems and turmoil because I want to

656
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,100
see how it reacts Under Pressure if the

657
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,339
plants that I'm growing with show me

658
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,719
intersex traits hermaphroditism uh what

659
00:21:59,339 --> 00:22:03,240
else did you call it Hermes is the other

660
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,279
word I saw today if the plan is intersex

661
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:07,740
in any way it does not get used in a

662
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,658
breeding project because that intersect

663
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,179
straight will carry through into my

664
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:14,580
breathing and you guys do not deserve or

665
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,980
want intersex plants in your garden so I

666
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:19,379
eliminate those the female plants I'm

667
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:21,720
using in my feminized projects are

668
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,059
stress tested to a rigorous level they

669
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,579
are not intersex what I am doing is

670
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:28,019
spraying the plants with silver

671
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:30,298
thiosulfate what is happening is the

672
00:22:28,019 --> 00:22:32,339
thiosulfate is helping the silver enter

673
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,980
the plant and get into the plant system

674
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:37,199
that silver then disrupts the copper

675
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:39,720
movement in the plant that plant then

676
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,419
has an ethylene reaction which causes is

677
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:44,700
it to produce anthers which contain only

678
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:47,340
female pollen here's an important part

679
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,519
the pollen is only female pollen because

680
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:53,158
that plant is only a female it is not

681
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:56,099
intersex it is not a boy it is 100

682
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:58,260
percent a female so I'm taking a female

683
00:22:56,099 --> 00:23:00,719
plant and I'm doing science to it

684
00:22:58,259 --> 00:23:02,519
science magic and nature all meat I

685
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,220
treat it with the chemical that plant

686
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:07,500
then creates pollen sacs which only

687
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,298
contain female pollen there's no male

688
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,279
there's no intersex there's no

689
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:14,038
hermaphrodite those words are not

690
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,019
involved at all then I use that female

691
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:18,119
pollen from that tried true tested

692
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:20,400
female plant that's been reversed and I

693
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,139
put that on another tried true and

694
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,720
tested female maybe the same female

695
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:28,140
maybe a clone of the same female and we

696
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,298
make Femme seeds so that is my rant and

697
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,919
my disclaimer to get me started here to

698
00:23:30,298 --> 00:23:33,359
talk about your Femme seed project now

699
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,460
let's talk a little bit about more about

700
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:37,079
what you actually asked now for the sake

701
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,419
of this conversation I am going to

702
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:40,859
replace the word Herm with reverse

703
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:43,380
because that is what we are attempting

704
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:45,599
to do we want to reverse a plan we want

705
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,940
to turn it from a female into a pollen

706
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,859
donating female plant that is what we

707
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,620
call reversing it so let's talk about

708
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:54,178
that I only want to reverse is what

709
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:56,939
we're going to say so now it goes on it

710
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:59,880
says I only want to reverse one branch

711
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,159
of each plant not the entire plant I'm

712
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,200
not Crossing just pollinating the plants

713
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,400
themselves any advice would be awesome

714
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:08,159
if you already have an episode

715
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,360
discussing this I will check it out I

716
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,340
probably have done a full episode

717
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,500
talking about this but we're here let's

718
00:24:11,339 --> 00:24:15,119
talk about this the first thing that got

719
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,859
my attention is it sounds like you've

720
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:20,399
got multiple plants you want to work

721
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:23,719
with I highly very highly recommend you

722
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,759
only mess with one reversal at a time

723
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,220
pollen is microscopic pollen can travel

724
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:31,019
pollen can get from one reversed plant

725
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:32,940
over to the other reversed plant and

726
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:35,519
then we've got what I call a Mori Povich

727
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:37,500
situation who is the baby daddy was it

728
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:39,298
this plant or was it this plant we're

729
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:42,179
never gonna know so what I recommend is

730
00:24:39,298 --> 00:24:44,400
only one reversal at a time don't mess

731
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:46,320
this project up we want to know what

732
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,240
you've made you want to self this plan

733
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,519
is what you want to do you want to take

734
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,440
let me read and make sure yes so you've

735
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,298
got let's just say you've got this

736
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,340
doesn't exist don't get excited let's

737
00:24:54,298 --> 00:24:58,259
say you've got Golden Goat Autoflower

738
00:24:56,339 --> 00:25:00,418
plants you want to make Golden Goat

739
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:01,980
Autoflower plants what I would do now I

740
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,538
did also just come up with another catch

741
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:05,579
in my mind I'm not familiar with

742
00:25:03,538 --> 00:25:07,679
breeding with autoflowers so I'm not

743
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:10,259
exactly how this is going to work but in

744
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,640
your scenario if you want to self this

745
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,980
plant which is what you're doing you're

746
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,419
taking a hypothetically a Golden Goat

747
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,759
Autoflower and you want to make more

748
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,679
Golden Goat autoflowers since you've

749
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,960
only got the one plant you've got to

750
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:24,360
reverse part of that plant and pollinate

751
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:26,579
the other branch of that plant with the

752
00:25:24,359 --> 00:25:28,558
same pollen on the same plant otherwise

753
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:30,178
you've got to get more seeds and put

754
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,298
pollen from that plant onto another

755
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:35,640
plant but because you can't cut clones

756
00:25:33,298 --> 00:25:37,079
from the autoflowers I'm a little bit

757
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,538
confused when it comes to breeding with

758
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:41,579
autos because I don't ever do this

759
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:44,278
normally you would take one Auto reverse

760
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:46,079
it pollinate Autos other autos and that

761
00:25:44,278 --> 00:25:47,339
way you've got that pollen donor and you

762
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,240
can just pollinate all the others you

763
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:50,459
don't have to worry about cloning

764
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,980
anything but you've only got the one

765
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:55,319
plant so you're going to have to reverse

766
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,179
one branch or half of the plant and then

767
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:00,119
take that pollen and carefully apply it

768
00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:02,820
to the rest of the plant yes that should

769
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,278
work in theory notice I did say should

770
00:26:02,819 --> 00:26:07,980
let's talk about what happens sometimes

771
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,200
when you attempt to reverse a plant you

772
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,339
will spray just a couple of branches to

773
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,019
do what you're trying to do get some

774
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:15,720
pollen from one side to pollinate the

775
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:18,599
rest sometimes that works

776
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:20,700
sometimes it's perfect other times the

777
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:22,379
plant does not want to reverse the

778
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,058
hormones in that plant are so stubborn

779
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,740
that when you treat these few branches

780
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:27,359
the hormones from the other part of the

781
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,000
plant go nah we're not going to let it

782
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,678
reverse it's just so so dominant or so

783
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,720
powerful and who that plant is that

784
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,460
you're not going to change it then other

785
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,679
times we get the opposite you try to

786
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,778
reverse this one branch and the plants

787
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,460
just got those hormones and it goes

788
00:26:39,778 --> 00:26:44,339
watch me in the whole [ __ ] plant

789
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:46,440
reverses so you've got three options it

790
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:48,178
may work beautifully you may spray a

791
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:50,400
couple of branches and isolate those and

792
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:51,840
spray those and those will pollinate and

793
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,240
you may be able to pollinate the rest of

794
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,819
the plant or when you reverse that one

795
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,440
side the entire plant could reverse or

796
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:00,359
when you go to reverse that one side

797
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,519
nothing could happen so you got three

798
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:03,899
potential outcomes here like I said

799
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:05,759
normally if you're working with the

800
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:07,620
autoflowers you would reverse one full

801
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,419
plant and then use that as your pollen

802
00:27:07,619 --> 00:27:10,979
donor for multiple females so that's

803
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,720
going to be the catch here and like I

804
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,460
said I'm not an Autoflower breeder so

805
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,980
this is the the closest I can get you

806
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:18,659
with my experience with what I know what

807
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,519
I would recommend what you're going to

808
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:23,100
have to do probably to reach the goal

809
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,740
you want is grow that plant reverse it

810
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:27,480
pollinate reverse one-sided pollinate

811
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,220
that other side of that plant with that

812
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,900
plant there's going to be a lot of

813
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,778
obstacles I don't know the timing of

814
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,519
that most of the time I know I trigger

815
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:37,859
the flowering phase I spray the plant

816
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,500
before a flower and then I can spray it

817
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:42,418
at certain times during flour unless you

818
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,980
know how long that plant veggies or how

819
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,960
tall it gets before it goes into flour

820
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,278
it's going to be hard to anticipate when

821
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,798
to start spraying unless you spray

822
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:51,720
immediately when you see pre-flowers or

823
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:52,859
right when it goes into flour but it's

824
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:56,038
going to be a little bit challenging

825
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:57,658
your question and your plan will work

826
00:27:56,038 --> 00:28:00,480
but you're gonna have some obstacles

827
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:02,700
number one I recommend doing these two

828
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,720
plants separately the next catch is that

829
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,120
you're worth working with the

830
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,980
autoflowers you get one shot per seed at

831
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:10,079
this because you cannot clone it so

832
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:11,880
you've got to grow it reverse half of it

833
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,038
and successfully pollinate the other

834
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,559
side and you get one shot you get two

835
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:18,240
shots but man I hope this works out for

836
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,220
you let me make sure I'm answering the

837
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,440
question here I want to reverse only one

838
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:24,298
branch not the whole plant not Crossing

839
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,580
just pollinating themselves that should

840
00:28:24,298 --> 00:28:28,079
work that is the way to do that that

841
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,359
should work but like I said you got

842
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:31,859
three options for outcomes any advice

843
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:33,599
would be awesome if you already have

844
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,278
I've done an episode similar to this but

845
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:37,558
it is not about Autoflower so there's a

846
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:39,720
lot of new caveats and obstacles in here

847
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:40,980
I hope I've answered your question let

848
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,620
me give the disclaimer I'm not an

849
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:45,360
Autoflower grower or a breeder so I'm

850
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:47,278
just talking about the experience I

851
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:48,778
understand from photo period breeding

852
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,700
the hardest part is going to be the

853
00:28:48,778 --> 00:28:52,740
timing in my opinion knowing when to

854
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:55,740
start spraying if you use the silver

855
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:58,200
thiosulfate you've got to spray it one

856
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,880
time about a week before flower and then

857
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,679
day one of flower which how do you

858
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,940
determine that with an Autoflower just

859
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,200
kind of keep an eye on it and I guess

860
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,538
you get to decide when that happens

861
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,179
right but you got to spray it the day

862
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:11,460
one day three six nine twelve fifteen

863
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,200
eighteen and twenty one it's going to be

864
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,700
challenging to time that there is

865
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,319
another spray out there I cannot think

866
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,880
of the name of it I have not tried it

867
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,519
but they claim

868
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,899
that you can spray a plant one time and

869
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:24,000
it will reverse the plant so maybe

870
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:26,519
that's something worth looking into it

871
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,259
is quite expensive but if it does what

872
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:29,879
you need done I've never thought of an

873
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:32,339
instance where that spray would be worth

874
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:34,620
the money suddenly this may be the

875
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:37,199
appropriate application all right my

876
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:38,519
dude flaccid Jack that's a great name I

877
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,038
hope you're able to solve the flaccid

878
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,259
problem I hope I helped you out making

879
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,298
some Autoflower seeds if you've got

880
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:47,460
follow-up questions dude please do reach

881
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:49,079
out because like I said I'm not an auto

882
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,120
flower breeder so there are some things

883
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,859
I'm going to miss in this question if

884
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,139

885
