genetics.com make sure you go to iry

30
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:23,599
genetics.com there's a row of tabs on

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,159
the top one of them says questions or

32
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,158
growel click on that tab there will be a

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,079
few preliminary questions we will ask

34
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,680
what type of question do you have is it

35
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:33,839
a garden question is it a general

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,680
question if it's a grow question we will

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,118
then ask about the the temperature the

38
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,840
humidity indoors Outdoors basic

39
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:42,118
questions to give me an idea of how to

40
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,118
help this grow question then most

41
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,359
importantly we give you a space to ask

42
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:48,560
your grow question send me those grow

grown out the Golden Goat batross and

59
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,959
the Scarlet Bonas and even though I made

60
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,199
some really big mistakes the plants were

61
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,400
some of the best I have ever grown that

62
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,759
is a huge compliment to my genetics uh

63
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,640
you would aded that you made a few

64
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:34,598
mistakes and they were still some of the

65
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,518
best that you've ever grown uh good job

66

69
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:43,359
hard part for a lot of people to do so

subcool and myself are the two guys

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,959
teaching you and inspiring you to breed

102
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:50,798
and that you want to use my uh Jack the

103
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,560
Ripper f2s which maybe some people don't

104
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,519
know that Jack the Ripper was originally

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,360
made by subol I was given uh honor and

106
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,200
Blessing by his uh former partner and uh

107
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,720
what's the word there his X wife Miss

00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,438
that Jack the Ripper in a breeding

110
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,598
project I've made f2s of it I've also

111
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:11,400
made a lot of outcrosses with it but our

112
00:04:08,598 --> 00:04:14,078
friend Brian ja here has chosen the Jack

113
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,478
the Ripper F2 number five phenotype to

114
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:18,199
make his very first breeding project

115
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,959
with because he learned a lot of what he

116
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,560
knows from sub cool and I that's a huge

117
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,439
honor uh to sub and myself so thank you

118
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,720
now let let me get myself back on track

119
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:30,759
it says my goal is to grow plants with

120
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:33,360
the strongest smell and taste possible

121
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,639
that is a very good goal um and I'm not

122
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,360
going to critique you here this is your

123
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,079
very first breeding project you're

124
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,840
inspired you're looking for uh the

125
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,079
strongest smell which of course is what

126
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,599
everybody wants and taste possible we

127
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,079
all want that smell and taste but what

128
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,639
about uh things like potency what about

129
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:51,879
plant Vigor what about structure uh what

130
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,800
about resistance to problems like

131
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:56,519
pathogens and maybe bugs what about

132
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,280
resistance to Drought what about the

133
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:01,038
ability to tolerate light stress or cold

134
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,478
stress press those are just other things

135
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:06,599
I would recommend you also add to the

136
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:08,159
requirement list here if you don't know

137
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,520
about all the positive traits that you

138
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,039
should be looking for in a plant you

139
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:13,319
might not look for them so I just want

140
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,719
to remind you that it is awesome to

141
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:18,279
breed for that Aroma and flavor but what

142
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,039
about Vigor what about plant structure

143
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:21,799
uh what about potency those are also

144
00:05:20,038 --> 00:05:23,680
things to consider this is your breeding

145
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,960
project you can do whatever you want I

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,079
just want to throw some ideas at you

147
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,918
because you're new I'm not discouraging

148
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:31,599
um focus on that smell and taste if

149
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,198
that's what you'd like to do but also

150
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,479
keep in mind those other things I

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,680
mentioned structure growth flowering

152
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:39,439
time what if these plants take 140 days

153
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,439
to flower but they taste exactly how you

154
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,279
like is that tolerable most people

155
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,879
wouldn't accept that so just things to

156
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,959
think about there other than just taste

157
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,079
and aroma so it says knowing that is

158
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:52,038
there a male I should look for that will

159
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,959
fit these characteristics that you that

160
00:05:52,038 --> 00:05:58,478
you can talk about in the description

161
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,239
now um unfortunately the hard part about

162
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,120
seeking a male is that the only way to

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,000
truly tell what flavor and Aroma that

164
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,038
male plant is going to pass to the

165
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,639
progyny is by breeding with him um so

166
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:10,879
you've got to find a male we'll talk

167
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,319
about that a little bit more in here I

168
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,240
do have some criteria for helping you

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,240
find a male but you've got to find a

170
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,038
male then what you also got to do is

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,478
you've got to find the female is there a

172
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:23,240
female plant that tastes very close or

173
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,000
exactly like what you're looking for is

174
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:27,000
that female plant available the first

175
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,560
part of this is to find that girl that

176
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,319
tastes very much like that uh the flavor

177
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,918
that you're seeking so find that female

178
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,840
plant then find a male now a moment ago

179
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,598
I talked about structure and vigor and

180
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:39,799
all that let me refer to my notes here

181
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:42,360
because I did make a couple of notes

182
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,038
that are very important in my opinion in

183
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,840
my experience in my reading from what I

184
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,079
understand to the best of my knowledge

185
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:52,638
but I am not an expert um generally in

186
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,240
most instances that male plant the male

187
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,918
part of the uh the the program here the

188
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,478
mail plant of the equation is the word

189
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:02,639
I'm looking for contributes to the

190
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:05,719
structure the Vigor and the flowering

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,360
time heavily and the pest and pathogen

192
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:09,560
resistance a lot of that stuff comes

193
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,720
from the male side of the equation so

194
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:13,319
select a male and my what I would

195
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,800
recommend is find a female that's got

196
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,280
the flavor if you're just breeding for

197
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,879
flavor find a female plant with the

198
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,719
exact flavor you're looking for then

199
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:24,120
find a male from the Jack the Jack the

200
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,560
Ripper line that has structure that has

201
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,280
Vigor that's got all of the physical or

202
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,439
all of the visual things that you can

203
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,519
see find that from the male plant

204
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,560
because what I think what I believe is

205
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,680
the male contributes heavily heavily

206
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,759
heavily to the structure the Vigor the

207
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:41,879
flowering time um and the pest and

208
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,759
pathogen and stress resistance a lot of

209
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,319
that will come from the male so if you

210
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,759
insist on going mostly for flavor find a

211
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,879
girl that tastes real good CU we can

212
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,639
already verify that she's got that

213
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,479
Flavor now look for that male that has

214
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,360
the structure you like then like I keep

215
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:59,120
saying also look for that female with

216
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,360
the flavor and Aroma then breed them

217
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
together together and then you're going

218
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,840
to find a phenotype out of there that

219
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,319
will carry that structure that Vigor

220
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,439
that plant growth traits that you're

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,199
looking for and it will also have that

222
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,839
flavor and Aroma because it's already in

223
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,520
there it's an ingredient we've mixed

224
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,918
that in we've stirred it up some of the

225
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,519
phenotypes that come from this will have

226
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:20,120
that flavor guaranteed now if you really

227
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:23,560
want to lock that in if you want to do

228
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:25,158
this um you said knowing that uh you

229
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,639
asked about a male I'm going to totally

230
00:08:25,158 --> 00:08:29,279
throw you off track you could do

231
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,759
feminized seeds if you find a girl a

232
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,038
female plant that's got the traits that

233
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,200
you're in love with you could easily

234
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,080
reverse that plant uh take two clones of

235
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,800
it reverse one put that pollen on the

236
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,599
other and make feminized seeds of that

237
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,639
plant if that is what you wanted to do

238
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,959
if you're going strictly for flavor but

239
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,240
I like your idea uh you're going to it

240
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:49,439
sounds like you plan to start with a

241
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,278
male and a female which would be awesome

242
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,720
so like I've said multiple times now

243
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,759
find the female that tastes just like

244
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,240
what you're looking for find a male with

245
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,879
the structure the Vigor um a good

246
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,000
growing male you'll know it when you see

247
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,519
it um subcool taught me this and I'm

248
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,320
going to pass this knowledge on to you

249
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,879
at the same time um most of the let's

250
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,600
just hypothetically say you've got a 10

251
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,039
pack of seeds usually there's 10 seeds

252
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,000
in my 10 packs there's usually 12 so you

253
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,159
got probably 10 of them worked for you

254
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,360
just because you might be a new grower

255
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,159
I'm just making assumptions here we're

256
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,560
just doing math out of the air you got

257
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:22,000
10 seeds most of the time five of them

258
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:23,838
will be female five will be male um the

259
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,039
females are easy to select from because

260
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,760
we can um we get to experience them we

261
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:29,719
get to grow them smell them touch them

262
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,399
smoke them consume them get high from

263
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,560
them and enjoy them the females will be

264
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:35,240
obvious which one you want the males we

265
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:37,000
don't necessarily get to smoke we don't

266
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,639
get to consume but the females are

267
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,679
easier to feno hunt here's how I kind of

268
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:43,679
do the boys we got five boys generally

269
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,319
there will be one or two that take off

270
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,719
flowering very early uh they're just

271
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,839
like hey look at me I'm a boy I want a

272
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,879
flower I'm going to get ahead of

273
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,000
everybody I'm going to grow bigger I'm

274
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:54,799
going to start making pollen those two

275
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,399
boys in that pack usually do not get to

276
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,240
be my breeding candidates and I'll

277
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,039
explain why from what subcool taught me

278
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,320
and from what I understand from my own

279
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,799
experience from using Subs guidance I

280
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,079
have learned an experience that those

281
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:09,759
males that flower too quickly that are

282
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:12,439
too eager to flower they pass too much

283
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,559
of themselves to my breeding project now

284
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:16,040
what I mean by that is if I take a male

285
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,159
I'm just going to pick something random

286
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,078
here I'm going to say chocolate if I

287
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,480
took a meil that is chocolate and I

288
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:26,039
pollinated strawberry banana lemons and

289
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,720
gas I want chocolate strawberry

290
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,319
chocolate lemons chocolate banana and

291
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,120
chocolate gas is what I hope to get out

292
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,720
of that if I use that first dude he will

293
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,240
make everything taste like chocolate I

294
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,680
just remake this dude all over again

295
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,799
because his genetics are so dominant are

296
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,719
so strong in this mix that all of his

297
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,519
kids look just like him mommy has no

298
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,839
chance of getting a daughter that looks

299
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,039
just like her it's all going to be a

300
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,600
bunch of [ __ ] Beefcake looking dudes

301
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,120
look just like this uh over testosteron

302
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,000
male that's the way that I can explain

303
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,360
it to you so those first two are usually

304
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,360
not the candidates the fifth one he's

305
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,680
taking too long to flower usually not

306
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,639
the candidate so it's usually the third

307
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:06,519
and fourth male in the mix to show me

308
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,519
that they're male usually one of them's

309
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,919
a little taller one of them's a little

310
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,399
different shaped that's what you're

311
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:13,360
going to usually that's what I choose

312
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,679
from is males number three and four out

313
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,720
of those five so the first two that take

314
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,719
off I don't like those the last one to

315
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,720
take off he's usually too slow it's

316
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,079
usually number three or number four

317
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,639
you'll have to decide do you want that

318
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:26,078
tall lanky one do you want the short

319
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,480
squatty one do you want the one with the

320
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,799
big wide leaves what I what I would

321
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,440
recommend is flower all five of them out

322
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,639
as far as you can if you can take them

323
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,079
to like week six week seven week eight

324
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,440
you'll get to see what type of flower

325
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:40,599
structure they develop you'll get to see

326
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,200
that big old flower cluster on the top

327
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,278
it is really fun and interesting

328
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,519
watching flowers on male plants develop

329
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:47,480
they're going to make a [ __ ] ton of

330
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,720
pollen so be careful if you've got other

331
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,920
rooms in flower try not to contaminate

332
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,720
those rooms with pollen but doing a male

333
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,360
phenol Hunt is very fun and very

334
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,120
rewarding if you've got the space and

335
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,720
time so flower out those boys look for

336
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,480
like I said remove one and two you'll

337
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,800
know they'll go into flower early one's

338
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,920
going to get way tall uh call those guys

339
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,319
three four and five keep an eye on those

340
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,039
numbers three and four those are going

341
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,320
to be your candidates out of a 10 pack

342
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:13,759
that is my experience so I've been

343
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,720
rambling for a couple of minutes about

344
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,679
that part find that good male that

345
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,879
provides that structure then we've got

346
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:22,359
to pollinate with him and like I said

347
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,600
before my goal in selecting a male is to

348
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:26,120
find a male that's going to put

349
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,519
chocolate or whatever selected flavor

350
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,519
into the mix so that I can make

351
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,639
chocolate strawberry chocolate but an I

352
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,440
don't want that dude that's just going

353
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,360
to dominate and those later flowering

354
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,680
guys they're not so dominant in their

355
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,919
genetics that when you breed to them

356
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,838
they're going to allow their qualities

357
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,078
their traits to pass into the progyny

358
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,760
but also Mommy gets a chance to show her

359
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,479
beauty and her expression in the

360
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,879
breeding as well let me get back to my

361
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,839
notes because I've gotten way off track

362
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,679
although I'm right where I need to be um

363
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,920
pollinate your favorite female and then

364
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,719
I put in parenthesis females something I

365
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,319
like to do I keep saying this when I'm

366
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,839
breeding with the male plant I just said

367
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,440
to take that chocolate and put it to

368
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,000
Strawberry bananas [ __ ] pineapples

369
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,560
watermelons breed it to everything the

370
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,600
reason I want to do that the reason I

371
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:11,119
recommended breeding your male plant to

372
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:14,159
multiple female plants different females

373
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,440
if you can um is because here's here's a

374
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,198
reason I want to see what he presents

375
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:21,440
and delivers and across across multiple

376
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:23,559
plants if I breed uh chocolate to

377
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,800
bananas and it comes out chocolate

378
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:27,799
bananas I know that these two plants

379
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:29,679
make chocolate bananas it doesn't give

380
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:31,278
me any evidence it doesn't give me any

381
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,000
it just gives me what these two plants

382
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,600
do if I breed that to strawberry and

383
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,919
lemon and one comes out chocolate

384
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,159
strawberry now I know that it delivers

385
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:42,879
that chocolate trait if the chocolate

386
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:44,399
and the banana plant both or the

387
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,240
strawberry and banana plant that I Brad

388
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,000
it to make progyny that are both uh

389
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,079
really really tall then I know that that

390
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,679
trait came from the mail plant if the

391
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:55,919
progyny uh come out with like a really

392
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,399
weird color across three different

393
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,198
progyny then I know that the male is

394
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:01,120
delivering that cuz that's the common it

395
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,359
in the mix so that's why I like to breed

396
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,720
to multiple different females from one

397
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,440
male plant now here's another option and

398
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,199
I'm going to [ __ ] with your head here uh

399
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,720
I'm assuming you've got a 10 pack of the

400
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,799
Jack the Ripper uh number five plants

401
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,320
one thing you could do which would be a

402
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,879
lot of fun and you will find the

403
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,199
phenotype that's got the flavor that

404
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:21,679
you're looking for you could put all 10

405
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,679
of those plants in a room all five boys

406
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,799
all five girls and you could just let a

407
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,879
wild crazy plant orgy happen in that

408
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,198
room and what that is called is an open

409
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,720
pollination

410
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,039
um if you were going to list that on

411
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,720
paper to describe it you would just say

412
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,719
uh five Jack the Ripper females cross to

413
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,600
five Jack the Ripper males and an open

414
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,480
pollination uh there are several good

415
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,079
reasons to do that uh it just makes a

416
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,320
lot more seeds if you want to preserve

417
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:48,359
this line and make a bunch more seeds

418
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:49,879
this will show you so many of uh the

419
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,759
genetic options this will show the

420
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:54,000
genetic potential in so many different

421
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,919
ways because you've got every male and

422
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
every female phenotype available for the

423
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,278
mix they're all going to pollinate each

424
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,880
other I don't know the mathematical

425
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:04,159
equation but uh it's 5 million something

426
00:15:01,879 --> 00:15:06,360
or 250 million something is the way that

427
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,399
I think it would work if you took uh

428
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:10,399
plant number one and pollinated all five

429
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,399
of these that's five plants right and

430
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,278
then plant number two and pollinated all

431
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
five of these and you can do that that's

432
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:17,720
how it will work all five plants will

433
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,639
pollinate all five other plants you'll

434
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,160
have lines going to be String Theory all

435
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,039
crazy going from one plant to the other

436
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,480
but that is a possibility that open

437
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,039
pollination or you can remove anything

438
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,600
you don't like and still perform the

439
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,519
open pollin I'm just giving you

440
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,199
different ideas the first thing I would

441
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,198
do is find the female that tastes like

442
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,439
what you like find a male with the

443
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:39,519
structure the Vigor uh the leaf shape

444
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,120
the flowering time that you're into then

445
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,198
I would breed them then I would grow out

446
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,159
those seeds then I would try to find the

447
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,198
phenotype that tastes just like you're

448
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:49,360
looking for if you're satisfied with

449
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,919
that guess what Tada that is your first

450
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,600
breeding project and it is successful if

451
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,759
you find the phenotype your goal is to

452
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,920
find the fenal with your flavor desired

453
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,680
if you find that you have hit your goal

454
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,078
I would try to go for further

455
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,159
Generations uh this is a really fun idea

456
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:07,719
but if you were breeding strictly for

457
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,360
flavor um that's fun but what about

458
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,839
potency don't you want to get really

459
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,600
really high from it also so what I would

460
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,920
do is it's going to get you really high

461
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,079
it's Jack the Ripper it's going to have

462
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:18,278
the potency but if you're breeding

463
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,758
strictly for flavor think about it like

464
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,278
when we were building uh characters on a

465
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:24,959
video game they gave you a 100 points to

466
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,039
build your character we're just going to

467
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,559
say it was a basketball video game uh

468
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,759
you got some speed was one of the

469
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:34,719
attributes you got uh shooting accuracy

470
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,919
uh you got awareness uh you got stamina

471
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,160
and then there's probably something else

472
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:41,240
um who cares what it is right ability to

473
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,439
sell sneakers so you got all five of

474
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,519
these things you got to fill them up

475
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,519
with as much uh as much as you want but

476
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:48,360
you've only got a 100 points to put into

477
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,120
there so think about that the same thing

478
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,600
happens when we are breeding plants

479
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,799
you've got 100 points worth of

480
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,879
attributes to assign if you focus 90% of

481
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,399
that on Flavor the potency the Vigor all

482
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:02,198
that other stuff is going to fall to the

483
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:04,359
waist side so keep flavor and Aroma up

484
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:05,879
there real high as your importance but

485
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:08,558
also keep in mind that we need some

486
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,079
potency so um if you do insist on

487
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:13,240
breeding one plant strictly for flavor

488
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:14,519
what I would also do now this is where

489
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,480
it's going to get really interesting now

490
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,759
we're going to talk about line breeding

491
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,640
what the heck is line breeding you've

492
00:17:18,759 --> 00:17:23,359
got your we're going to breed two

493
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,360
different lines of the same plants I'm

494
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,678
going to breed a Jack the Ripper uh F2

495
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,000
from you've got F2 so you're going to

496
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,200
breed F3

497
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,480
you're going to make the Jack the Ripper

498
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,240
F3 you're going to select for flavor

499
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,360
only just select for flavor then from

500
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,480
those f3s we're going to find those

501
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,119
seeds and select for flavor and make F4

502
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:46,759
from that batch of seeds we're then

503
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:49,079
going to make F5 Now by this time every

504
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:52,798
time we grow these seeds we should find

505
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:56,038
that exact same flavor every time almost

506
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,240
every plant 89 95% of these plants

507
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,440
should taste exactly the same just like

508
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,759
we we talked about just like you're

509
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,360
searching for because this is the fifth

510
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,720
generation that we have bred well you

511
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,839
got them at f2 this is the third or

512
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,919
fourth generation you've bred

513
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:10,839
specifically for that one specific

514
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:12,480
flavor if it didn't have that Aroma and

515
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,839
flavor you did not breed to it it got

516
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,839
knocked out it got pushed away out of

517
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,359
the breeding project we've gone five

518
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,480
generations locking down this Flavor now

519
00:18:18,359 --> 00:18:22,839
what I would also do at the same exact

520
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,200
time I would run a parallel breeding

521
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:27,839
project of Jack the Ripper I would start

522
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,759
with the same exact seeds but on this

523
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:34,798
side I would breed for potency and uh

524
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:36,640
Vigor cuz I want a vigorous plant I want

525
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:39,119
a potent plant and a plant that tastes

526
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,159
good so we're going to focus line one is

527
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,199
Jack the Ripper flavor Town that's all

528
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,919
we're working on then on this other side

529
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,000
in this other breeding room I'm going to

530
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,200
breed a Jack the Ripper that is nothing

531
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,159
but potency and vigor I don't care what

532
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,558
it tastes like I don't care it could

533
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:55,480
taste like cardboard it could tastes

534
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:58,119
like dog puke as long it as long as it

535
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,240
is the most potent plant in the room and

536
00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:01,798
it is vigorous when it grows that is

537
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,038
what I'm breeding for so I'm going to do

538
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:07,639
that F3 F4 F5 I may go to F6 on both

539
00:19:06,038 --> 00:19:09,158
sides it just kind of depends on what

540
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,000
the phenotypes are showing me at this

541
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:15,200
point now on both sides when I germinate

542
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,240
these seeds I'm getting 89 to 95%

543
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,480
homozygous plants which means they all

544
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,400
look exactly the same on this side

545
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,200
they're all going to smell exactly like

546
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,038
that one Aroma that I'm going for that

547
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,120
Jack the Ripper lime turp that I found

548
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,879
that I'm in love with I've got it locked

549
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:30,918
in every phenotype makes it on this

550
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,960
other side every phenotype is

551
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,600
ridiculously potent and it's got an

552
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,440
amazing structure now guess what we're

553
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:39,119
going to do we're going to breed those

554
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,759
two together and that's going to be our

555
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,038
true F1 breeding project that could take

556
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,759
you 15 years to accomplish that to be

557
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:47,798
realistic with you don't rush that

558
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,839
project don't be in a hurry to do it but

559
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:52,279
to get to F5 F6 that's five or six years

560
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:53,798
worth of work right there if you do it

561
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:55,279
properly and then you got to do it on

562
00:19:53,798 --> 00:19:57,240
two different sides on two different

563
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,879
lines you got to carefully

564
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,000
select at some point in that breeding

565
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,080
project there will be a misstep and you

566
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,240
will have to go backwards one generation

567
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,519
it happens don't be afraid that happens

568
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,640
when you're breeding you think this is

569
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,079
the male I need to use you do it and you

570
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,320
grow them out and you go well [ __ ] I

571
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:14,038
didn't find what I'm looking for in

572
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,319
there you just chose the wrong male not

573
00:20:14,038 --> 00:20:17,640
a big deal just time space money you

574
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,119
still get to smoke all the weed and have

575
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:21,159
a good time but the breeding didn't make

576
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,558
any forward progress got to go back and

577
00:20:21,159 --> 00:20:25,919
do it again so what I'm talking about

578
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:27,678
here is line breeding your first idea is

579
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,000
to create a strain that is completely

580
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,559
flavored town now I want to add to that

581
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,640
I want Vigor and potency so I'm going to

582
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:35,599
use the same genetics and just keep

583
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,400
going in filial generations and breeding

584
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:41,158
again a different project um either line

585
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,000
a or line b line one line two flavor

586
00:20:41,159 --> 00:20:45,000
town and [ __ ] Tricom Town whatever

587
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,038
you want to call them just keep breeding

588
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,519
and then make this one only focused on

589
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,440
potency and structure and vigor and this

590
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:53,918
other one is just focused on Flavor then

591
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,240
when I get to the F5 or F6 I'll get the

592
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,280
female that has the flavor and the male

593
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,880
I'll find a male uh phenotype from from

594
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:02,319
that Pro from that uh population of

595
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,600
seeds that looks just like what I need

596
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,759
that structure I'm sure it's going to

597
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,959
pass on that potency pollinate that

598
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:11,278
flavor toown female and The Offspring

599
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,600
from that will be the Super vigorous the

600
00:21:11,278 --> 00:21:17,359
super flavorful and the super potent

601
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,359
brand new F1 version of your line and

602
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,439
guess what also comes with that brand

603
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,798
new hybrid Vigor so that is a huge fun

604
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,120
project that is something that you could

605
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:28,158
definitely do um I may have taken this

606
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:30,719
simple answer way too far but this is a

607
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,278
really fun ramble um the easy way to do

608
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,240
it is to find that male that fits an

609
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:36,558
easy criteria find a female that tastes

610
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,440
good let them [ __ ] if you want to go

611
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,000
further I definitely give you a lot of

612
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,038
different Avenues to have fun with that

613

00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:45,599
answered your question this was a fun

615
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:47,158
breeding question for me I got to talk

616
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,319

idirect tocom pegasus's question goes

641
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:44,640
just like this it says yo what's up

642
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,000
rosta Jeff yo what's up Pegasus it says

643
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:50,360
I have a question about breeding that is

644
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,480
very good this is the breeding episode

645
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,678
it says let's just say if I were to

646
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,240
breed a male arise plant with a female

647
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:00,640
Afterglow would The Offspring be in

648
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,159
different if I had used the opposite

649
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,278
plants the female arise and the male

650
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:08,640
Afterglow much thanks and keep on

651
00:23:06,278 --> 00:23:12,119
growing yes this is a very good question

652
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:15,320
and ironically um I made Afterglow which

653
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:18,278
is uh Clementine to aise which is a huge

654
00:23:15,319 --> 00:23:20,278
hit it kills it but then also uh I put

655
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:23,240
that Afterglow plant in a greenhouse and

656
00:23:20,278 --> 00:23:24,919
pollinated that with the arise again so

657
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,200
the first half of this has happened

658
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,159
which is really weird that you brought

659
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,919
that up uh my idea there was to uh put a

660
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:32,600
little more power into the Afterglow

661
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,759
just a little more turbocharge but also

662
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:36,558
try to keep that orange turp uh it seems

663
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:39,359
to have worked I'm rambling at this

664
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,278
point let's answer the question at hand

665
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,558
here like I talked about just a moment

666
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:45,599
ago it is my belief my experience my

667
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:48,240
theory that much of that flavor and

668
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:49,879
Aroma is coming from the female side

669
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,519
many of the other traits do come from

670
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,880
the female side but is real what is

671
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:55,918
really noticeable is the flavor and the

672
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:58,120
aroma then what I think happens from the

673
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,159
male side like I said is that vigor the

674
00:23:58,119 --> 00:24:01,918
structure the plant uh the flowering

675
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,159
time is heavily contributed by the male

676
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,480
I think the resistance to problems comes

677
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,520
from the male side so yes if you did

678
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,558
switch them you're just automatically

679
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:12,278
going to get different traits just and

680
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,558
the main thing that came to my mind is

681
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:18,240
knowing about breeding they're different

682
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:19,960
phenotypes um even if so the male the

683
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,720
male version of a rise and the female

684
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,038
version of a rise you may select

685
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,278
different phenotypes they're going to

686
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,839
have different traits within themselves

687
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:29,759
uh so that already starts us doing uh

688
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,480
different uh opportunities in the

689
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,640
progeny so um yes I do believe if you

690
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,839
reverse them um you're going to change

691
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,559
something definitely uh it's like I

692
00:24:36,839 --> 00:24:40,720
believe kind of when you're breeding you

693
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:43,119
taking traits from chromosomes the

694
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,159
traits from Mom traits chromosomes from

695
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,959
Dad and you're putting them into a

696
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:48,159
whatever a primordial blender and you

697
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,159
shake it up and however those

698
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,120
chromosomes and traits all land that's

699
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,799
what you get I feel like it's going to

700
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,599
land differently uh you're more uh

701
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,440
predisposition to get certain outcomes

702
00:24:56,599 --> 00:25:00,558
if the male and female are are certain

703
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,480
variants I have no scientific evidence

704
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,639
to back that up that is just it's got to

705
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,159
be different how it would not be science

706
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,720
would science in nature together would

707
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,080
not make that come out the same and I

708
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,120
believe that without any real I don't

709
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:14,119
have any science to back up that claim

710
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:15,558
but that just makes sense to me um let

711
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:16,879
me get myself back on track here the

712
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:19,038
different phenotypes yeah you've got

713
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,039
different phenotypes um if you took the

714
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:25,119
Afterglow female um and a aise male and

715
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:26,440
then you did that work then you tried to

716
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,798
switch that around are you going to find

717
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,720
phenotypes that looked just like the

718
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,359
Opposites like the male that looks just

719
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,079
like the I think you understand what I'm

720
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,119
saying that would be the challenge there

721
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,918
just that phenotypical variation is

722
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:41,038
going to be enough to cause variation in

723
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:42,559
the different breeding projects so

724
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:43,839
basically you're just reshuffling the

725
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,319
deck and just putting all the black

726
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,119
cards in one spot and all the red cards

727
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:48,759
in another spot and we're just

728
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,239
reshuffling and we're going to get

729
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:52,759
different outcomes in my opinion so I

730
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,278
think I covered that question quite

731
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,319
thoroughly I got to Branch off of the

732
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:57,798
