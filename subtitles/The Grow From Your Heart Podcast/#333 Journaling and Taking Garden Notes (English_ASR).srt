00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:20,049
dad and on today it is 7:10 so I've been

37
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:22,090
dabbing on a little bit of everything I

38
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:24,460
started off with some East Coast

39
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,719
strawberries ambrosia I had a little bit

40
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:29,199
of Holy Grail batter

41
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:31,780
I've had some Durban Kush sauce and now

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,510
I'm dabbing some clementine ambrosia

43
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,689
sauce with gigantic crystals gigantic

44
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,760
chunks in here it just smells like a big

45
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:42,099
bag of fresh clementines or some orange

46
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,290
candies it's got a really juicy wet

47
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:45,789
smell to it it smells amazing you can

48
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,130
smell it from several inches away from

49
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,770
your face this jar is quite Turkey it's

50
00:01:48,129 --> 00:01:52,810
a a nice sized jar it smells delicious

51
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:54,908
and the dabs just taste incredible the

52
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:56,260
flavor doesn't go away when you take a

53
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:57,939
dab of the Clementine you can take a

54
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:59,290
drink of water five or ten minutes later

55
00:01:57,938 --> 00:02:01,209
and it kind of reactivates the

56
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:04,150
Clementine flavor in your mouth it is

57
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:05,500
delicious so that's my 7/10 that's what

00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,379
episode of the podcast is going to be

167
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,389
about keeping a journal for your

168
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:42,310
cannabis grow keeping notes keeping

169
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:45,339
track of what you've done and having

170
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:47,110
sort of a notebook to look back through

171
00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:48,599
when something goes right or something

172
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:52,870
goes wrong so let's talk about

173
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:54,910
journaling your cannabis grow now before

174
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,850
we talk about keeping notes and taking a

175
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:01,450
journal for your grow let me say that I

176
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:03,790
can't promote people growing cannabis in

177
00:06:01,449 --> 00:06:06,189
illegal places if it's illegal for you

178
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:08,530
to grow maybe you shouldn't be doing

179
00:06:06,189 --> 00:06:11,410
that where you are I can't advocate that

180
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:14,529
legally I've got to say if it's illegal

181
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,750
don't do it but if you insist on growing

182
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,879
cannabis in an illegal place

183
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,860
maybe you shouldn't keep as careful

184
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,589
notes as the people in Colorado and

185
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,580
California and other legal locations are

186
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:28,989
going to keep maybe you're keeping

187
00:06:26,579 --> 00:06:30,939
incriminating evidence maybe you want to

188
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,889
skip keeping a journal maybe you want to

189
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:36,639
create a Google Doc and use code words

190
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:38,500
or something maybe you don't want to

191
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,959
have this evidence laying around but

192
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,759
like I said before I don't promote you

193
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,849
growing

194
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,370
illegal area so that's something to

195
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,920
think about now with that being said if

196
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:51,990
you live in a location where it is legal

197
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:54,150
to grow and produce cannabis take

198
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:57,329
excessive notes write everything down

199
00:06:54,149 --> 00:06:59,009
because those notes will come to use in

200
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:01,469
the future now before we start talking

201
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,629
about taking notes let's talk about the

202
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,340
actual journal I'm not too picky about

203
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:07,019
what kind of journal you use I've got a

204
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,339
large notebook here a college rule

205
00:07:07,019 --> 00:07:10,769
notebook on the table this is what I

206
00:07:08,339 --> 00:07:13,019
take notes in for the podcast this would

207
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:14,519
work fine as a journal open it up start

208
00:07:13,019 --> 00:07:16,049
writing in it whatever you do in your

209
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,909
garden write it down we're gonna talk

210
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,199
more about what to write down it doesn't

211
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,150
have to be broken down into categories

212
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,860
it doesn't have to be looking like

213
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,019
homework just write down what you do

214
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,120
just open up the notebook write the date

215
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:29,099
right what phase of the girl you're in

216
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,660
maybe write this stream of plants may be

217
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,460
on the front page write a paragraph if

218
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,990
you feel like like how many plants

219
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,149
you've got how many lies to run and just

220
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:37,560
right just right in there then turn the

221
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:39,959
next page and when you go in the garden

222
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,459
write down what you do today I did this

223
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,250
and then just write that [ __ ] down

224
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:46,169
you'll start designing your journal the

225
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,120
way you want it over time it will morph

226
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:49,500
into what you want it to be so I've got

227
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,180
this College rule notebook here also

228
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,889
next to me that I've got another little

229
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:54,900
side project two notes going on it's

230
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:56,310
just a little tiny nine and a half by

231
00:07:54,899 --> 00:07:58,169
six inch notebook it's a smaller

232
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,319
notebook that would work just fine for a

233
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:03,480
grow journal I've seen guys use little

234
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:06,029
tiny flip books little notebooks I've

235
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:08,100
seen guys use fancy binder notebooks or

236
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:10,109
you don't have to even use paper you can

237
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,060
use a Google Doc if you want you can use

238
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,520
the note application in your phone if

239
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:16,350
you'd like I would write rather cuu

240
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,060
something that can't get lost that note

241
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,650
application you can delete that that's

242
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,480
gone once you delete that he [ __ ] up

243
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:23,969
it's gone forever have something maybe a

244
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,410
hard copy you can hold on to I like that

245
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,210
better but like I said if you're in a

246
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,860
legal place that becomes evidence in the

247
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:30,930
worst case scenario so if you need a

248
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,099
digital copy that's the way to do it

249
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,870
something you could delete really

250
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,669
quickly if you need to that may be key

251
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,490
something that's password-protected if

252
00:08:35,668 --> 00:08:39,990
you need to anyway keep a journal it

253
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,629
doesn't matter how the journal is kept

254
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,669
something that works for you all of our

255
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:46,289
brains work differently all of us set up

256
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:47,759
our thoughts and projects differently as

257
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:49,620
long as you're taking notes and keeping

258
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:51,659
track of things you were journaling and

259
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,970
it doesn't matter how it's done as long

260
00:08:51,659 --> 00:08:55,409
as you can read that [ __ ] don't scribble

261
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,690
down a note thinking your cue

262
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:00,208
writing just some quick shorthand stuff

263
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,980
seven initial letters and then a number

264
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:03,689
and then milliliters next to it and

265
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,028
you're gonna come back here you cannot

266
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:07,829
even write like write clearly write

267
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:09,149
legibly right what you're talking about

268
00:09:07,828 --> 00:09:10,828
and then when you go back to read those

269
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:12,778
notes in the future you'll be able to

270
00:09:10,828 --> 00:09:14,429
repeat what you did before and you'll

271
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:17,578
have a repeatable outcome it won't be a

272
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:19,438
guessing game so keep a simple journal

273
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:21,028
keep a detailed journal as long as

274
00:09:19,438 --> 00:09:23,009
you're keeping a journal on either paper

275
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,198
or digitally I'm happy now let's

276
00:09:23,009 --> 00:09:26,669
actually talk about journaling let's

277
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:27,208
talk about the advantage of keeping

278
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:28,769
notes

279
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:31,619
what is the advantage why do I want to

280
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,990
write this stuff down there are several

281
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,629
advantages to keeping a grou journal and

282
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,459
keeping grou notes one of the biggest

283
00:09:36,629 --> 00:09:40,170
advantages is let's say we're trying to

284
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:41,669
dial in a new nutrient system I've been

285
00:09:40,169 --> 00:09:43,289
trying to get everybody addicted to veg

286
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:45,240
bloom let's say you just started using

287
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:46,828
vegetable um it's your first run you're

288
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,448
dialing it in you know you don't know

289
00:09:46,828 --> 00:09:50,789
how those plants are gonna react to veg

290
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:53,818
bloom so let's start a grow journal for

291
00:09:50,789 --> 00:09:55,980
the veg bloom grow on page 1 you say I'm

292
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:57,659
in veg I'm using this much of edge bloom

293
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,430
you write down everything you put in

294
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:00,838
there and then you grow you run the

295
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:02,370
whole cycle you write down everything

296
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,079
you do and at the end if you're happy

297
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,028
with it you can look back and you go huh

298
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:08,068
that's how I did it and you can repeat

299
00:10:06,028 --> 00:10:09,480
that if you're not happy with it you can

300
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:11,159
look back and see where you screwed up

301
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,139
or you can see where you can adjust and

302
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:15,149
make it better that's the main point of

303
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:16,948
keeping notes you can repeat it if

304
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,110
something goes right or you can correct

305
00:10:16,948 --> 00:10:21,208
it if something goes wrong you have got

306
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:23,100
records and at the same time you're

307
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:25,768
creating an SOP which we'll talk about

308
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,439
in a little bit let's say you're growing

309
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:31,318
and you're in flour and about week four

310
00:10:28,438 --> 00:10:33,240
you start seeing an issue you can use

311
00:10:31,318 --> 00:10:36,000
those notes from the past to help you

312
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,769
correct and identify a problem you can

313
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,448
look back and you can say oh I fed it

314
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,589
cal-mag too many days in a row and

315
00:10:39,448 --> 00:10:42,568
you'll know because you wrote it down

316
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:44,130
and now instead of wondering what the

317
00:10:42,568 --> 00:10:46,169
problem is you've got a note that says

318
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:47,850
right here I fed it cal-mag on Monday I

319
00:10:46,169 --> 00:10:49,438
also [ __ ] up and gave it cal-mag on

320
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,689
Wednesday it's probably got too much

321
00:10:49,438 --> 00:10:53,669
cal-mag and now you've got a record all

322
00:10:51,688 --> 00:10:55,528
so hopefully this will prevent you from

323
00:10:53,669 --> 00:10:56,759
feeding it too much cal-mag because you

324
00:10:55,528 --> 00:10:58,350
wrote down in the journal all you have

325
00:10:56,759 --> 00:11:00,120
to do is turn back to pages and see what

326
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,829
you fed it two days ago see what you fed

327
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,448
it the past few days and you know oh I

328
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,609
gave it cal-mag she won't need cal-mag

329
00:11:03,448 --> 00:11:07,500
for a few days she'll be just fine so

330
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,600
that's some of the advantages of keeping

331
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,360
notes also you've got data

332
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,310
the future if you love the outcome you

333
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,500
know what you did you can do it all over

334
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:18,809
again if you're not satisfied with the

335
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:21,299
outcome you can try to fix it and then

336
00:11:18,809 --> 00:11:23,369
here's the best part grow again and

337
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,169
change something and then see how you

338
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,940
like that outcome and then compare the

339
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:28,229
two notes see what you did differently

340
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,329
and see what you did the same then you

341
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:31,829
can create a test sample you can create

342
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,370
a base and you have somewhere to work

343
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:34,409
from

344
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:36,299
you just need data we were creating data

345
00:11:34,409 --> 00:11:37,948
for the future is what you're doing with

346
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:41,419
journaling and you can use that data to

347
00:11:37,948 --> 00:11:43,708
identify and correct problems and

348
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:45,120
prevent problems I almost overlooked at

349
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:47,669
that part we're using the data to

350
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,078
prevent problems at the same time now

351
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:51,750
from a business person's point of view

352
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,489
if you're trying to open a grow or

353
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,559
you're trying to run a grow or work at a

354
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,899
grow for somebody maybe you're trying to

355
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:59,669
start your own business as a grow is the

356
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,799
guy with all of the notes and details

357
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:03,870
gonna be more likely to get financial

358
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:05,818
backing or is it gonna be the guy with

359
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,620
pictures of his plants which one of

360
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:10,318
those feels more reliable from a

361
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,269
business standpoint so notes show

362
00:12:10,318 --> 00:12:14,969
accountability and responsibility and

363
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:16,948
initiative at the same time also science

364
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:18,990
is all about taking notes any sort of

365
00:12:16,948 --> 00:12:20,429
progression is about keeping notes how

366
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:22,409
can you know if you're doing better or

367
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:24,719
worse if you don't have anything to

368
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:26,969
compare to so that's another thing about

369
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,410
taking notes it's a very once you get

370
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:30,350
into the business world it will be

371
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:32,850
required so start getting used to it now

372
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,290
all right let's get focused again I'm

373
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,300
just talking to me when I say let's get

374
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:36,899
focused I get rambley it may be all the

375
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:38,490
dabs

376
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,429
alright so we're talking about taking

377
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:43,409
notes what do we note note everything

378
00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:46,948
note what you were feeding your plants

379
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:49,230
know what you are mixing how much water

380
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:52,109
are you using to feed the plants how

381
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:54,060
frequently are you feeding them when

382
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,829
you're mixing what is in the mix what

383
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:57,688
are you putting in there how much of you

384
00:12:55,828 --> 00:12:59,188
what nutrient and how much of it are you

385
00:12:57,688 --> 00:13:01,019
putting in there how often are they

386
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:02,818
getting fed back the way I would do this

387
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:04,350
I would open up a page of the notebook

388
00:13:02,818 --> 00:13:07,679
and I would write whatever it is if

389
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:11,730
you're in veg whatever July 10th

390
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:14,638
veg week 3 today I fed 5 gallons of

391
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:17,100
water I mixed in 5 grams of Base

392
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,318
nutrients per gallon I mixed in one gram

393
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,050
of plus life per gallon and then I gave

394
00:13:19,318 --> 00:13:23,490
it 2 mils of cal-mag per gallon and then

395
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:24,929
I pH dit I would write down

396
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,080
what went in there I would write down

397
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,399
the EC I would write down the pH and I

398
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,830
would write down the temperature of my

399
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,659
feed solution before I even carry that

400
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:35,009
container of water to the plants to

401
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:37,829
water it all of that would get written

402
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:39,809
down then I would water the plants to a

403
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:41,459
point of runoff tour at least a little

404
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:43,859
bit of water is coming out of each plant

405
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:45,599
I've got a catch tray under the plants I

406
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,850
would catch some of that water and I

407
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,190
would put my EC meter and my pH pin in

408
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:52,860
that runoff water and I would document

409
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,630
that runoff water as well if you've got

410
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,278
multiple plants in large containers I

411
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:57,600
would check several of them I would

412
00:13:56,278 --> 00:13:59,490
check them all if you feel like you have

413
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,159
time to do it and document this when

414
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,959
things go wrong those runoff numbers may

415
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:05,939
be indicators of when and where things

416
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,409
went wrong and then you can look back at

417
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,089
your other notes and you can see what

418
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:10,799
you fed it and then we can compare that

419
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,959
EC running off and we can see what's

420
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,059
going on and what it's not eating and

421
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,500
why the pH is fluctuating we can figure

422
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:18,629
all that out through the notes you're

423
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,039
keeping all right so we're taking great

424
00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:21,838
notes of our feet we're measuring what

425
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:25,079
goes in and what comes out so you've got

426
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,070
a notebook and it says veg week 2 or

427
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:31,920
whatever I'm just being hypothetical

428
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:34,649
here veg week 2 July 10th fed this pH n

429
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,778
was this EC n was this temp in was this

430
00:14:34,649 --> 00:14:38,309
runoff measurements were this EC was

431
00:14:36,778 --> 00:14:39,600
this pH was this I don't measure the

432
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,429
temperature of the runoff that doesn't

433
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,230
matter to me maybe it should but it

434
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:44,699
never has it's never come into play so

435
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,579
write down what goes in write down what

436
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,950
goes out keep that document every time

437
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:51,689
you feed and then if you feed it water

438
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,300
or something next time just write that

439
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,279
down write down almost everything you do

440
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:58,409
in that grow almost think like it's an

441
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,000
accountability sheet so if if somebody

442
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:01,528
were to say hey what the [ __ ] did you do

443
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,078
all day then you could say oh I did this

444
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:05,909
I water the plants I gave them this new

445
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,078
have got details and then you've got

446
00:15:05,909 --> 00:15:09,120
everything written down write down

447
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,759
everything that you do in the grow so

448
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,220
we'll move on to sprays write down your

449
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,439
sprays if it's a foliar feed if it's a

450
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:19,110
pesticide application if it's a spot

451
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,370
spray of one plant write that down and

452
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,079
buy a spot spray I mean if you're not

453
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:24,000
spraying the entire room if you just see

454
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,620
one area where you're you see some

455
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,610
spider mite damage but it hasn't sprayed

456
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,620
and you don't feel like you want to

457
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,480
spray the entire crop yet maybe you just

458
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,549
makes up a small batch of pesticides and

459
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,409
apply that to one small area that's what

460
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:35,639
I call a spot treatment I just hit that

461
00:15:34,409 --> 00:15:36,499
hot spot get in there and make sure it

462
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,269
doesn't spread

463
00:15:36,499 --> 00:15:39,739
I just if you happen to see something or

464
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,719
if you've got a specific strain that you

465
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,788
know gets mites treat that [ __ ] to

466
00:15:41,719 --> 00:15:46,459
pretreat it so anyway

467
00:15:43,788 --> 00:15:48,499
write down every spray every application

468
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:50,418
whether it's a pesticide a feeding a

469
00:15:48,499 --> 00:15:52,579
preventative whatever it is write down

470
00:15:50,418 --> 00:15:54,619
what you spray it write down the product

471
00:15:52,578 --> 00:15:57,588
write down how much of it you applied

472
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:58,939
write down how much you mixed up say you

473
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:01,369
probably makes up a half a gallon or a

474
00:15:58,938 --> 00:16:02,718
gallon if you're a home grower put I mix

475
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:05,538
up a gallon of water

476
00:16:02,719 --> 00:16:08,899
what pesticide did you put in there did

477
00:16:05,538 --> 00:16:09,408
you put thirty milliliters of evergreen

478
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,229
in there

479
00:16:09,408 --> 00:16:13,968
did you put five milliliters of smite in

480
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:16,939
there what did you mix up is there also

481
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:19,399
25 or 50 milliliters of push in there

482
00:16:16,938 --> 00:16:21,408
write it all down did you check the pH

483
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:22,969
of that some folks check the pH oh

484
00:16:21,408 --> 00:16:24,948
they're full of your feed some folks

485
00:16:22,969 --> 00:16:27,049
don't some products you should not

486
00:16:24,948 --> 00:16:29,088
adjust the pH some products you do need

487
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:31,338
to adjust the pH write it down if you

488
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,439
did or did not write down when it was

489
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:36,049
applied write down if it was applied

490
00:16:33,438 --> 00:16:37,548
right before the lights came on write

491
00:16:36,048 --> 00:16:39,259
down if you turned off the lights and

492
00:16:37,548 --> 00:16:41,239
applied it write down how long those

493
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:42,499
lights were off check the plants before

494
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:45,709
you turn the lights on and make sure

495
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:47,720
they're dry note that you did that write

496
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:49,578
down why you sprayed why were you

497
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,239
spraying what was your purpose write

498
00:16:49,578 --> 00:16:52,278
that down

499
00:16:50,239 --> 00:16:53,389
like act like there's another person

500
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:54,318
that's gonna come check your notes

501
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:56,028
mm-hmm

502
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,098
acts like I'm gonna come check your

503
00:16:56,028 --> 00:17:00,649
notes he's like so I see that you

504
00:16:58,099 --> 00:17:02,119
applied as a max today why and then I

505
00:17:00,649 --> 00:17:04,429
should see right underneath that oh I

506
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:06,199
see why I identified spider mites or

507
00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,329
thrips in the garden today and I felt

508
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,308
that it would be best to apply a product

509
00:17:08,328 --> 00:17:13,068
so something like that write down why

510
00:17:10,308 --> 00:17:15,949
you applied some products then later on

511
00:17:13,068 --> 00:17:18,588
write down the results did you see any

512
00:17:15,949 --> 00:17:20,659
results were there dead bugs hanging off

513
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:22,519
of the leaves were there dead eggs

514
00:17:20,659 --> 00:17:23,869
somewhere in the grow room that the

515
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,149
plants look like [ __ ]

516
00:17:23,868 --> 00:17:28,278
did the plants look better write down

517
00:17:26,148 --> 00:17:30,378
the results what did you do and write

518
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:30,528
down the results write down why you did

519
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:33,469
it

520
00:17:30,528 --> 00:17:34,609
what you did and how it reacted to it

521
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:36,200
and then you're gonna have to pay

522
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:38,359
attention because sometimes a pesticide

523
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,399
application won't show you problems for

524
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,939
a couple of days so pay attention to

525
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:43,729
that

526
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:45,379
write that down also if you rinse the

527
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,480
plants off a lot of people will apply a

528
00:17:45,378 --> 00:17:49,158
foliar application some products it's

529
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,000
ideal to rinse them a few hours later

530
00:17:49,159 --> 00:17:53,750
write that

531
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,609
down also detailed notes also if you put

532
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:57,529
in sort of a surfactant maybe you're

533
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:59,750
using some wet Betty or some Coco wet

534
00:17:57,529 --> 00:18:02,149
inside of your foliar feed write that

535
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,130
down also everything that goes in should

536
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:05,480
get written down as my point so we're

537
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:07,250
writing down the feeds we're writing

538
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,839
down the sprays that's just about

539
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,279
everything that is going into the plants

540
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,899
if you're making your own soil mix I

541
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:13,460
didn't write this down if you're making

542
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,890
your own soil mix if you're making a

543
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,620
super soil write down everything you put

544
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,500
into that that's crucial right back down

545
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:23,929
to the cup if you're scooping cups or

546
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,900
spoonfuls or whatever write it down

547
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:28,970
grams if you can highly detailed write

548
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:30,920
that down your super soil mix should be

549
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,509
dialed in that's gonna take you a couple

550
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,009
runs to get it perfected and if you

551
00:18:32,509 --> 00:18:35,390
don't have notes it's gonna be a [ __ ]

552
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:37,789
to dial that inks you might not remember

553
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:39,470
what you did we're smoking cannabis you

554
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:41,750
guys we forget a lot of [ __ ] take a lot

555
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:44,990
of notes so let's move forward more

556
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:47,839
notes to take room and environment notes

557
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:50,779
document the lights maybe you don't have

558
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,179
a lumen meter but pay attention document

559
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:55,609
the temperature document the humidity

560
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:58,039
and if you can pay attention to the co2

561
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:59,899
there are several ways several devices

562
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:02,089
it'll document all these things for you

563
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:04,070
if you just need the cheap hydrometer

564
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:04,309
and a pen and paper do that write it

565
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:06,889
down

566
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:08,509
pay attention see if you've got spikes

567
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:10,220
see if you've got valleys see if you've

568
00:19:08,509 --> 00:19:13,009
got swings and your temperature and your

569
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:14,870
humidity in your co2 hopefully you can

570
00:19:13,009 --> 00:19:16,609
get something like a pl minder unit in

571
00:19:14,869 --> 00:19:17,989
there from PL Gro systems and you can

572
00:19:16,609 --> 00:19:19,639
pay attention to what's going on at all

573
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,410
times but we don't all have that ability

574
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,360
so you're gonna have to write it down

575
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,250
and pay attention use one of those

576
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,629
hygrometers and thermometers that gives

577
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,009
you a high and a low and it lets you

578
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,960
know what the high got to and the low

579
00:19:28,009 --> 00:19:31,940
was do the best you can with what you've

580
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:34,069
got but take notes of that because if it

581
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:35,900
was too hot for too long your buds will

582
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:38,000
show you that if it was too cold for too

583
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,890
long your buds will show you that if it

584
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,210
was too humid for too long your buds

585
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:42,740
will show you that in the end and if you

586
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:44,269
don't write it down if you're not aware

587
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,130
of it then you can't correct it and

588
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:47,480
you'll go why are my buds so fluffy you

589
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:49,970
won't realize it was because they were

590
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,460
too hot for too long you may forget so

591
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,470
write down the room and environment

592
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,210
notes that you see the temperature the

593
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,769
humidity and the co2 and if you can

594
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,259
measure the amount of light in there if

595
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:02,359
you've got a lumen meter do that not

596
00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:04,058
required just helpful that helps you

597
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,678
know when to replace your

598
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:07,148
and when it comes to commercial growing

599
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,359
that that really makes a huge difference

600
00:20:07,148 --> 00:20:12,848
on you moles and para watts and how much

601
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:14,288
lighting per square foot it really comes

602
00:20:12,848 --> 00:20:15,249
into play on the commercial grow anyway

603
00:20:14,288 --> 00:20:17,408
let's move forward with what we're

604
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:21,038
focused on and keep me focused today

605
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:23,889
write down schedule notes are you in veg

606
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:26,259
are you in flower write down when veg

607
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:27,968
started write down when flower started

608
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,159
write down what time the lights are

609
00:20:27,969 --> 00:20:33,429
coming on and going off I've had

610
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,629
situations now I use a digital timer so

611
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,129
if the power goes out there's a backup

612
00:20:34,628 --> 00:20:39,098
battery in there and it'll stay on the

613
00:20:36,128 --> 00:20:40,958
correct time a long time ago before I

614
00:20:39,098 --> 00:20:43,298
was smarter than that I was using old

615
00:20:40,959 --> 00:20:45,548
analog timers if the power went out the

616
00:20:43,298 --> 00:20:48,068
timer quit spinning so it is now wrong

617
00:20:45,548 --> 00:20:51,398
for however long the power is out my

618
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:52,598
timer is that many hours off sometimes I

619
00:20:51,398 --> 00:20:54,008
didn't remember what time the lights

620
00:20:52,598 --> 00:20:55,689
came on that I have those lights coming

621
00:20:54,009 --> 00:20:57,190
on at 7:00 a.m. or did they come on at

622
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,379
9:00 I ain't 9:00 a.m. I don't remember

623
00:20:57,190 --> 00:21:01,449
so now you got a guess write that [ __ ]

624
00:20:59,378 --> 00:21:03,488
down take some notes have some

625
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:05,169
accountability notes will save your ass

626
00:21:03,489 --> 00:21:06,999
in the long run one day you're gonna go

627
00:21:05,169 --> 00:21:09,038
oh I'm so glad I wrote that [ __ ] down

628
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,479
and just write that down every little

629
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,648
thing you can think of schedule notes

630
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,509
what time to the lights come on what

631
00:21:11,648 --> 00:21:16,118
time do the lights go off what time is

632
00:21:13,509 --> 00:21:17,889
my AC come on what time does that hydro

633
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:19,628
pump come on just write down everything

634
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:21,398
if you're running hydro and stuff and

635
00:21:19,628 --> 00:21:23,288
you've got to do different cycles if

636
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:25,058
you're running a flood and drain or some

637
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:27,519
sort of ebb and flow write down how long

638
00:21:25,058 --> 00:21:29,259
it takes for that stuff to wet and dry

639
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:30,429
and how frequently you're watering they

640
00:21:29,259 --> 00:21:32,409
may help you out in the future when

641
00:21:30,429 --> 00:21:33,969
you're trying to plan future grows so

642
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:36,190
staying on the same note of scheduling

643
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:38,099
write down when you cut your clones

644
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:41,288
write down when you sprout your seeds

645
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:43,509
write down everything you can you guys

646
00:21:41,288 --> 00:21:45,338
write down Windows clones came out of

647
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:47,409
the cloner and into dirt write down

648
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:49,568
every transplant and a pot that you can

649
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:50,979
transpire that you can write down keep

650
00:21:49,568 --> 00:21:52,989
notes on everything that way you can

651
00:21:50,979 --> 00:21:54,429
keep track when you're looking to grow

652
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:57,190
in the future you can say hi I don't

653
00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:59,259
have a lot of time which plants veg the

654
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:00,818
fastest out of my selection do I want to

655
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:02,229
run this og or do I want to run this

656
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:03,368
Strawberry Hayes and you're gonna look

657
00:22:02,229 --> 00:22:05,048
back and you're gonna see in your notes

658
00:22:03,368 --> 00:22:07,628
that that strawberry Hayes only needed

659
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:09,578
two weeks to veg and that og cush needed

660
00:22:07,628 --> 00:22:10,778
four because it's a slow veg er and then

661
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:12,249
you'll say oh [ __ ] let's run the

662
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:14,108
strawberry so notes are gonna help you

663
00:22:12,249 --> 00:22:16,479
so then of course you're gonna want to

664
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:17,889
write down when you start your veg cycle

665
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:20,049
you're gonna definitely

666
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:22,600
want to write down when you start your

667
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:26,349
bloom cycle also write down your

668
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,159
anticipated flush date if you anticipate

669
00:22:26,349 --> 00:22:30,699
a flush date

670
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:33,040
write that down also it's wise to create

671
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:34,509
a feed schedule in advance and try to

672
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,579
stay on top of it if you're gonna grow

673
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:39,579
for nine weeks write yourself out a

674
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:41,679
seven week feed schedule and tasks to do

675
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:42,909
throughout those seven weeks and then

676
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:44,470
when you turn the page one day when

677
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,240
you're going to work you're gonna water

678
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:48,430
the plants that's gonna say flush today

679
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,109
and you're gonna go oh cool I'm 10 to 14

680
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:52,330
days away from harvest I should start

681
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:55,000
flushing so prepare that write yourself

682
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:57,549
a schedule along with your journal then

683
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,680
also write down when you started

684
00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:01,869
flushing also you're gonna be paying

685
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,830
attention to the trichomes every day

686
00:23:01,869 --> 00:23:04,839
when you're looking in there with the

687
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:07,419
scope write down what you see why not

688
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:09,369
write down today on July 10 I looked at

689
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,590
my Strawberry Fields plant I looked at

690
00:23:09,369 --> 00:23:13,209
the top buds all that all the trichomes

691
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:14,769
were milky but towards the bottom there

692
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:15,640
were a couple of amber trichomes on the

693
00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:17,950
bottom of the plant

694
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,080
write that down why not write that all

695
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,789
down so you're writing down everything

696
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,960
you guys I know I'm being redundant but

697
00:23:21,789 --> 00:23:24,250
do you guys might forget some of this

698
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,110
stuff and I point out things that you

699
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,329
guys may have missed so write down the

700
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:30,429
day you started flushing that way you

701
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:32,199
don't forget because I forgotten you'll

702
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,180
be in the grow room link did I give him

703
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,950
nutrients last time or have I given him

704
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,570
straight water you'll be flushing for

705
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:38,920
two times and you'll [ __ ] up and pour

706
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:40,689
nutrients in the plant you're like oh

707
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,269
yeah [ __ ] up so write it down pay

708
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:46,570
attention just have yourself some solid

709
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:49,089
notes also document any sort of

710
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:50,859
defoliation and popping and topping and

711
00:23:49,089 --> 00:23:53,259
lolli popping write that stuff down

712
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:55,479
because some plants are going to react

713
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:58,029
poorly to it some plants are going to

714
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:00,370
love it if you write down everything you

715
00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:01,899
know when you pissed off a plant you can

716
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:03,909
look through the notes and go so this is

717
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:05,200
OG kush plant got pissed off around week

718
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,210
three what happened and you look at your

719
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,860
notes and you go oh we d foliated the

720
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,840
[ __ ] out of it on week three and we also

721
00:24:08,859 --> 00:24:12,129
fed it too much cal-mag you'll be able

722
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:14,139
to look at your notes and you'll have

723
00:24:12,130 --> 00:24:15,850
some sort of a an idea of where you went

724
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,890
wrong and that's gonna be really helpful

725
00:24:15,849 --> 00:24:19,689
for when we go to grow that same og cush

726
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,490
next time we'll go look in week 3 bro

727
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:23,380
don't do foliate the [ __ ] out of it and

728
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:25,029
don't OD it on cal-mag it'll be much

729
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,590
happier than it was last time and then

730
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:29,379
you'll learn how to dial it in notes

731
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:31,778
will help you out with that a lot now as

732
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,570
a breeder and a Fino hunter

733
00:24:31,778 --> 00:24:36,848
this is one of my favorite parts

734
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:38,918
document any growth details and anything

735
00:24:36,848 --> 00:24:41,918
notable does that plant make pretty

736
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:43,570
colors does that plant grow weird did it

737
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,609
do something strange did it spit out

738
00:24:43,569 --> 00:24:47,710
extra nodes did it spit out extra

739
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:49,178
branches or the branches really closed

740
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,999
and compact together did anything

741
00:24:49,179 --> 00:24:53,710
strange happen anything notable write

742
00:24:51,999 --> 00:24:55,899
down growth details do they get really

743
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,729
tall that it's a remarkably short

744
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:59,618
did something happen when you topped it

745
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,519
did something happen when you did some

746
00:24:59,618 --> 00:25:03,308
lollipop

747
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,200
write down anything you notice that is

748
00:25:03,308 --> 00:25:07,960
notable about the growth of that plant

749
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,598
whether it's colors whether it's just

750
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,429
extra branching anything you see that

751
00:25:10,598 --> 00:25:14,888
may get your attention write it down

752
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:16,839
also if anything happened in that room

753
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:18,939
environmentally when that weird change

754
00:25:16,838 --> 00:25:21,038
happened document that on a side note

755
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,139
and let's pay attention to that over the

756
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:25,148
next couple of cycles so let's say maybe

757
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:26,468
I got maybe the air conditioner didn't

758
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,968
go off one night or maybe you got a

759
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:29,950
little extra cool just because it cooled

760
00:25:27,969 --> 00:25:31,509
down tonight and it got cool in the grow

761
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,919
room and it rained and the room got a

762
00:25:31,509 --> 00:25:35,200
little cooler and more humid

763
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,119
the next day you noticed that some of

764
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,009
the some of the leaves are turning a

765
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:40,538
little bit purple and then we're gonna

766
00:25:39,009 --> 00:25:41,950
note that it got a little cold in the

767
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:42,999
room and the leaves were purple next

768
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:44,379
time we grow it we're gonna pay

769
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,179
attention does it have to get cold to

770
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:48,398
get it purple or around this same time

771
00:25:46,179 --> 00:25:50,559
period does it purple up on its own and

772
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:52,388
we'll start knowing those leaves get

773
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:53,979
purple because of cold or do they get

774
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:55,928
purple because there's great genetics

775
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:57,848
and then if we want to make it purple in

776
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:59,859
the future and it's just genetics we can

777
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:01,749
add that purple again or add that cold

778
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:03,278
again and bring out the purple well know

779
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:05,889
that it's something that we can control

780
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:08,079
just taking notes will give you more

781
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:09,758
ideas and sometimes you find things in a

782
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,778
plant that you want to repeat sometimes

783
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:12,548
you find things in a plant you don't

784
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:14,858
want to repeat and this is the way to

785
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:16,749
know how to do it so a moment ago I

786
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:18,098
mentioned the air conditioner failure

787
00:26:16,749 --> 00:26:19,598
maybe the air conditioner didn't turn

788
00:26:18,098 --> 00:26:21,878
off maybe the heater didn't come on

789
00:26:19,598 --> 00:26:24,989
maybe the [ __ ] air conditioner didn't

790
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:27,338
come on and it got real hot document any

791
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:29,919
incidents or accidents that you may have

792
00:26:27,338 --> 00:26:32,259
in that grow room even if you [ __ ] up

793
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,489
its your grow room it's okay yeah I said

794
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:34,808
earlier I'm gonna come check your notes

795
00:26:33,489 --> 00:26:36,159
that's alright I'm not gonna get mad at

796
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:37,210
you I have [ __ ] up in grow rooms I

797
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,099
have fallen asleep with the grow room

798
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:41,348
with the flower room door open before I

799
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,819
guess what you got a seed or a crop full

800
00:26:41,348 --> 00:26:44,288
of seeds I just cut it down and threw it

801
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,129
away as soon as I saw the seeds forming

802
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:47,379
I was like nope

803
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,570
I [ __ ] up just threw it all the way a

804
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,160
hole it was just one small room is like

805
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:53,289
nine plants under one light but I fell

806
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,970
asleep with that door open I think I

807
00:26:53,289 --> 00:26:56,319
went got myself some food I went ate and

808
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:57,850
then I fell asleep and I'd left the grow

809
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:59,139
room door open because I was just

810
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,219
letting to get fresh air I had the fan

811
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,870
blowing in there you know you don't want

812
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,880
to stifle the room all day and we can

813
00:27:01,869 --> 00:27:06,009
give it some fresh air you can but a

814
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,810
pizza got stoned fell asleep and I woke

815
00:27:06,009 --> 00:27:09,460
up later and I was like oh you know what

816
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:10,960
and I walked in there and it was [ __ ]

817
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,279
dark in the room and the door was open

818
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,900
and the light from the hallway was just

819
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:15,250
shining right in there so I knew there

820
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,410
was a problem but as soon as I saw the

821
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,210
seed pods form this plants got killed

822
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:20,830
so I've [ __ ] up so write down if you

823
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,240
leave a door open write down if you

824
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:23,649
leave a light on write down if something

825
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,750
goes wrong write down if you did

826
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,460
something wrong maybe you [ __ ] up in

827
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,319
overfed something write it down it's

828
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:31,509
gonna help you identify a problem in the

829
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,700
future and it will help you not do that

830
00:27:31,509 --> 00:27:35,950
mistake again

831
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:37,569
also write down if you adjusted any

832
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:39,279
equipment did you change any air

833
00:27:37,569 --> 00:27:40,779
conditioning settings did you change any

834
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,609
timer settings did you mess with that

835
00:27:40,779 --> 00:27:43,269
fan in the corner did you change

836
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:45,069
anything

837
00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:47,170
make a little section on your notes for

838
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:49,389
today of any equipment that you changed

839
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:51,700
what did you adjust because small

840
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,190
adjustments can create huge problems

841
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:56,680
over several hours in a grow room maybe

842
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:58,809
you turned that fan from low to high and

843
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,430
though that one bud that it's just been

844
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:02,769
kicking the [ __ ] out of every time it

845
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:03,850
rotates that one bud is gonna get dried

846
00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:05,650
out the leaves are gonna start looking

847
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:07,569
leathery and crispy it's gonna start

848
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:09,550
talking up or it's gonna get back claw

849
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:10,899
and start clawing down it's gonna start

850
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:12,519
looking like a leather leaf it's gonna

851
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,620
look like a fake plant instead of a real

852
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:16,089
plant that buds gonna get all dry the

853
00:28:14,619 --> 00:28:17,709
plants gonna be trying to send all of

854
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:19,959
its moisture up there to keep that one

855
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:20,950
one piece of plant living and happy and

856
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,980
it's not gonna do it it's gonna make

857
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:25,690
that whole plant struggle document that

858
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,730
[ __ ] you could be like uh yesterday I

859
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:29,049
put that fan on three that's why it

860
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:30,940
looks like [ __ ]

861
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:33,369
and just document things like that any

862
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,019
sort of update or adjustment that you do

863
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:37,239
did you change a timer did you move a

864
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:39,250
fan did you do something to the AC did

865
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,940
you change the co2 anything like that

866
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,410
make sure you write that stuff down now

867
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,580
here are some other things that you may

868
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:50,860
not think about write down whenever you

869
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:52,359
change your bulbs a lot of people forget

870
00:28:50,859 --> 00:28:54,399
when the bulbs are changed it's a good

871
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,019
idea if you've got a bulb there's that

872
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,400
little white part the ceramic part at

873
00:28:56,019 --> 00:28:59,039
the base of the bulb you can write the

874
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:01,170
date right on there on the

875
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,058
or I've taken little stickers just a

876
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:04,980
little green yardsale sticker or a piece

877
00:29:03,058 --> 00:29:06,869
of duct tape or whatever and write the

878
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:08,700
date of that bulb on there and stick it

879
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:12,058
to the reflector changed all these bulbs

880
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,710
on 7:10 2018 boom stick that sticker

881
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:15,299
right on the reflector and then you've

882
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:17,130
got some sort of note but put it in your

883
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:18,450
journal that way you've got it all right

884
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:20,010
there in one spot have some

885
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:21,509
accountability know when those bulbs

886
00:29:20,009 --> 00:29:24,990
were changed cuz bulbs don't last

887
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:26,759
forever also write down when you change

888
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,650
your carbon filters your air

889
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,660
conditioning filters if you're running

890
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:32,550
any kind of hydro or also if you're

891
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:35,100
running an RO system write down when you

892
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:36,509
change those filters write that [ __ ]

893
00:29:35,099 --> 00:29:38,759
down in your journal so that it's a

894
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,779
never a question so if somebody says hey

895
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:41,279
how long have you had that [ __ ]

896
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,450
carbon filter you hold on it's in my

897
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,369
journal you can scroll to the the

898
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:47,819
equipment page and you can go oh I put

899
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:49,619
that in here on the 4th of July in 2016

900
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,480
and go OK it's time to replace that

901
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:53,879
[ __ ] then you just have some

902
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:56,069
accountability with that also I would

903
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:58,830
recommend documenting when all of your

904
00:29:56,069 --> 00:30:01,289
meters are calibrated your pH meter your

905
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:03,449
EC meter your ppm meter whatever type of

906
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:05,909
meters you are using calibrate those

907
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:08,580
things make sure you calibrate them and

908
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:10,740
write that down also here's something

909
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,569
you may not think about write down if

910
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:15,179
you're using a respirator when you apply

911
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:17,849
pesticides and you should be write down

912
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:19,530
when you changed those cartridges the

913
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:22,019
cartridges do not last forever they've

914
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:24,178
only got so many hours depending on what

915
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:26,039
type of pesticide you were applying the

916
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:28,140
life of those cartridges can be

917
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:29,730
shortened by different products they

918
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,140
don't last the same amount of time for

919
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:32,490
each product if you've got a more

920
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:33,570
volatile product I don't know the

921
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,910
correct word but if you've got a more

922
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:37,950
dangerous product then that cartridge is

923
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:40,500
absorbing more junk and it's not going

924
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:42,539
to last as long so write down each

925
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,789
application that you have done with that

926
00:30:42,539 --> 00:30:46,678
cartridge and when it was inserted into

927
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:49,349
your respirator and pay attention to

928
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,179
when it needs to be replaced now since

929
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:53,879
we're talking about safety gear let's

930
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,530
write down the last time we checked our

931
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,330
fire extinguisher have you checked the

932
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:59,099
fire extinguisher lately you should have

933
00:30:57,329 --> 00:31:00,779
one of those have you checked your smoke

934
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,490
detector you should have one of those

935
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:04,829
check the batteries in your smoke

936
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:07,169
detector and write down the last time

937
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:09,149
you tested it that smoke detector won't

938
00:31:07,169 --> 00:31:11,640
do you any good if the batteries are

939
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:12,110
dead and it doesn't make any noise all

940
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,759
right

941
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:15,558
guys I feel like I have talked about a

942
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,000
lot of stuff we could journal how you

943
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:19,789
want to journal how you want to organize

944
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,829
and arrange everything is up to you I'm

945
00:31:19,789 --> 00:31:24,139
sure I've made my point of write down

946
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:26,539
everything that you can now let's say

947
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,920
you see a problem let's say that you're

948
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:29,839
walking into the grow room and you see

949
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,670
that in the middle of week six of flower

950
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,470
these plants just look like they have

951
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:34,970
totally gone to [ __ ] they're clawed up

952
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:36,558
some of the leaves are yellow

953
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,420
the leaves are facing down they look

954
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,849
like look like a claw like a monster

955
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,890
claw and they're yellowed out oh crap

956
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:45,558
what happened it's probably a nutrient

957
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:47,570
problem it's probably from about three

958
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:49,519
to seven days ago let's get out the

959
00:31:47,569 --> 00:31:51,589
notebook let's scroll back and look to

960
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,940
see what we did three days ago what did

961
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:54,889
we feed them anything weird

962
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:57,110
let's look yesterday did we spray

963
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:58,250
anything didn't spray anything let's

964
00:31:57,109 --> 00:32:00,439
look the day before do we spray anything

965
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:02,599
no spray let's look before that oh here

966
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:04,730
we fed a whole bunch of stuff let's look

967
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:06,558
through here okay it doesn't seem to be

968
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:08,720
like that's the problem let's look back

969
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,849
okay we started seeing that the runoff

970
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,679
was different the runoff the pH of the

971
00:32:10,849 --> 00:32:14,119
runoff started getting really low and

972
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,759
the EC of the runoff started getting

973
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,709
really high about seven days ago what

974
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:20,509
did we feed it about eight or nine days

975
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,058
ago and you can start doing that math

976
00:32:20,509 --> 00:32:25,700
and you can say oh [ __ ] look about 12

977
00:32:23,058 --> 00:32:28,579
days ago maybe 10 days ago we fed this

978
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,830
plant way too much of something or we

979
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,599
did we applied something that did it and

980
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:35,359
you'll just be able to use those notes

981
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:37,308
as a map backwards and now it has become

982
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,599
a math problem just to figure out

983
00:32:37,308 --> 00:32:40,548
through deductive reasoning with your

984
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:42,230
notes what went wrong and if you wrote

985
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:43,668
her enough notes and you're paying

986
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:45,079
enough attention to the plants and

987
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:49,040
you've got the connection that you need

988
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:50,599
you'll be able to find the problem then

989
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,819
once you find that problem write it down

990
00:32:50,599 --> 00:32:55,129
in your journal then when we grow a G

991
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:56,750
khush again we know that in week 5 not

992
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:58,910
to try to feed it way too much bloom

993
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:01,009
boosters so this is what we call dialing

994
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:03,230
in your grow this is why a lot of

995
00:33:01,009 --> 00:33:05,450
experienced growers are sought-after in

996
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,579
commercial facilities we can dial things

997
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:09,259
in much more quickly because we're more

998
00:33:07,579 --> 00:33:10,819
familiar with these types of things we

999
00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:12,169
know that some plants want some things

1000
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:13,609
you know that some plants are gonna

1001
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:16,220
react certain ways and we've got an eye

1002
00:33:13,609 --> 00:33:18,949
to identify those things and we develop

1003
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:20,779
that skill through taking notes through

1004
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:23,840
practicing through observation and

1005
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:25,710
through repeating this process also you

1006
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,990
guys if you think about it Oh

1007
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:30,240
several crop cycles if you take good

1008
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:33,210
enough notes you were reverse

1009
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,460
engineering SOPs for yourself you were

1010
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:38,160
creating a standard operating procedure

1011
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:40,079
for your grow you were dialing it in you

1012
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,850
were starting to get a streamline work

1013
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:43,589
process you're starting to dial in the

1014
00:33:41,849 --> 00:33:45,719
cost you're starting to dial in the

1015
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:47,970
efficiency and you can streamline it a

1016
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:50,400
little better every grow by taking notes

1017
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,589
and seeing exactly how much nutrient

1018
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:54,120
you're using seeing each step that

1019
00:33:52,589 --> 00:33:56,009
you're doing where you could kind of cut

1020
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:57,629
some time out by say it by doing oh

1021
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:59,039
maybe I'm doing this wrong you can save

1022
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,170
time here you can save time here you

1023
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:03,359
could save a few dollars here you can

1024
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:05,130
learn how to not [ __ ] up your crops you

1025
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:06,899
can learn how to prevent problems you

1026
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,340
can see which pesticide applications

1027
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:10,139
worked you can see which pesticide

1028
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,519
applications did not work you can see

1029
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,889
when to time things better

1030
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:16,619
keeping these notes will help you create

1031
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:18,929
standard operating procedures that will

1032
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:23,400
work in a small scale grow it will also

1033
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:24,960
be expandable to a larger facility now

1034
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,789
here's one last thing that we should

1035
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,190
keep notes of in any sort of grow

1036
00:34:26,789 --> 00:34:30,989
situation and that is your harvest you

1037
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,110
want to keep notes on your harvest Waits

1038
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:37,199
per plant per strain per room however

1039
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:39,450
you want to do it keep notes also take

1040
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,969
personal notes on how you feel the

1041
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:44,549
quality is of your product if you can

1042
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:46,619
get it lab tested do that and keep notes

1043
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:48,990
on that that way we can see if we are

1044
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:52,319
increasing our harvests increasing our

1045
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:54,689
quality also document how many harvests

1046
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,360
you get per year and let's see if we can

1047
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:59,280
maximize your room maybe if we time

1048
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,289
things properly we can pull a whole

1049
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,120
nother crop out of that room per year

1050
00:35:01,289 --> 00:35:05,039
let's see what we can do for you the

1051
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,319
only way we can do that is take notes

1052
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:09,809
and see if we can repeat our processes

1053
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,930
and see where we can improve you guys so

1054
00:35:09,809 --> 00:35:14,849
that is my episode on journaling and

1055
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:16,169
keeping a grow journal I hope you

1056
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:17,549
learned something if you feel like

1057
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:19,980
there's something I missed that you'd

for a lot of stuff at the end of every

1117
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,360
episode here I'm like go follow me on

1118

patreon go stalk me on social media give

1119
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,360
me an iTunes review there's all kinds of

1120
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,160
stuff I always ask for at the end of the

1121
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,640
show but I would really appreciate it if

1122
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:25,710
we could get my strain arise on Leafly

1123
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:27,960
the way to do that is to go to Leafly

1124
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:29,970
and go to the submit a new strain tab

1125
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,059
and then just leave a review on a rise

1126
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:35,669
if you have ever smoked smelled grown

1127
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:36,989
consumed anything about a rise and you

1128
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,789
feel like you're qualified to leave a

1129
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:41,579
review on there I would appreciate that

1130
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:44,759
let's get a rise on Leafly go to Leafly

1131
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:46,319
calm go to the add a new strain tab you

1132
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,420
may have to create an account that's

1133
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:50,610
always fun then once you've got your

1134
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,980
