that way I can find them more easily

58
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,160
today's pet peeve started off kind of as

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
a question but I'm going to turn this

60
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:37,959
into my pet peeve this question came

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,039
from a friend who wants to be called

62
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,519
Full Throttle this question came from

63
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:45,039
that growel tab on iy genetics.com

64
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,680
that's right my main website is iy

65
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,959
genetics.com at the top of that web page

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,920
there's a list of tabs one of those tabs

67
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:54,199
does say grow help if you click on that

68
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,919
grow help tab guess what you get to send

69
00:02:54,199 --> 00:02:57,639
me your grow help question tell me

70
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,479
what's going on in the grow let me know

71
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,000
what the problem is in the grow space if

72
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,919
I read read your question here on the

73
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,199
podcast I will send you a coupon code

74
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,199
for a free pack of seeds off of I

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,158
redirect.sh it came from my new friend

76
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,479
Full Throttle there's a lot of prep to

77
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:24,919
this question and then they get right to

78
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,479
the point which I'm going to jump

79
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,438
straight to the question goes a little

80
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:32,359
bit like this and this is also my grow

81
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:35,000
room pet peeve of the day it says I've

82
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,400
been growing since 1989 and about three

83
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,318
years ago I started making feminized

84
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,319
seeds bro congratulations on the seed

85
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:44,878
making welcome to the party it says my

86
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,839
question is if I can turn a male into a

87
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,679
controlled hermy now that's not at all

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,000
what is happening here so that is my pet

89
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,280
peeve when people talk about feminized

90
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,878
seeds when they talk about reversing and

91
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,158
they use the word Herm in the

92
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,560
conversation that's a pet peeve when you

93
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,359
are breeding making femin fed plants

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,239
making feminized seeds there should be

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,239
zero Herm word interaction reason in

96
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:11,799
this conversation at all the word Herm

97
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,280
especially hermy hermy isn't even a word

98
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,879
Herm is short for hermaphrodite uh which

99
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,639
the appropriate word is intersec uh that

100
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,238
word those words should never come up

101
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,360
when we are talking about making fem

102
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,839
seeds if you have any interex traits in

103
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
either one of your plants when you are

104
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,399
making fem seeds you're already [ __ ]

105
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,639
up you're going to make guess what more

106
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,839
Herm more interex plants so my big pet

107
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,840
PE pet peeve is when people talk about

108
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:38,879
making feminized seeds is when they say

109
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:41,119
anything to do with the word Herm

110
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,879
especially the word hermy that's not

111
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,759
even a real thing and if you're using

112
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,360
the word Herm and your fem seeds you're

113
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:48,960
already doing it all wrong now I

114
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,840
understand what you're saying uh you

115
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,638
said if I can turn a female plant into a

116
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,959
controlled Herm to make fem seeds that

117
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,840
is not what's happening at all let me

118
00:04:55,959 --> 00:05:00,839
explain more of what is happening that

119
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,239
plant is not a male um that plant is not

120
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,560
a male plant in any way that plant is

121
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,960
not a hermaphrodite plant in any way

122
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,959
that is still a fully female plant the

123
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,719
way we identify that plant and verify

124
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,799
that is that we have ran that plant

125
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,080
multiple times in several conditions in

126
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,400
several rooms if that plant shows

127
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,439
intersect uh traits in that plant I

128
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:22,799
eliminate that I do not breed that into

129
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,439
my breeding mix we don't breed with

130
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,560
intersects with her plants at all we are

131
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,839
taking a solid true tested female plant

132
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,000
with true XX chromosomes we're taking

133
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:35,679
that female plant and we're reversing it

134
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,478
uh by doing what I'm doing is I'm

135
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,160
spraying it with a silver solution there

136
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:41,680
are several different silver Solutions

137
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,960
you can use I make my own silver thyo

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
sufate solution I spray it with that

139
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:48,318
when that silver penetrates those leaves

140
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840
it creates a copper disruption in that

141
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,120
plant the copper can't move around

142
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,439
properly because the silver blocks that

143
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,280
then the plant says something's going on

144
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,800
then that creates an ethylene response

145
00:05:56,279 --> 00:05:59,239
which is part of the ripening process

146
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,759
and most of the fruits and vegetables

147
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,759
which we consume that process goes into

148
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,520
a lot more detail I'm not qualified to

149
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,479
explain which creates pollen sacks those

150
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,399
pollen sacks are all female pollen sax

151
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,478
it's all female pollen in there there's

152
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,799
no male chromosome there's no

153
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:18,159
hermaphrodite hermy interex chromosome

154
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:20,360
involved in here it is all female it is

155
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,680
not a controlled Herm that is not the

156
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,400
word it is reversed we say reversed you

157
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:26,959
said reversed so when we're reversing it

158
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:29,038
uh that is what we're doing it's not a

159
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,598
controlled Herm that is not the word

160
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,800
Herm should my pet peeve is the word

161
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,399
Herm when it comes to Fem breeding get

162
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,120
that out of there if the word Herm is in

163
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,239
there you're [ __ ] up already you're

164
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:40,959
doing it wrong now let me keep going it

165
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,360
says um is there a spray that can turn

166
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,038
male plants into female flowers to make

167
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,038
seeds I'm guessing there is but every

168
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,199
seed would be male and that's why no one

169
00:06:48,038 --> 00:06:52,439
does it now you are absolutely correct

170
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,280
there are chemicals sprays applications

171
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,360
products that we can put on our male

172
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:58,878
plants that will allow them to show us

173
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,520
what they would look like as a female um

174
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,039
I don't know about seed production with

175
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:04,478
that I've never tried that but we have

176
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,878
reversed a male plant to look like a

177
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,519
female before it looked just like when a

178
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,759
normal female changes itself to look

179
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,198
like a male you could definitely tell in

180
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,919
my opinion uh I don't do this I don't

181
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:17,840
think it's worth the time because and

182
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,598
the time it took that breeder to reverse

183
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:22,079
that male plant to show us what it would

184
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,360
look like as a girl I took my male plant

185
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,918
and pollinated female plants with it and

186
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,960
now we can grow those seeds and I've

187
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,159
actually made forward progress in my

188
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:33,159
breeding so yes there is is a chemical

189
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,919
called epon um I did not write down the

190
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,520
uh dilution and application rates but

191
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,560
epon is available you can reverse male

192
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:41,519
plants uh you can what would be called

193
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,280
it wouldn't be feminizing it' be mascul

194
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,918
them right so you can make masculine

195
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,279
seeds if you really wanted to I don't

196
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:47,799
see a reason to do that that would be

197
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,038
shooting yourself in the foot in my

198
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,478
opinion but there is a product there is

199
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,918
a chemical out there that will do it um

200
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,318
you can reverse that plant and it will

201
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,318
show you what it would look like as a

202
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,840
female if you want to know what traits

203
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,120
it would bring to the table as a female

204
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,839
but like I said

205
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,639
while you're doing that project I'm

206
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,758
using my male that I've already selected

207
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:07,639
with visual traits that I can rely on

208
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,479
and I'm pollinating females I'm a step

209
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,918
ahead of you you're flowering out that

210
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:12,839
dude and trying to do the tricks and do

211
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,799
the Wizardry I'm already making seeds

212
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:17,038
that we can grow that we grow those

213
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,800
seeds and those seeds show me what my

214
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:21,439
pollen donor plant actually would have

215
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,038
done in the mix so uh my pet peeve I'm

216
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,038
going to answer the question but my pet

217
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:28,360
peeve here is uh stop saying Herm the

218
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:30,839
pet peeve is the word Herm when it comes

219
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,800
to making fem SE that is not what is

220
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,120
happening let me make sure I covered all

221
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,120
this uh yes I did so my dude your name

222
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,278
is on the other side so my dude Full

223
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,479
Throttle thank you for the great

224
00:08:38,278 --> 00:08:41,759
question here make sure you do check

225
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,600
your inbox CU you have a coupon code for

226

a free pack of seeds from iy direct.com

227
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,879
all right we're going to keep this

228
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,079
momentum moving this next question is

229
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,320
about paen also this question came from

230
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,959
our friend who wants to be called

231
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,680
trumpus good to meet you my dude the

232
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:00,039
question goes a little bit like this it

233
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,958
says when you reverse a female and you

234
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,639
pollinate another female with that

235
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,879
reversed pollen okay makes sense so far

236
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:10,480
is the Reversed female a male van no it

237
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,720
is not it is a reversed female kind of

238
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,839
like the previous question uh it is just

239
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,639
a reversed female that's exactly what it

240
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,200
is it's a girl that has been treated

241
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,958
with silver or whatever you want to

242
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,759
treat it with that is will cause it to

243
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:25,479
reverse and it has reversed it did not

244
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:28,000
get a gender change it is still a female

245
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:29,680
uh it has got all X chromosomes uh this

246
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,159
could be a very controversial subject if

247
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,479
we wanted to go that way but this is all

248
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,159
female it is still a female plant you've

249
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,519
just treated it with a solution that has

250
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,078
caused a reaction there a chemical

251
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,679
reaction is all that's happening in this

252
00:09:40,078 --> 00:09:44,559
plant that plant is still a true female

253
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:48,239
so much so that the pollen that comes

254
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,879
off of that plant is true female um that

255
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,680
pollen that comes off if you gather that

256
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,120
pollen that is all female pollen no

257
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,000
matter how many other female plants you

258
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,078
put that on it's going to make female

259
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,559
seeds because it is all female that's

260
00:09:57,078 --> 00:10:01,239
how truly female that plant is said

261
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:03,278
please help me understand you rosta Jeff

262
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:05,320
you're the man I appreciate everything

263
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,480
that I am learning from your podcast yo

264
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,480
thank you for listening thank you for

265
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,079
the great compliment I know this is a

266
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,278
really short answer and I hope it makes

267
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,559
sense and you're going to win your free

268
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:17,320
pack of seeds but um is the Reversed

269
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,639
plant uh male no it's still a female it

270
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,000
has just been treated with chemicals

271
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:22,559
that's all there is to it we haven't it

272
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,919
hasn't changed its name it doesn't wear

273
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,399
different clothes uh we simply sprayed

274
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:28,159
it with some [ __ ] and it's having a

275
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,159
chemical if it were a human it would be

276
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:32,319
a medical reaction a chemical reaction

277
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,078
is all it would be same story we're not

278
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
going to do this comparison with people

279
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:38,439
and plants cuz this is weird when it

280
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:41,039
gets to this borderline but uh no it is

281
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,200
still a female plant I just sprayed it

282
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,759
with some stuff all right I hope that

283
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,079
answers your question that was quick and

284
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,360
straight to the point so my dude uh make

289
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,600

podcast of course once again this did

300
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,879
come from the growel tab on my website

301
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:26,199
IR genetics.com go to the website IR

302
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,439
genetics.com on the top there's that row

303
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,278
of tabs one says grow help click on that

304
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,399
grow help tab this one came from our

305

can't go wrong click on everything see

327
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,120
what all the tabs are about navigate

328
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,879
yourself around it will take a minute to

329
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,159
get used to it but eventually it will

330
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,679
all make sense then one day you will

331
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,078
find the smoker's Lounge what the smoker

332
00:12:24,679 --> 00:12:28,799
Lounge that is a video chat where I hang

333
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:31,359
out a lot of my friends hang out we talk

334
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,919
about growing we talk about smoking uh

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,759
sometimes we talk about food we talk

336
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,838
about dogs you never know what we could

337
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,000
talk about in there if you've got a grow

338
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,480
question uh if you've got a grow problem

339
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,320
something is just stumping you and you

340
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,519
need immediate input from an army of

341
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
people that know what they're talking

342
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,879
about there's somebody in the Smokers

343
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,560
Lounge or The Growers Lounge right now I

344
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:51,240
could be in there you never know who may

345
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,078
be in there we may be able to answer

346
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,720
your question just pop in show us a

347
00:12:53,078 --> 00:12:56,159
picture show us a video of the grow let

348
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,480
us know what's going on we may be able

349
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,198
to help you out in real time uh give you

350
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,199
real recommend advice there may be

351
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:03,799
somebody in your region in your area

352
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,319
that's growing that has the same problem

353
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:07,399
that knows where there's a store nearby

354
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:09,160
that can help you get a solution it's a

355
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,759
great resource I do invite you to join

356
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:14,480
us on the Discord server the IR Army

357
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,360
Discord server pop in that smoker Lounge

358
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,240
don't be shy if you don't want to be on

359
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,120
video uh you don't have to put your face

360
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,799
on video if you don't want to smoke on

361
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,120
camera you don't have to you can come be

362
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:25,799

365
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,079
have that name displayed and you can

366
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:32,679

comfortable you can hang out you can

369
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,360
share your experience just want to make

370
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:42,198
sure that everybody feels invited to the

371
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,039
IR Army Discord server that was a lot of

372
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:46,958
rambling let me keep myself a little bit

373
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:48,879
focused here um my question is about

374
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,359
reversing females I'm sure you guys have

375
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,360
caught on that this episode is going to

376
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:55,639
be mostly about feminized breeding

377
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,480
projects we're going to jump into it it

378
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:01,039
says I wonder if reversing with silver

379
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,278
is contrib to the hermaphrodite traits

380
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,399
my quick answer with positive confidence

381
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:07,278
is nope those are the plants which you

382
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,839
are choosing that are contributing to

383
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:12,559
your hermaphrodite traits it says um I

384
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,199
am starting with solid genetics that

385
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,599
have been grown to harvest with no

386
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:18,039
hermaphrodite traits in sight tested

387
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,560
some of the seeds that were made and

388
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:22,519
have a very high rate of Herms is there

389
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,958
something other than silver I can use to

390
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,078
reverse not what those two plants no

391
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,319
whichever two plants you were using one

392
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:31,958
of them definitely is carrying the

393
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,000
intersex Gene it is not the dominant

394
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:35,159
trait in that plant but it is in there

395
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,240
actually we've never bred with these

396
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,639
before it could be a dominant trait we

397
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,959
haven't seen it express itself it's

398
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,360
hidden in there you unlocked it by

399
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,958
breeding to it so one of these two

400
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,879
plants has that intersect trait in it uh

401
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,399
I'm not sure which two plants you used

402
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,198
I'm not sure which two plant which of

403
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:54,078
the two you reversed but uh it is

404
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,479
definitely not the silver that is

405
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,679
causing the intersect tray it is the

406
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,639
plants the plants are what is doing it

407
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:02,919
if the silver what is what was causing

408
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,919
this all of my projects all of your

409
00:15:02,919 --> 00:15:07,599
projects everybody's projects involving

410
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:10,039
silver would have intersect traits the

411
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,920
common uh common denominator here is

412
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:14,198
your plants that is the thing that is

413
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:17,360
showing the intersect traits I want to

414
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:19,399
know um which plant did you reverse and

415
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,320
then I also want to know how many plants

416
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:23,278
did you pollinate and then did you

417
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,920
pollinate one or did you pollinate

418
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,399
multiple plants of that pollination how

419
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,599
many of those seeds have you grown was

420
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,720
was it a project or was it an outcross

421
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,440
where there were multiple do the s1s do

422
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:38,800
they show F or hermaphroditism or do all

423
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,319
of the population show hermaphroditism

424
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,519
that would really help us narrow down

425
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:45,278
where the Herm trait is coming from but

426
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:47,560
I am super sure that the Herm trait did

427
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,519
not come from the silver um you said

428
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:51,679
that you've grown these plants to a

429
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,318
harvest before but have you stress

430
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,399
tested them have you taken these plants

431
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:56,799
in a room and [ __ ] with the timer have

432
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:58,440
you messed with their light cycle have

433
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,000
you messed with their feeding have you

434
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,120
messed with drought have you messed with

435
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,879
flood uh these are all conditions that I

436
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,919
would definitely experiment with before

437
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:08,240
breeding to that plant push them to

438
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,639
their limit find out when they snap see

439
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,039
what it takes to really piss these

440
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:13,440
plants off before you breed to them I'm

441
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,719
going to go over this and make sure I'm

442
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,160
covering everything here because I've

443
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,519
been going really quickly with this

444
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:20,838
episode it feels like this may be a

445
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,959
short but powerful episode um uh

446
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,639
hermaphrodites coming from Silver solid

447
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,958
traits grown to harvest no hermaphrodite

448
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,759
traits in sight in sight see that's um

449
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,278
it was in there it's in one of these

450
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,959
plants so what I would recommend um I

451
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:35,519
wouldn't breed I may pick totally

452
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:37,159
different plants but if you insist on

453
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,278
using these plants again here's a way to

454
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:42,159
find out which one is the interex plant

455
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:44,439
whichever one you chose as your pollen

456
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:46,519
donor do the same thing again and then

457
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,440
pollinate whichever plant you chose last

458
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:51,720
time again but then pollinate other

459
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,199
plants as well if the other plants all

460
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,399
show intersex traits from the progyny

461
00:16:54,198 --> 00:16:58,039
it's your pollen donor if only some of

462
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,159
them show the intersect it could be the

463
00:16:58,039 --> 00:17:01,958
plant that is receiving the pollen and

464
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,078
not the pollen donor but we've got to

465
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:06,798
start doing a process of elimination

466
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,678
here then my next run I would do a

467
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,119
different pollen donor and hit all of

468
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,199
those Fe I moved the one that was the

469
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:14,318
pollen donor before move it right into

470
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:15,798
the line and or the and make it a pollen

471
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,678
receiver this time with a different

472
00:17:15,798 --> 00:17:19,359
donor and that's the only way you're

473
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,600
going to find out where that intersect

474
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,119
trait lies where it's hidden but I

475
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,000
guarantee you that the intersect didn't

476
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,918
come out of any of the uh the silver the

477
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,279
intersects guaranteed came out of the

478
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,880
plants that you start Ed with so uh

479
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:33,519
sometimes that's the magic of breeding

480
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,640
sometimes you put plant a plant B

481
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,440
together those chromosomes mixed the x's

482
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,240
and y's they all jingle up together they

483
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,080
land how they come out sometimes you

484
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,440
create the hottest new fire sometimes

485
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:44,759
you make a big old bag of Herms you

486
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,519
never know what might be happening

487
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,879
that's why uh you just got to grow them

488
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,720
and test them out and this is one of the

489
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,960
big reasons why I recommend pollinating

490
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,200
multiple female plants with the same

491
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,440
pollen donor because like I keep saying

492
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,480
I don't know if it's your and maybe I

493
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,440
don't know how how many plants you

494
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:03,558
pollinated I don't know if you made s1's

495
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,640
I don't know if you made a bunch of r1's

496
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:07,558
but if it's just the we're just going to

497
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,360
say um what's your name your name is

498
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,879
skunky Steve we're just going to say we

499
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,199
took skunky Steve S1 or skunky Steve

500
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,280
we're just going to call a plant skunky

501
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,319
Steve and you took two cuts and tried to

502
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,918
make s1s if those are Herms there's only

503
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,558
one plant in there contributing to that

504
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,159
interex mix that's your intersex plant

505
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:27,240
if youve read it out to other things uh

506
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,520
then we could see where that intersect

507
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,558
lies but if it's just an S1 one then

508
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,599
skunky Steve is a Herm if you pollinated

509
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:36,038
skunky other plants with skunky Steve uh

510
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:37,599
if half of those are Herms I would say

511
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:39,879
it came from skunky Steve if none of

512
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,038
them are Herms I would say that that

513
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,679
that's how we would figure it out I'm

514
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,000
talking in circles now trying to figure

515
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,960
out that process of elimination but it

516
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is definitely in those plants it's not

517
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,240
in the uh it's not in the silver but

518
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,759
that's why I would pollinate multiple

519
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:54,279
females that's what I was saying

520
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:55,919
pollinate multiple females then we can

521
00:18:54,279 --> 00:18:58,279
see what is actually happening is it the

522
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:01,000
pollen donor or is it the females where

523
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:02,558
the problem wise process of elimination

524
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,759
more data it makes it a little bit

525
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,599
easier all right my dude skunky Steve

526
