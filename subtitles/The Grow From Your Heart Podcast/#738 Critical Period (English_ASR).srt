61
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,840
did not cover any grow talk we made sure

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
not to cover grow talk i don't want to

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,159

106
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,479
let's quit rambling about patreon i said

107
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,680
that i've got a grow question here in

108
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,000
front of me um outdoor season is quickly

109
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
coming upon us people are setting up

110
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
their plants indoors a lot of people at

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,158
least are vegging their plants indoors

112
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,959
they're going to veg indoors if you're

113
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,719
doing it correctly last year you ran

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,719
some seeds or got some clones or got a

115
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,318
plant from somebody then you grew that

116
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,400
and you made sure that it is quality if

117
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,079
you grew from seed hopefully you

118
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,680
eliminated the boys who eliminated

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,079
anything intersex you eliminated

120
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,918
anything problematic and you found a gem

121
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,759
of a keeper that you want to put outside

122
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,198
this year so you've done your research

123
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
done your work you've got a quality

124
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,639
plant to put outside now people are

125
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,478
vegging those they've some people have

126
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,240
been vegging since january they started

127
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,560
their clone their seed however they want

128
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,918
to do it since january it's getting big

129
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
they have now sexed it they've made sure

130
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,039
it's a female they've got a clone of it

131
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,080
they know what they've got it's getting

132
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,479
bigger and bigger they're going to put

133
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,240
it outside pretty soon i'm going to see

134
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,240
on social media a lot of people saying

135
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,519
that they put their plants outside and

136
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,199
immediately when they put them outside

137
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,039
they went into flower and they're going

138
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,280
to go into flower too early then those

139
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,639
plants are going to go back into a veg

140
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,239
they're going to continue a little bit

141
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,079
of a veg cycle then once they get

142
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,600
settled into that veg phase mother

143
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,519
nature out there is going to adjust to

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
the actual flowering cycle then they

145
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,159
will want the plants to go into flower

146
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,680
they'll go into flower they're going to

147
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,800
be weird they're going to be upset

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,560
they're not going to be the quality

149
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,160
which they could have been if we timed

150
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
this better if we understood what was

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,800
going on

152
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,159
what's going to happen

153
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,000
a lot of people are going to take their

154
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,639
plants from their grow room or they're

155
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,038
giving them 18 hours of light 18 and 6

156
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,038
maybe more maybe 24 hours of light and

157
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,360
they're getting a direct light from an

158
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,639
led or an hps or maybe it's just a t5

159
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,080
but they're getting a lot of direct

160
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,319
light out there and they're not getting

161
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,240
any stressors and you're giving them a

162
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:30,478
solid light schedule and you're going to

163
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,720
take them outside because you think by

164
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:35,519
looking at the sun and the sky

165
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,600
that we're getting more than 12 hours of

166
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,399
light outside so those plants should

167
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,400
continue

168
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:42,638
to veg outdoors is what a lot of people

169
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,560
think but sometimes that doesn't happen

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,639
and that is because of a couple of

171
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,478
factors i do have an email that i want

172
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
to read this will set me up to get

173
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,918
further into this topic i may skim

174
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
through this because there is a lot of

175
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,639
this email it's not all necessary um our

176
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,319
friend is as long-winded as myself here

177
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,918
so let me try to edit this and we'll

178
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,199
make something out of this message it

179
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,839
says bro

180
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,000
i really appreciate the way you do what

181
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,519
you do you are a positive light and you

182
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
are contagious

183
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,079
um that is awesome somebody taught me a

184
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,240
long time ago that smiles are contagious

185
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,519
uh somebody also taught me that uh don't

186
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,720
complain because nobody gives a [ __ ] and

187
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,639
it makes people just not want to be

188
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,400
around you so try to smile try to have

189
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,759
the good vibes especially when a

190
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,120
camera's on there's no reason to come on

191
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,400
a camera when i'm in a bad mood not

192
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,160
having a good vibe i do have uh bad days

193
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,198
[ __ ] does happen in my life i just don't

194
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
share that with the world there's no

195
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
need to put that [ __ ] out there uh just

196
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
shed love and light so thank you i'm

197
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,599
glad that you noticed that i'm glad you

198
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,960
like the way i do what i do uh because

199
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,720
i'm just doing it the way i know how to

200
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:42,799
do it i couldn't change it if i tried so

201
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,960
thank you it goes on it says you are an

202
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,720
extremely thorough you are extremely

203
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,560
thorough in the way you teach that's why

204
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,120
i'm pretty stoked and i think i might

205
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,360
have something for you to riff on here

206
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,598
and pretty much never gets covered by

207
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,120
anybody that is i've read this email

208
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:58,560
you're very correct this does not get

209
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,879
covered by a lot of people a lot of

210
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
people don't understand uh this concept

211
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,639
this phenomena here is it a phenomenon a

212
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,639
phenomena

213
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,079
um i should have did that research

214
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,840
should i learned the words right i speak

215
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,758
a lot of english i should know the words

216
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,758
uh but anyway uh you're right nobody

217
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,199
does talk about this a lot so i

218
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,720
appreciate that you think i am a

219
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720
thorough teacher sometimes people say

220
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,639
that i will repeat myself and beat a

221
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
subject into the ground too many times

222
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,560
that's because there are different types

223
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,319
of learners some people learn visually

224
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,399
some people learn hands-on some people

225
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,160
learn by being told some people have to

226
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,000
have the combination of all three some

227
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,319
people need [ __ ] literally beating into

228
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
them so i try to approach a topic

229
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,520
multiple different directions give a few

230
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,279
different ways to learn the same thing

231
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,639
because there are a lot of people

232
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:42,638
watching the show and a lot of people

233
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,840
learning from uh they have different

234
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,519
learning styles i want to make sure to

235
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,799
get everybody i know that stoners have

236
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,959
add

237
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,319
we all we didn't like school because we

238
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,680
had somebody just lecturing us about

239
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,598
some [ __ ] we didn't care about but we

240
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,280
all like to learn we're passionately

241
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,878
curious about stuff we care about i just

242
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,038
didn't care about a lot of the [ __ ] in

243
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,639
school i am rambling this goes on it

244
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,478
says i want to say something about the

245
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,038
process by which cannabis plants

246
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,839
transition themselves from a vegetative

247
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:10,159
stage to a flowering stage outdoors that

248
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,560
is a very good uh conversation to be had

249
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
at this time of year it says

250
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,399
i think and he has think in capital

251
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,719
letters i think it is right to call this

252
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,719
thing that happens as a trait just like

253
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,039
the flowering time is a trait that can

254
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,199
vary between sisters the flower trigger

255
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:27,839
event varies greatly as well from plant

256
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,319
to plant this is my experience anyway

257
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:33,360
typically the equatorial satival sativa

258
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,680
dominant varietals can be put up to a

259
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,000
month earlier than your endica heavy

260
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,439
varietals with no chance of early flower

261
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,879
and a resulting revenge but not always

262
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,240
so this is a great topic if you haven't

263
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,879
followed along to what this person is

264
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,240
saying they are addressing the fact that

265
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,639
um

266
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,919
some plants so there are traits in our

267
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,319
plants let me back up and cover a couple

268
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,719
of things that he said uh aroma is a

269
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,720
trait of the plant potency is a trait of

270
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,759
the plant a characteristic an attribute

271
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,959
of that plant flowering time is a trait

272
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:04,240
of the plant

273
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,359
there's a thing that we haven't talked

274
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,519
about a lot in uh the podcast space

275
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,919
which is called the critical period

276
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,919
critical period is also a trait within

277
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:16,079
the plan i agree with you i believe i

278
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,399
think that you are correct that what is

279
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,399
known as the critical period is a trait

280
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,600
for each plant and what my friend is

281
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,919
talking about

282
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,399
is when we put some plants outside they

283
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,639
will flower sooner than other plants put

284
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,639
outside if you put a heavy indica plant

285
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:33,039
and a heavy sativa plant outside they

286
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,600
will begin to flower at different times

287
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,919
because those plants are from different

288
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,360
parts of the world so uh in one part of

289
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:40,639
the world they had more light in the

290
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,879
other part of the world it got dark

291
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:45,278
sooner and those plants just adapted to

292
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,120
that environment evolution did that that

293
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,720
was just years and years of evolution of

294
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,799
the plant maybe it was breeding maybe it

295
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,959
was evolution ah that's why we've got

296
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,120
autoflower plants autoflowers naturally

297
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,559
happened if you think about in alaska

298
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,839
there are time periods for months and

299
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:59,759
months and months where they don't get

300
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
dark but these plants are growing and

301
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,799
the plants finally said hey i'm just

302
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:04,399
going to [ __ ] flower you're not going

303
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,199
to give me any dark time i'm just going

304
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,200
to flower i'm i'm tired of growing uh a

305
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,360
cannabis plant's main goal is to

306
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,600
reproduce the main goal of our cannabis

307
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,120
plant its goal not our goal we prevent

308
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
this from happening the cannabis plant's

309
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,919
main goal is to produce a seed drop that

310
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,078
seed into the ground to continue its

311
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:24,639
generation next year it's life next year

312
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,239
the next filial generation we interrupt

313
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,838
that process by pulling all the males

314
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,680
out there we don't allow the pollination

315
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
we don't allow the seeds to happen but

316
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:33,838
cannabis plants main goal is to get

317
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,759
pollinated the females main goal is to

318
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,000
get pollinated the main the male's main

319
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,519
goal is to shoot that pollen just like

320
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
people one of our main goals is to

321
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,679
[ __ ] procreate that plant will do

322
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,680
everything it can to procreate like they

323
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,919
say in jurassic park life will find a

324
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:50,399
way life does find a way so we had these

325
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,559
plants in alaska now we they them

326
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
somebody there were plants in alaska

327
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,559
they were growing they never got dark

328
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,839
these plants went hey it's not going to

329
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,278
get dark you want a flower and they had

330
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,120
a meeting and they just [ __ ] decided

331
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,200
to flower and through years and years of

332
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,560
evolution those plants just learned that

333
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,240
it's not going to get dark we got to do

334
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,958
it on our own that's how we got

335
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,799
autoflower plants so that is a trait all

336
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,719
of our cannabis plants have a similar

337
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,039
trait which is known i'm circling back

338
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,519
as the critical period what am i talking

339
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:20,879
about the critical period the critical

340
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,039
period is the amount of continuous dark

341
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:26,159
hours that it would take to trigger our

342
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,519
plant into a flowering phase now most of

343
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,319
us are going to say that's 12 hours

344
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:32,720
right well kinda but

345
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,800
the plants weren't naturally doing 12

346
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,040
hours of darkness and they would flower

347
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,799
that's what we're doing indoors because

348
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,719
that's what worked with the equipment

349
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,120
that we had the lights we were working

350
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,920
with the plants that we happened to have

351
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,078
our forefathers my uncles uh maybe my

352
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,078
uncles uncles probably my uncles were

353
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,479
the guys responsible for selecting all

354
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:54,078
of those plants and they realized we've

355
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,839
got to force them to flower by putting

356
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,278
them in darkness so they probably just

357
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,720
reduce the light they're like well let's

358
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,159
give it four hours and never flower they

359
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,920
gave it six it didn't flower eventually

360
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,838
somebody realized when i give it 12 it

361
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,759
flowers every time

362
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,760
now did we select plants that flower

363
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,919
under that did we breed at that or is

364
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,519
that a natural thing that's uh so these

365
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,360
plants if we leave them outdoors this is

366
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,839
where this is going if we put these

367
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
plants outdoors the plants are going to

368
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,040
flower at different times that would

369
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,720
happen you'll see it happen naturally

370
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,120
indoors but it's not as drastic because

371
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
we've bred these plants to all be grown

372
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
indoors under these indoor conditions

373
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,479
and we've kind of bred the plants to

374
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,320
work with the rooms now we don't make

375
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,000
the rooms work for the plants we've got

376
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,278
so many varieties and so many different

377
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,799
things in the room that we're breeding

378
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,838
the plants to work for the rooms we need

379
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,838
the plants to work in 74 to 84 degrees

380
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,880
with like 30 to 70 humid i know it's a

381
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,160
huge range but that's what we're

382
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,919
breeding them for to work in those

383
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,199
environments so

384
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,078
something that naturally happens with

385
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,440
the plants is outdoors uh so and all of

386
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,120
the plants indoors and outdoors you'll

387
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,959
see it indoors not as drastically if you

388
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,200
put a strong indica and a strong sativa

389
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,039
next to each other and put them on 1212

390
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,560
lighting they will flower at different

391
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,480
rates you'll notice the indica plant

392
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,000
kicks into flower a little bit sooner

393
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,680
that sativa plant takes a little bit

394
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,759
longer to kick into flower but once it

395
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,599
does it really gets going then it takes

396
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,679
16 weeks to finish that indica plant

397
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,360
will be done eight or nine weeks that's

398
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:12,879
a trait and that is a critical it's

399
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,879
called the critical period the amount of

400
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,559
darkness which it takes to trigger that

401
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,399
plant into flower

402
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:20,319
some plants will go into flower with 13

403
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,278
hours of darkness dj short teaches us to

404
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,240
do 11 on 13 off some plants will go into

405
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:28,639
flower with 14 hours of darkness some of

406
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,399
them will go with 10. just we've done

407
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,879
all the breeding to where most of the

408
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,000
plants work with 12 12 also they'll work

409
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,000
with 11 13 either direction now let's

410
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,078
talk about outdoors outdoors we have

411
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,078
some anomalies

412
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,679
we've all noticed this we look outside

413
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,679
we got our clock we got our timer we got

414
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,359
our watch we see the sun come up it was

415
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,519
seven o'clock we see the sun go down

416
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,199
it's 8 30. we're obviously getting more

417
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,600
than 12 hours of daylight outside we're

418
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,198
getting 14 or 15 hours so it is safe to

419
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
put our plants out there a lot of people

420
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,559
move the plants out there they think

421
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,919
it's warm enough if you're in colorado

422
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:00,799
wait a little longer it's going to hail

423
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,399
on you you're going to get your plants

424
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,399
beat to [ __ ] a lot of people are gonna

425
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,078
go out early that's what's gonna happen

426
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,078
they're gonna say i've got 14 hours of

427
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,759
daylight after those plants are outside

428
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,278
for a few days they are going to begin

429
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,278
to flower and people are going to be

430
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,039
very confused there are a few things

431
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,278
that are happening here first of all you

432
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,198
just went from an 18-6 or a 24-hour

433
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,720
light cycle straight outside to less

434
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,319
lighting the plants are confused they're

435
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,920
gonna go into flower kind of stressed

436
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,760
them out kind of shocked them they're

437
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,599
flowering that's just how they they want

438
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,278
to survive they're going something's

439
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,639
wrong we better flower like they just

440
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,240
want to procreate before the end of the

441
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,079
world they think the world might end

442
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,839
they're just trying to get get pregnant

443
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,919
or make something pregnant at that very

444
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,519
last opportunity so that is why they

445
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,879
start flowering possibly you just went

446
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,399
from that indoor light cycle to the

447
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,240
outdoor light cycle it's so different

448
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,519
they freaked out here's another thing

449
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
that is happening

450
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,799
we are thinking we're getting 14 hours

451
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,720
of light however when the sun sets as

452
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,639
the sun begins to set you may see this

453
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,800
with your eye you may not see this with

454
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,879
your eye you may notice that the sky

455
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,519
gets a little bit orange a little bit

456
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,759
red as the sun sets so as the sun sets

457
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,440
it puts off a red spectrum which is

458
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:09,439
known as far red and that spectrum tells

459
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,600
the plants it is time to go to sleep

460
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,600
that triggers something within the plant

461
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,920
called phytochrome red and that

462
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,720
phytochrome red is basically the way

463
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,159
that the far red and phytochrome uh work

464
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,480
together when they touch that is

465
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,559
basically nyquil or ambient for your

466
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,480
plants it goes night [ __ ] and they go

467
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,239
oh look far red let's trigger

468
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,159
phytochrome and then they go to sleep it

469
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,159
just puts the plants to sleep so that

470
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,559
triggers them to go to sleep earlier

471
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,319
than when that darkness happens in the

472
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,518
indoor grow unless you've got one of

473
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
those new lights with the far red

474
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,519
lighting which they just started adding

475
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,679
a couple of years ago big up to that but

476
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,159
until then we did not have far red

477
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,838
lighting indoors so we had to turn off

478
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,759
the light and at that point the plants

479
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,079
were not asleep it takes them an hour or

480
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,320
two to actually fall asleep completely

481
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,479
and begin their dark cycle the night

482
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,560
cycle process takes a little bit to kick

483
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,720
in so they couldn't kick that in until

484
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,000
an hour or two after we actually put

485
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,000
them to sleep

486
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,320
okay i do apologize i was interrupted by

487
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,480
a delivery i am back on track now i do

488
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,320
not remember where i was i know i was

489
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,079
talking about phytochrome red i was

490
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,519
talking about the different plants going

491
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,439
into flower at different rates i'm not

492
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,360
exactly sure so we're going to jump in

493
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,800
right here a lot of people are growing

494
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,720
sativas a lot of people are growing and

495
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,559
because most people are growing straight

496
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,278
hybrids at this point most of your

497
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,958
sativas are going to take 16 weeks ish

498
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,799
to fill to finish out if they're a real

499
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,399
that's what i mean by a sativa most of

500
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,078
your indica stuff is your eight or nine

501
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,679
maybe maybe the 10 weaker stuff with

502
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,278
that big fat leaf that's the indica

503
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,278
stuff you're going to notice that some

504
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,120
of those plants will go into flower

505
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,519
earlier outdoors and some will go into

506
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
flower later outdoors that is called the

507
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,560
critical period you've got to get that

508
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,638
critical period of the right amount of

509
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:49,359
darkness for each plant and that's going

510
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,959
to be dependent on where that plant came

511
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,039
from where did the parent plants come

512
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,399
from which part of the world did that

513
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,360
plant start from now with all the

514
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,720
breeding

515
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
you've got plants that are they got

516
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,240
parents from all over the place so it

517
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,079
just kind of depends on which phenotype

518
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,519
it leans toward i do have some notes i

519
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:04,879
want to make sure i get onto all my

520
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,400
notes here because i haven't looked at

521
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,240
my notes at all i've just been talking

522
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,240
off the top of my head what we were

523
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,880
talking about here is the critical

524
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,798
period this could be very different

525
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,559
between different phenotypes if you've

526
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,959
got a pack of seeds and you put them

527
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,240
outside one may flower much earlier than

528
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,640
the other that is just different

529
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,000
phenotypes that is expression that's all

530
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,199
about uh the genetic location and origin

531
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,880
of that plant that's what i was just

532
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,640
talking about where did that plant come

533
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,360
from if you've got a plant that came

534
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,120
from alaska it may autoflower on you

535
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,798
some plants may flower as soon as you

536
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:38,879
give them a little bit of darkness some

537
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,079
may need a lot more darkness to trigger

538
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,760
into flower that's just going to be

539
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,599
genetics that's just like a lot of other

540
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,119
parts of our plants sometimes the plants

541
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,000
want more calmag sometimes they want

542
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:50,079
more nitrogen sometimes they need more

543
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,839
dark period that's how we've got

544
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:53,839
autoflower plants i touched on that at

545
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,678
the beginning uh they're autoflower

546
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,439
plants because up in alaska it just

547
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,600
wasn't getting dark up there in certain

548
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,279
parts of russia it wasn't getting dark

549
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:02,798
so the plants were just like hey we got

550
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,160
to do something dude or we're just not

551
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,240
going to be able to get to the party and

552
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,038
they wanted to party just like we all do

553
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,440
uh we chose 1212 because uh that seems

554
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:14,000
to be what works for most plants like i

555
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,038
touched on a minute ago you can do 11 13

556
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,880
either direction 11 on 11 off 13 on 13

557
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,960
off as long as you got a 24 hour light

558
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,000
cycle right there you could do 11 13.

559
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,600
i've seen 10 14 both directions it's all

560
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,919
about trying it with your plants and

561
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:29,439
what works best for your plants you guys

562
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,919
you've heard me talk about switching my

563
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,240
light cycle to 18 6 at the end don't be

564
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,679
afraid um a lot of people think that

565
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,279
when i talk about experiments

566
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:40,000
experimenting with my plants i'm talking

567
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:42,000
about doing this in like a 25 by 25 room

568
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
with [ __ ] 25 lights in there that's

569
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,880
not how i do it when i'm doing

570
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,558
experiments i do in a little teeny tiny

571
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,200
space where i can't ruin a whole bunch

572
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,720
of [ __ ] at one time so get one light and

573
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,400
a few plants and just experiment with

574
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,679
those we're not going to get better

575
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,480
we're not going to learn anything we're

576
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,038
not going to advance improve uh

577
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,480
if we don't practice try and fail you've

578
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,720
got to have some failures and some

579
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,240
successes to become better at anything

580
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,759
if it's growing weed if it's

581
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,919
skateboarding if it's playing music if

582
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,519
it's karate if it's ballet whatever

583
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,038
you're doing you've got to fail a couple

584
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,200
of times i got to learn everything the

585
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,720
hard way if you don't have some failures

586
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,960
you're not going to learn anything do a

587
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,720
lot of experiments try a lot take a lot

588
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,880
of notes but don't do it in your big

589
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,640
space do that all in a small space and a

590
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,240
small practice area if you don't

591
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,440
practice if you don't try new [ __ ]

592
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,038
you're not going to learn anything

593
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,960
you've got to fail occasionally i've

594
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,720
done full podcast episodes about

595
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,000
mistakes that i've made don't be afraid

596
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,640
to make some mistakes alright there's

597
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,400
more to this i do think that as lighting

598
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,880
and equipment evolves i think that light

599
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,080
cycles will evolve as well i've seen

600
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,840
other people playing with different

601
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,079
light cycles since we're getting the

602
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,079
proper light the proper spectrum

603
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,000
we've got far red lighting we've got all

604
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,759
we can cover just about any color of

605
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,480
lighting we can replicate it any color

606
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,240
spectrum we can make that with expensive

607
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,480
lighting or affordable lighting i think

608
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,079
as the lighting evolves so will some of

609
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,079
the schedules we're able to give the

610
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,158
plants all the photons all the energy

611
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,839
that it needs so that'll let it get more

612
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,760
sleeping time because it's getting the

613
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,839
dli which i need to do a podcast about

614
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,359
dli but that's uh there's some equations

615
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,720
to be done that i don't understand all

616
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,399
the math but i know what it means if

617
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,240
that makes any sense but with the

618
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,000
technology the plants will be getting

619
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,960
their dli which means we'll be able to

620
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,359
give them

621
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,640
maybe longer sleep periods

622
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,079
who knows how it'll work out but we're

623
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,400
going to learn a lot more with the

624
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,839
evolution of technology i did say that a

625
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,440
lot of the gear we have a lot of the

626
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,959
plants we have a lot of the selections

627
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,120
we have now are because of our

628
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,480
forefathers who did not have the best

629
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:33,678
technology they didn't have the internet

630
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,798
they didn't have par meters they didn't

631
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,559
have led lighting we've come so far and

632
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,400
also they didn't have legalization we've

633
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:41,839
got legalization on our side they

634
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,200
couldn't even talk about growing wheat

635
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,639
if they're going to grow weed they

636
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,400
didn't have the internet to do research

637
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,080
they didn't have a bro to talk about it

638
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,759
they just had to do it and hope not to

639
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,359
get busted and see how it goes and try

640
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,440
again they were learning it all from

641
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,359
scratch we're a little spoiled now i

642
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,880
like to say we're blessed we're cheating

643
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,959
back in the day you had to be secretive

644
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
you didn't have the internet and it was

645
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
not legal at all now we got the [ __ ]

646
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,558
internet and it's legal we are cheating

647
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,799
uh but i think there will be a lot of

648
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:08,480
evolution in the technology in the

649
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,279
growing and light cycles now that we've

650
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,360
got uh more technology and legalization

651
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,839
and the internet on our side i think

652
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:17,759
i've covered up all of my notes i talked

653
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,599
about far red i talked about phytochrome

654
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,519
red i said that's basically plant

655
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,439
sleeping pills let's talk about the

656
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,918
opposite end of that spectrum in the

657
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,159
morning the plant the sun puts off a

658
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,240
bluish colored light and guess what that

659
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,159
one does that works like an alarm clock

660
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
it says wake up [ __ ] it is time to

661
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,600
get moving and it wakes up all your

662
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,279
plants and they get the day started that

663
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,359
is the blue light that comes from the

664
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,519
sunrise so you get the blue and the

665
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:43,519
sunrise the red and the sunset that

666
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,679
dictates a lot of the plants movement

667
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,200
and actions through the rest of the day

668
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,280
all right i think that is all i've got

669
