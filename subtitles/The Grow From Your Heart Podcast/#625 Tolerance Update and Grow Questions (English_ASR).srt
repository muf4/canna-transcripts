forward slash grow from your heart all

52
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,478
right in a recent episode i did talk

53
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,879
about

54
00:01:34,478 --> 00:01:37,759
having what i was calling tolerance

55
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:39,359
swings

56
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,040
i was mentioning that sometimes i can

57
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,759
buy a gram of concentrates and let's be

58
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
real i never buy a gram of concentrates

59
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,959
i always buy several grams of

60
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:47,758
concentrates let's just be honest with

61
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,000
each other here

62
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,599
but when i buy concentrates sometimes i

63
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,599
get home and i smoke

64
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,039
a gram of concentrates and i'm like i

65
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:55,679
really wish i would have gotten a better

66
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
buzz

67
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640
and it has nothing to do with the

68
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:00,239
concentrates because i'm buying the same

69
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
brand all the time

70
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:03,920
i prefer a certain brand i like a

71
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,200
certain little range of flavors which

72
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,359
they offer

73
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,800
so the concentrates are consistent then

74
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,560
there will be some days

75
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,000
when i can open up that same jar of

76
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,039
concentrate and take just

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,959
you know like a maybe a 0.25 maybe a 0.2

78
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,519
of a gram of a dab out of that thing

79
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,598
and just be completely obliterated my

80
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,959
eyes get heavy they get red time starts

81
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:24,479
traveling funny i can't remember what

82
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,280
the [ __ ] i was thinking about

83
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,079
so i have what i call drastic tolerance

84
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,759
swings

85
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
one day i can look at the jar of dabs

86
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:32,959
and get [ __ ] wrecked one day i can

87
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
smoke the whole jar of dabs all of the

88
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,719
dabs and not get a proper buzz

89
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:38,159
there are several things that i think

90
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,120
contribute to that a lot of them are

91
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:40,959
health-wise

92
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,719
i realized maybe i was catching a cold

93
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,120
when i was getting that super

94
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,759
low tolerance time period for a week

95
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,120
there

96
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,399
had a little bit of a sniffle that was

97
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,439
rude to do into the microphone but it

98
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
was a good example

99
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,878
i was getting a little bit of a sniffle

100
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,920
there i noticed i was taking a nap more

101
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,280
than usual

102
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:56,719
so i may have been fighting off a little

103
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,519
bit of a cold that may have been

104
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,680
affecting

105
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,959
my cannabis tolerance just getting extra

106
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,400
high because there were other things

107
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,239
happening in my body

108
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,239
uh also i've noticed my levels of

109
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,719
hydration have a lot to do

110
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,439
with how buzzed i get from cannabis if

111
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:11,280
i've been drinking

112
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,719
sugary and sweet drinks maybe i've had

113
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,800
some juice or something

114
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,239
uh maybe i've had i don't drink a lot of

115
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,640
sugary junky crap but

116
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,599
if i've had too much uh sugary foods or

117
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,598
snacks or something

118
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,799
juice with a lot of sugar in it a real

119
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,399
fruity kombucha

120
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,599
i got that high blood sugar i can't get

121
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
the proper buzz because i'm just

122
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:29,359
competing with the sugar

123
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
uh if i've eaten a big fat fatty meal

124
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,080
with a bunch of rice and a bunch of

125
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,639
noodles and stuff

126
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,719
sometimes the dabs make me more lazy

127
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,399
then they will give me a nice head buzz

128
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,080
so a lot of it has to do with diet with

129
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,760
my intake with my other things i'm

130
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,040
putting into my body what i'm reacting

131
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,280
with responding to

132
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,798
hydration is one of the major issues in

133
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,959
my dab ability

134
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
if i'm not properly hydrated i can't

135
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,239
take a big dab

136
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,280
because my lungs say bro what are you

137
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,680
doing

138
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,680
if i'm well hydrated if i've had several

139
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,760
glasses or bottles of water today

140
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,280
and i take a big fat dab my lungs go

141
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:02,318
yeah dude you're nice and hydrated you

142
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,919
can

143
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:05,359
use that dryness into your lungs and

144
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,399
it's not going to be a big deal so a lot

145
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
of it is

146
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,158
physical a lot of it is what i'm putting

147
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
into my body to go along with the dabs

148
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,840
to prepare for the dabs and recover from

149
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,160
the subsequent dabs

150
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,600
another thing that people chimed in with

151
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,160
the most common

152
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,799
response and reaction and comment was

153
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,199
company

154
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:25,039
have a lot to do with your dabs in your

155
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,720
response to consuming cannabis

156
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
when you're by yourself and you smoke or

157
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,000
you eat edibles you don't have anybody

158
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,120
to look over and go dude are you as

159
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,720
[ __ ] high as me

160
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,560
or dude did you even get anything off of

161
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,320
those edibles you don't have that

162
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,918
you don't have anybody to ask anybody to

163
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,279
laugh at or compare it to or to give you

164
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,079
hints it's just you trying to figure

165
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,000
life out

166
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:43,758
you may not even notice uh and this is

167
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
gonna segue into the next part here

168
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,120
you might not even notice how high you

169
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,080
are until you change your environment a

170
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,399
lot of people said

171
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,519
uh environment and setting have a lot to

172
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,679
do with your buzz

173
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,519
uh your and your environment will give

174
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
you a phenotypical expression on your

175
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,359
buzz that's just a grow room joke

176
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
but environment and setting have a lot

177
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,000
to do with it i've noticed if i dab

178
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,758
right here

179
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,038
or if i dab in the other office space

180
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,720
which you guys are familiar with if

181
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,000
you've seen my live videos or seen me on

182
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,199
other shows i've got another office

183
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,199
space in which i

184
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,240
uh frequently take dabs and hang out do

185
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,560
recordings in there

186
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
if i hang out in those spaces my

187
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,000
tolerance is unlimited because i don't

188
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
have to do anything except to deal with

189
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,800
my personal space i know where this

190
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,720
microphone is

191
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,079
i know where this table is this chair is

192
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,639
secure i'm safe

193
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,478
in my office space i've got a nice chill

194
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,160
super comfy office chair i've got all

195
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:31,439
the music i can imagine i got a nice

196
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,520
sound set up in there

197
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,038
i got the air pods in my ears there's a

198
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:36,959
couch in there nothing could go wrong

199
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,800
there's a change of clothes in there

200
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,478
are a bunch of sneakers it's a chill

201
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,680
place nothing could go wrong in my

202
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:43,599
little chill areas

203
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,038
so sometimes i'll take a bunch of dabs

204
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,560
and for the sake of telling a story that

205
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,478
a lot of people are going to listen to

206
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,478
i'll call my uber driver and they'll

207
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,319
come pick me up

208
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,279
as soon as i get in that uber i think to

209
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,038
myself holy [ __ ] i'm high as

210
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,318
[ __ ] but when i was chilling in the

211
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,439
office or chilling at the recording

212
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,120
studio space

213
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,038
i didn't even notice how buzzed i was i

214
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,720
was cool everything was going just fine

215
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,639
and then i walked outside and felt that

216
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,880
outside air hit my skin and i went

217
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,400
oh [ __ ] and the neighbor across the way

218
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,918
said what's up ross to jeff and i went

219
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,599
hey bro and realized

220
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,519
i'm talking in slow motion and hearing

221
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
in 3d and then you get in the uber and

222
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,879
the uber driver is like where you going

223
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,318
you're like i don't [ __ ] know dude i

224
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,079
typed that in a minute ago and already

225
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,919
forgot where are you taking me

226
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,439
like you don't realize until you change

227
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,639
your setting and your environment and

228
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,918
then you get somewhere

229
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,759
how many times have you thought you were

230
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,279
cool maybe you go somewhere and

231
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,560
allegedly hypothetically

232
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,000
you drive too and i'm just going to say

233
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,519
in high school back in the day where i'm

234
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,959
from we all went to the mall i like to

235
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,399
go hit the mall on saturdays and buy

236
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,758
some sneakers go see if there's any new

237
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:42,159
sneaker drops

238
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,000
uh so sometimes allegedly you drive to

239
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,319
the mall you get to the mall parking lot

240
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
you

241
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,280
roll a fat one up or maybe you burn it

242
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,639
on the way to the mall whatever you do

243
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,000
right you smoke on the way to the mall

244
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,439
and you think i'm legit

245
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,120
you get out of the car the cloud comes

246
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,719
out of the car you all giggle you

247
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,399
[ __ ] put in eye drops like nobody's

248
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,759
gonna notice that all six of you are

249
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,359
walking around smelling like a [ __ ]

250
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
dispensary in the mall giggling at

251
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,479
stupid [ __ ] looking stoned in there

252
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,160
you think you're getting away with it

253
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,279
but it's cool anyway you walk into the

254
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
mall and then you realize

255
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,719
oh my goodness there are people in here

256
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,639
and there are stores

257
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,400
and there are lights and i'm so high

258
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,079
that it's almost uncomfortable but it's

259
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,799
really fun because i like that sort of a

260
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,159
thing

261
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,079
i've noticed that when i change my

262
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
setting my environment my surroundings i

263
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:22,879
really get a different buzz

264
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,478
i've noticed that when we used to go to

265
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,800
city council meetings

266
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,560
i would get the most paranoid weird

267
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
anxiety ridden buzz

268
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,759
and it was cool because i could have

269
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,318
cannabis you weren't supposed to take it

270
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,000
in there

271
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,759
but i mean i could be around cannabis i

272
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,800
could be stoned i was a medical cannabis

273
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,800
patient there

274
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,160
talking about medical cannabis i was

275
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
definitely consuming

276
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,439
uh between work and the meetings so i

277
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,038
was going in and

278
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,560
uh they knew that i smelled like

279
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,240
cannabis and looked like cannabis and

280
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,160
for some reason that buzz was

281
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,519
just so [ __ ] nerve-wracking being in

282
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,120
there super high

283
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,399
i probably would not have enjoyed it as

284
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,160
much it probably would have been even

285
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,120
more nerve-wracking if i wasn't nice and

286
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,199
blazed

287
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,038
so then there are places that i go that

288
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,639
i feel just totally [ __ ] i don't even

289
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:03,598
notice that i'm blazed once i get to the

290
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,360
dispensary

291
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,800
i'm like what's up guys and gals because

292
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,000
my friends work at all the dispensaries

293
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,960
where i shop and i'm just hanging out

294
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,639
with my bros

295
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,159
hanging out with my friends i gotta show

296
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,519
my idea and give them money but we all

297
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,960
know each other we say what's up it's a

298
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,240
fist bump situation

299
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,239
so when i'm at the dispensary i don't

300
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
notice how buzzed i am get back in the

301
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,280
car to drive in the get in the uber

302
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,119
again to get back home and then i'm like

303
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,559
dude you're going too fast and he's like

304
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,879
i'm parked bro

305
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,839
like it's just all about setting

306
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,879
scenario

307
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,918
location that is a huge uh contributing

308
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,158
factor to

309
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,158
the buzz which i feel like a lot of us

310
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:37,599
receive uh who you're with imagine if

311
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:39,599

312
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,039
uh some people and not to sound that way

313
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
some people do meet me and smoke with me

314
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:44,000
and they act all starstruck and weird

315
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,278
that's really funny to me

316
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,958
but then smoking with me you've got

317
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:47,759
nothing to worry about like i'm not the

318
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,759

332
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,800
if you got a cool lawyer you might get

333
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,838
to smoke some dabs with your lawyer but

334
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,000
it's all about who

335
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,519
and where what you're smoking uh

336
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,958
sometimes in the car you got that little

337
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,240
protective bubble as soon as you get out

338
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,319
of the car you're not in that bubble

339
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,039
life is weird out there it's lots of

340
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,240
environment

341
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,519
you think you're fine until you pull up

342
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,879
to the drive-through window and try to

343
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,159
order you guys be careful if you're

344
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,919
smoking in the car these are all just

345
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:31,360
hypothetical funny ideas that i may or

346
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:32,559
may not have experienced in my high

347
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,959
school days

348
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,719
um another thing that heavily in my

349
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,639
opinion contributes to

350
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,160
uh the buzz which i receive can from

351
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,000
consuming my cannabis

352
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,519
is not only the product the product is

353
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
definitely a huge factor i've said that

354
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,120
i've got my favorite brands

355
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,959
i've got a few brands i really select

356
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
and support uh none of them sponsor the

357
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,679
show they don't pay me to talk about

358
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,959
them i just like to buy the products

359
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:54,639
because they taste good they smoke well

360
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,799
they give me a good buzz

361
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,080
uh most of the time i buy green dot labs

362
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:00,000
uh the live batter

363
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,278
uh part of the time i buy the binsk

364
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,399
batter because it tastes good and it

365
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:03,679
gives me a nice buzz

366
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,278
there are a couple more that i'll buy

367
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,879
just in the periphery if those are ran

368
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,600
out or sold out or whatever

369
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,439
but that's what i prefer um those

370
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,278
products give me a nice buzz if i get

371
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,680
something and i like the batters

372
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,600
when i smoke the diamonds the buzz comes

373
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,319
on real fast real strong it's more of a

374
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,480
head sweat

375
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,240
[ __ ] bug-eyed sort of a thing

376
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
sometimes that's what i'm after

377
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,680
so that's a different sort of a buzz the

378
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,360
product is what i'm talking about

379
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,719
shatter gives me a completely different

380
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,519
buzz than the

381
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,240
diamonds the sauce or the batter smoking

382
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,879
flour

383
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,240
is a completely different buzz i like to

384
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,759
carry a pipe around

385
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,200
uh when i'm doing chores around the

386
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:40,399
house if i'm just cleaning up if i'm

387
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,079
cooking food

388
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,000
if i'm cleaning up from cooking food if

389
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,120
i'm chopping vegetables just got a pipe

390
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,639
sitting there and i just [ __ ] take a

391
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,759
rip off the pipe there's usually a pipe

392
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:49,120
within reach just

393
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,039
like a little security blanket just to

394
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,039
keep the little buzz going it doesn't

395
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,120
give me what i need from a dab but it'll

396
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,759
make the dab last a little longer so the

397
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,278
product

398
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,120
and then what i was going to get to next

399
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,200
is the device

400
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
my favorite rig i'm going to say that

401
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,839
sentence again because i feel like i

402
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,879
slurred that one all out

403
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
my favorite rig gives me a completely

404
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,799
different buzz

405
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,799
than my non-favorite rig my first place

406
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,319
rig hits way better than my second place

407
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,000
rig i love my second and third place

408
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,240
rigs i've got a lot of rigs

409
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,839
but my first place rig is first place

410
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,079
for a reason

411
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,519
uh something about the ritual of the way

412
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:25,120
it fits in my hand

413
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,720
the way the mouthpiece fits against my

414
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,679
mouth the way that the

415
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,480
carb cap reaches the way that the dabber

416
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,039
reaches

417
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
not it's far enough away from my eyes to

418
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:35,360
where i don't look cross-eyed trying to

419
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,519
get the dabber

420
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,680
into the banger uh and then when i go to

421
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,440
carb cabba cap it it's not too far away

422
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,278
from my face but it's not so big that

423
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,200
it's cumbersome

424
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,240
my rig is my favorite rig and it gives

425
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,200
me the most beautiful hits i know that

426
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
rig i know

427
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,959
how hard to pull i know how hard to draw

428
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,320
i know how long to draw i know how to

429
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,078
wiggle the carb cap

430
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,680
i know exactly how much water to put

431
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,199
into it i know

432
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,359
when i've bitten off more than i can

433
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,720
chew and i should stop pulling so hard

434
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,440
or pull a little bit harder with that

435
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,120
rig

436
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,560
that rig is my favorite and i talk about

437
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,399
it a lot i show it off a lot

438
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,679
i'll pop a picture in right now so that

439
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,679
you guys can see the rig i'm talking

440
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,519
about but that's the rig i love to hit

441
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,799
ah it feels really nice on my lungs

442
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,839
gives me a good dab

443
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,359
when i hit other rigs sometimes i don't

444
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,200
even feel like i got a nice hit got a

445
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,959
nice buzz because i'm like ah this rig

446
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
sucks or whatever the nail is too small

447
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,838
the mouthpiece is shaped

448
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,519
funny i don't like the little peepee

449
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,360
shaped mouthpiece if it's like a

450
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,720
a peepee shape if it's phallic shaped

451
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,399
and it's got the little hole in it

452
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,959
and i have to make a kissy shaped face

453
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,958
to hit it i feel like the size dabs i

454
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:37,439
take i get a lot of concentrate built up

455
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,039
on

456
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,560
the kissy face part of my lips and my

457
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,599
lips get all sticky and they get all red

458
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,799
and i look all weird

459
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,079
and then i walk around doing this for

460
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,078
the next 20 minutes with my lips i'm

461
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,359
just going

462
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,559
because i got that sticky [ __ ] on my

463
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,919
lips and act like a little kid don't

464
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,359
know what the [ __ ] to do with it

465
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,838
so i don't like the peepee shaped

466
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,919
tapered skinny uh skinny mouth rigs i

467
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,120
prefer a flared out trumpet mouthpiece

468
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:58,639
style rig

469
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,000
that i can just put over my mouth and

470
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,440
then i know that the smoke is getting in

471
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,679
there and i don't have to make that

472
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
uh duck face peepee suck face whatever

473
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,359
face you're talking about

474
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,200
so sometimes somebody's rigged i'll take

475
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
a dab of really quality concentrates and

476
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,759
i know it's a fat

477
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,919
dab and i'm like where'd all that smoke

478
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,360
go where's my dab dude what happened

479
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:17,278
and i don't know their nail i don't know

480
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,519
their carb cap i don't know their rig

481
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,120
and so the nail is too hot or too cold i

482
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,000
don't cap it properly i don't hit it at

483
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,440
the right time

484
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,799
and then also the rig just sucks it

485
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,079
doesn't bubble right there's too much

486
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:28,399
too little water in there

487
00:13:26,078 --> 00:13:29,439
i don't feel like i got a good dab then

488
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,278
occasionally

489
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,120
i'm gonna i'm gonna give praise right

490
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,120
after i complain just because this does

491
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,959
happen too in reality in life

492
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
occasionally somebody will hand me a dab

493
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:39,599
and a rig and they'll be like you want

494
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,720
to hit my new rig and i'll be like that

495
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
looks all fancy

496
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,639
and i'll go in to take a hit and that

497
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,399
rig will uppercut me in the dick and it

498
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,120
will be one of the best dabs i've ever

499
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,120
had

500
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,959
so it's kind of unpredictable sometimes

501
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,560
with the rig it depends on the shape of

502
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,919
the rig the quality of the rig who made

503
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:55,198
the rig has a lot to do with it there

504
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:56,000
are some makers out there that really

505
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,719
focus on good

506
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,039
getting a good fat rip some people want

507
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,839
to

508
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,399
and this is all opinion based some

509
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,440
people

510
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,440
in my opinion like or want too many

511
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,959
bubbles and spinnies and functions and

512
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,959
twists and turns and

513
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,198
[ __ ] fancy ways for the water to go

514
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,799
and drains and spouts and twisties and i

515
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,240
said twisty too many times

516
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,399
but they want all these directions and

517
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,399
cool flows and recycles and end cycles

518
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,320
and out cycles and donuts and [ __ ]

519
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
that's cool but in my opinion every one

520
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,839
of those twists turns

521
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,919
ands out steals a little bit of my dab

522
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,680
it seals the airflow it steals the

523
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,838
the terps it steals the resin and it's

524
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,559
more to clean just not for me i like a

525
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,800
dab

526
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,399
that goes from the banger to the water

527
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,319
to where it cools off a little bit

528
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,519
doesn't splash me in my mouth and then

529
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,079
into my brain

530
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,320
so that it's just like dab and uppercut

531
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:44,879
oh i'm stoned that's what i want from it

532
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,720
so

533
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,480
um i got off on a huge ramble on there

534
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
but the rig the [ __ ]

535
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,000
setting the environment that rig has a

536
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,198
lot to do with it in my opinion is where

537
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,399
i was headed a lot of people like a

538
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,399
really ornate rig

539
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,399
i prefer a simple rig punch me in the

540
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,759
face get me going so

541
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,600
who you're hanging out with will have a

542
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,439
lot to do with it if you smoke with me

543
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,959
or if you smoke with your [ __ ] lawyer

544
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,440
or if you smoke with a judge

545
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,399
probably gonna cop a different buzz

546
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,959
environment

547
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,000
if you're smoking before you go into a

548
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,078
rock concert or

549
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
a dispensary totally chill you shouldn't

550
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,759
be paranoid at all if you smoke before

551
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,040
you go into court or walk into the bank

552
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:20,399
you're probably going to get the sweats

553
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,838
you're probably going to get the armpit

554
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,120
sweats and a little bit of anxiety it's

555
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,279
all about setting it's all about where

556
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,278
you're going

557
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,879
then also the rig and the product are

558
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,078
gonna have a lot to do with the buzz

559
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,600
then what you've eaten what you've

560
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:33,278
consumed your physical health your

561
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,839
mental health are going to have a lot to

562
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,879
do

563
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,120
with how that buzz comes on to you i

564
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,639
really really talked a lot longer than i

565
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,159
meant to about that part so

566
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,079
this is the part where i'm going to jump

567
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,159
into some patreon questions

568
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,838
i've gotten a lot of like short random

569
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,198
patreon questions that have just been

570
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,880
sitting around so i

571
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:52,879
kind of just compiled a few of them a

572
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,078
couple come from people that are uh they

573
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,439
send me a lot of questions

574
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,278
a couple of these are from brand new

575
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,839
people i'm just gonna go through a few

576
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:59,360
of these

577
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
and see if i can't knock out a couple

578
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,159
pages of these just like short random

579
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:04,078
questions

580
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,360
i think the first two came from the same

581
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,679
person so with

582
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,120
less rambling a little less talk a

583
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,000
little more action let's jump into the

584
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,159
first one

585
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,320
it says here is a question for you ross

586
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,879
to jeff sometimes i hear you talk about

587
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,959
rubbing

588
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,240
the stems of the male plant as you

589
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,879
describe the odors

590
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,079
in very vivid and graphic terms yes some

591
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,600
of my terms are very

592
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,919
graphic then it says are we to take from

593
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,278
this

594
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:32,719
that terpene profiles are male dominant

595
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:34,320
traits so let's talk about this question

596
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,320
when i do talk about selecting male

597
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,160
plants and also female plants

598
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,839
i like to rub the stem of the plant the

599
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:41,439
stock of the plant so you got

600
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,360
the [ __ ] base of the plant and i've

601
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,560
lolly popped that probably a few inches

602
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,278
and then the branches come up and

603
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,198
whatever

604
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,720
a lot of times i'll just grab that naked

605
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,159
stock of the plant just pinch it with my

606
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,560
fingers and rub it give it a little

607
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:53,439
a little rub and tug and then smell my

608
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:56,319
fingers

609
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,600
and i notice a lot in those aromas that

610
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,199
come off of there that's not what the

611
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,759
plant is going to smell like when it's

612
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:01,359
finished

613
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,800
that's not what the final product will

614
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,640
smell like but it tells me a little bit

615
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,240
of what the ingredients i'm working with

616
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,400
now smell like

617
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,078
and from experience from being a breeder

618
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,798
that's done this a lot

619
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,399
i know what the now flavor the now smell

620
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:15,279
will turn into later and what it

621
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,720
translates to

622
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:21,599
into the breeding project so i know

623
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,959
that in my opinion a male plant that

624
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,759
smells acrid

625
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,519
like vomit like bar trash can like that

626
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,759
fermented bar trash can if you've ever

627
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,679
had to take out the trash at the bar

628
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,359
if you've ever taken up the trash at the

629
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,519
bowling alley or somewhere that serves

630
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:37,519
booze and food

631
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,359
there's this acrid smell on the bottom

632
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,400
of the trash can that's just

633
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:46,000
it's fermented it's funky it's putrid

634
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,440
that smell in a male plant translates to

635
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,720
gassy uh funky burnt rubber

636
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:55,120
tennis ball cushy stinky aromas

637
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,798
when you breed with that plant so that's

638
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:57,279
why i talk about rubbing the male of the

639
00:17:56,798 --> 00:17:59,119
plant

640
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,319
i give it a little rub and tug straight

641
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,319
up smell my fingers

642
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,918
and observe what i've smelled then try

643
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,519
to hit the fingers with rubbing alcohol

644
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,120
get all that smell off of there rub them

645
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,079
on your jeans or on your khakis real

646
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,399
hard

647
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,678
use your other hand smell another plant

648
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,038
then clean that hand again and then

649
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,880
hopefully by now the terps are gone from

650
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,319
both hands you go back and repeat the

651
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,840
process you could smell a few plants and

652
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,759
see what you're working with

653
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,038
one will [ __ ] stand out even if you

654
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,319
don't clean your fingers enough

655
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:26,079
one of them will make you go ooh

656
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,558
go with your heart go with your body go

657
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:30,240
with your uh your senses that's like

658
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,678
your your body knows when you need

659
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,960
something desire something wants

660
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,600
something when something's gonna work

661
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
for you

662
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,719
uh when you smell oranges you go that

663
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:37,918
smells good because there's vitamins in

664
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,279
there when you smell poop

665
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,200
your body goes i probably shouldn't eat

666
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,720
that because that's waste we've got pro

667
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,080
we're programmed to know what our body

668
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,839
wants so go with the one

669
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,000
uh that your nose tells you tells you to

670
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,159
go with i did a podcast

671
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,038
maybe six years ago that's called follow

672
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,798
your nose

673
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,319
because your nose always knows that's

674
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,359
what you can sam taught us and it's

675
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,759
still accurate

676
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,199
uh follow your nose because your nose is

677
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,480
one of your biggest receptors that can

678
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,160
tell your body what's good for you and

679
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,160
what's bad for you like i just said

680
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
oranges smell good for a reason poopoo

681
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,640
smells bad for a reason

682
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,720
now the question is are we to take from

683
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,520
this that terpenes are male

684
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,558
dominant traits no that is not what i

685
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,960
mean by that

686
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,879
um i just know what that male trait

687
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,759
delivers to the mix and i know that i've

688
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,880
had success

689
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:24,319
using uh that ingredient so

690
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,320
a lot of our when you're chefing you

691
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,839
need to use butter and cream or

692
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,279
two other things i can't think of right

693
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,279
now that would mix well but butter and

694
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,960
cream mix well every [ __ ] time right

695
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,558
uh or salt and cream i'm [ __ ] that

696
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,038
all up anyway you gotta salt the cream

697
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,678
right

698
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,038
so if you've got a plant that [ __ ] uh

699
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,559
you can always count on that male plant

700
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,000
that smells like puke to be your cream

701
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:43,200
it's always gonna work with most things

702
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,720
or it's always gonna be your

703
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,240
your butter you can butter up almost

704
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
everything it's always gonna work so

705
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,480
that's

706
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,079
it's just chefing in my opinion i've had

707
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,519
good that may have been a terrible

708
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:53,199
[ __ ] analogy i may have lost

709
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,599
everybody with that but you know me

710
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,640
um so i just think that it's like

711
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,480
cheffing and i know

712
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,400
that that's a good starter that's a good

713
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,319
base that's a good color palette to bust

714
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,360
out to start with it will mix well with

715
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,678
a lot of things

716
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,439
it will complement a lot of things uh

717
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,400
that muted puke

718
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,480
flavor uh is like kind of on the darker

719
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,000
grayer side if you think in colors

720
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,839
and if you mix it with the pinks and

721
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,798
blues which you get from like strawberry

722
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,399
blueberry

723
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,960
oranges which you'd get from orange

724
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,480
flavored terps it allows them to mingle

725
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,079
very well together then you get that

726
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,000
dark color with the lighter color and it

727
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,319
brings out the best of both worlds

728
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,599
that's a little view into my weird

729
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,158
thought process on

730
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,359
colors and flavors and chefing and

731
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,200
creating strains

732
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,639
i just know that that puke flavored

733
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,038
trait uh

734
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
evolves or translates into good things

735
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:42,240
in the future i know that

736
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,519
if you've got a male plant that smells

737
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,159
acrid and sour

738
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,839
that you get that weird uh swampy cushy

739
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,559
flavor in the end if it's got berries at

740
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,158
the start

741
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,359
it's going to have way too much berries

742
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,720
in the flavor in the end that's just

743
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,839
something i know from working with a lot

744
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,640
of male plants

745
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:58,240
so rub those males rub the females see

746
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,038
what they work see what they smell like

747
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,279
see what they turn

748
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,480
into once you work with them a few times

749
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:04,639
you'll get familiar with it you'll say

750
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,279
when it smells like berries at the start

751
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,799
when it's got this uh watermelon smell

752
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,678
or strawberry smell at the beginning it

753
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,038
turns into

754
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,480
grapefruits at the end or something

755
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:12,960
you'll notice that you'll start to learn

756
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,480
that

757
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,000
that's just all from growing the same

758
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,159
plants over and over

759
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,440
and over again all right thank you for

760
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,880
that great question my friend i'm going

761
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,640
to move on to the next question on my

762
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,400
cards here

763
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
it says ross to jeff thank you for

764
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,919
sharing sharing

765
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,399
your unique talent have you ever

766
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,640
included cow manure compost or mushroom

767
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,720
compost in your soil mixes

768
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,640
do you have an opinion one way or the

769
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,880
other and i just simply replied with no

770
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,000
because that is not my style

771
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,919
i buy cocoa i buy perlite and i mix

772
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,279
cocoa and perlite together and that's

773
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,520
generally my mix

774
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,480
for a commercial grow in my personal

775
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:53,279
grows i honestly rotate from

776
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,798
something like a roots organics or the

777
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,798
707 mix

778
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:58,000
sometimes i buy what's it called

779
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:01,200
fertilum in the red

780
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,119
bag then i put a lot of perlite in that

781
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,960
sometimes i buy what is the other one

782
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,719
fox farms ocean forest

783
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,640
i buy right now it's kind of hard to get

784
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,480
a lot of soil because things are limited

785
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,799
because of the situations we're in

786
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,400
so i get what is available and i believe

787
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,079
that since i'm feeding my plants with

788
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,840
such good nutrients

789
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,839
i mainly use new millennium bottled

790
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,759
nutrients with a couple of additives

791
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,959
uh there's some bud swell in there

792
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,038
there's uh

793
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,480
some green sensation in there there's a

794
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,240
little bit of veg bloom products in

795
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,720
there i use the shine

796
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,720
but i'm mainly using high quality inputs

797
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,400
so as long as i've got a good substrate

798
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,200
for my plants to hang out and the roots

799
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,559
to be in

800
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,720
as long as i'm feeding them while i'm

801
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:39,599
not super picky about my soil or my

802
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,120
medium

803
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,959
as long as it's kind of fluffy and it's

804
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:43,759
well aerated and it's a good quality and

805
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,079
it's clean

806
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,158
then that's what i'm using but i usually

807
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,480
don't use any sort of compost no manure

808
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,840
or anything like that i live in the city

809
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,599
my neighbors are close i don't have a

810
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,000
lot of space a lot of yard space a lot

811
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:55,678
of

812
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,599
room for like composting and [ __ ] like

813
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,759
that i just got a lot of storage and

814
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,959
[ __ ] like that taking up all my space so

815
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,599
that's not my style

816
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,720
so no never done that uh probably won't

817
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,639
do that

818
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,839
uh just not the way that i grow more of

819
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,440
a commercial grower with a different

820
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:10,558
mindset doing things a little bit of a

821
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,480
different way

822
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,158
the next weird question that i got was

823
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,558
is your real name jeff

824
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,520
uh yeah the name is jeff i am the lemon

825
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:19,359
jeffrey

826
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,879
i'm the jeff behind lemon jeffrey that's

yes the name is jeff real name's jeffrey

834
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,480
if you want to get technical

835
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
um all right what about old bottles of

836
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,240
nutrients i have unopened

837
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,599
quartz of calmag and containers of great

838
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,599
white that are three

839
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,678
or more years old should i flush them

840
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,000
into my septic tank

841
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,159
there's a lot to unpack in that question

842
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,839
um a lot of your products should have an

843
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,480
expiration date printed on them if you

844
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,000
look

845
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,599
on the lid or on the bottom of the

846
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,798
bottle somewhere there should be an

847
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,399
expiration date

848
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:57,918
i don't know what those companies

849
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,679
recommend for storage

850
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,840
for long-term use if they're more than a

851
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:05,679
year old i generally get rid of them

852
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:07,519
um the quartz of calmag

853
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,278
i would open up and smell it see what it

854
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:09,918
smells like if it smells like calmag

855
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:11,440
should

856
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,880
if you've been using cow mag for a while

857
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,640
you know what it smells like it smells

858
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,240
like cow mag like a bottle of calamag

859
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,440
it's got a very distinct smell to it

860
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,640
when you get it on your fingers you

861
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,720
smell it all day

862
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,320
it's not terrible but it's got a very a

863
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,159
very noticeable aroma

864
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,678
smell them see if they're okay i would

865
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,840
consider using the calmag

866
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,600
maybe if it's past its expiration date

867
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,038
but if you can toss it and get another

868
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,558
one if it's affordable i would just do

869
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:34,640
that don't risk it

870
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,918
if it's chunky if it smells bad then

871
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,720
toss it immediately

872
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,520
check for an expiration date the great

873
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,839
white

874
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,759
um i don't know how hot or cold you've

875
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:45,439
had those stored i don't know how dry or

876
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:48,158
moist and which the environment in which

877
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,720
those were stored has been

878
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:52,720
but if it hasn't changed colors i think

879
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,319
it starts off like a whitish gray if it

880
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,240
hasn't turned purple or too

881
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,879
dark and it hasn't clumped up and gotten

882
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,319
chunky it's probably okay to use the

883
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,240
good thing is uh

884
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:03,759
if you use that product and it is

885
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,679
expired you're probably

886
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:06,960
not let me try to [ __ ] get my tongue

887
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,679
under control here

888
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,159
you're probably not going to cause any

889
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,759
harm

890
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,360
by using that product should it be

891
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:14,319
expired you've just got a bunch of dead

892
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,918
microbes

893
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:17,599
it'll just be a bunch of inert matter

894
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:19,200
that'll just be just

895
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,879
sand basically floating around in your

896
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,480
water when you mix it in

897
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,240
so i don't think there will be a problem

898
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,278
if you do attempt to use it however i

899
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,079
would look for

900
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,798
a an expiration date on both of those

901
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:30,480
maybe

902
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,558
i do not work for those companies i

903
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,159
would say maybe contact the vendors the

904
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:35,759
manufacturers and see

905
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,360
how long they recommend you keep them

906
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,240
around if they were in a cool

907
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,439
dry dark safe environment maybe they'll

908
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,599
last a little longer

909
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,880
if you had adverse conditions extremes

910
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:46,319
of one end or the other

911
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,240
they're probably toast and i would

912
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,960
consider getting rid of them if you can

913
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,200
afford it

914
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,798
toss them out get some fresh [ __ ] not

915
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,919
talking trash about your budget

916
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,359
i know everybody has [ __ ] tightened down

917
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:58,320
right now because of the pandemic

918
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,558
because of the

919
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:02,158
situation in which we are all facing so

920
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,599
i don't really have any solid advice for

921
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,480
you contact the vendors

922
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,519
or check out the products if the dried

923
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,919
products have become

924
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,558
purple or chunky and dried up and stuck

925
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,038
together

926
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:13,918
i would toss that if it's gummy i would

927
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,319
definitely toss

928
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,520
that if the other product is chunky as

929
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:19,200
well smells bad

930
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,359
if they smell bad don't use them get rid

931
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,640
of them uh contact the vendors

932
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,719
see what they say look for that

933
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,240
expiration date

934
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,720
here's another question i found to be

935
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,079
kind of funny this is not grow related

936
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,079
this is just random it says what did

937
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,678
walmart do to piss you off

938
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:35,119
i did not know that i had expressed

939
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,720
anywhere that i had

940
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:37,839
any sort of hatred or anger toward

941
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,960
walmart but i just thought this was

942
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,240
funny it was something i could just

943
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,480
address really quickly

944
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,919
i do try to answer all of the patreon

945
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,360
questions and this one came in so i'm

946
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:46,159
standing by my word and doing my best to

947
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:47,519
answer this

948
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,520
and it could be real quick if i'd quit

949
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,240
rambling about it uh what did walmart do

950
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:52,639
to piss me off

951
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,480
nothing like directly nothing like they

952
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,799
didn't stab me they didn't punch me

953
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
i just don't like the way that walmart

954
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,319
treats the community

955
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,200
i don't think that they're uh they're

956
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,798
not it's not cool man it's babylon man

957
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
they come to communities and they shut

958
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,240
down mom and pop stores

959
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
and then they build the big walmart

960
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,200
store and then every three blocks you

961
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,798
got a walmart neighborhood market and it

962
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,600
makes it hard for the small

963
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:16,798
mom and shop community stores stores yes

964
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,119
those two

965
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,879
to stay in business and survive and as a

966
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,239
small business myself i understand what

967
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,000
it's like we need to make

968
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,359
ends meet we need to pay our employees

969
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,200
and [ __ ] handle things

970
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:28,558
it's a struggle sometimes so seeing

971
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,319
walmart crush things

972
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:32,000
uh was kind of weird and then if you

973
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,678
want to get closer to home

974
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,200
my mom no longer works there so i could

975
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,960
talk about it my mom worked at walmart

976
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,798
and they didn't give a [ __ ] about her

977
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,960
i love my mom dearly she's the most

978
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,599
important person in my world in my life

979
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,000
and walmart treated my mom like [ __ ] so

980
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:46,480
uh

981
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,319
watching somebody or a company or an

982
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,759
entity treat somebody you love

983
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,119
more than anything that you wish you

984
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,879
could solve all their problems and

985
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,798
[ __ ] just pay their way for life

986
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,120
to see that company treat my mama like

987
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,158
[ __ ] that made me salty to be quite

988
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,398
honest with you

989
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,840
um she worked there for years it's you

990
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:02,479
guys don't care about what my mom did

991
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:03,519
for walmart

992
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,839
my mom probably doesn't want her

993
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:07,278
business broadcasted out but i feel like

994
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,439
walmart did her dirty

995
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:10,880
so and not just one time i just feel

996
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,000
like it was a continued

997
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,440
uh a continued [ __ ] you from walmart to

998
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,119
her and to the family just because the

999
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
way they treated her she was a kick-ass

1000
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:20,719
employee

1001
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,079
uh i got my work ethic from my mom and

1002
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,079
if you guys know me you know i [ __ ]

1003
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,960
work my ass off my mom will work circles

1004
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,639
around me

1005
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,240
uh she's old enough to be my mama

1006
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,679
obviously and she will still [ __ ]

1007
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,440
work circles around me

1008
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,720
so i'm salty at walmart for treating my

1009
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,000
mama like [ __ ]

1010
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,360
anybody that treats your mama like [ __ ]

1011
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,880
you're gonna have some hatred for i

1012
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,439
don't know that it's hatred salty is the

1013
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,080
word

1014
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,480
uh if i can shop anywhere else i just go

1015
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,798
there

1016
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,880
there's no need for me to give my money

1017
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,240
that i work for my mama works hard for

1018
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,159
her money

1019
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,759
there's no need to spend my money at a

1020
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,640
company that doesn't give a [ __ ] about

1021
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,319
the people

1022
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,759
uh that does kind of sketchy shady

1023
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:54,798
things i should i should be careful with

1024
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,640
what i'm saying because

1025
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,079
uh they may [ __ ] delete my sku tag

1026
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,679
and i made [ __ ] disappear

1027
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,918
i may be taking that inventory and never

1028
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,120
[ __ ] return here if i keep talking so

1029
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,799
i just didn't like the way they treated

1030
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,158
my mom she doesn't work there anymore so

1031
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:07,759
we can talk [ __ ] now they can't fire

1032
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,360
they can't do a [ __ ] thing but

1033
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,119
i just didn't like it so that's pretty

1034
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,798
much why i'm salty on walmart they

1035
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:14,959
didn't do anything directly they just

1036
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,319
just a bunch of years of just [ __ ]

1037
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,159
jabs just being

1038
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:19,839
dicks like i don't know i just didn't

1039
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
care for it that's not cool

1040
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:22,798
there's probably better places to work

1041
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,278
and if you work for walmart do your

1042
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:24,720
thing

1043
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:26,798
i understand it's a pandemic get your

1044
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,200
[ __ ] paycheck but

1045
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,918
oh man yeah i wouldn't do it i wouldn't

1046
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,159
work there

1047
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,200
and i'm privileged and blessed so i

1048
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,960
understand things are different but

1049
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,960
that's what walmart did to piss me off

1050
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,720
uh it was mean to my mama and anybody

1051
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,840
that's got a problem with my mama

1052
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,759
got a problem with me

1053
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,439
kind of [ __ ] joking mostly [ __ ]

1054
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,200
serious so let's keep

1055
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,798
moving forward this is a fun podcast i

1056
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,240
like these short questions

1057
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:51,759
this is a good thursday show i think

1058
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,720
this comes out on thursday happy

1059
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,480
thursday y'all

1060
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,759
this one goes like this i'm never gonna

1061
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,399
say y'all again either

1062
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,879
uh hey bro big fan with a big question

1063
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:03,038
is flash photography bad for the plants

1064
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,799
could it go as far as making our plants

1065
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:08,240
turn into hermaphrodites or

1066
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:10,398
express intersex um

1067
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,679
i do not think that flash photography is

1068
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,639
bad for the plants

1069
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,159
during the lights-on cycle don't disrupt

1070
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,240
the nighttime cycle with flash

1071
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,120
photography that will probably piss them

1072
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,319
off

1073
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:25,119
um you can think of it like this

1074
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,240
what do you accept when you're sleeping

1075
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:29,359
you want it

1076
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,880
still dark and quiet right shut the [ __ ]

1077
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,199
up turn off the lights and don't bother

1078
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,159
me

1079
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,360
that's what you want when you're

1080
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,720
sleeping guess what that's what the

1081
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,240
plants want also

1082
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,000
they want to be in a cool temperature a

1083
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,679
cool environment they just don't want to

1084
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,960
be [ __ ] with they want it dark

1085
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,798
they want it quiet and they want to be

1086
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,159
left the [ __ ] alone if you go if i

1087
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:46,158
walked into your bedroom

1088
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,520
when you fell asleep two or three hours

1089
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,880
after just walk in there and start going

1090
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:51,038
hey could i get you to maybe

1091
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,720
uh strike a pose [ __ ] and start taking

1092
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:55,119
pictures with flash photography

1093
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,480
you're gonna throw everything in reach

1094
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,518
at me and i'm gonna have photos of it

1095
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,720
it's gonna be really funny i'm gonna

1096
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,720
post them and tag you

1097
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,919
but [ __ ] shit's gonna come flying to

1098
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,519
me from all directions

1099
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,200
your glass of water you got by the

1100
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,319
bedside that's coming the book you were

1101
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,240
reading before bed

1102
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,439
that's coming if i haven't ran yet

1103
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,880
you're probably shooting at me by now

1104
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,159
for taking flash photography

1105
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,679
of you trying to sleep you're probably

1106
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,039
in your undies probably don't look your

1107
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,159
best probably all puffy faced and

1108
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,000
[ __ ] confused

1109
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,519
the plants feel the same way don't go

1110
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,038
taking pictures of the ladies

1111
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,319
in there don't take any pictures of

1112
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:23,919
ladies and they're sleeping unless you

1113
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,798
got their permission you guys

1114
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,000
no ladies even none of the ladies all

1115
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:29,278
you guys out there listen to me no

1116
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,398
ladies want you taking their pictures

1117
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,079
when they're asleep and that comes down

1118
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:33,359
to the cannabis plants and all ladies in

1119
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,879
our lives don't do it

1120
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,719
skip that be a better person than that

1121
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,960
that's partly a joke again

1122
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,839
again completely [ __ ] serious when

1123
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,360
they're awake

1124
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:42,480
let them get dressed up let them pose

1125
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:43,759
let them do their thing let them be

1126
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,960
prepared and take all the flash

1127
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:46,480
photography you want

1128
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,798
i don't think flash photography will

1129
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,159
harm the plants in the daylight cycle in

1130
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:52,079
the night time cycle

1131
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,399
yes you've got the potential to cause

1132
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,359
huge catastrophic problems with flash

1133
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:56,558
photography

1134
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:58,398
in my opinion just because you're

1135
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,759
walking in there you probably got a

1136
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,439
light on when you go in there you got to

1137
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:02,720
maneuver around the room you're taking

1138
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,278
pictures you're looking at the camera

1139
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,480
screen

1140
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,159
probably using your phone for a

1141
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,599
flashlight not even thinking about that

1142
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,120
being a light

1143
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,798
just take pictures when the lights are

1144
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:11,918
on use your flash photography at that

1145
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:13,200
point they will be cool i don't think

1146
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,640
that'll make them hurt

1147
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,080
i've been going for a long time i've got

1148
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,440
one more question we're going to finish

1149
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,439
this page of questions

1150
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,038
then we'll wrap up this random questions

1151
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,240
episode this one says

1152
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:26,079
another soil question for you

1153
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,079

00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,918
a commercial grow in your youth that's

1155
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,158
funny in my youth

1156
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,759
in my youth i was a [ __ ] most of my

1157
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,120
commercial growing has been as an adult

1158
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,278
but thank you i appreciate that maybe

1159
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:40,079
i'm still in my youth [ __ ] yeah

1160
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,720
still in my youth anyway it says with

1161
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:44,480
all of the craft breweries in colorado

1162
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,038
have you ever heard of anyone making a

1163
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,798
soil blend containing a percentage of

1164
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,599
spent barley grains

1165
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:52,480
from the brewery uh then they signed

1166
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,240
their name i don't know if they want

1167
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,079
their name said i did not ask i did not

1168
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,480
verify clarify or confirm

1169
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,158
or deny so i'm not going to say that but

1170
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,399
let's answer the question

1171
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,080
um i have never heard of that honestly

1172
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:05,278
i'm sure it's happening somewhere i

1173
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,558
don't think it's happening in a

1174
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:10,159
commercial grow

1175
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,798
because there's probably some stupid

1176
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,840
rule

1177
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:16,000
that bans uh the brewery

1178
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,439
from giving out that spent stuff and

1179
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,679
another stupid rule

1180
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,440
that would ban the commercial grow from

1181
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,640
accepting that spent stuff honestly

1182
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,038
there's probably some

1183
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,880
logistics that put a big piece of red

1184
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,640
tape from allowing that to happen

1185
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,240
that's just how both of those industries

1186
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,200
work they're both highly overly

1187
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,720
regulated

1188
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,798
and there would just be i'd probably

1189
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,558
have to pay a million dollars to buy it

1190
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:38,000
and then probably they'd have to spend a

1191
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:38,720
[ __ ] million dollars just to sell it

1192
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,278
to me

1193
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,798
only the government and uh the governing

1194
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:43,599
agencies would make the two million

1195
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:45,599
dollars

1196
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,839
both of us would be [ __ ] out of money

1197
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:50,319
um that's just how this [ __ ] works in

1198
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:51,759
commercial uh cannabis and commercial

1199
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,678
alcohol production so

1200
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:55,519
i don't know anybody doing that that's

1201
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,440
my assumption by the way once again bro

1202
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,880
science bro news bro info

1203
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,240
i don't know anybody doing it never

1204
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,399
heard of it done is that a good idea

1205
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,679
containing a percentage of barley grains

1206
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,678
from the brewery

1207
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,519
i don't know i never thought of that

1208
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,559
never heard of that idea that's a new

1209
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:13,280
one for me

1210
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:13,679
but very creative and uh thank you for

1211
