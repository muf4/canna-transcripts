151
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,159
to do a positive service i'm not trying

152
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,520
to start rumors talk [ __ ] create any

153

00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,079
happen if you're spending money putting

158
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,519
energy and effort into that slow down

163
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
give the family time and space and let

164
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,439
them handle all of their stuff then the

165
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,879
business will come

166
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:40,319
whenever they care to deal with the

167
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,240
business right now obviously it's not

168
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,319
the time uh when the time comes they

169
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
will do that so i'm not talking any

170
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,918
trash i'm not creating any drama i'm

171

letting you know don't spend your money

172
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:52,560

173
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,000
buy a plane ticket book a hotel room i

174
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,519
might buy a new banner and a bunch of

175
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
special packaging and it might be a

176
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,519
waste of time so don't do that just yet

all right now let's move into the main

271
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,000
part of this podcast i feel like i've

272
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,919
paid all the bills done all the

273
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,559
housekeeping let's get to the part that

274
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:12,159
you signed in for the main topic of

275
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,719
today's podcast

276
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:16,719
in the previous episode i talked about

277
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,278
bud washing that was a process a

278
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,920
practice of dunking our buds into a

279
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:24,559
solution of water and maybe possibly

280
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,120
hydrogen peroxide in an effort to clean

281
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:29,199
those buds of any uh contaminants that

282
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,519
may have stuck to those buds may whether

283
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,680
it was dust powdery mildew

284
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
we talked about bird poop and bug poop

285
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,278
anything that may have gathered on those

286
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,680
buds during their process i said this

287
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,120
was doable on indoor and outdoor

288
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,799
greenhouse gardens you can do this on

289
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,720
just about any grow

290
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,879
then i realized as i was watching the

291
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,639
video and doing some editing i should

292
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:51,600
have mentioned that you can do the same

293
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:53,360
type of process while the plants are

294
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,680
growing while the plants are still

295
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,800
growing alive happening you can treat

296
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,479
them with the same type of solution if

297
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,319
you do encounter a powdery mildew

298
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,399
situation in your indoor grow

299
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,519
environment of course the first step

300
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,078
is to find what is causing that powdery

301
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,639
mildew it's probably a vapor pressure

302
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,879
deficit issue a vpd issue you probably

303
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,838
have either too high or too low of

304
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,480
humidity too high or too low of heat or

305
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:23,279
possibly insufficient airflow those are

306
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,839
most common causes of powdery mildew we

307
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,360
need to diagnose and correct the cause

308
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,279
of the powdery mildew the first thing

309
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,079
you're going to do is freak out and want

310
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:34,879
to fix the plants which sounds good but

311
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:36,559
if you don't fix the cause if even if

312
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,559
you fix the plants it's coming back in a

313
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,159
few days so you could do everything you

314
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,078
could polish every single leaf but if

315
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,480
you don't cure the room correct the

316
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,000
issue find a good solution or find a

317
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,000
very good preventative measure that you

318
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
can apply other than the room then

319
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,519
you're going to keep getting it so let

320
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,800
me segue into talking about how to treat

321
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,120
with a hydrogen peroxide or h2o2

322
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,639
solution for powdery mildew first step

323
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,560
of course is to figure out why you're

324
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,639
getting it try to correct the room that

325
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,078
is going to be your own adventure you're

326
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,559
going to have to correct that maybe add

327
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,958
some airflow maybe add some fans correct

328
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,479
your vpd do you have too much humidity

329
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,719
do you have too much heat do you have

330
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
too much cool do you have big swings

331
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,399
when the lights come on lights go off

332
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,240
are you getting big humidity swings

333
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,000
humidity spikes humidity drops are you

334
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
getting crazy swings

335
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,200
during the night and during the day are

336
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,600
your temperature swings drastic during

337
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,079
the night during the day if you can get

338
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,159
everything sorta more stabilized that

339
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,559
will prevent the production and

340
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,319
development of powdery mildew

341
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,919
giving so there are a lot of different

342
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
types of powdery mildew so some people

343
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:39,838
will say keep it more dry keep it more

344
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,000
humid keep it warmer keep it cooler

345
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,079
unfortunately there's a type of powdery

346
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,240
mildew for all conditions if the plants

347
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,078
can live in there and thrive in there so

348
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,759
can the powdery mildew soak in the bugs

349
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,439
so can all the other [ __ ] they all love

350
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,278
the same thing that's just how nature

351
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,120
works uh wherever you want to put on

352
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,120
flip-flop sunglasses take off your shirt

353
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,039
wear some shorts and have a good time so

354
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,720
do the plants so do the bugs so does the

355
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,879
powdery mildew it loves all the same

356
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,759
[ __ ] as us the thing that brings it on

357
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:08,720
the most is those crazy drastic changes

358
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,039
and improper vpd now let me focus in on

359
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,120
how to take care of it let's say you see

360
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,159
some powdery mildew happening let's say

361
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
it's getting a little thick on the

362
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:19,439
leaves we got a couple of options in the

363
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:22,879
last episode i talked about using 30

364
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:25,040
hydrogen peroxide h2o2 is very similar i

365
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:27,278
believe they will work at the same

366
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:28,879
rates and same consistencies and they'll

367
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,480
work at the same efficacy as the word

368
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,120
i'm searching for in my head as i ramble

369
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,480
my way to it so hydrogen peroxide and

370
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,399
h2o2 will work just as well the good

371
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
hydrogen peroxide the 30

372
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,759
not the stuff from walmart you've got to

373
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,000
get the good stuff they may sell the 30

374
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,159
at walmart by now who knows but the good

375
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,919
[ __ ] the stuff you normally buy i think

376
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,240
is three percent so you've got to get

377
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,319
the uh better stuff and when you use

378
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,480
either of these products here comes the

379
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,480
dad and me here comes the pesticide

380
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,800
trainer in me make sure that you use the

381
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,399
proper protective personal equipment

382
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:01,919
when you're using these products they're

383
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,759
both caustic they'll burn your skin

384
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,078
they'll burn your fingers they'll burn

385
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,039
the living [ __ ] out of your eyes i know

386
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:08,638
you're saying you're going to put these

387
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,199
on the plants yes we're going to dilute

388
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,278
it very heavily so when you're using

389
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,759
these bottles these products please wear

390
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,519
gloves and wear goggles or some sort of

391
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,679
eye protection most of you are going to

392
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,240
ignore the eye protection please do it

393
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,638
but please for sure at least wear gloves

394
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,879
when you're mixing and applying this

395
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,919
product in the last episode i focused

396
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,759
mostly on the hydrogen peroxide and h2o2

397
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,479
because those are what i would recommend

398
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:36,639
for a bud wash if we're going to harvest

399
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,720
the plants dunk them into a product and

400
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,879
then they're going to dry and basically

401
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,399
be cured and smoked pretty soon from

402
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,679
there that's why i was recommending the

403
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,919
h2o2 and the hydrogen peroxide those

404
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,519
products dissipate evaporate they don't

405
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:51,439
stick around very long they're gone from

406
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,879
your plants quite quickly so they're

407
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,600
safe to consume they don't leave any

408
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:57,278
residue any aroma you'll never know they

409
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,800
were there so that's why i was

410
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:01,360
recommending those those are very good

411
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,198
to use as a preventative and corrective

412
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,879
spray as well so you see the powdery

413
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,919
mildew come in you can hit it with the

414
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:10,799
h2o2 or the hydrogen peroxide i would

415
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,799
start with approximately 10 to 15

416
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:15,599
milliliters per gallon then work your

417
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,559
way up i did say to use about 50 mils i

418
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,159
think per 5 gallon of water last time

419
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:22,000
honestly the way that i measure it in a

420
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,919
commercial grows i fill up a few five

421
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,240
gallon buckets and i put just a couple

422
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:29,039
of bloops in there the bottle goes bloop

423
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,440
bloop bloop that's my measurement one

424
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:33,519
bloop if it's really bad put a couple of

425
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,040
bloops in there if you've worked with me

426
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,560
you know for sure that's my unit of

427
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,399
measurement just a couple of bloops per

428
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,479
bottle don't do glugs just a couple of

429
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,759
bloops glug glug that's too much bloop

430
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,959
that's enough i

431
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,639
when you do it you're going to go how's

432
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,958
a couple of bloops and it's enough

433
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,198
you'll figure it out start low go

434
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,359
stronger go until the powdery mildew is

435
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,120
dissolving but don't bleach the plants

436
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,800
and be careful when you're doing this

437
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,198
increase slowly so

438
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:58,639
mix up the hydrogen peroxide or the h2o2

439
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,639
don't mix them together

440
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,959
mix that up into your

441
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,039
water and then spray that onto the plant

442
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,039
and just spray it directly onto the

443
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,039
powdery mildew try to wash it off this

444
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,639
product will dissolve the powdery mildew

445
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,159
at the same time as washing it off at

446
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,919
the same time you're washing off all the

447
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,198
other dirt and contaminants that may

448
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,759
have gathered up on these plants you're

449
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,240
just giving them a nice little peroxide

450
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,198
bath and this is not going to damage we

451
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,959
have diluted the caustic products to a

452
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,559
level tour they are not going to damage

453
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:29,119
the plants but they will damage the

454
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,198
powdery mildew the mildew is much uh uh

455
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,039
what's weaker than the trichomes the

456
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,319
terps anything else in there and those

457
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:36,159
products are the trichomes are

458
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,000
protecting everything that we don't want

459
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,559
destroyed the powdery mildew will get

460
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,799
decimated by these products

461
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,278
so start off with around 15 milliliters

462
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,198
per gallon of water work your way up if

463
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,039
necessary i've gone pretty hard i'm not

464
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,198
going to encourage you to go too hard

465
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,198
now i was focused on those other two

466
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:55,120
products because i was doing the bud

467
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,439
wash let's talk about some products that

468
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,240
we can use as a preventative and as

469
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,000
corrective sprays

470
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,079
you can mix the following products

471
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,198
together but do not mix them with the

472
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:09,120
peroxide or the h2o2 the following

473
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:12,719
products i'm going to talk about would

474
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,959
be destroyed by the h2o2 or the hydrogen

475
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,959
peroxide you can possibly switch

476
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,399
hydrogen peroxide with zero tall in most

477
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,319
cases as well let me throw that in there

478
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,399
i forgot to mention uh zero tall is a

479
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,879
good product let me get back on track

480
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,839
don't mix the hydrogen peroxide zero

481
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,000
tall or h2o2 with the following products

482
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,440
but do mix the following products in any

483
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
way you'd like i think they will work

484
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:37,440
great together in many combos

485
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,199
or by themselves or in rotations um so

486
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,360
let's talk about them a few products i

487
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:43,758
like for powdery mildew and fungicide

488
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,000
and mold control in an indoor

489
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,600
environment a greenhouse environment or

490
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,559
outdoor is a product called cease

491
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,079
cease is very cost effective i don't

492
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,838
have a bottle of sea sneer me i should

493
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,479
have researched to see what was in there

494
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,399
it is a beneficial bacteria that will

495
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,959
gather on your leaf when you spray it

496
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,119
and it out battles the powdery mildew

497
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,198
and this beneficial bacteria does no

498
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,918
harm to the plant it doesn't hurt us or

499
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,000
anything but it does make it undesirable

500
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,000
for powdery mildew so you've laid a

501
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,919
protective layer of your plants by

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,759
applying cease

503
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,559
another great product that does a very

504
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:24,078
similar thing is double nickel you can

505
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:26,879
apply double nickel and cease each at 45

506
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,720
milliliters per gallon of water both of

507
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,280
these products are approved by the

508
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,319
colorado department of agriculture for

509
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:38,079
use in the production of recreational

510
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,839
and medical cannabis so uh cease and

511
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:41,678
double nickel you can use those in a

512
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:44,480
commercial environment or in your

513
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,038
personal grow they will work great for

514
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,839
the powdery mildew um other things you

515
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:52,319
can use a product called regalia is

516
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,879
great for powdery mildew and then also

517
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,558
sometimes you can use grandivo but

518
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,120
grandivo kind of makes a mess and i

519
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:02,720
would use the other three products first

520
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,879
so cease double nickel and regalia are

521
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
the three things i would recommend for

522
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,080
your powdery mildew problem if it's

523
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,080
getting out of hand if it's getting

524
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:14,240
thick if it's getting chunky hit it with

525
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:16,240
hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or zero tall but

526
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,400
that will destroy the colonies of

527
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,480
beneficial bacterias you have built up

528
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,038
with the cease the double nickel the

529
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,880
regalia and the grand devos so that is

530
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,200
kind of a final resort sort of a thing

531
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,799
or that's a panic mode or a holy [ __ ]

532
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,720
this is thick and it looks like frosted

533
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,918
donuts in here sort of attack

534
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,160
but the h2o2 zero tall hydrogen peroxide

535
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,000
will work one of those don't don't

536
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,240
triple double up on those products just

537
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,759
use one of those they're caustic

538
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
they will dissolve the powdery mildew

539
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:44,480
it's all you need excuse me for the

540
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,000
kombucha burps guys i'll get that under

541
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,360
control won't drink kombucha before the

542
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,720
next episode

543
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:50,159
um so

544
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,240
other things that we need to do we're

545
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,840
going to apply either preventative or

546
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,279
corrective sprays we're going to start

547
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,519
off with things like cease and double

548
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,960
nickel or regalia and then if it gets

549
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:02,079
too out of control we'll step up our

550
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,079
game and use hydrogen peroxide h2o2 or

551
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,599
zero tall

552
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,480
the good thing about the cease and the

553
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,558
double nickel is in most cases if you're

554
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,880
using beneficial insects they will not

555
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,279
destroy your beneficial insects the

556
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,760
hydrogen peroxide and h2o2 is really

557
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,359
going to piss off the beneficial insects

558
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,919
cease and double nickel they should

559
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,678
stick around the regalia i can't testify

560
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,759
i do not know what the regalia will do

561
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,320
to your beneficials i have not tried

562
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,240
that with beneficials in the same mix

563
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,720
the season double nickel i've done that

564
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,200
with swarovski's persimilis hypoasmus

565
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,798
miles green lacewings i've done it with

566
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,080
all those guys still around and they

567
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:39,440
survive and live through it it doesn't

568
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,960
disrupt them

569
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,600
so that's the cease and double nickel

570
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,840
that you can do with the beneficial bugs

571
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,119
now other things that we can do uh we've

572
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,000
got to put some work into this you're

573
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,399
going to have to correct the room then

574
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,759
before we spray why not defoliate if we

575
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,519
just go in there and take off most of

576
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,400
the leaves if those leaves aren't there

577
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,798
they can't be problematic let me back up

578
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,480
uh it's we know what time it is put on a

579
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:03,759
mask you should probably already have a

580
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,839
mask right it's in the car it's in your

581
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,519
pocket grab a mask put on a mask let's

582
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:10,000
not [ __ ] with this powdery mildew too

583
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,839
heavily without a mask maybe a little

584
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,599
bit but if the powdery mildew is getting

585
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:15,119
funky if it's getting thick why not put

586
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,279
on a mask you might not want to breathe

587
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,399
it just put on a little just a c word

588
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,000
mask i don't want to say it i don't want

589
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,960
to get us in that category on youtube

590
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,640
but

591
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,759
just put on a white mask just to cover

592
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,200
it up so you aren't breathing the dust

593
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,400
because you're going to jostle those

594
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,558
leaves right over the leaves you'll have

595
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,320
it on your fingers let's just try not to

596
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,759
inhale too much of that powdery mildew

597
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,119
let's put on a mask

598
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,960
definitely put on some gloves so you

599
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,439
don't have sticky hands and powdery

600
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,200
mildew fingers and let's defoliate any

601
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,558
leaf that has got some frosting on it

602
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,960
just go ahead and feel free to pull it

603
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,839
off why not those leaves are

604
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,759
contributing to the overhumid condition

605
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,480
in the room those leaves are where the

606
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,640
powder powdery mildew is hiding if there

607
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,720
are no camping spots there are no

608
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,320
hippies camping so get rid of the

609
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,839
camping spots you won't have spots if

610
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,439
there are no donuts there's no powdered

611
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,199
sugar bro get rid of those spots is

612
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
really what i'm trying to say so get rid

613
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,400
of all that powdery mildew stuff put

614
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,919
that in a trash bag

615
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,360
burn the [ __ ] no you don't have to burn

616
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,960
it get rid of it put it in the trash get

617
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,279
that stuff out of the grow as quickly as

618
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,159
possible seal it up get it gone

619
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,720
um then after we've defoliated then

620
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,880
spray at that point then spray the room

621
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,558
follow the appropriate instructions on

622
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,159
the container of whichever product you

623
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:24,798
choose to spray and keep in mind if you

624
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,480
spray indoors add two hours to the

625
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,000
re-entry interval time because some of

626
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,440
those products you don't want to go in

627
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,119
the room too early they're expecting

628
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,558
wind and sun to help break that down you

629
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,719
don't have that in the grow space add

630
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,960
two hours then

631
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,880
ventilate the room if we're spraying for

632
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,798
powdery mildew these products all of the

633
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,039
products which i've listed

634
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,279
we don't need those to stay wet for very

635
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:47,919
long we want to hit the plant and get

636
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,240
the plants dry so don't put fans on them

637
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,960
and dry them rapidly but let's dry them

638
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,640
naturally slowly get ventilation in

639
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,400
there get some air movement in there we

640
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,880
don't want hurricane-like conditions but

641
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,120
we want some movement some airflow we

642
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,720
don't want crazy [ __ ] rustling leaves

643
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,158
but we want like movement on the leaves

644
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,839
we want them rustling and not [ __ ]

645
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,360
when i'm jostling and not rustling you

646
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,879
know what i'm saying right don't don't

647
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:10,879
[ __ ] go in there and destroy the grow

648
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,559
now just go in there and blow around a

649
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,320
little bit and get it drying blow dry

650
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:15,440
its hair just a little tiny bit get it

651
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,279
cleaned up but don't give it an

652
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,880
opportunity to build mildew with the

653
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:20,960
moisture you just [ __ ] sprayed in

654
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,440
there uh most of the products i

655
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,000
mentioned uh definitely the peroxide the

656
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,679
h2o2 and the zero tall you can spray

657
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,839
those three

658
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,440
the day of harvest you could spray those

659
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,759
all the way up to harvest we're gonna do

660
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,519
a bud wash with those anyway so don't be

661
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:38,079
afraid to use those all the way up to

662
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:40,079
the very end season double nickel you

663
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,519
can use those quite late in flour

664
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,798
they're not going to disrupt the flavor

665
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,639
of your buds they're not going to cause

666
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,639
any problems with your product i think

667
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,799
those will work well the regalia and

668
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,720
grand devo i can't testify to using

669
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:53,119
those very late i would use those very

670
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,200
early in flower if it were up to me so

671
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,479
we're gonna defoliate we're gonna spray

672
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,558
we're gonna ventilate the room we're

673
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,558
gonna get the room dry while we're doing

674
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,399
this we're going to wear a mask and

675
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:05,038
gloves we're also gonna put on some good

676
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,000
music and spread some good vibes ah then

677
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,000
spray when the lights are off or the sun

678
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,519
is down don't spray with the lights on

679
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,240
don't spray with the sun up this will

680
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,000
cause you some problems um a lot of

681
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,919
little boys remember burning ants with

682
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
the magnifying glass or doing some maybe

683
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,799
you burned leaves i don't know what you

684
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,240
burned but we did some experiments in

685
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:23,918
science class when we were kids we had a

686
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,679
magnifying glass and the sun would hit

687
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,280
it just right and you could move that

688
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,759
[ __ ] around and you could catch [ __ ]

689
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:31,678
on fire just think about the grow light

690
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,279
or the sun hitting a little droplet

691
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,280
those grow lights are super close to

692
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,359
your uh your plants in some cases

693
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,038
especially some of those new leds i've

694
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,879
seen plants get little burns from it

695
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:42,960
some people say it doesn't happen some

696
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,880
people say it's impossible i think it's

697
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,798
very likely i think i've seen it happen

698
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,080
and it grows so spray when the lights

699
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:53,359
are off or when the sun is down uh if

700
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:56,240
possible please all right i think that

701
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,759
covers my uh recap of treating powdery

702
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,440
mildew some stuff that i should have

703
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,119
talked about in the last episode

704
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,960
honestly the main thing you guys is to

705
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:05,599
correct the room have some sort of

706
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,840
monitors in there um and uh oh another

707
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,278
thing uh the products i listed nobody's

708
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,959
paying me to talk about those products

709
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:14,159
nobody pays me to talk about cease

710
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,079
double nickel regalia grand devo uh h2o2

711
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,159
zero tall nobody paid me for any of that

712
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,599
so um that's something important that i

713
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,640
think i should say i was on the track to

714
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:21,839
saying something else i don't even know

715
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,520
what the [ __ ] it was oh the most

716
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,359
important part have some monitors in

717
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:26,798
there uh so that you know what's

718
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,319
happening is it too humid in there is it

719
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,158
too hot in there i don't care if you use

720
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:33,278
a pulse monitor if you use a pl grow

721
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,880
unit a minder unit i don't care if you

722
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,400
got a little kid in there taking notes

723
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
all i do care if you put a little kid in

724
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,840
there all right let's be real uh

725
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:42,558
maybe if you have an adult that's paid

726
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,480
hourly on a living wage and is giving

727
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,158
meal breaks if they're in there i don't

728
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,759
if you got a helper monkey in there

729
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,440
that's reading a thermometer and writing

730
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,278
down the hourly notes and just keeping

731
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,880
track of it have some way of knowing

732
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,278
what's going on in your grow when you're

733
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,600
not there are you using a pl minder unit

734
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,880
are you using a pulse monitor unit what

735
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:00,558
do you have in there letting you know

736
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,440
what the conditions are like when you

737
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,879
are away are there drastic humidity or

738
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,038
temperature changes during your

739
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,039
nighttime cycle are there drastic heat

740
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,599
spikes or humidity spikes during your

741
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:13,200
daytime cycle is something going awry at

742
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:15,199
a switch that's where things really go

743
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,679
weird is when you flip from day to night

744
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:20,159
or night to day is when you see drastic

745
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:22,080
temperature and humidity fluctuations

746
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,200
those are the things that are going to

747
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:27,439
cause trigger influence and continue

748
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,120
perpetuate your powdery mildew situation

749
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,519
so have something in there letting you

750
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:34,879
know what is going on you might not even

751
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,639
know that it's getting 90 humidity right

752
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,120
when the lights go off maybe you need to

753
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,880
get a blower or an extractor fan and

754
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:42,558
hook that up and that way when the

755
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,799
lights go off that can run for 30

756
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,440
minutes or they sell another device that

757
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,519
plugs into the wall this piece itself

758
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,360
plugs into the wall it's got a meter on

759
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,679
it you tell it when it hits whatever

760
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,519
percent humidity you set it to a meter

761
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,200
and when it hits that percent it

762
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,960
triggers on and the power comes on so

763
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,319
you just plug your exhaust fan into that

764
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,880
you hang the sensor in the middle of the

765
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:05,278
room when it hits 70 humidity this thing

766
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,880
goes i'm supposed to turn on it powers

767
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,880
electricity to your extraction fan and

768
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,679
it sucks out some humidity until that

769
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,600
sensor says oh it's 69 humidity i can

770
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,960
turn off because he wants it at 70. and

771
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,639
that thing clicks off and it keeps you

772
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,720
at 70 or below you can set it whatever

773
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,799
you want uh most of the time those are a

774
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,480
cap switch or something similar to that

775
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:25,278
maybe that is your solution maybe a

776
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,640
dehumidifier on the same type of switch

777
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:28,079
maybe both

778
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,640
there are a lot of options for fixing

779
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,399
humidity and powdery mildew but the main

780
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,600
thing is correct the room and how do you

781
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,120
know if something's wrong in the room

782
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,959
well we know because we've got powdery

783
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,558
mildew but how do we know when and how

784
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,240
to correct it if we don't have some kind

785
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,759
of meter so if you want to win your

786
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
battle with powdery mildew the first

787
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:45,519
thing to do is to fix the room i would

788
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,600
recommend some sort of monitoring device

789
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,679
to monitoring device to let you know

790
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,918
what is going on in that room it doesn't

791
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,159
have to be something super expensive of

792
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,240
course like a pl grow minder unit a

793
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,520
pulse monitor something in that same

794
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,278
realm would be beautiful would be

795
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,918
excellent or you can get one of those

796
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:03,200
hygrometers thermometers with the it

797
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,278
just keeps records for you shows you

798
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,038
what the high and what the low was those

799
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:08,960
will work but how do you know when that

800
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,319
happened

801
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,000
so something a little more high tech

802
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,558
that you can keep some data would be

803
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,798
ideal but get what's in your budget and

804
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,038
get what is within your technical means

805
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,480
i understand some people are not highly

806
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:21,839
technical these days some of us just

807
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,599
want to go in the garden and get dirt

808
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,119
under our nails and grow weed don't want

809
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,719
to worry about too much monitors and

810
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,798
stuff get what you're comfortable with

811
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,038
because we do need to know what is going

812
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,759
on in the grow all right i think that

813
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:35,440
wraps up my powdery mildew recap section

814
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,679
of this podcast i do have a couple of

815
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,919
great questions here in front of me this

816
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,798
message came from our friend fat ankle

817
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,360
foot and it goes a little bit like this

818
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,839
it says hey rasta jeff thank you for all

819
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,719
you do i have a question on reading the

820
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:53,439
pesticide labels correctly that is

821
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,679
always a good question it says first off

822
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,399
is an indoor grow facility considered a

823
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,159
greenhouse a nursery or

824
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,439
neither you know i'm not an expert on

825
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,278
that part i guess i've been trained by

826
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,320
the department of ag and i never asked

827
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,640
that question uh i think when they wrote

828
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:11,038
the pesticide bottles i honestly don't

829
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,038
think they have indoor cultivation in

830
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,720
mind that's why i always add that

831
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:20,240
disclaimer to add two hours to your

832
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,919
re-entry interval time because uh it is

833
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,319
a little bit different than all of the

834
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,919
above it's kind of it's new it's they

835
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,439
didn't expect us to put a bunch of

836
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,440
lights in a warehouse so i don't think

837
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,278
those companies thought of that when

838
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,360
they wrote those labels which i'm going

839
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,278
to get off on a side tangent here that

840
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:37,278
caused a lot of controversy when it came

841
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,798
to deciding which pesticides we could

842
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,839
use in colorado because there are a lot

843
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,558
of weird things written on those bottles

844
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:46,398
and none of the stuff specified uh what

845
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,639
could be smoked none of it was designed

846
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,158
for smokeable products really some of it

847
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,520
probably was stuff for tobacco and

848
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,080
things none of it was designed for

849
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,599
cannabis so we had to kind of develop

850
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:57,199
rules here with the department of ag and

851
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,879
the colorado marijuana enforcement

852
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,960
division and the colorado department of

853
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,679
public health and environment

854
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,840
and citizens and growers and cultivators

855
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,759
and industry leaders and

856
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,678
all kinds of people got together and

857
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,038
made a bunch of rules on what pesticides

858
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,559
and what the fundamentals of what

859
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,720
pesticides would be allowed in

860
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:16,398
commercial production so those rules

861
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,640
didn't exist they had to kind of create

862
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,879
those rules now i i could be completely

863
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,399
wrong that your indoor grow it sounds

864
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,919
like a nursery to me but when i think in

865
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,519
nursery i'm thinking like outdoors with

866
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,960
a lot of air flow there's a couple of

867
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:28,879
nurseries in my neighborhood and they

868
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,120
don't look anything like any indoor

869
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,080
commercial environment i've ever been in

870
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,079
so

871
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,960
i'm gonna say it's not any of those dude

872
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:38,639
it's indoor uh is indoor considered a

873
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,840
greenhouse or nursery or neither i guess

874
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,840
neither is going to be my answer it's

875
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,519
kind of a hybrid dude

876
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,519
they'd like i said they didn't expect

877
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,519
this this is a whole new thing

878
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,798
those pesticides were written

879
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,720
before indoor cannabis quilt uh before

880
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:54,240
they were allowed to discuss indoor

881
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,519
cannabis cultivation they knew it was

882
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,880
happening they knew we were going to use

883
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:58,558
it but they were just like what do you

884
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,760
mean they grow weed with this and they

885
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:00,879
just acted totally like it wasn't

886
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:02,798
happening because they couldn't be

887
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,039
involved so that's a really good

888
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:07,038
question and i wish i had more of an

889
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,558
educated answer to that but honestly i

890
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,398
don't think they had

891
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,398
indoor cultivation in mind when they

892
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,319
started writing pesticide labels maybe

893
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,519
they do now

894
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,119
but i don't think they did then now

895
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,839
there's more to this it says my boss and

896
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,918
i are having disagreements on your

897
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:24,398
evergreen information would you be able

898
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,000
to clarify this i hope so buddy let's

899
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,519
try not to get you fired let's get you a

900
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,119
raise and leave everybody as friends at

901
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,200
the end of this

902
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:33,119
would you be able to clarify this yes i

903
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,278
will do my best it says

904
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,000
i'm trying to use the evergreen

905
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,079
concentrate product on our plants we

906
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,720
have a root aphid problem okay that's

907
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,759
going to work it says my boss says we

908
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:50,640
would only be able to use one ounce per

909
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:52,640
2 and 460 square feet because on the

910
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
inside of the pesticide label it does

911
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,840
recommend and limit how much you should

912
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,839
use per square foot when you are

913
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,558
applying this pesticide

914
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:04,398
but what they are talking about is a

915
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,759
canopy size space you are treating the

916
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,359
root zone which is a completely

917
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,440
different ball game a different plan of

918
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:10,798
attack a different method uh you're

919
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,399
playing by different rules doing a

920
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,398
different thing so they're talking about

921
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,079
the rules of baseball we're playing

922
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:17,759
football they're talking about leaf ball

923
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,199
we're playing dirt ball here so let's

924
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,359
change the rules a little bit but i do

925
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,960
want to continue with reading it says my

926
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,479
uh my boss says we can only use one

927
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:28,880
ounce per uh 2 460 square feet we would

928
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,640
be drenching into five gallon pot so

929
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,600
you're going to need a lot it goes on it

930
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,120
says

931
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:36,959
15 milliliters per gallon at 150 gallons

932
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,959
is 50 ounces

933
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,200
also how does square footage translate

934
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,960
when using pots it doesn't uh this is

935
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,080
two totally different things that uh

936
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,558
2460 square feet that you guys were

937
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,319
talking about that is canopy space this

938
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:52,798
is root zone space this is a different

939
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:54,558
thing you are not spray applying uh you

940
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,158
were mixing as a soil dredge this is a

941
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,319
different thing a different application

942
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:00,720
a different purpose a different use a

943
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:03,038
different plan of attack uh while i'm on

944
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,000
that ramble do both when you were doing

945
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:08,000
the soil dredge also do a foliar spray

946
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,119
just hit both uh that way any bugs that

947
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,960
are living down in the roots they're

948
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,719
going to try to climb up into your bush

949
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,000
uh into your canopy

950
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,278
that way you've already hit there too

951
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,798
they have nowhere to go anything that's

952
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,558
living in the bushy canopy part is gonna

953
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,000
move right back down into the soil and

954
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:21,599
they're gonna go [ __ ] it sucks here and

955
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,119
they're just gonna die or move they're

956
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,199
gonna pack up and get the [ __ ] out of

957
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,278
there so um

958
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,120
it doesn't translate to the best of my

959
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,359
knowledge best of my ability best of my

960
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,199
training there's no translation it's two

961
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:34,639
different things so it says i hope the

962
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,120
message is clear yeah the message is

963
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,799
clear um this was a very good convert i

964
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:39,759
hope this was a very good conversation

965
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:41,759
between

966
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,119
your boss and whoever else was involved

967
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,038
in this conversation it does say there's

968
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,038
three people here i hope this was very

969
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,278
friendly i hope i contributed some

970
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:50,960
useful information uh it's not a

971
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,119
greenhouse it's not a nursery it's an

972
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,480
indoor grow facility and i really don't

973
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,759
think they had that in mind when they

974
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,200
wrote your rules and then uh how does it

975
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,440
translate it doesn't it's two different

976
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,840
things go ahead and do your root drench

977
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,038
at the recommended rate of 15 mils per

978
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,599
gallon

979
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:10,319
but also do a spray around the same

980
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,759
dosage up top also at the same time fat

981
00:33:10,319 --> 00:33:13,200
ankle foot wraps up the message by

982
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:16,000
saying the first rule for using

983
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,278
pesticides is read the [ __ ] label the

984
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,278
problem is

985
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:20,880
we've the problem we face here was three

986
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,359
people read the label and we've got

987
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,880
three different answers i do appreciate

988
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,759
that there was a good debate in that

989
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,039
grow space in that office space i hope i

990
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:31,440
have solved the problem i hope i have

991
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,038
given you some useful information

992
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,399
i'm glad that there was a great debate

993
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:36,480
and i'm glad you guys are talking that

994
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:37,359
means there's some educated smart people

995
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,519
in there

996
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,798
nobody was right nobody was wrong

997
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,798
but let me know who was right and who

998
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,798
was wrong i do appreciate that three

999
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,038
people in that cultivation read the

1000
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,119
pesticide booklet because that means

1001
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,200
that as probably three more people read

1002
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,599
that pesticide booklet than a lot of

1003
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,360
cultivation facilities unfortunately so

1004
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,000
i'm proud and excited that you guys did

1005
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,319
that good job fist bump big ivory army

1006
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,159
salute to everybody for reading that

1007
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,519
pesticide book all right i think i

1008
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,799
wrapped up this message i do have

1009
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,038
another one i want to get to and i'm

1010
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:10,159
quite rambly this one ends up with

1011
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:13,119
thanks and hugs from fat ankle foot fat

1012
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,800
ankle foot big big thanks big hugs big

1013
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,760
ivory army fist bump on to make sure i

1014
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:19,839
got everything spray and drench to win

1015
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,359
were the main notes that i wrote down

1016
00:34:19,838 --> 00:34:24,799
all right let's segue right into the

1017
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:26,480
next message this one came from j bags

1018
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,240
this one came from the irie genetics

1019
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,320
website that's right on the irie

1020
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:32,319
genetics website there is a grow help

1021
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,559
tab if you click on the tab that says

1022
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,159
grow help it will go to the grow help

1023
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,320
tab that asks you

1024
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,838
several preliminary questions it asks

1025
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,960
what name to use what strain you're

1026
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,119
using

1027
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,599
or growing if you're using

1028
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,039
leds hps lights if you're going indoors

1029
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,960
or outdoors what kind of medium you're

1030
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:51,119
using ask you all kinds of useful

1031
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,358
questions to help me help you out

1032
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,879
jbag's filled out all of those questions

1033
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,398
uh we don't need to talk about a lot of

1034
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:58,319
that stuff because he has a great

1035
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,679
question uh that a lot of the other

1036
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,880
stuff won't matter so we're gonna skip

1037
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,598
all of his environmental stuff and get

1038
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,320
gets the point it says the problem i

1039
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:08,000
don't really have a problem more so of a

1040
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,559
question that's good bro cause i have

1041
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,719
got answers it says i live in the

1042
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,358
northeast my state allows me to have 12

1043
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:18,078
plants if any stage for my wife and i i

1044
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:20,239
typically clone every plant i grow just

1045
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,640
in case i find a keeper yes i always

1046
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:25,039
preach to take a clone of every plant in

1047
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,239
case you find that gem you need it again

1048
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,679
you don't want to be heartbroken that

1049
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:29,598
you found the beauty of your dreams and

1050
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:31,279
she got away there will always be a

1051
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:33,838
story you tell

1052
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,320
it goes on it says although i also like

1053
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,838
to grow perpetually using four tints he

1054
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,960
explains a little bit of his perpetual

1055
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:40,719
cycle

1056
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,280
so he describes his grow quite a bit he

1057
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,679
talks about his perpetual system then we

1058
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,920
get to the part here that says i've got

1059
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,919
so many good seeds at the moment i would

1060
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,320
like to stop cloning everything and keep

1061
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,680
growing from seeds then when i find a

1062
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,440
keeper my plan is to re-veg for those

1063
00:35:55,679 --> 00:35:59,519
clones which does make good sense i've

1064
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,240
done that a couple of times uh because

1065
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:04,960
myself i am limited on plant count so

1066
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:07,679
you just flower it out cut down most of

1067
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,679
the buds re-veg that bad dog cut a clone

1068
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:11,118
off of it throw that original plant away

1069
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,199
your plant count never changed you went

1070
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,640
from one to one still with that same

1071
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,039
plant it was a big plant now it's a

1072
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:18,879
clone so it does sound like you have a

1073
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:21,039
sound a strategy that is the way that a

1074
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:23,760
lot of people do it you grow it out cut

1075
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:25,440
it down reveg cut a clone start fresh

1076
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,760
with it that does make sense now here's

1077
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,039
where we get to the anomaly of this

1078
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,320
process it says due to the limited space

1079
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:36,639
can i cut down the root ball of a mature

1080
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,280
freshly harvested plant in order to

1081
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:41,679
re-veg then he describes in detail

1082
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,440
meaning i flour in five to seven gallon

1083
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,679
pots can i trim the root ball to fit

1084
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,079
into a two gallon pot with a little bit

1085
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:51,679
of fresh cocoa and worm castings then

1086
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,680
begin that re-veg process i'm familiar

1087
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,759
with the reveg process because i've done

1088
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,239
it successfully in the past i always

1089
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,680
kept them in very large pots yeah i

1090
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:01,598
think that will work you're gonna have

1091
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,279
to trim down a lot of the plant don't

1092
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,039
leave a lot of the plant for your reef

1093
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,119
edging just have two or three maybe four

1094
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,199
or five little thumb size nuggets that

1095
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,559
you're re-veging don't leave a lot and

1096
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,639
this should work

1097
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:15,440
it may take a little bit longer for this

1098
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:17,519
plant to re-veg but it should work it

1099
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,358
goes on to say it would be nice if i can

1100
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,679
keep them in smaller pots long enough to

1101
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:23,358
snag a couple of clones then kill off

1102
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,440
this mom i know that's harsh no that's

1103
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,960
how it works it says but she had it

1104
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,240
coming yeah she did she had that coming

1105
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,320
from the beginning and she should have

1106
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,799
known and i'm just playing it goes on to

1107
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:34,559
say i dig the podcast and the help you

1108
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,240
have given me via instagram and then he

1109
00:37:34,559 --> 00:37:38,239
wraps it up with this uh instagram name

1110
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,559
i'm not sure if he wants that said here

1111
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,919
on the podcast uh respect if you want

1112
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:42,960
that said sorry i didn't say it i didn't

1113
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:44,400
want to get you blasted because if

1114
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:46,320
there's no way to take it back once i do

1115
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,320
say it i can't correct it it says by the

1116
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,838
way i know my humidity is high i'm

1117
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,000
working on that in my grow because he

1118
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,920
did yeah but uh that's okay no stress on

1119
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,960
the uh no judgment on the environment

1120
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:59,680
bro it has been 108 degrees here so my

1121
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,679
my my environment is not correct either

1122
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,039
but we struggle we adjust we adapt we do

1123
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,480
it we can do no shame in your game

1124
00:38:03,039 --> 00:38:06,320
brother do what you're doing

1125
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,199
i get it i get it life is rough right

1126
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,160
now it was 108 degrees today and then in

1127
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:11,519
like

1128
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,519
seven to ten days i'm going to be

1129
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,880
wearing a hoodie every day so

1130
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:15,838
that's kind of [ __ ] we're growing with

1131
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,440
right now

1132
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,440
let me make sure i wrapped up all of

1133
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,119
this stuff here okay there was one thing

1134
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,639
i did want to kind of recap and mention

1135
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,000
here your strategy is going to work

1136
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,078
you're going to cut down that root ball

1137
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,519
real small also make the plant real

1138
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,119
small when you do that so there's not a

1139
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,280
lot to support there would be much

1140
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:33,599
better if you could have a bigger root

1141
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,240
zone so let me give you a suggestion on

1142
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,400
possibly how to do that now i do

1143
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,000
understand that you're crammed for space

1144
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,599
and i do understand that you're crammed

1145
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,159
for plant count i also know you've got a

1146
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,000
perpetual grow so i don't know how well

1147
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,519
this will work for you maybe you've got

1148
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,199
a veg space

1149
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:51,759
this may actually free up some space in

1150
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,039
your flower room if my idea works for

1151
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
you and if you understand where i'm

1152
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,800
headed with this

1153
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,559
i have done a full podcast on returning

1154
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,440
our plants to 186 of lighting schedule

1155
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:06,400
right before harvest so about 14 days at

1156
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,400
the most maybe 10 7 days before you

1157
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,639
harvest during the flush phase if you

1158
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,800
flush that's also controversial now

1159
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:15,118
during the flush phase i talk about

1160
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,440
turning the plants to a longer light

1161
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,838
cycle an 18-6 cycle basically a

1162
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,320
vegetative cycle there's a reason for

1163
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:24,000
this light is the number one energy

1164
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,760
source for our plants it triggers

1165
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,920
photosynthesis it makes everything

1166
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,160
happen so let's give it as much light as

1167
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,920
possible at the end people are gonna say

1168
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,879
that will make my plants go back into

1169
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,358
veg

1170
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,200
probably but we're gonna harvest in like

1171
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:40,000
10 days and we're not going to see any

1172
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,439
reveg for at least 14 days and you can

1173
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,480
cut them down and smoke them and enjoy

1174
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,119
them anyway

1175
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,280
if you plan on re-vegging you can get

1176
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,838
ahead of the game by putting your light

1177
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,359
cycle back on 18 6

1178
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:55,679
7 to 10 maybe 12 to 14 days before you

1179
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,759
intend to harvest these plants

1180
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,759
if they do begin to re-veg cut them down

1181
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:01,520
right away but you'll notice they may

1182
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,520
finish a little bit early they may

1183
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,039
finish a little bit beefier because

1184
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:06,480
you're giving them more light more

1185
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,318
energy right at the end a lot of

1186
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,838
cannabis plants decide to bulk up and

1187
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:12,000
beef up at the end of the flowering

1188
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,318
phase imagine if you give them a little

1189
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,079
push a little steroids right at the end

1190
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,279
when you normally cut the nutrients now

1191
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,119
you're going to give them more light and

1192
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,480
they're going to go bang so you're going

1193
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,318
to get possibly a bigger heavier beefier

1194
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,880
harvest by giving them a little bit more

1195
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,719
light possibly also they may finish a

1196
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,920
little bit sooner

1197
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:34,639
so if you can return your plants to a

1198
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,159
vegetative light cycle maybe put them

1199
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:38,639
you've got a perpetual growth so you

1200
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:40,799
can't put that room on 1212 maybe you

1201
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,799
can drag these plants you intend on

1202
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,039
harvesting back into your flowering

1203
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,000
space and get your new next flowering

1204
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,318
run in there seven to ten days earlier

1205
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,559
and re-veg that plant so that may help

1206
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:54,719
you out that's just an idea just

1207
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,318
something that i wouldn't be a friend

1208
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:59,838
and wouldn't be a bro and wouldn't be a

1209
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:02,239
pro if i didn't add on to your question

1210
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:04,400
so think about the 18 6 at the end that

1211
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,559
may be the trick that may help you out

1212
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,639
that'll speed up the process

1213
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:10,000
then you won't need to put it into the

1214
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:11,279
other pot because you could just cut

1215
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,280
down most of it and it's only going to

1216
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,119
be a little bit away after that to get

1217
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,960
it back into the vegetative state

1218
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,720
yeah i hope that helps you out

1219
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,400
uh give me a follow-up let me know which

1220
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:24,318
