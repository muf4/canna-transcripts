start of the show

47
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:29,840

48
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:31,519
i'm going super fast i feel like i'm

49
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
kind of rambling so i'm going to mention

50
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:33,920
that i'm dabbing something called dirty

51
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,400
business

52
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
from green dot labs it's a sour diesel

53
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,439
and og cush cross

54
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
i don't have the jar here next to me to

55
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,199
give you the full details but i do know

56
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
i'm all [ __ ] up from it and it's

57
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
delicious and i enjoy it so you're gonna

58
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:48,319
have to deal with me going a little bit

59
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,118
fast and a little bit rambly in this

60
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:51,039
episode

61
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,438
big shout out to our friends at green

62
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,360
dot labs all right let's do some updates

63
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,919
in a previous episode i did talk about

64
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:59,920
auto watering uh when i did the auto

65
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,840
watering system i kind of looked over

66
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,040
overlooked a couple of details i forgot

67
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,159
to mention uh

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,640
auto pots and hemp buckets and sips

69
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,840
systems these are very affordable and

70
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,238
very simple ways

71
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,159
to auto water our plants they're gravity

72
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,520
fed you don't need any timers any

73
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,840
buttons any magic

74
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
it is gravity fed like i said before so

75
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,200
if you want an easier system that i

76
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,640
completely [ __ ] overlooked did not

77
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:23,598
think about until my kind friends

78
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,919
reminded me

79
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,839
uh do a little research on autopots the

80
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,639
auto pot system is great

81
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,159
you fill up one reservoir run some some

82
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,639
lines to other pots

83
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,598
they work on a uh it's gonna be i can't

84
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,119
even think of the word right now it's

85
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,639
like a capillary system it knows how

86
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,159
moist the medium is

87
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,679
and if it needs more water it gives it

88
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,680
more water if it doesn't

89
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
it turns it off the hempy buckets kind

90
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
of work on a similar method

91
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,839
uh these are what are known as sips

92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,959
systems sub

93
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,239
irrigation uh planning systems i think

94
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,800
that's what it is sub

95
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,319
sub subterraneal irrigation you guys

96
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,519
obviously this is not my field of

97
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,119
expertise but

98
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,719
i had to remind you about it had to tell

99
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,360
you about it if you're looking to build

100
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,959
your

101
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,400
auto watering system looking for an

102
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,280
affordable route an affordable

103
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,879
alternative

104
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,199
something very easy to do something

105
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,199
gravity fed something very reliable

106
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,719
look into the hippie buckets the auto

107
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,439
pots something in that realm

108
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,280
a sips system is what you're looking for

109
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:18,719
all right that was my update on that

110
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,719
what else did i want to talk about you

111
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,800
guys i've been scrolling social media

112
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,400
uh when i'm chilling out trying to relax

113
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,760
a little bit i scroll just like you and

114
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,879
i've been seeing a lot of great things

115
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:28,719
on social media

116
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,318
i've also been seeing a lot of [ __ ]

117
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,080
one thing that drives me crazy is i see

118
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:33,839
a lot of grow rooms a lot of grow tents

119
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,239
a lot of grow environments

120
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,479
that simply are wasting a ton of space

121
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,080
if you've got a five by five grow tent i

122
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,439
would like to see at least four by four

123
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,799
worth of herb in there we don't need

124
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:44,799
three by three we don't need

125
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,400
one plant and a five by five one plant

126
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,000
over here one plant over here

127
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
let's put those right under the center

128
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,639
of the light get them as much light as

129
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,039
we can possibly get them

130
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,399
spoil those two plants or even better

131
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,239
let's fill the room

132
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,599
you guys a lot of places growing

133
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,200
cannabis is illegal

134
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,560
and you're growing and you're setting up

135
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,359
a five by five you're paying for

136
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,640
electricity

137
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,080
you're going in you're paying for the

138
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:04,958
lights you're paying for the electricity

139
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,519
you're losing

140
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,158
you're using your time your manpower

141
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,360
also

142
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,840
you're committing a crime if you're

143
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,519
gonna commit a [ __ ] felony go in

144
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,519
fill that [ __ ] room don't commit a

145
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,079
felony for a little couple of nugs

146
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,720
commit a [ __ ] felony for a rewarding

147
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,319
[ __ ]

148
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,919
prize at the end you guys so what i'm

149
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,918
saying is i see a five by five tent with

150
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,639
like one plant over here and one plant

151
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:26,959
over here

152
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,639
this shit's a disorganized chaotic mess

153
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,680
have a strategy have a plan

154
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,879
fill your 5x5 if you've got a 5x5 canopy

155
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,360
a 5x5 tent

156
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,918
i'd like to see a 5x5 canopy in there my

157
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,000
tents

158
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,758
when i unzip the tent it just busts out

159
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,560
it looks like a 70s bush busting out of

160
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,000
a bikini

161
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,918
it's ridiculous when i open the tent

162
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,600
that's what i like to see from you so

163
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,959
think about how to fill that tent

164
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
maximize your space

165
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,478
let's not get a five by five tent and

166
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,479
put three plants in there and have one

167
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,680
super tall one super short one not even

168
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,199
under the [ __ ] light

169
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
think about what you're doing you're

170
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,319
using the lights you're using the space

171
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
you're using the electricity

172
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,399
the soil all of that costs money time

173
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,079
energy and like i said before you're

174
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:05,918
possibly committing a crime

175
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,918
if you're gonna commit a crime make it

176
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:09,439
[ __ ] worth it felonies are not free

177
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:10,319
that's what we used to say don't do your

178
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,719
own felonies

179
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,519
for free for yourself either all right i

180
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,440
just wanted to say

181
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,959
fill your space if i gave you a cooler

182
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,719
and i was like here's a box it's three

183
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,159
feet by three feet by three feet

184
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,840
you can put as much weed in there as you

185
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,880
want are you gonna put two feet by two

186
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:23,359
feet worth of weight or are you gonna

187
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:25,199
put

188
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,479
[ __ ] three by three by three worth of

189
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,120
weed in that [ __ ] you're gonna fill it

190
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,639
up right

191
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,478
if i said fill it up with cookies or

192
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,918
beer or weed whatever you want you're

193
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,599
gonna stack that [ __ ] up you're not

194
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,599
gonna just stack the middle of it put a

195
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,840
couple over here a couple over here

196
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,439
that is not efficient i'm a commercial

197
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,279
cannabis cultivator i'm all about

198
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,120
efficiency productivity

199
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,559
uh and then also i'm a drummer so i'm

200
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,319
used to packing the car

201
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,399
uh if there's a space put some [ __ ] in

202
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,240
that space dude all right that's enough

203
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,758
ranting about space and wasted space in

204
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,000
your grow tents i see it a lot on social

205
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,080
media

206
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,519
it drives me crazy organize your tent

207
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,120
what the hell are you guys doing get in

208
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,079
there and clean that [ __ ] up if you're

209
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,160
gonna commit a crime

210
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,478
[ __ ] commit a crime all right that is

211
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
enough of the rambling intro part of the

212
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,439
podcast i do have a couple of messages

213
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,680
here that are going to get me

214
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:09,360
rambling on a focused subject i told you

215
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,800
guys those dabs are that

216
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,160
dirty business i think that's what it's

217
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,038
called dirty business that [ __ ] got me

218
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
high as [ __ ]

219
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,639
i'm talkative i'm rambly but that is

220
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,478
good for a podcast

221
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,918
this one comes from patreon before we go

222
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,800
too far on patreon let's give a shout

223
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:22,879
out to my buddy

224
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,000

225
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,719

229
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:33,120
team for a long time been showing love

230
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,600
for a long time big shout out

231
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,240
to saint skinny and mama skinny mama

232
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
saint

233
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,519
however you want it to go this is how

234
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,840
the first question from patreon goes

235
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,839
this one says rosta jeff get your lab

236
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:44,239
coat then it says what are the chances

237
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:46,560
that an

238
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,360
industrial hemp farm would potentially

239
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,439
pollinate and

240
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,919
outdoor cannabis grow would it even

241
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,519
pollinate yes it's the same plant

242
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,359
technically in colorado the only

243
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,959
difference between cannabis and hemp

244
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,199
is a [ __ ] lab test if you got more

245
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,038
than .03 thc

246
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,439
your cannabis if you got less than that

247
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:06,079
it's hemp so it is the same plant

248
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,000
uh that is how we make strains of

249
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,560
different cannabinoid ratios is by

250
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,519
breeding

251
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
high thc to high cbd or other varieties

252
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,959
we just breed those together

253
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,960
then you come out with different ratios

254
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,159
different numbers of thc and cbd that is

255
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:19,038
how it's done how the breeding has

256
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,400
happened

257
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,159
uh but what are the chances of

258
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,560
industrial hemp potentially

259
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,319
potentially potentially that's my new

260
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,839
word what are the chances of industrial

261
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,759
hype potentially

262
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,519
uh pollinationaling uh let's see it

263
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,038
right now potentially pollinating an

264
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,639
outdoor cannabis grow

265
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,639
would it even cross-pollinate yes it

266
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,560
absolutely would it is the same plant

267
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,280
it is very possible it's very likely

268
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,360
unfortunately it's kind of common

269
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,598
back in the day we had agricultural

270
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,280
rules that you couldn't set up a farm of

271
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,240
a certain type within a certain amount

272
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,318
of kilometers

273
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,918
of another farm of that same type when

274
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,360
the cannabis industry came in

275
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,680
we started building hemp farms and

276
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,280
cannabis farms somebody forgot about

277
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,400
that guideline and that rule and we've

278
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,598
begun building

279
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,478
cannabis farms and grows and hemp grows

280
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,240
and hemp farms

281
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,918
right on top of each other and it is

282
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,639
happening i know of several people who

283
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,159
have lost

284
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,038
cannabis crops and who have had hemp

285
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,560
crops contaminated due to stray pollen

286
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,800
something that did happen last year that

287
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,639
messed up an entire outdoor hemp crop

288
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,120
is somebody's outdoor hemp crop was

289
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,960
pollinated early by a cannabis crop

290
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,399
their intention was to make outdoor

291
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,079
feminized hemp seed

292
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:25,758
that [ __ ] got destroyed by somebody

293
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,359
else's crop before that they're in

294
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,280
litigation now finding out

295
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
if there's something if that farmer who

296
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,718
pollinated on accident owes

297
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,478
the farmer who got pollinated something

298
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,080
so that [ __ ] does happen it's very

299
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,680
common it's very likely

300
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,599
there are things that people do to try

301
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,359
to prevent that there are different

302
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,120
kinds of trees and plants we can set up

303
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,680
as a barrier that will stop the pollen

304
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,879
so it does happen it happens often it's

305
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,479
very possible

306
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,399
and like i said before that's how we get

307
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
different types of either hemp or

308
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,958
different types of cannabis if you

309
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,559
pollinate that hemp

310
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,479
let's say you got some cbd that's got

311
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,518
like 20 or some hemp with like 20

312
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,159
cbd and cannabis with 20 thc when those

313
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,399
cross

314
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,159
you're gonna get wildly wildly varying

315
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,839
different cannabinoid ratios so

316
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,199
that's what we do to cross things it is

317
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,000
absolutely possible

318
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
same plant to cross pollinate that stuff

319
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,919
so

320
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,680
it will happen it will continue to

321
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,599
happen until people uh

322
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,079
learn the distancing rules this is why i

323
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,240
stress so much at outdoor season this is

324
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,160
why i tell people how important it is

325
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
to find those male plants and get them

326
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:25,120
out of your garden yeah it's cool that

327
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,080
you're getting the seeds out of

328
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,679
your garden you're not going to

329
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,440
pollinate your garden but what about

330
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,599
everybody in your neighborhood

331
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,920
that is growing cannabis outdoors

332
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,720
everybody for miles has potential to be

333
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:36,958
pollinated

334
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,800
that pollen can go i'm gonna guess two

335
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:39,759
or three miles without being disrupted

336
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,919
if you get that wind

337
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,679
blowing that pollen just right it can go

338
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,278
two or three miles or you got some birds

339
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,399
or some bees just like the pollinators

340
00:09:45,278 --> 00:09:48,480
are supposed to do

341
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,080
they move pollen around quite far so

342
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,600
they land on your cannabis plants

343
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,040
they get pollen in their feathers or in

344
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,240
their bug fuzz i don't know what that

345
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,319
shit's called on a bug

346
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,440
uh they get on their little bug legs the

347
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,040
bug flies around

348
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,560
it goes to another cannabis plant it

349
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,000
just took that pollen to your from

350
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:03,359
another crop over to your crop it

351
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
pollinated your [ __ ]

352
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,720
that's why it's really really important

353
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,360
that we pay attention to getting male

354
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,399
plants

355
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,759
out of the outdoor garden as soon as

356
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,799
possible you're not only going to

357
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,039
potentially

358
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,078
potentially there that word is again

359
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,240
you're not only

360
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,239
potentially going to [ __ ] up your grow

361
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,278
but you could mess up every grow

362
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,600
for miles uh the custom of dealing with

363
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:24,958
that

364
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,320
in some states that have been growing

365
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,000
outdoor for quite a while if you

366
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,000
pollinate my crop

367
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,159
i come get your crop and then i may come

368
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
get your crop next year and can't do

369
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,039

370
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,000

371
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,719

reveal your identity it goes a lot like

406
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,120
this it says rasta jeff that is me

407
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,879
it says as you are one of the top

408
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,639
cannabis breeders in the world

409
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:43,919
i don't know about that i will accept

410
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,600
that title if you want to give it to me

411
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,278
never tried to get that title didn't

412
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,120
know that was a thing

413
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,039
um let's hear some feedback on that

414
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,959
anyway i thought you would be the person

415
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,759
to ask about this issue

416
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,958
some time ago i had wanted to obtain bog

417
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,519
seeds blue

418
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,958
kush that's bushy old growers blue kush

419
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,200
but they were sold out

420
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,799
as that strain quite often is sold out

421
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,480
because that was a badass strain

422
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,399
it says i periodically checked for a

423
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,399
restock but then as you know

424
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,440
bushy old grower from bog seeds passed

425
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,278
away suddenly

426
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,760
making the possibility of getting bog

427
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,838
seeds very slim yes once bogg died

428
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:19,439
the prices off all of his seeds

429
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,800
increased astronomically

430
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
hopefully some of those proceeds are

431
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,679
going to miss his bog because she is

432
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,639
still around and we do need to support

433
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,159
and take care of a

434
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,159
a lovely lady who does not have her

435
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,199
husband around the head of household the

436
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,199
[ __ ] bread winner

437
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,959
so hopefully some of those markups and

438
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,639
auctions are going to mrs bogg but yes

439
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,559
those seeds are now hard to find

440
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,320
it says i decided to make one last check

441
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,518
a few weeks ago and

442
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,440
seeds here now.com had a few packs in

443
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,679
stock so i got a pack

444
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,040
yes our friends at seeds herenow.com i'm

445
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,359
going to interrupt myself and do a quick

446
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:49,838
apology disclaimer for seeds herenow.com

447
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,639
they did

448
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,000
a spring cleaning of their website when

449
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,600
they did the spring cleaning they

450
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,879
discovered a couple of tech issues it's

451
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
none of my business to air their

452
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,200
business but

453
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,720
they had some tech issues they were

454
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,040
rebuilding the website it took them

455
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
longer than expected and anticipated

456
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:06,000
they're getting their [ __ ] together if

457
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,200
by the time this episode comes out they

458
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,879
should have their [ __ ] together

459
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,200
i want to apologize for them what they

460
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,879
were doing was updating their system to

461
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,399
give you as a customer the most

462
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,360
streamlined experience you could

463
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,039
possibly have

464
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,039
so for a couple of days they were down

465
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,039
but it was to improve service

466
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,919
for you as the customer that's what the

467
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,360
idea was uh while they were doing that

468
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,199
they did an inventory and they

469
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,959
discovered a lot of packs that

470
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,879
were in inventory that were not on the

471
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,479
website some things were on a vault some

472
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,000
things were on a stash

473
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,079
some things got discovered those have

474
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,639

the disclaimer for seeds here now i

499
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,199
covered two things check them out again

500
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,120
they did some website updates also

501
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,958
restocks on a lot of old gear that was

502
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,278
sold out now i'm gonna get myself back

503
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:23,518
here

504
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,720
into this message it says it made me

505
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,440
think about making

506
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,120
blue cush seeds to preserve it for my

507
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,720
future use isn't that amazing when

508
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,240
you've got some seeds and you love them

509
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,079
so much they're like i've got to

510
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,440
preserve this how do i do this again how

511
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,359
do i make more

512
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,600
that's what turns growers into breeders

513
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,680
that's where it all starts

514
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,680
so it says however i realized i'm

515
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,599
ignorant about making seeds he goes on

516
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:47,278
to say i don't mean that i don't know

517
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,199
that a male plant pollinates a female

518
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,120
plant but since i've got

519
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,078
limited space i'm going to need to

520
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,360
return my pollinated female to my flower

521
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,278
tent so

522
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,720
our friend has a basic understanding of

523
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,000
breeding he knows that a male and a

524
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,680
female makes seeds

525
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,278
he's got the basic idea he knows he's

526
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:04,958
going to make f2 seeds

527
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,559
the dilemma that our friend used to be

528
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,479
cool is running into here

529
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,078
is once they pollinate this plant it

530
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,720
will need to be returned

531
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,239
to the flowering room so that it can

532
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,120
continue to flower there's only one

533
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,959
flower room

534
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,879
he doesn't want to want to pollinate the

535
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,319
entire grow because he does need some

536
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,078
usable medicine

537
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,278
so um there are a couple things about

538
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,159
this but i'm going to continue with the

539
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,320
message

540
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,480
my questions are how long does it take

541
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,000
for pollen to impregnate a female

542
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,079
and if the pollen is immediately

543
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,519
accepted by the female can i then spray

544
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,838
that said female

545
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,679
with water to kill any remaining pollen

546
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,720
and safely place her back into the

547
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,719
end of the flowering tent also

548
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
if you think i would benefit from any

549
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,519
other information

550
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,720
uh to help advance my plan i would

551
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,919
appreciate the input we're gonna give

552
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,879
you some guidance and information here

553
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,319
in just a moment

554
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,240
uh it says i know you've been very busy

555
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,600
and swamped with questions uh

556
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,278
of course i love getting back to you bro

557
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
never feel stressed about that

558
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,639
i've had these seeds for several months

559
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,240
but because of unforeseen circumstances

560
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,480
my schedule was delayed everybody's

561
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,240
behind schedule my grow is off schedule

562
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,440
don't worry about that then it says uh

563
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,120
thank you for all you do for the

564
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,759
community bro you are very welcome thank

565
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,839
you for the

566
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,839
continued feedback and support then they

567
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,240
wrap it up with used to be cool

568
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,199
let's talk about your breeding questions

569
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,799
you've got

570
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,479
you've obviously got a male plant

571
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,078
somewhere that's producing pollen i want

572
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,440
to know where that male plant is

573
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,198
because if it's not in your main

574
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,720
flowering space you've got it somewhere

575
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:29,758
in a 1212 cycle producing pollen

576
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
what i would do in an ideal world is i

577
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,320
would put

578
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,000
that female plant i would get it into

579
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,959
flower i would move it in there with

580
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,639
that male plant

581
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,399
i would leave it in there for just a day

582
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,799
you know just put it in there knock it

583
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,839
uh let that male plant dust it real good

584
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,479
let that pollen

585
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,600
be accepted then i would just leave it

586
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,839
in that room

587
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,000
or i would put it in a veg room

588
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,079
ideally you would pollinate this plant

589
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,600
and give it two to three days maybe five

590
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:57,278
to seven days at the most

591
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,639
just to make sure that it's impregnated

592
00:16:57,278 --> 00:17:01,120
well then

593
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,839
i would move that plant back into a veg

594
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,000
room

595
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,919
that plants already got pollen all of

596
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,359
the bud sites that are going to receive

597
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,199
pollen have been pollinated

598
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,958
the magic has been done we're no longer

599
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,038
looking to make flowers or buds now

600
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,959
we're focused on making seeds

601
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,879
if you move that plant back into a veg

602
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,120
room under 186

603
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,319
it will continue to produce those seeds

604
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,078
it's been impregnated

605
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,240
its whole goal now is to finish those

606
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,558
seeds those seeds will keep going

607
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,519
so if you have a veg room you can move

608
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,879
that plant

609
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,359
into the veg area or leave it in that

610
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
room

611
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,199
where you just pollinated where that

612
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,440
male plant is and put that light on

613
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,279
the veg cycle i don't know if you've got

614
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,960
that extra room so that's just my main

615
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,319
idea i would put it back into the

616
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,919
vegetative room

617
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,558
the plants in the veg room can't get

618
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:49,440
pollinated the seeds will

619
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:51,200
mature more quickly in a vegetative room

620
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,480
because they're getting more photons

621
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,558
more light energy

622
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
and again we're not focused on flowers

623
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,798
so the plant that you have pollinated

624
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,079
will continue to produce those seeds at

625
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,720
the same time it will

626
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,918
reveg so you're going to have that plant

627
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,160
will be seeded

628
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,600
filled with viable seeds and it will

629
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,120
begin to make clones

630
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:10,879
that you can cut off of there to make

631
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:14,079
another mother plant to again

632
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,320
preserve that original mother so i

633
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,918
if you have the room i would put it into

634
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,759
a vegetative space

635
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
let me read because there was something

636
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,279
that got my attention here

637
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,038
and i thought of an idea that i wanted

638
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,119
to read to tell you

639
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:28,319
um yeah i think you've got the right

640
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:29,678
idea i can't think of what the part that

641
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,279
left my head was but i would just put it

642
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,640
back into the vegetative

643
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,240
space or um pollinate it

644
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,600
leave it in that flower room for a

645
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,000
couple of days you can leave it in there

646
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,519
for

647
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,359
in the dark if you need to after it

648
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,000
receives the pollen it can sit in that

649
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,240
dark space

650
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
for like 24 48 hours in the dark it

651
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,720
won't make a difference it won't get too

652
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:49,200
angry

653
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,720
then take that plant out of there spray

654
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,798
that plant down with water because the

655
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,440
pollen at this point has been received

656
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,038
spray yourself down with water spray the

657
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,880
other girls down with water

658
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,640
then you can put it back in that room

659
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,520
but i'm not going to guarantee that you

660
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,759
have killed

661
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,679
all of the pollen there still could be

662
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,200
viable pollen on that plant

663
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,320
that could get into that room you may

664
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,600
make minimal seeds but if you do

665
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,918
what's wrong with that is this your

666
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,599
personal crop maybe you get

667
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,080
uh maybe you got like four other strains

668
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,959
in there maybe the uh bog strain the

669
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,599
blue kush

670
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,279
is loaded with seeds maybe the red kush

671
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,159
the purple kush and the i'm gonna just

672
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,079
guess raphael

673
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,919
in there maybe maybe those all get

674
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,759
dusted with a couple of flecks of pollen

675
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,280
now maybe you've got four or five seeds

676
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,319
of all of those also

677
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,918
across to the blue kush maybe that's

678
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,678
what you did on accident maybe that's

679
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,000
not a bad idea maybe that's not a bad

680
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,480
deal

681
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,839
maybe you do want all those seedless but

682
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,798
that's going to be the worst case

683
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,399
scenario

684
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,079
the thing that left my brain it just

685
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,360
came back as i paused so

686
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,359
i'm going to talk about that another

687
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,079
thing you could really do that i as a

688
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,798
breeder

689
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,720
who i run seeded crops most of the time

690
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,558
in my grow spaces but i also like to do

691
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,319
a non-seeded crop so we got

692
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:59,839
a test run of new stuff that way mike

693
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,439
and i have something to [ __ ] smoke on

694
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,079
that's not seeded up we could try new

695
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,840
stuff

696
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,759
i can write strain reports i can select

697
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,199
phenotypes and keepers and move forward

698
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,960
projects

699
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,960
but i stagger my grows to where

700
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,720
these are so far into flower that they

701
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,240
can't receive pollen and these are so

702
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,120
early into flower that they can't

703
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,798
receive pollen

704
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,959
but my target plant is right at the

705
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:22,480
right time so i've got one crop that's

706
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,360
going to get seeded and one crop that's

707
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,880
almost done

708
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,558
and then another crop that's about to go

709
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,360
in flowers so it's just all about timing

710
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,440
at that point

711
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,199
stagger them to where one is too far

712
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,200
ahead one is too early

713
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
that may help you out i know you've

714
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,400
probably got one room

715
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,000
you probably got a flowering room maybe

716
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,720
you got a veg room uh

717
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,319
but um i'm confused on what you've got

718
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,159
because you've got another space with a

719
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,599
male plant that's in flower

720
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,280
you've got to have another space with

721
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,119
that boy that's in flower because if the

722
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,240
boy is in with the girls all your girls

723
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,079
are going to get seated

724
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,400
so i'm assuming there's a boy space

725
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,079
somewhere get that boy go in

726
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,440
get him you could put the girl right in

727
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:58,879
there with that boy the whole time you

728
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,080
can let them share space

729
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,000
or you could put that girl in there when

730
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,319
the pollination time is perfect

731
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,919
but just sacrifice that space once

732
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,359
you've cut down the mail cleaned them up

733
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,159
you can leave that girl in there for a

734
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:09,678
little while

735
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,600
until you feel like that pollen has been

736
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,519
absorbed i'd say just a few days

737
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,719
uh two to three days at the most five to

738
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,639
seven days

739
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,159
it's pregnant like a few seconds after

740
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,400
you pollinate it but

741
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,679
um leave it in that other space and then

742
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,759
move it to the veg room

743
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,038
under 18 6 or then move it back to the

744
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,480
other flower room but

745
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,319
treat it with water maybe treat it with

746
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,919
water a couple of times you know let it

747
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,079
receive the pollen let it sleep for a

748
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,840
couple of days hit it with water

749
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:35,359
uh let the lights [ __ ] cycle hit it

750
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,720
with water again move it back into the

751
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,678
other room hit those [ __ ] in that

752
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,519
room with water

753
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,360
spray yourself down also because that

754
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,639
pollen's gonna get everywhere

755
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:44,798
i feel like i've given you the right

756
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,640
idea either put the plant

757
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,558
in the space where the male was after

758
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,799
you pollinate it put the plant in the

759
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:52,639
veg space after you pollinate it or very

760
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,240
carefully spray everything down

761
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,480
and put it back into that flower room

762
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,480
your other option is to stagger

763
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,319
your crops which i know is kind of a

764
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,679
pain in the ass we all want to make as

765
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,200
much as we can you want to fill that

766
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,038
room like i just said

767
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,880
but sometimes you got to make a little

768
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:07,839
space just for that one pollinated

769
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
pregnant girl

770
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,480
the pregnant girls are always special

771
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,360
you got to treat them special give them

772
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,279
their own space

773
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:14,399
do special things special arrangements

774
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:15,678
for them

775
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,919
all right my buddy used to be cool i

776
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,519
hope i uh thoroughly successfully and

777
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,360
