00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,270

25
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,250
live batter from Green Dot labs this is

26
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,709
a blend of Paradise Island and Han Solo

27
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,590
Berger the flavor is described as

28
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,210
strawberry piña colada you know I think

29
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,549
I agree with that it's very tropical

30
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,469
it's very fruity it's very delicious I

31
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,840
think I tasted pineapple and coconut

32
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:12,000
maybe in there maybe that's the Pina

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,799
Colada part very delicious made me feel

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,599
like I was on a beach on an island I can

35
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,880
almost feel the wind blow through my

36

41
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,570

patreon all right I did say I was going

76
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,509
to do a rant about making and labeling

77
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,820
feminized seeds um something I should

78
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:47,280
say before I get into this is this is my

79
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,079
method this is how I do it I'm not

80
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,400
saying that your method the way you were

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,200
taught the way you learned the way you

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,180
read the way somebody else should you

83
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:56,729
had to do it is wrong I'm saying this is

84
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,250
how I do it and I personally have seen

85
00:02:56,729 --> 00:03:01,679
great success I think the people who end

86
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,599
up with my seeds see great success I

87
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,610
think the people who've end my seeds are

88
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,280
very satisfied with me and I do not get

89
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:11,670
any complaints so with that disclaimer

90
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,060
let's talk about how I make feminized I

91
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:16,500
read genetics seeds um the first thing I

92
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,479
want to cover something that really

93
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,930
frustrates me I see it on social media

94
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:24,949
people have this assumption this idea in

95
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:27,689
their head that feminized seeds are

96
00:03:24,949 --> 00:03:29,639
hermaphrodites they are not Herms

97
00:03:27,689 --> 00:03:32,430
they're not hermaphrodites they're not

98
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:33,869
Hermes I don't like the word hermie it

99
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,969
sounds very immature

100
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,530
it's a hermaphrodite or it's an intersex

101
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:39,269
plant if you want to chop the word

102
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,159
hermaphrodite down just say herm

103
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,200
Hermey sounds childish to me maybe

104
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,819
that's just weird to me that's not a big

105
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,649
deal let's continue the plants are not

106
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,599
hermaphrodites they are not intersex

107
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:54,150
they are true and trusted female plants

108
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:56,879
the females that I use have been stress

109
00:03:54,150 --> 00:04:00,510
tested and specially selected for

110
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,699
breeding if I have a female plant before

111
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:04,799
I even consider breeding with it I beat

112
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,169
the [ __ ] out of that plant and how do I

113
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:09,840
do that there are a lot of ways to

114
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:12,958
trigger a plant to show a hermaphroditic

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,789
trait or a intersex trait if it's in

116
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
that plant the easiest way to do it is

117
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:20,370
to disrupt the light cycle during flower

118
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:22,619
so when I am working with new plants if

119
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,720
I intend to breed with them I will put

120
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,728
that female plant into flower for about

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,690
two weeks everything is normal I'm on

122
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:29,279
1212

123
00:04:27,689 --> 00:04:30,920
I'm feeding it normally we're going into

124
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,209
flour things are starting to look good

125
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,009
as soon as the plant is comfortable in

126
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:37,079
twelve twelve I'm gonna [ __ ] it up and

127
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:37,949
put it on eighteen six now the plant

128
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,319
goes wait a minute

129
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:42,449
it was the fall now it's spring again

130
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,839
I'm still alive I don't know what to do

131
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:48,180
some plants will freak the [ __ ] out some

132
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,579
plants will show signs of intersex

133
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,470
traits of hermaphroditism within a few

134
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:54,419
days they will pop up little male

135
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:56,520
flowers they'll pop up full-on pollen

136
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,530
sacks they will show you problems you

137
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,699
get rid of those plants or do not breed

138
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:01,169
with them if you want to grow those in

139
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:02,610
your own private garden that is cool

140
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,110
you're not breeding you're not passing

141
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,500
on that trade just know that that's an

142
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,480
option

143
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,069
one day when you [ __ ] up if you get a

144
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,740
light leak if something goes wrong that

145
00:05:08,069 --> 00:05:12,870
plant could turn into a hermaphrodite

146
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,280
and that plant could express that trait

147
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,220
and that plant could pollinate your

148
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:18,479
garden I get rid of those I don't grow

149
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,640
them I don't breed them they're not

150
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,710
allowed in my grow I've got very high

151
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,870
standards for my breeding for my

152
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:26,579
cultivation if it shows any intersex

153
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:28,019
traits it goes bye-bye I don't want it

154
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:30,060
we're not hanging out it's not my friend

155
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:33,180
nothing personal I'm in it for business

156
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,370
I can't have problematic plants so the

157
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,680
bottom line is these are solid tried and

158
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,720
true tested females other ways that I

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,970
abuse them so I said then I'll change

160
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,130
that light cycle to eighteen six then I

161
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,110
may still not see problems so I'll put

162
00:05:44,129 --> 00:05:48,089
it back on twelve twelve after three to

163
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:49,410
five days now we're three weeks in we

164
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:51,719
either see some problems or we don't

165
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:53,640
I'll put it back on 1212 finish out

166
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,710
weeks three and four on 1212 then at

167
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,209
week six or seven let's just [ __ ] up

168
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:59,189
that light cycle all again let's put it

169
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:00,719
on 24 hours a day and see if those

170
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:02,370
plants her/him out see if they have any

171
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,070
signs of stress if they freaked out on

172
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,990
me those plants better not freak out if

173
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,219
they do guess what chop chop bye bye see

174
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,160
you later they don't get to play with my

175
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:13,590
friends anymore they're gone so I am

176
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,810
stress testing these plants also many of

177
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:17,729
the cultivars the plants the clones the

178
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:20,759
selections that I am using have come

179
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:25,230
from commercial cultivation facilities I

180
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:27,060
love all my bros and uh female grower

181
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,370
friends that work in these commercial

182
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,389
cultivation facilities but many of them

183
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,250
are young I love you guys they're 24 25

184
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,879
26 years old some of them are in their

185
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:40,810
early 30s a lot of them like to have fun

186
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,389
on the weekends a lot of them

187
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,699
maybe sometimes may take a couple too

188
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:47,379
many dabs on their lunch break so [ __ ]

189
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,750
happens in the commercial cultivation

190
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:52,839
facilities and when [ __ ] happens the

191
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:56,199
plants get seriously abused sometimes

192
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:58,000
also sometimes equipment fails HVAC will

193
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:00,699
fail watering irrigation will fail

194
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,029
something will go wrong I get to see a

195
00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:07,120
myriad of abuse and problems given to

196
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:09,039
these plants via the grow tax somebody

197
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,079
may be stoned and forget to pH a whole

198
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:13,150
batch of nutrients somebody may be

199
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,939
stoned in overwater a whole [ __ ] room

200
00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:17,888
somebody may just forget to even show up

201
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:19,750
to work that day sometimes [ __ ] happens

202
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,370
in a commercial cultivation facility

203
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:23,228
there are ramifications and

204
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:24,668
repercussions for the staff but also the

205
00:07:23,228 --> 00:07:26,620
plants have issues that we've got to

206
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:28,060
deal with I get to see the plants get

207
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:30,340
abused as what I'm saying you guys I've

208
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:32,079
seen them tortured in all sorts of ways

209
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:34,149
you can and cannot imagine so I know

210
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,279
what the plants are going to work with

211
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:38,049
many of the plants I work with I've seen

212
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,929
them in a commercial cultivation setting

213
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:42,759
and I've gotten to watch them in ah the

214
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,709
commercial cultivation in Pueblo West

215
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:46,930
and the one in Springs the one in South

216
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,129
Denver the one in northglenn I get to go

217
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,319
to these different facilities and

218
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:52,060
they've got the same cultivar in these

219
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,250
facilities so I get to see it grown by

220
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,139
four different leave growers I get to

221
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,569
see it abused by four different HVAC

222
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:00,189
systems I get to see four different bug

223
00:07:58,569 --> 00:08:01,959
infestations whatever happens in a

224
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:04,569
facility I get to see it four different

225
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,879
times in over hundreds of plants so I've

226
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:08,889
seen what will handle problems what will

227
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,569
not handle problems what is good for

228
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,668
growing under high stress conditions

229
00:08:10,569 --> 00:08:14,949
that's where I've selected my females

230
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,990
that I'm using for breeding so they're

231
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:19,120
not hermaphrodites they're able to take

232
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,728
abuse they take stress very well they

233
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,590
grow with good vigor and also I think

234
00:08:21,728 --> 00:08:25,810
they're good plants since they work in a

235
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:27,129
commercial environment where we I would

236
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:28,899
love to say we can pay attention to

237
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:30,759
every single plant sometimes [ __ ] gets

238
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:32,168
overlooked like I said earlier we got

239
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:33,429
young people who are having a good time

240
00:08:32,168 --> 00:08:34,569
working and they're the music's loud

241
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,788
we're going fast

242
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,219
[ __ ] happens I lost train of that

243
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:40,479
thought but [ __ ] happens I may need to

244
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,570
[ __ ] press pause and figure out where

245
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,250
I was

246
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:45,899
I'm selecting these plants from a

247
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:47,820
commercial cultivation facility so I've

248
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,828
seen a lot of problems I know they're

249
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,410
gonna grow well since the grow techs

250
00:08:49,828 --> 00:08:53,849
that show up late and stone and have a

251
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:56,039
lot of plants to handle some of them are

252
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,050
overloaded and I'm bombarded with work

253
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,639
if they can handle hundreds of these

254
00:08:58,049 --> 00:09:01,859
plants I know that when I breed to them

255
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,539
a grower who is new it growing will

256
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,550
definitely have good success with a

257
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,139
small batch of these plants they're good

258
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,639
successful plants is what I think I'm

259
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:10,649
trying to say with the good they've been

260
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,500
vetted by myself and by several other

261
00:09:10,649 --> 00:09:14,940
commercial growers so they're verified

262
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,828
qualified plants they are not

263
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,569
hermaphrodites they are not males they

264
00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:20,189
don't have problems those are the plants

265
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:22,049
that I start with the main most

266
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,930
important thing I think is starting with

267
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:26,879
trusted breeding stock you can't make a

268
00:09:24,929 --> 00:09:28,828
good cake with shitty ingredients you

269
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,659
can't have champions without good

270
00:09:28,828 --> 00:09:32,789
[ __ ] champion stock I don't know what

271
00:09:30,659 --> 00:09:35,519
I'm saying but you need good plants to

272
00:09:32,789 --> 00:09:37,980
begin with so let's say we've got to

273
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,149
qualified plants let's say we've got one

274
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,949
qualified plant we're gonna start with

275
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,528
one that we want to make feminized seats

276
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:46,948
from um let's kind of go through the

277
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:49,379
process of how I do this the selected

278
00:09:46,948 --> 00:09:50,849
cut is I would take two clones if I just

279
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:53,100
want to make a small batch of FEM seeds

280
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:55,680
I've got one plant I take two clones I

281
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,360
grow them I vege them they get about the

282
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,120
size where I'm ready to flower here's

283
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,839
where the feminization process kicks in

284
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,440
the one of the selected cuts is treated

285
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,930
with silver thiosulfate that is a blend

286
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,519
of silver nitrate and sodium thiosulfate

287
00:10:09,929 --> 00:10:13,379
those are two products that are

288
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,299
available for purchase on the internet

289
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:17,100
if you know where to look they are not

290
00:10:15,299 --> 00:10:18,719
very dangerous if you're safe with them

291
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:21,269
you can cause problems if you inhale

292
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,670
them just be careful follow the safety

293
00:10:21,269 --> 00:10:25,318
precautions on the containers and you

294
00:10:23,669 --> 00:10:26,338
will be fine wear a mask wear some

295
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:27,958
gloves you'll be okay you're probably

296
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,019
wearing a mask today anyway don't worry

297
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:34,109
about it so I mix up my own silver

298
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:37,828
thiosulfate solution then it is diluted

299
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:40,528
to specific dilutions then it is applied

300
00:10:37,828 --> 00:10:43,588
via a spray I spray it directly onto the

301
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:46,230
plant by itself without a surfactant I'm

302
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,779
applying diluted silver thiosulfate

303
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:52,199
solution onto a plant at very specific

304
00:10:48,778 --> 00:10:54,778
dilutions and very specific intervals

305
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:56,399
what does that mean the strength of my

306
00:10:54,778 --> 00:10:58,889
solution varies based on

307
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,379
the plant I am trying to reverse some

308
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:02,970
plants want really strong solutions some

309
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,350
plants really freak out if you spray

310
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,050
them too strong they need a lighter

311
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,759
solution more times it is kind of you

312
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:11,370
have to learn the plant so what do I

313
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:13,889
mean by intervals I spray it in a very

314
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,659
very carefully scheduled time I know

315
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,009
exactly which day those plants are

316
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,559
getting sprayed I can tell you how many

317
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:22,110
times each plant that I reverse will get

318
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:23,819
sprayed if I've worked with it a couple

319
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,129
of times excuse me I'm choking on my own

320
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,840
words if I've worked with the plant

321
00:11:26,129 --> 00:11:29,730
reversing it several times I have

322
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,590
already got a good idea a notebook a

323
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,060
recipe in my head somewhere I've got it

324
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,950
written down and marked down but I know

325
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,629
it needs this dilution it needs to be

326
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:39,450
sprayed this many times for optimal

327
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:42,509
pollen production if you spray with too

328
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:44,879
hard of a solution too strong of a

329
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,830
solution sometimes the plants will

330
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,539
produce pollen sacks but they will not

331
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,490
produce any pollen you'll get a really

332
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:52,349
Paul and Sachi plant nothing comes out

333
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,990
of it if you don't use a strong enough

334
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:56,759
solution obviously it doesn't reverse so

335
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,159
you've got to find the balance some

336
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:01,080
plants want to be sprayed really hard a

337
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:03,179
couple of times some plants want to be

338
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,220
sprayed really lightly a bunch of times

339
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:07,559
some plants want to be sprayed really

340
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:09,480
hard a lot of times it's all about the

341
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,549
plant and what it takes to reverse that

342
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,500
plant and the only way to learn that is

343
00:12:11,549 --> 00:12:15,509
by doing it to that specific plant and

344
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,580
watching the plan sometimes the leaves

345
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:19,259
will crinkle up and it looks like you

346
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:21,509
just shocked that plant with a [ __ ]

347
00:12:19,259 --> 00:12:23,909
laser you've gone a little bit too hard

348
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:25,799
but often times those plants make a lot

349
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:27,629
of great pollen we're not going for the

350
00:12:25,799 --> 00:12:29,759
looks we're going for pollen so it's all

351
00:12:27,629 --> 00:12:33,299
about pollen production is the main goal

352
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:35,850
so I mix up silver thiosulfate i dilute

353
00:12:33,299 --> 00:12:38,759
it to specific delusions and I spray at

354
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:40,769
specific intervals when I spray I spray

355
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,210
the [ __ ] out of the plant I remove the

356
00:12:40,769 --> 00:12:44,009
plant that is going to get sprayed out

357
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:46,440
of the grow space so it is the only one

358
00:12:44,009 --> 00:12:48,090
to get sprayed I soak it to the point of

359
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,740
runoff that plant is dripping there's a

360
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:52,860
puddle on the floor around the plant uh

361
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,860
I really soak it I also make sure to

362
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,840
spray the sticks and the main stalk

363
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,310
I don't just focus on the leaves I want

364
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:03,420
to get a lot of silver into this plant

365
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:06,239
so I'm using silver thiosulfate the

366
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:08,399
thiosulfate acts as a carrier the silver

367
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,810
cannot penetrate the leaf surface and

368
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,600
get into the plant the

369
00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:14,159
sulfate makes it more bioavailable for

370
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,329
the plant I guess you want to say is I

371
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:16,559
don't know if that's the correct word it

372
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:19,078
makes it more I gives it better

373
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,388
penetration for the leaf surface that

374
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:23,039
gets this silver into the plant the

375
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:25,318
silver is the active ingredient that is

376
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,078
going to work the magic so I've selected

377
00:13:25,318 --> 00:13:30,659
proper plants I have mixed up a solution

378
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,120
I have made a schedule and I've applied

379
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:35,669
my solution at the proper schedule I've

380
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,528
applied to runoff we've gotten silver

381
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:38,878
thiosulfate into the plant that silver

382
00:13:37,528 --> 00:13:42,480
is into the plant now let's talk about

383
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,550
how and why this feminization process

384
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:48,329
works I've just sprayed the plants with

385
00:13:44,549 --> 00:13:49,979
silver silver stops the copper movement

386
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:51,508
within the plant there is copper moving

387
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,550
in the plant we feed the plants lots of

388
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:54,990
minerals lots of elements copper is one

389
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:56,399
of the things that is abundant and

390
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,659
moving within our plants I don't know

391
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,490
that abundant was the appropriate word

392
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:03,568
it is present and moving within our

393
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:05,519
plants when I disrupt disrupt the copper

394
00:14:03,568 --> 00:14:08,549
movement by spraying the silver

395
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,299
thiosulfate that disruption triggers an

396
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:14,549
ethylene response ethylene is a hormone

397
00:14:12,299 --> 00:14:17,490
that triggers and I just wrote down a

398
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:19,438
lot of different reactions in different

399
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,000
species of plants and if you research

400
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:23,789
what ethylene does in plants it has a

401
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,610
lot of different functions and triggers

402
00:14:23,789 --> 00:14:27,838
in plants it makes some plan to ripen it

403
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,919
has a lot to do a lot to do with

404
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,689
ripening and senescence in cannabis it

405
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,179
makes cannabis think that the end is

406
00:14:33,688 --> 00:14:38,370
near because I'm ripening for some

407
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:41,278
reason and I wasn't ready to ripen I'm

408
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:44,188
not sure what to do cannabis is main

409
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,679
goal is to reproduce just like a lot of

410
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:49,318
us all it wants to do is reproduce so a

411
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,239
female cannabis plant it's only instinct

412
00:14:49,318 --> 00:14:52,919
is to survive it wants to make the only

413
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:55,049
way it can reproduce the only way it can

414
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:56,490
survive is to make seeds so that next

415
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:59,669
year those seeds can grow and it can

416
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:01,528
carry on its generation so when we freq

417
00:14:59,669 --> 00:15:03,479
this plant out it kind of panics and it

418
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:05,999
goes I don't really know what to do I

419
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,860
may die my hormones are all [ __ ] up

420
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:10,019
I'm scared of life right now here's what

421
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,579
I'm gonna do and it makes pollen sacks

422
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:12,959
because it's already got the female

423
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:14,549
we've got a female plant it's already

424
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,649
got the female sex part so that it can

425
00:15:14,549 --> 00:15:18,448
breed it makes pollen sacks to where now

426
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,980
it's got the part of the breeding that

427
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:21,679
it was missing now that plan is

428
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,570
self-sufficient

429
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,859
people are gonna say you've got pollen

430
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,040
sacks you've got a hermaphrodite you've

431
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,110
got a male no there are no male

432
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,299
chromosomes present because I have

433
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:34,039
selected a tried and true solid female

434
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,809
and we have proven that by my stress

435
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,000
testing earlier by messing up the white

436
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,619
schedule by overfeeding it by giving it

437
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,269
too much cold I didn't talk too much

438
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,580
about stress testing but light is the

439
00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,409
main way I do overfeed I give it cold I

440
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,570
give it heat give it too much co2 I

441
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:49,819
don't give it co2 I withhold waterings

442
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:51,290
stress him out let [ __ ] the guys at

443
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:53,028
the grow grow them they will stress them

444
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:54,889
for you and tell you what stresses those

445
00:15:53,028 --> 00:15:56,990
plants out so it is not a hermaphrodite

446
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,449
it is not a male it is not showing

447
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,070
intersex traits this is a female that

448
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:03,110
has been treated with a chemical that is

449
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:06,528
now hormonal e reacting by producing

450
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:09,200
pollen sacks those pollen sacks contain

451
00:16:06,528 --> 00:16:13,730
pollen but the magic part is there are

452
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:17,028
no male chromosomes within that pollen

453
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:19,430
there's no male pollen all of the pollen

454
00:16:17,028 --> 00:16:21,588
in here is female our friend mr. soll

455
00:16:19,429 --> 00:16:23,569
made a great analogy he said just

456
00:16:21,589 --> 00:16:26,330
imagine if you put your female plant

457
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:28,430
here and your pollen donating plant here

458
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,440
in this case it's a reversed female and

459
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:33,169
we put a filter between them it would

460
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,089
only filter out male pollen that is

461
00:16:33,169 --> 00:16:37,338
basically what we have learned to do by

462
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:39,350
creating feminized pollen there is no

463
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:42,890
male pollen no male chromosomes

464
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,430
available in this exchange so now I have

465
00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:46,669
created

466
00:16:43,429 --> 00:16:49,429
female all female pollen eckesachs

467
00:16:46,669 --> 00:16:51,649
pollen there's no wise no males allowed

468
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:54,139
no boys allowed this is all girls club

469
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,809
in this situation if I have done my

470
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,970
selections properly and I think my track

471
00:16:56,809 --> 00:17:02,028
record shows that I am pretty damn good

472
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:04,850
at selecting female plants for feminized

473
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:08,670
seed production so at this point we have

474
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:10,859
got female or feminized pollen

475
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,390
that is the basic beginning of making

476
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:14,189
feminised seeds that is where it all

477
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,840
starts it's all about the female pollen

478
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:18,509
so I've taken silver that I've taken

479
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,209
selected plants made my solution applied

480
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:23,039
the solution and that silver has created

481
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:24,539
an ethylene a copper disruption which

482
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,460
created an ethylene response which

483
00:17:24,539 --> 00:17:27,599
triggered the plants to create pollen

484
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,460
sacks that is kind of the short

485
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,929
condensed version but for you guys to

486
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,009
understand that's really all you need to

487
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,870
know if you want to read more I

488
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:36,359
encourage it because it's really fun

489
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:38,039
learning about hormones and ethylene and

490
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:40,229
plants you'll really open up your mind

491
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:42,930
to learning more so at this point we

492
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,089
have got a female plant that is now

493
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,759
dropping feminized pollen that is the

494
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:49,859
first half of our breeding combination

495
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,839
remember earlier I said we were going to

496
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:53,699
take two clones of the same plant now

497
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:55,409
we've got one it is reversed when we

498
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:57,059
treat it with the silver thiosulfate and

499
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:59,190
it starts changing its sex we have now

500
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,779
reversed the sex it's kind of gotten a

501
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,420
sex change but we just call it reversed

502
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,980
to be polite so now we've got the one

503
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,529
reversed plant we've got the remaining

504
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,360
clone that we have not done anything to

505
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:11,309
it is growing just like it normally

506
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,569
should maybe we've bottomed it and

507
00:18:11,309 --> 00:18:14,639
cleaned it up a little bit maybe you

508
00:18:12,569 --> 00:18:16,169
topped it to get more tops whatever you

509
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,270
want to do to keep that plant growing

510
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:21,150
happily and healthily now it is time to

511
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,799
put the plants in to flower you've got a

512
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,930
couple of options here things you can do

513
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,849
you can either collect the pollen from

514
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,769
the reversed plant and store it and then

515
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:30,389
apply it later but what I would prefer

516
00:18:28,769 --> 00:18:32,190
to do is just put that plant in the room

517
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:34,759
along with the females that are going to

518
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:37,130
get pollinated so

519
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:38,599
in this situation you need if since I'm

520
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,890
choosing to put the mail in the plant

521
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,048
with the girls I need to get him

522
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,730
pollinating get him started ahead of

523
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:46,099
time for the females he's going to take

524
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,089
a while to produce pollen reversed

525
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:52,699
plants tend to take about two weeks ten

526
00:18:50,089 --> 00:18:56,389
to ten days to two weeks longer to drop

527
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,548
pollen in a standard true male plant a

528
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,190
male plant will start putting out pollen

529
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:03,410
sometimes day 1012 but hopefully around

530
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:05,900
day 14 17 he started getting pollen

531
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:08,419
around 8 23 to 30 you're really

532
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:11,960
pollinating with a reversed plant I

533
00:19:08,419 --> 00:19:15,500
generally don't get pollen until days 25

534
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:18,019
to 32 ish sometimes a little bit later

535
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,880
depending on the cultivar and how well I

536
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,009
reversed her sometimes if I'm learning

537
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,929
it'll take a little longer and I

538
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:26,240
honestly don't get a lot of pollen from

539
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:28,160
reversed plants that's why they are a

540
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,039
little bit more pricey than the regular

541
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,048
seeds so the normal male plant will

542
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:37,308
pollinate much earlier the reverse plant

543
00:19:33,048 --> 00:19:39,740
pollinates around day 26 to 35 ish

544
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:41,178
hopefully somewhere in that area so what

545
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,579
we've got to do is we've got to get him

546
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:46,548
going in flower and starting to produce

547
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:48,230
his pollen way before the females here

548
00:19:46,548 --> 00:19:50,119
is a trick that I usually charge money

549
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,009
to tell people but I love you guys

550
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:54,319
and if you've listened to this this far

551
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:57,169
you deserve this tip when I am making

552
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:00,740
feminized seeds the way that I time it

553
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:03,740
properly I do not put my females in the

554
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:07,400
flowering chamber until my reversal has

555
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:09,019
begin to solidly show me some male parts

556
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,850
once I've got some pollen sacks and some

557
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:12,859
balls popping up and I'm certain that my

558
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:14,649
reversal is working that's what I'll

559
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:16,759
move the girls into the flowering room

560
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,780
sometimes if you move them into there

561
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:20,119
too early

562
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:21,649
the females miss their peak pollination

563
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,569
point and then it takes too long for

564
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:25,790
that reversal to start dumping pollen

565
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:27,529
you get very little pollen you also get

566
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:29,569
very little pollen reception you get

567
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:31,668
very little seed production and it is

568
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:33,649
not worth your time and space I'm a

569
00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:35,809
commercial seed producer I've got to

570
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:37,759
time it out very well so as soon as I

571
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:39,769
see that guy not as soon but I know when

572
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,419
when I see the guy making his balls the

573
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:43,099
girl making her balls I know that that's

574
00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:44,780
[ __ ] gets confusing when he got these

575
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:47,178
things going on but it's 20/20 we got to

576
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:48,740
accept this [ __ ] when my female starts

577
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,360
showing her balls I said

578
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:52,130
that think about that my female plant

579
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,949
starts showing her balls that's when I

580
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:57,020
move my other females into the room to

581
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:58,700
receive the pollen now that plants going

582
00:20:57,019 --> 00:21:00,650
to drop pollen onto my girls that

583
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:03,740
happens just like a male and female the

584
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:06,679
I guess you can consider the pollen is

585
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:09,710
the sperm and the pistols and the ovules

586
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,059
are the female parts the ovaries inside

587
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,759
of a lady so we just got to get the jizz

588
00:21:11,058 --> 00:21:15,829
in there so we get the reversed pollen

589
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,539
on to the female plant I keep saying

590
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:19,579
female because there is no male that's

591
00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:22,460
how we are making feminized seeds

592
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:24,289
so we're pollinating we have now taken

593
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:26,509
the pollen from the reversed plant and

594
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:27,829
put that pollen all over the at the

595
00:21:26,509 --> 00:21:30,109
right time at the appropriate time

596
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:31,669
somewhere probably around day eighteen

597
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:33,079
to twenty three twenty five on the

598
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:35,480
flowering plant is when you want that

599
00:21:33,079 --> 00:21:37,279
pollen to hit day thirty-two is probably

600
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:39,500
like around when it's way too [ __ ]

601
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,819
late so get it around eighteen twenty

602
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,759
three twenty five somewhere in that area

603
00:21:40,819 --> 00:21:45,859
depending on the cultivar colony now we

604
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,779
have pollinated now this is where we

605
00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,369
have two different options of course in

606
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:51,139
my example I said we're going to use the

607
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:53,959
same cut so let's talk about that well

608
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:56,300
we have now done is called selfing a

609
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,799
plan the best way I can say this for you

610
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,230
to remember is that plan just [ __ ]

611
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:02,058
itself it [ __ ] in itself and it made

612
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:03,589
clones of itself it didn't make clones

613
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:04,849
and made seeds of itself I shouldn't

614
00:22:03,589 --> 00:22:06,289
have said clones that's the wrong word

615
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:09,289
disregard the word clones I'm gonna move

616
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:12,079
forward it made reproductions of itself

617
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:14,178
it made offspring progeny of itself we

618
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,619
self that plan there are a lot of

619
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:18,050
reasons why we could do this and a lot

620
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:21,079
of benefits um I've got a lot of

621
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:23,269
favorite plants but I cannot keep every

622
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:25,609
plant so right now I would like to cycle

623
00:22:23,269 --> 00:22:28,339
a couple of plants out and a couple of

624
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:29,928
plants in let's just say that I want to

625
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,519
I'm not gonna do it to nobody freak out

626
00:22:29,929 --> 00:22:33,290
let's say I want to get rid of the

627
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,879
grateful dog because I don't have space

628
00:22:33,289 --> 00:22:37,039
I want to get rid of it I want to coal

629
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,450
to plants bring in two more if I want to

630
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,058
get rid of grateful dog but I'm afraid

631
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,940
to lose it forever one thing I could do

632
00:22:41,058 --> 00:22:45,799
is sell fit take two clones make Paul

633
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,529
and put the pollen on the same plant now

634
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:50,779
I've got self seeds there is no

635
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:53,029
adulteration of genetics so I have

636
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:54,980
preserved my grateful dog when I want it

637
00:22:53,029 --> 00:22:56,539
later it's over there in a bag in the

638
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,860
vault all I got to do is grow some seeds

639
00:22:56,539 --> 00:22:59,750
and find the one that I really like

640
00:22:57,859 --> 00:23:02,118
grateful dog is back in the rotation

641
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:04,308
I've got seeds for preservation so

642
00:23:02,118 --> 00:23:07,278
that is a really good way to preserve

643
00:23:04,308 --> 00:23:09,949
across and not adulterated what do I

644
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:12,138
mean by adulterating it we want a lot of

645
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:14,798
people want golden goat seeds but there

646
00:23:12,138 --> 00:23:16,698
is not a golden goat mail available also

647
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,729
here's something I want to touch on

648
00:23:16,699 --> 00:23:21,739
briefly there is no golden go there's no

649
00:23:19,729 --> 00:23:23,149
gorilla glue for male available so if

650
00:23:21,739 --> 00:23:24,828
you say you've got gorilla glue for

651
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:26,418
seeds and they're regular seeds you do

652
00:23:24,828 --> 00:23:28,848
not that is fake that's not a thing

653
00:23:26,419 --> 00:23:31,669
gorilla glue for was a clone only

654
00:23:28,848 --> 00:23:33,708
phenotype so you cannot have regular

655
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,839
seeds of gorilla glue for there's no boy

656
00:23:33,709 --> 00:23:37,999
it is adulterated there's something else

657
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:40,999
crossed into it it could be a back cross

658
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,929
it could be a FEM seed GG for purely not

659
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:44,509
a possibility

660
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:46,399
golden go purely not a possibility there

661
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:48,469
was not a male of those released so

662
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:52,098
nobody's making pure unadulterated seeds

663
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:53,568
so now we can make unadulterated golden

664
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:56,598
goat feminized seeds we can make

665
00:23:53,568 --> 00:23:58,729
unadulterated greatful dog feminized

666
00:23:56,598 --> 00:24:00,798
seeds and store them for preservation in

667
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:03,048
the future also if people want to grow

668
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,638
that golden go they've got a really good

669
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:06,648
opportunity of getting the phenotype

670
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:09,408
that they see me post because I haven't

671
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:11,598
added any other ingredients into the

672
00:24:09,409 --> 00:24:14,629
[ __ ] the recipe it's still golden

673
00:24:11,598 --> 00:24:16,249
goat if I wanted to make seeds of it and

674
00:24:14,628 --> 00:24:18,078
not feminized it I would have to find a

675
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:20,629
male of something else and now it is

676
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:22,459
golden go across to whatever not pure

677
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:25,038
gold and go kind of [ __ ] it up for you

678
00:24:22,459 --> 00:24:27,259
so that is called selfing when you take

679
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:30,259
one plant reverse it put the pollen on a

680
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:32,868
cultivar of the same type it's got to be

681
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:34,749
the same plant golden go to Gold and go

682
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:37,249
Grateful dog to Grateful dog

683
00:24:34,749 --> 00:24:39,348
whatever that's as far as blueberry

684
00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:42,679
cookies - blueberry cookies now there is

685
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:44,798
another thing that we do with feminized

686
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:48,589
pollen we put the feminized pollen on

687
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:51,318
different cultivars so if I put the

688
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:54,198
golden goat pollen on Lemon Jeffrey

689
00:24:51,318 --> 00:24:55,999
there on the lemon skunk that makes

690
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:58,669
lemon Jeffrey golden goat pollen on a

691
00:24:55,999 --> 00:25:00,460
lemon skunk female makes feminized lemon

692
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:04,780
Jeffrey seeds

693
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:06,970
that is called a reversal or an r1 that

694
00:25:04,779 --> 00:25:09,519
indicates the difference between selfing

695
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:11,650
and using the pollen on another plant

696
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,139
what we have done there is we have

697
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:16,480
created a brand new hybrid we have made

698
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,340
a new line and we didn't have to use a

699
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,250
male plant in that so we've got a

700
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:23,980
feminized brand new hybrid so instead of

701
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:26,049
calling it an f1 or an s1 which is what

702
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,799
we would call a self project this is now

703
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:31,389
an r1 to indicate to my customers and

704
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:33,730
people reading about it that this is a

705
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:37,480
reversed feminized cross there was not a

706
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:40,360
male used it was an R so the S indicates

707
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,089
self and if I say s1 that's the self

708
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:46,179
first generation if I say R that is the

709
00:25:43,089 --> 00:25:49,059
reversed first generation r1 is a first

710
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:51,970
generation reversal so I think that

711
00:25:49,059 --> 00:25:55,269
covers the basics of FEM seeds really

712
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:57,940
quickly important is selection the most

713
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:59,529
important part is selection select solid

714
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,049
females then make your silver

715
00:25:59,529 --> 00:26:03,670
thiosulfate solution the next important

716
00:26:02,049 --> 00:26:06,430
part is learning the delusions and

717
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:08,920
application intervals and rates apply

718
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,480
your silver silver thiosulfate then

719
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,519
you've got to time out your males and

720
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,200
females get the mail dump and pollen get

721
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:15,879
the females ready to receive pollen at

722
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,789
the same time then you've got to

723
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,930
pollinate then everything else if you're

724
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:22,359
breeding if you're growing seeds

725
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:24,640
everything else happens just the same as

726
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:26,949
it did with regular seeds your Rapala

727
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,590
nating just like you are any other crop

728
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:31,660
um we're going to make self seeds or

729
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:34,599
we're going to make reversed seeds there

730
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:36,400
is no reason why you cannot put so if I

731
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:37,990
wanted to reverse gold and go I can

732
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,850
reverse the golden goat put a clone of

733
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:41,890
golden goat in the room put a clone of

734
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:44,319
platinum tangi in the room and put a

735
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:46,930
clone of lemon skunk in the room and now

736
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,730
I can make golden goat films lemon skunk

737
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,740
our lemon Geoffrey films and also

738
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,730
platinum it's the Sunkist fans I got a

739
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,140
lot of [ __ ] my brain right now I'm

740
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,120
trying to keep it all straight but I can

741
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,640
make three different lines of FEM seeds

742
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:59,049
from that one golden go reversed plant

743
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,690
and that's why you see me making

744
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:03,869
multiple crosses the red pill the blue

745
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:07,210
pill is a golden goat feminized cross

746
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:08,709
lemon Geoffrey platinum tangi the golden

747
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,150
goat there are several of them the

748
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,340
garlic goat which was kind of rare

749
00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:14,210
that's I've been going out those are all

750
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:16,279
feminized golden go across

751
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,960
many of them happen in the same room at

752
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:19,670
the same time I don't have to breed just

753
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:21,559
golden goat two golden goat I can put

754
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,870
multiple girls in there and make a lot

755
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,369
of great crosses so when I do golden

756
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,529
goats a golden goat just to recap and

757
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:29,479
keep it in your brain that is a self it

758
00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:31,430
is [ __ ] itself I know that's crass

759
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,950
but you're not gonna forget if I

760
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:36,230
pollinate anything else with that pollen

761
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,330
that is a reversal and those will both

762
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:41,620
be feminized and here's where I'm going

763
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:45,379
to reiterate they are not hermaphrodites

764
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:49,299
99.9% of the feminized seeds I produce

765
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:51,470
are true feminized seeds there is 0.1%

766
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:53,389
that gives me the opportunity for

767
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,130
complaints and error I don't get the

768
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:56,750
complaints and [ __ ] problems you guys

769
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:59,030
nobody sends me emails saying I bought

770
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,250
FEM seeds and I've got hermaphrodites or

771
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:03,710
I've got problems because I feel like my

772
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,740
process first of all I keep reiterating

773
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:09,019
that selection process I feel like that

774
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,809
process is solid I feel like my reversal

775
00:28:09,019 --> 00:28:14,480
process is solid then here's something

776
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:16,700
the next step for a breeder for anybody

777
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,559
making FEM seeds here is the next most

778
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:21,680
important step for you to do you have

779
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,839
got to grow them your self do not give

780
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,299
them to friends do not sell them don't

781
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:28,099
donate them you may be setting people

782
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,539
you may be giving them [ __ ] dynamite

783
00:28:28,099 --> 00:28:31,579
for their grow room you may have just

784
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:33,619
given them a big batch of hermaphrodite

785
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:35,269
seeds if intersex seeds they're gonna

786
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:36,919
put them in there grow they may not be

787
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:38,509
experienced growers they're gonna have

788
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,580
it growing you told them feminized

789
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:43,039
they're not even looking for males then

790
00:28:40,579 --> 00:28:44,569
guess what first day a week three Kapow

791
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,659
everything is pollinated because you

792
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:50,450
done [ __ ] up so your responsibility as

793
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,800
a breeder a pollen chucker a cannabis

794
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:54,799
community member somebody who's trying

795
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:57,769
to help is to grow the seeds you made

796
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,710
yourself grow them see what you've got

797
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:02,450
if you get one hermaphrodite one

798
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:04,340
intersex plant out of that batch of

799
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:06,319
seeds you need to reconsider what you're

800
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:09,740
going to do do you want to put that out

801
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:12,019
there to the community one batch of herm

802
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:14,900
seeds can ruin a seed company's

803
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,759
reputation for the entire future you can

804
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,250
be on top of the world and if you

805
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,960
release one line of Herms you may have

806
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,819
just ruined your seed company for the

807
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,950
rest of your career she'll still sell

808
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:27,279
some seeds but people will be very

809
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:29,140
reluctant very hesitant they will

810
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,849
I'm looking at me for my fem seeds

811
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:31,870
because I've got a better reputation I'm

812
00:29:30,849 --> 00:29:34,089
not trying to brag I'm just saying

813
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:35,859
that's how he goes I've seen it done in

814
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:38,079
this industry there's a breeder who was

815
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:39,939
[ __ ] killing it for several years

816
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,769
putting out Femmes I don't know what

817
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,740
went wrong he got a lot of complaints

818
00:29:41,769 --> 00:29:46,509
about problematic [ __ ] plants now I

819
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:48,609
don't see him it events I don't see his

820
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:50,470
booth anywhere he kind of disappeared I

821
00:29:48,609 --> 00:29:52,059
know he's still online selling seeds but

822
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,680
he doesn't go to the events he doesn't

823
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:55,089
want to put his face out there he would

824
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,830
probably get a long line of people

825
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:58,209
yelling at him and another line of

826
00:29:56,829 --> 00:30:00,039
people trying to buy seeds so he just

827
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:02,350
stays at home and clicks on the internet

828
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,690
does his sales that way so be careful it

829
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:06,519
is your responsibility to make sure that

830
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:09,309
the seeds you created are worth a [ __ ]

831
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:11,170
grow them they have to be better or as

832
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,869
good as the parent plant if you're

833
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:15,789
making self seeds make sure they look

834
00:30:13,869 --> 00:30:17,229
like the [ __ ] plant you're promising

835
00:30:15,789 --> 00:30:19,210
people they're gonna look like you will

836
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,529
see this is a good way to segue into

837
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:23,740
this you'll see a little bit of

838
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:26,379
variation we're not introducing another

839
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,359
cross into there but golden goats got

840
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,400
parents it's got a mom it's got a dad

841
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,519
it's got two grandparents on either side

842
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,280
you may see recessive traits you may see

843
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:38,049
a little bit of variation when it comes

844
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:39,879
to your Femmes that depends on the

845
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:42,129
parent plant that you choose to work

846
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:44,530
with when you're making selfs there will

847
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,850
be little variation hopefully but it is

848
00:30:44,529 --> 00:30:48,609
possible when you're working with the

849
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:50,500
reversals you are going to see a little

850
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:51,729
bit of them female and a little bit of

851
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:53,769
the reversal come through you're gonna

852
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,890
get mostly 50/50 s but you'll find a

853
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:59,049
really dominant phenotype in that mix so

854
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,660
if you don't make a phenotype that is as

855
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:03,849
good or better than your starting parent

856
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:05,920
stock you did not do a successful

857
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:07,869
breeding project you have not done

858
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:10,029
anything improving you just [ __ ] made

859
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:12,279
a copy or you just kind of made a bunch

860
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:13,899
of seeds you've got to improve cannabis

861
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:16,539
to call yourself a breed or have a goal

862
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,670
have an intention and make improvement

863
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:21,339
don't take us backward and the evolution

864
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:23,050
of cannabis please move us forward and

865
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:25,179
once again they're not hermaphrodites

866
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:27,879
there is no if the her word herm is

867
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:29,529
available in this situation he [ __ ] up

868
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,460
don't breed with Herms don't make herbs

869
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,559
don't sell Herms

870
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,360
if the seeds are hermaphrodites if you

871
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,950
get more than if you grow a hundred and

872
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,779
you get two harms out of there you're

873
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:39,190
getting 2% and that is beyond the

874
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:40,930
threshold of allowance for

875
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:43,720
hermaphroditic seeds you

876
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:45,640
got to cross that back again get a good

877
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,259
female and then reverse your original

878
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:49,000
mom and [ __ ] redo it now you've got

879
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:51,309
like a femme [ __ ] bat cross thing

880
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,720
going on which would it'll work but I

881
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,789
would abandon the project all the way

882
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,650
because that means that there is

883
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:57,220
hermaphroditism present in that line of

884
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,259
jeans

885
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,150
I wouldn't even [ __ ] with it or maybe at

886
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:02,500
least try a different phenotype of that

887
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:04,690
but if you've got a different female why

888
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,210
are you making trims so abandon it that

889
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:11,580
is my idea don't be ashamed or afraid to

890
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:15,069
abandon a breeding project it is more ah

891
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:17,500
admirable respectable to say this batch

892
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:19,450
of seeds is [ __ ] flush or feed them to

893
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,069
the bunny or whatever you got make hemp

894
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,569
seeds out of it make some seed sprout

895
00:32:21,069 --> 00:32:24,399
tea maybe you can make some [ __ ]

896
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:25,990
Korean [ __ ] natural farming sort of

897
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,280
stuff out of it but don't sell them

898
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:28,509
don't give them to people don't expect

899
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,089
people to put that in their gardens

900
00:32:28,509 --> 00:32:33,279
because as a breeder we want to our I

901
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:35,980
want to I think our job our goal our

902
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,809
purpose our mission ah we should be here

903
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:39,670
setting people up for success we should

904
00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:42,129
be making cannabis better we should be

905
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:44,710
making growing easier more enjoyable

906
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,300
more successful more pleasant for our

907
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:47,440
clientele our customers whatever you

908
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,329
want to call them our [ __ ] friends

909
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,279
our community our family the people that

910
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:52,750
buy seeds for me keep me alive keep me

911
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,609
afloat they keep [ __ ] food in my

912

915
00:32:58,089 --> 00:33:03,519
drumset addiction I got dabs to smoke so

916
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:05,559

customers my clientele they're my

918

community they're my friends I don't

919
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:11,799
want to rip off my friends I would feel

920
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:14,619
like a [ __ ] bag of a person if I sent

921
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:16,930
out a batch of seeds and anybody sent me

922
00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:18,689
a message gone bro your seeds [ __ ] up

923
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,580
my garden these seeds you made

924
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:23,980
hermaphrodite it and put pollen on my

925
00:33:21,579 --> 00:33:26,740
[ __ ] girls and I needed medicine and

926
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:29,920
I don't have medicine dude I would I

927
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:31,720
would probably grow a crop for them or

928
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,279
buy them medicine if I did something

929
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,250
like that like that's how bad I would

930
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,839
feel I I [ __ ] feel things ah people

931
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:39,130
work really hard for their money first

932
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:41,799
of all they work hard for their money to

933
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:43,630
buy this seeds seeds are not cheap even

934
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,950
if even if you get them directly from me

935
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:47,260
at an event they're still expensive

936
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,000
that's several hours at your job slaving

937
00:33:47,259 --> 00:33:50,259
away doing some [ __ ] you didn't want to

938
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,819
do for someone you didn't want to do it

939
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:53,369
for in a condition you didn't want to be

940
00:33:51,819 --> 00:33:55,139
in I get that I under

941
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:57,419
stand back so when you give me that

942
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:59,580
money I want you to have a smile not

943
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,230
just be satisfied with the seeds you got

944
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,970
for the price but you need to be

945
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:04,410
satisfied with the outcome you've got a

946
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,569
lot to do with it if you're just [ __ ]

947
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:08,940
pouring redbull and miracle-gro in your

948
00:34:06,569 --> 00:34:10,469
plants don't ask me for help or do ask

949
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,639
me for help I'll [ __ ] help you but if

950
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:13,138
you [ __ ] them up by doing that that's

951
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:15,149
your fault but if you get a shitty

952
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:17,579
outcome on my fault I feel really bad

953
00:34:15,148 --> 00:34:18,989
for it ah I think I made I think that

954
00:34:17,579 --> 00:34:20,340
comes by in my tone of voice and if you

955
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:22,408
see the show you don't definitely know

956
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:24,389
I'm sincere so I want people to have

957
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:26,159
great success with cannabis that's why I

958
00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:28,710
breathe that's why I do the show this

959
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,720
show is free because I want everybody

960
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,309
out there to grow the best ganja they

961
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,989
can we need to medicate we need to write

962
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:35,989
create we just need to feel good feel i

963
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,250
reinforce honest make sure you're not

964
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:43,378
making it worse because I'm doing a lot

965
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,449
of work and a lot of our friends a lot

966
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:46,710
of our cohorts will call them colleagues

967
00:34:45,449 --> 00:34:48,509
may be a better word we're out there

968
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,610
doing our best to make it better so if

969
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,970
you're gonna breed please do your best

970
00:34:50,610 --> 00:34:55,919
to improve on cannabis you guys I feel

971
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:58,019
like that went by quite quickly it looks

972
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,460
like we're at about 35 30 ish minutes

973
00:34:58,019 --> 00:35:02,250
maybe if I do a couple of edits in here

974
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,199
um I hope I covered everything I hope I

975
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:06,420
was clear and concise I know I repeated

976
00:35:04,199 --> 00:35:08,699
several things not hermaphrodites FEM

977
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,590
seeds are not my femme seeds are not

978
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:13,169
made through hermaphrodite um

979
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:15,570
hermaphroditism there is a method that

980
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:17,460
some people use old-school dutch methods

981
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:19,410
we've kind of moved on from that those

982
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,579
companies don't last they're not around

983
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,859
any longer because they weren't

984
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:24,690
feminizing properly I think we can trust

985
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:28,559
most of the major companies that are

986
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:30,780
available now making FEM seeds so part

987
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,639
of my mission here was to dispel the

988
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,380
myth that their Femmes that frustrates

989
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,210
me because I work hard to make quality

990
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,680
films or that their harms are e they are

991
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,730
not Herms I worked very hard to make

992
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:43,559
quality films and also uh I don't think

993
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,880
that we need to be afraid of feminized

994
00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:46,860
seeds anymore and we need to quit

995
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,619
bashing people who choose to grow FEM

996
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:52,260
seeds um they are very useful every

997
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:54,179
plant you grow will be a viable plant if

998
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,380
you get it to fruition if you take care

999
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:57,359
of it if it germs would probably get

1000
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,579
fruits out of it if you're growing reg

1001
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:01,680
seed you got to cut down probably 50 to

1002
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:03,840
60 maybe 70 percent of your [ __ ]

1003
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,250
plants before they even get to flower so

1004
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,170
there is an advantage if you're in an

1005
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:09,119
area with a limited plant

1006
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,250
or if you're in a small tent and you

1007
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,960
really rely on everyone if your system

1008
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,608
if you've got a six plant setup and you

1009
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,630
need all of them those fins are the way

1010
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:18,298
to go you don't want to have an empty

1011
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,619
pot empty pots are expensive if you

1012
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:20,940
think about it that pot should be

1013
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:22,048
producing something and if you don't

1014
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,789
have something in there you're running

1015
00:36:22,048 --> 00:36:25,500
lights you're running your system that

1016
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:28,170
empty pot is costing you whatever you

1017
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,798
would have produced so feminize do have

1018
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:30,630
a place

1019
00:36:28,798 --> 00:36:32,548
they're not [ __ ] hermaphrodites

1020
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:34,289
please quit saying that I think that's

1021
00:36:32,548 --> 00:36:35,730
all I've got for my feminized episode

1022
