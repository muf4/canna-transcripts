production schedule when they're gonna

00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,519

65
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:30,300
sort of competition or uh territorials

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,039
insecurity crap when it comes to

67
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,719
multiple podcasts I think we should all

68
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,000
do our own shows and help everybody and

69
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:37,859
be a community there's no reason why we

70

shouldn't work together we're all aiming

71
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,860

the episode I will be on there more uh

81
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,420
we did talk about me going on that show

82
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,640
more frequently uh now that I'm only

83
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,378
doing one episode per week here it does

84
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,018
allow me to do a little bit more guest

85
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:08,699
spot time doorbell rang excuse me I'm

86
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,500
going to go grab that all right I am

87
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:11,759
back I do apologize I am recording here

88
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,500
in the middle of the day so we did

89
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,818
receive a package at the door I can't

90
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,259
leave packages out there too long

91
00:03:14,818 --> 00:03:17,878
because other people will decide that

92
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,919
that is a gift or donation if they see

93
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:21,419
it on the porch had to go get that you

94
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:23,518
don't care a lot let's continue with

95
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,899
this podcast where was I

96
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,400
um let's talk about something that we

97
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,260
have all seen in the news all of the

98
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
Cannabis podcasts should talk about this

99
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,280
this is something that got quite a few

100
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,019
people uh kind of excited kind of riled

101
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,878
up and then we saw a lot of responses to

102
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,500
this of course I am referring to the

103
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,018
statement that Joe Biden made about

104
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,299
freeing Federal cannabis prisoners who

105
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,340
are in federal prison for petty cannabis

106
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,620
crimes let's talk really briefly about

107
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,939
what Biden said there uh he just said a

108
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,439
bunch of [ __ ] to make people think

109
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,180
he was going to do something he didn't

110
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:53,219
say anything useful he didn't do

111
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,140
anything useful let's break down what he

112
00:03:53,219 --> 00:03:58,560
said really quickly here he was going to

113
00:03:55,139 --> 00:04:00,779
free Federal cannabis prisoners who were

114
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,580
in federal prison for minor cannabis

115
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,620
crimes if if you commit a minor cannabis

116
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,480
crime you don't go to federal prison a

117
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,759
federal crime is how you go to federal

118
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,219
prison so those minor cannabis crimes

119
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:13,139
went to County Jail the federal crimes

120
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,539
went to federal prison guess who we

121
00:04:13,139 --> 00:04:17,339
released [ __ ] nobody so that was just

122
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:18,959
some [ __ ] that was just a a sales

123
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,339
pitch that was just a greeting card to

124
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,019
make you feel like something went well

125
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,879
didn't really do a lot for the movement

126
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,918
for the plant for the people if some

127
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:27,899
people if I have misinformed uneducated

128
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,459
and some people did get released that is

129
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:31,379
[ __ ] awesome if you pardoned one or

130
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:33,000
two people that is great but it's not

131
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:34,500
the move that we all thought he was

132
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,779
talking about making some people were

133
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,339
duped some people were fooled it was a

134
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:40,918
clever statement I think it was a sales

135
00:04:38,339 --> 00:04:43,019
pitch and it did not work on me I think

136
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,120
that what he said was I was just some

137
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,579
some frosting or a Band-Aid or just some

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,379
decoration and I didn't buy the [ __ ]

139
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,659
so I wanted to give you my opinion on

140
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,279
that he said he freed all of the uh

141
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,740
Federal cannabis prisoners who were in

142
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,179
prison for minor cannabis crimes once

143
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,860
again you don't go to a federal prison

144
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,840
for a minor cannabis crime you never

145
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,879
made it that far there was nobody to

146
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,638
free all right that was my ramble on

147
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,199
that let's talk about something more fun

148
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,240
more exciting if you've been following

149
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,580
along you do know that I had a

150
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:13,560
greenhouse running and I did harvest the

151
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:15,060
plants everything is down now there were

152
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,000
a couple of plants still in there until

153
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,500
recently uh some long-standing some late

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,240
finishers there were plants that I did

155
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,160
not expect to take so long that took a

156
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,560
really long time this year but they are

157
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,060
down they're in the plants are drying a

158
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,860
lot of the plants have been processed

159
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:31,139
seeds are coming out things are getting

160
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,319
counted I'm excited because I think that

161
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:36,660
by Halloween I should be able to re-drop

162
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,180
the blueberry butcher that's right on

163
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,160
iredirect.com on other vendors there

164
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,439

182
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,459
around Halloween there will be some new

183
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:22,740
stuff there also you guys have heard me

184
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:24,418
talk about the feminized seeds that I

185
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,160
have got coming those are harvested as

186
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,779
well uh those plants are kind of big

187
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,419
they're taking longer to drive than

188
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:32,758
anticipated but as soon as they're dried

189
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:35,399
processed counted all that good [ __ ] I

190
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:37,680
will get you guys the feminized lemon

191
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:40,739
Jeffrey the feminized orange gasm and

192
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,800
the feminized Golden Goat s1s will be

193
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,960
back very very soon the best way to stay

194

of course through the newsletter at

213
00:07:25,098 --> 00:07:30,060
iregenetics.com I did mention hoodies

214
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,460
that's right I just ordered more irie

215
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,259
genetics t-shirts I ordered black long

216
00:07:32,459 --> 00:07:36,719
sleeve T-shirts and I ordered black

217
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,060
hoodies and for the ladies I ordered a

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,280
few irie genetics tank tops they've all

219
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,500
got the square logo with the cross that

220
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,059
says irie genetics premium seeds people

221
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,279
have been asking for more designs more

222
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:49,740
ideas so we put that logo on a few

223
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,899
different items long sleeve black shirts

224
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,180
black t-shirts black hoodies and black

225
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:56,038
tank tops we will Branch out here I was

226
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:58,079
trying to get all the bases covered once

227
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,759
we got the basics covered I will expand

228
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,379
the merchandise line if you've got

229
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,360
recommendations or suggest questions

230
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:05,579
send me those ideas at grow from

231
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,139
yourheart hotmail.com it can be grow

232
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:08,758
from your heart idea merchandise it

233
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,800
could be irie genetics merchandise

234
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:12,419
whatever you've got in mind please do

235
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,520
hook me up I love making merchandise

236
00:08:12,418 --> 00:08:15,899
that I know you guys are interested in

237
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:17,939
that's the point right I could design

238
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:19,258
[ __ ] that I like all day I want to know

239
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:22,259
if you like it also if you're an artist

240
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:24,479
out there I could use a discrete ire

241
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:26,280
genetics and irie Army logo something

242
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,740
that people in prohibition States could

243
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:30,179
wear and they could proudly represent I

244
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,339
read genetics the grow from your heart

245
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,440
podcast or the irie army they could

246
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:35,760
represent all of that stuff but not tell

247
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,919
their boss their Community their

248
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:39,778
neighbors uh the preschool teacher the

249
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,699
daycare worker that they are cannabis

250
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:43,320
Growers and consumers so if you want to

251
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:45,839

00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,420
your ideas I will definitely take good

253
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,920
care of my favorite logos alright that

254
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:51,299
is enough rambling here at the start of

255
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,120
the show I did say that I was going to

256
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:56,639
talk about phenotype selection and a

257
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,039
Fino hunt let me segue into rambling a

258
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,958
little bit about that I feel like a good

259
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,599
spot to start would be by explaining

260
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,939
what a Fino Hunt is what do I mean by a

261
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,278
Fino hunt a Fino Hunt is simply

262
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,860
searching through a population of seeds

263
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:13,259
to find the phenotype of those plants

264
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,360
that works the best for you your garden

265
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:17,759
your clients your needs or your patients

266
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,820
whatever it may be now what do I mean by

267
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,740
phenotype when we grow from seed we will

268
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:25,260
see variation amongst the different

269
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,778
plants that is known as a phenotypical

270
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:29,639
expression some plants so we may have a

271
00:09:27,778 --> 00:09:31,919
10 pack of seeds if they are regular

272
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:33,539
seeds most of the time half of those are

273
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,579
going to be males we pull the boys out

274
00:09:33,539 --> 00:09:37,379
of there we've got five girl plants to

275
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,240
grow most of the time you're going to

276
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:41,100
see plants that look a little bit like

277
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,480
the mother plant plants that look a

278
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,100
little bit like the father plant and

279
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,659
then plants that look like kind of

280
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,300
combinations of those I call those the

281
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:49,799
50 50s those are usually my intended and

282
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:52,439
favorite phenotypes but that's a whole

283
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:54,419
different conversation so just like if

284
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,339
you've got brothers or sisters you don't

285
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:58,259
look exactly the same but you came from

286
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,180
the exact same parents maybe you do look

287
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,458
very similar that's also a phenotypical

288
00:10:00,179 --> 00:10:04,199
expression maybe you've got blue eyes

289
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:06,000
your sister's got green eyes maybe

290
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,459
you've got brown hair and your sister's

291
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,320
got blonde hair that is a phenotypical

292
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:12,778
expression and variation that happens

293
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,899
amongst phenotypes amongst a population

294
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:17,399
so with plants some plants may be taller

295
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:19,679
than others some may be shorter than

296
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,958
others some may get a lot of resin some

297
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,458
may not make any resin some may have a

298
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:25,439
certain Aroma some may have way

299
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:27,179
different Aromas these are all traits

300
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,700
that we will see as phenotypical

301
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:31,799
expression so when I talk about a pheno

302
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,620
hunt I'm talking about finding the

303
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:36,958
phenotype out of a population that works

304
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,419
best for my needs now let me get off on

305
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,099
a tangent here because being a breeder

306
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,019
being the person that is making a lot of

307
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,639
these seeds and that has a lot of

308
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,139
experience with the lines that I make

309
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,819
when I make these seeds I get to grow

310
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,620
them first I get to play with them as

311
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,180
long as I want before I even let you

312
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,980
know about it or sell them to you or

313
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:54,539
give them to you I've got those seeds

314
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,980
I've been running them a lot so I know

315
00:10:54,539 --> 00:10:58,740
what to expect

316
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,500
before you get the seeds I can tell you

317
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,120
what phenotypes will show up and the

318
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,220
traits of those phenotypes that you can

319
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,720
expect from a pack of seeds because I've

320
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,579
got experience running and I've ran the

321
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,139
seed so much that I know what it's going

322
00:11:08,578 --> 00:11:12,539
to show me now when I talk about

323
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:15,419
phenotypical selection people often say

324
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:18,240
which phenotype is the best out of this

325
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:21,479
line of seeds that is not for me to

326
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,759
decide I often describe it like this

327
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,800
um you wanted a pack of let me just say

328
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:27,600
strawberry Starburst seeds you know that

329
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,939
you want the seeds that have the

330
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,680
strawberry candy flavor and Aroma they

331
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,600
make really good concentrates it's got a

332
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:34,859
really nice sativa Buzz we know that

333
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,420
that's as far as we've gotten now

334
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,919
there's a phenotype in there that's

335
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:39,120
going to be perfect for you and one that

336
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:40,919
won't be the best for you and one

337
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,078
that'll be pretty good the way I

338
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:44,939
describe this is we've all chosen that

339
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:46,799
we want to eat at the Italian restaurant

340
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,000
right we've all chosen we want the

341
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,099
Italian restaurant that's your

342
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,958
strawberry Starburst pack of seeds when

343
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,700
we get to the Italian restaurant we're

344
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,500
going to get a menu somebody's gonna

345
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:57,180
want white sauce somebody's gonna want

346
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:59,278
red sauce and somebody's gonna want

347
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:00,659
eggplant Parmesan somebody's going to

348
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,820
want gnocchi somebody's going to want

349
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:05,219
pasta there's a million kinds of pasta

350
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,240
gnocchi or spaghetti those are all

351
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,160
things that are at the Italian

352
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,139
restaurant they're all very acceptable

353
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:11,639
they're all very delicious they're all

354
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:13,319
kind of the same because they're Italian

355
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:15,299
food made in the same restaurant but

356
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,459
there's going to be little variations

357
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,500
and differences that's what I think we

358
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,179
find when we go grow growing from a pack

359
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
of seeds you've got the Italian

360
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:24,419
restaurant that's your pack of

361
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,399
strawberry Starburst seeds now you got

362
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:27,778
to find the phenotype that expresses the

363
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,879
traits that you want do you want the

364
00:12:27,778 --> 00:12:31,559
marinara or do you want the garlic sauce

365
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,240
when it comes to the seeds to the

366
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:34,619
strawberry Starburst plant

367
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,079
do you want the one that tastes more

368
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,240
like watermelons or bubble gum candy or

369
00:12:37,078 --> 00:12:41,219
the one that's got that weird sour sort

370
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,399
of a Tangy and watermelon a grapefruit

371
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,600
sort of Aroma that's for you to decide I

372
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,299
like the one that tastes like strawberry

373
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,620
bubble gum but that's just me my buddy

374
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:51,479
Kelvin likes the one that tastes like

375
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,759
juicy watermelons so that's the

376
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,440
phenotypical that is the phenotype that

377
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,179
will get your attention that you that is

378
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,160
the trait and the phenotype that will

379
00:12:57,179 --> 00:13:01,679
get your attention that works best for

380
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:03,600
you so the phenotype that works for me

381
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:06,299
may not be best for you are you smoking

382
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,040
I like to get really high I like a head

383
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:10,139
bust it makes me paranoid and [ __ ]

384
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:11,519
forget what I'm saying and lose my keys

385
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,560
when they're in my hand and lose my

386
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,360
sunglasses when I'm wearing them a lot

387
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,879
of people don't desire that so we may

388
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,500
want totally different phenotypes I've

389
00:13:17,879 --> 00:13:21,000
got a grow space that's eight feet tall

390
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,039
maybe you got a three foot tall grow

391
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,440
space my phenotypes aren't going to work

392
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:27,599
in your grow space so my best advice is

393
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,300
to pick the phenotype that works best

394
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,339
for you in your environment for your

395
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:34,139
needs like I said before maybe it's a

396
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,420
medical product Maybe it's a retail

397
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,339
product maybe it's a gray Market product

398
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,958
maybe you're making concentrates out of

399
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:42,360
it maybe you're making Edibles out of it

400
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:45,000
select the phenotype that performs the

401
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,759
way that you need that phenotype to

402
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,379
perform for you to reach your goal now

403
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,439
let's talk a little bit about the method

404
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:54,838
of a Fino hunt a pheno hunt can happen

405
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,459
with a little bit of seeds or a lot of

406
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:59,220
seeds that can happen in a little bit of

407
00:13:56,458 --> 00:14:00,838
space or a lot of space if I'm hunting

408
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,660
for something I don't grow the plants

409
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,459
very big I keep them small sometimes I

410
00:14:03,659 --> 00:14:08,159
don't even take a clone sometimes I just

411
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:10,679
rely on a re-vege I'm mainly looking for

412
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,600
the one keeper out of a population maybe

413
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,519
I took a clone of it maybe I didn't if I

414
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,320
did not get the Clone then I will rely

415
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:18,240
on that re-veg and it will be worth the

416
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,800
work because it was the keeper out of

417
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,720
however many plants which means that's

418
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,179
the one I want so it'll be worth doing

419
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,620
the extra work so whatever amount of

420
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,419
space you've got whatever amount of

421
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,759
seeds you got let's utilize that to the

422
00:14:27,419 --> 00:14:32,278
best of our ability maybe small plants

423
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,980
short veg time when I'm doing a Fino

424
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:37,439
hunt I do not manipulate the plants very

425
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,180
much on their first run I will Sprout

426
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,620
let's just say you've got

427
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:42,299
um okay let's do a couple of things

428
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:44,820
we've got two options maybe you've got

429
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:47,278
100 seeds maybe you've got 10 seeds

430
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:49,620
where I live I'm only allowed to grow 12

431
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,059
plants at a time so in my Fino hunt

432
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,799
let's just say I've already got two

433
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:54,659
plants as mother plants they're over

434
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,278
there in the corner I've got 10 plants

435
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:59,039
that I'm allowed to work with

436
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,139
I would pack a I would pop a 10 pack of

437
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,578
seeds that gives me 10 seeds to work

438
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,500
with eventually like I've said before

439
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,659
we're gonna pull out five because

440
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,240
they'll probably be males so I'm going

441
00:15:06,659 --> 00:15:10,919
to grow these 10 seeds exactly the same

442
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,899
I'm going to put them in a room and I'm

443
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:15,479
going to treat them all exactly the same

444
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,639
they get the same soil the same size pot

445
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,560
they get the same amount of light they

446
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:21,959
get fed the exact same thing they get

447
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,119
defoliated the same amount if I do any

448
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,099
manipulation to plant one it happens to

449
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,360
plant one through ten all the other

450
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,820
plants are getting the same treatment

451
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,820
this is the only way to keep it fair

452
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,139
scientific and to actually make a real

453
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,240
discernible determination on which plant

454
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:38,220
is the best or most desirable out of a

455
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,799
group so I will grow all these plants

456
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,360
exactly the [ __ ] same and then

457
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,039
somewhere around week six or seven

458
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,440
you'll start making decisions you'll go

459
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,000
this one right here has a lot of resin

460
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,560
but this one right here is making a lot

461
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,480
of weed and then there will be another

462
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,099
one that doesn't make as much resin or

463
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,839
as much weed but smells and tastes

464
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,420
really good that's usually the way that

465
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,920
a final hunt goes but keep growing those

466
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:01,019
plants grow them all the way through

467
00:15:58,919 --> 00:16:03,299
grow them Harvest them if you plan on

468
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:05,820
re-veging leave a little bit dry and

469
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:07,139
cure them now here comes the fun part if

470
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,060
you were growing these plants to share

471
00:16:07,139 --> 00:16:11,220
with friends or patients or clients or

472
00:16:09,059 --> 00:16:13,679
whoever it may be gather a few of them

473
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,240
around let's have a smoke party roll up

474
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,099
a couple of joints of phenotype number

475
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,320
one phenotype number two number three

476
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,600
label them let's smoke them with the

477
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:23,278
whole crew and see who desires what if

478
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,720
you're growing it for yourself pick the

479
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:25,919
one you like the best if you're the

480
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
grower if you're going to breed with it

481
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:29,458
if you've got goals you make the

482
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,560
selection that's the advantage of being

483
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:33,239
the grower the farmer you get to make

484
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,399
that final decision you can let people

485
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,320
say I like this one the best I like this

486
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,958
one the best but overall it's your

487
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,639
decision so start some seeds keep a good

488
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:44,039
eye on them take a lot of notes treat

489
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,560
them all exactly the same finish them

490
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:49,439
dry them cure them smoke them then

491
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,479
decide which one was your favorite that

492
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,699
is your keeper out of your final hunt

493
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,800
sometimes like I said before you'll find

494
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:57,958
two or three that are the winners out of

495
00:16:55,799 --> 00:17:00,179
a final hunt I kind of treat that like a

496
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,039
bracket system I will re-vadge those or

497
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:04,019
have clones of those three then I will

498
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,578
run them all three side by side in a

499
00:17:04,019 --> 00:17:07,558
room kind of focused into just those

500
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:10,078
three and I'll see what works the best

501
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:12,298
for me out of those three sometimes I

502
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,279
keep two sometimes I keep one sometimes

503
00:17:12,298 --> 00:17:15,838
I'll keep the tall one for myself and

504
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:17,578
send the short one to a friend so that

505
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,019
he can run that also and kind of

506
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,879
experiment with that we can see what we

507
00:17:19,019 --> 00:17:22,199
can do with breeding I'll breed to both

508
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
of them see what the breeding does on

509
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:25,919
both just phenotypical selection so I'll

510
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,600
keep the taller one he'll get the

511
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,820
shorter one but find the one that you

512
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,039
like the best narrow it down now a

513
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:35,099
minute ago I said we could do a final

514
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:37,079
hunt from 100 seeds it would be ideal it

515
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,058
would be really fun to run a hundred at

516
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:40,558
a time but at that rate you might need a

517
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,359
hundred clones if you want to clone it

518
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,000
at that rate you've got to manage 100

519
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:47,339
plants in most areas that's illegal so

520
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,099
we can't do that the way that we can do

521
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:52,019
this is if you can run 10 at a time or

522
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:53,819
this works however many you can run at a

523
00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:55,740
time max out and then do the math on

524
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:58,079
this let's just say you've got a hundred

525
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:00,660
seeds and you can run 10 at a time Run

526
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,839
10 seeds pick your favorite out of those

527
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,840
ten keep a clone of that Sprout nine

528
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,939
more seeds run that clone and those nine

529
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,038
seeds right next to each other and once

530
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,500
again pick the best out of all of those

531
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,119
that first clone you kept last time does

532
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,980
not have to be the keeper out of the

533
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,139
next round work it like a bracket system

534
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,000
an elimination match yeah you won the

535
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,620
last [ __ ] Royal Rumble get in the

536
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,140
ring with 10 more and see if you [ __ ]

537
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:26,699
survive every time as long as you select

538
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,679
a phenotype that you think is better

539
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,179
through every final hunt you're making

540
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,519
forward progress you're also making

541
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:34,080
product every time you grow it's not

542
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:36,900
like a waste of time or a waste of space

543
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,699
because you're producing those plants it

544
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,160
may not be the most desirable the most

545
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,480
sellable most profitable smoke ever but

546
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,038
you're going to produce a quality

547
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,140
product out of each one of those seeds

548
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:47,700
if you do it correctly and that is a

549
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,860
good way to segue into another thing

550
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,319
that I wanted to make sure to cover too

551
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:54,719
many people expect to plant a seed and

552
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,639
find the perfect phenotype I don't like

553
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,140
just that's why I don't sell one or two

554
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,360
seeds to people that's why you've got to

555
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:02,280
buy a pack of seeds because that's not a

556
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,899
good rep representation first of all if

557
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:05,720
you buy one seed and it doesn't

558
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,620
germinate you've got a hundred percent

559
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,480
non-germination rate and that looks

560
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:11,279
really bad on a breeder we try to give

561
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,900
you more seeds to at least get some to

562
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,399
germinate we don't want you to complain

563
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,980
that it gives you better numbers a

564
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,820
better ratio I've tested my germination

565
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,200
rates uh testers have tested it Growers

566
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:23,759
customers have tested that we know the

567
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,500
seeds are reliable but it still feels

568
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,058
weird selling you one or two because

569
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,038
then you got a chance of a hundred or

570
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,558
fifty percent failure rate and that

571
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,000
could be my fault that could be be I

572
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,220
could have gotten too hot in shipping or

573
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,720
that simply could be customer error and

574
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,100
I don't want to allow for that sort of a

575
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,900
ratio so

576
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:42,240
um I think you should run that's why

577
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,679
when you get one seed or two seeds I

578
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,599
think you should run more than that to

579
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,640
actually find the phenotype that you

580
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,918
want too many people think that their

581
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,080
first grow is going to be the grow where

582
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,059
they find the gold I think you got to

583
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,619
run a pack maybe two maybe three packs

584
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:57,960
of seeds it's kind of like dating in my

585
00:19:55,619 --> 00:19:59,699
opinion uh if you just find one person

586
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,500
and fall in love right off the bat

587
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,000
that's great but that's not common you

588
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,339
got to kind of play the field and see

589
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,779
like does that kind of person make me

590
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:08,519
happy does this person make me happy

591
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:10,139
figure it out like you're not locked

592
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:11,339
into one plant date a little bit with

593
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:13,200
these plants is what I'm saying I'm

594
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:14,220
sorry for the bad dating analogy I

595
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,960
haven't done that in a while so I'm

596
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:17,700
[ __ ] confused but

597
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,679
um find out which plant you like the

598
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:21,660
best and stick with that and then grow

599
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,759
that one over and over again then

600
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:25,798
develop a relationship with that plant

601
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,779
the first couple times you grow it it'll

602
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:29,339
come out pretty good but imagine if you

603
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:30,960
learned that like in week six I could

604
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,119
drop out the Cal Mag and really add

605
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,980
Bloom boosters and It Go shebang or

606
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,599
maybe the opposite or maybe you need to

607
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,400
feed it nitrogen just a little bit

608
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:40,079
longer or maybe you discovered that if

609
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,419
you let it go five extra days it really

610
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,819
puts on more weight experiment with this

611
00:20:42,419 --> 00:20:46,860
plant so run a pheno hunt start with the

612
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:48,839
population of seeds and grow them treat

613
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:51,659
them all exactly the same to keep it

614
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:53,819
scientific dry them cure them smoke them

615
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,100
determine your favorites out of that

616
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:58,379
population that is your keeper phenotype

617
00:20:56,099 --> 00:20:59,939
that is the basics of a Fino hunt if

618
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:02,100
you've got more seeds of the same thing

619
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,600
or if you've got different seeds and

620
00:21:02,099 --> 00:21:06,298
you're looking to keep the best plant

621
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:08,339
around run another pheno hunt put that

622
00:21:06,298 --> 00:21:10,139
one plant that won the last round in up

623
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:11,699
against all those other plants and see

624
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,799
who is the winner I called it the Royal

625
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,419
Rumble before keep the Royal Rumble

626
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:17,519
going until you've got the best plant

627
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,799
you can find if you're looking to stock

628
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,660
a stable of mother plants repeat this

629
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:23,700
process until you've got 10 of the best

630
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,798
mother plants you can find then you've

631
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,360
got 10 mothers to keep clones from you

632
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:28,859
can keep working with those or however

633
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,019
you may need it maybe you need one

634
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:32,579
mother plant maybe you need two maybe

635
00:21:31,019 --> 00:21:34,918
you're looking for a male plant you can

636
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:37,379
do a final hunt with the male plant the

637
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,179
exact same way you've got to flower it

638
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,559
out compare it to other plants see what

639
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,419
it looks like look for the traits you're

640
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,279
looking for then you can find that plant

641
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:46,860
of course then you've got to do some

642
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:50,158
pollen chucking which is a whole nother

643
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:52,319
slew of podcast episodes all right I

644
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,900
think I gave you the basics of A final

645
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:57,418
hunt basically run the seeds look for

646
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,038
the one that Rings your bell not my bell

647
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,559
it's all about you you got to live with

648
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,819
