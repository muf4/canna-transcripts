I'm glad I met you today we're going to

214
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:59,680
have some [ __ ] fun times together bro

215
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,120
absolutely how long have you been in

216
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,400
this breeding game ah I guess about six

217
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,720
years but I mean been breeding forever

218
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,279
you know I mean who who doesn't yeah I

219
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,479
mean what grower doesn't like see plants

220
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,159
and okay so that's a good question how

221
00:07:13,478 --> 00:07:18,079
long into your growing career did it

222
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:22,439
take you to get breeding

223
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,800
man I I'd say for the first like I don't

224
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,199
know four or five years you know it's

225
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,199
just straight growing you first get

226
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,680
started you know outdoor whatever but uh

227
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:32,759
I'd say like six seven years before you

228
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,000
know what I mean that's about right

229
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:35,560
that's how long it takes you four four

230
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,240
to six years seems to be for most of the

231
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,519
major breeders that I've talked to like

232
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,240
when I grew those plants the first

233
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,639
couple years I knew I had to breed but

234
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,519
then you have to figure out how and

235
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,879
where right I mean right being from the

236
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,318
area that we were in in the underground

237
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,840
you know you couldn't just back in the

238
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,240
uh you know early 90s and stuff and

239
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,279
being in places like Florida which is

240
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,079
one of the worst states possibly grow in

241
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,799
Virginia places like that East Coast is

242
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:56,800
really really throw you under the bus

243
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,840
lock you up that that's about it you

244
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,840
know and and and you couldn't really

245
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,158
order SE you know and get certain

246
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,158
strains and whenever you got good

247
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:05,879
genetics and you got good males you may

248
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:07,719
do with what you had and then you used a

249
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,000
lot of older genetics I personally used

250
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,759
a lot of older genetics when we were

251
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,279
younger from parents passed down

252
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,680
gainsvill Green um old Afghans a lot of

253
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,198
old afghanan stuff a lot of the old piny

254
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,158
you know good Piney buds that came out

255
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,639
of Florida back in the day in the 80s

256
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:23,360
and um Florida is known for a lot of

257
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,918
great dank enough credit in my opinion

258
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,319
pretty absolutely absolutely the past

259
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:28,359
few years they've really been being

260
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,158
known for it and noticed absolutely and

261
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,240
I would say the last 10 there's actually

262
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,080
been statistics to show that uh there's

263
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,200
more Growers indoors that get busted

264
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,959
every year in Florida than there are

265
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,200
registered cannabis users in California

266
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:43,478
wow wow so we say this all the time on

267
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,839
this show uh the logical step here

268
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:46,480
[ __ ] legalize it in Florida

269
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,800
absolutely right absolutely I mean why

270
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,360

like a great cross there now random

334
00:11:05,078 --> 00:11:08,719
question on offshoot of that are those

335
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,760
your top sellers by any chance and I

336
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,160
know one can't be because you're still

337
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:12,639
making it but the cookie wck sounds like

338
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:14,039
it's probably one of your top sellers

339
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,839
yeah that's definitely one of the top

340
00:11:14,039 --> 00:11:18,360
that's a great great St I've

341
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,160
seen my arms yeah it matches up both

342
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,759
parents match up just perfectly you know

343
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,039
what I mean it doesn't sound like it but

344
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,039
once you know you get to know both

345
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:26,559
parents from the breeder aspect you

346
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,399
could tell that that's the beautiful one

347
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,439
because guys here's a hint that I don't

348
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,440
talk about a lot the more the more

349
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:34,040
difference no the most difference in

350
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,120
your parents the better the outcome in

351
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:37,759
your cross right if you've got

352
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,000
completely different parents the better

353
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:42,078
your crosses are going to be in my

354
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,399
opinion natural selection yes yeah so

355
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,679
bro over here Mr sour seeds uh what are

356

358
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,879
of my number one strains is still to

359
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,919
this day is probably the original Kim

dog D or Kim 4 okay it's still to this

361

day it's it's not the prosty strain in

362
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
the world but it has some of the

363
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,519
greatest flavors you know all around

364
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,879

365
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,679
flavor it's got the punch it's got the

366
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,240
yield the bag appe peel the yield the

367

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,959
loud that's it and it's one of the

369
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:10,639
original true ogs you know and uh i' say

370
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,919
right now too it's still is one of my

371
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,519
family's uh original strains from way

372
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:16,439
back we' we've held this cut for

373
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:18,120
probably close to 8 to 10 years now it's

374
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,639
one of our original blueberries it's the

375
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,720
old original Blueberry Yum Yum you used

376
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,278
to hear about from ludicrous and back in

377
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,320
the day and things like that it's it's

378
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,480
not DJ's blueberry it's a very indicia

379
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,199
dominant blueberry almost smells like

380
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,680
ripe oranges halfway through flowering

381
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:32,439
and it really takes on a really sweet

382
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:36,078
blueberry appeal during finish and

383
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:38,240
riping um very very potent very frosty

384
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:40,319
um very couch lock okay you know quick

385
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,919
eight nine week or you know it's it's a

386
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,720
very indic plan it's not going to take

387
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,958
you 10 weeks to plower out um and

388
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,759
another one we run is uh probably a big

389
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,879
one that we're having a big release on

390
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,159
now is uh the space Dragon which is a

391
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,078
true West Himalayan Kush land race cross

392
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:58,519
with the original Kim 91 back cross mail

393
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,278
so this was this was a cross that was

394
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:02,198
done probably 7 eight years ago in

395
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:03,600
Florida okay and right now it's one of

396
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,879
the hottest things in Atlanta Georgia it

397
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,079
has been for for years down there in in

398
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,039
rant Tallahasse Florida and FSU college

399
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,078
for I don't know how many years we we

400
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:13,639
slung that stuff out on on the streets

401
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:14,838
and uh people can't get enough of it

402
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:16,759
we've we've gotten reviews from

403
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,040
everywhere from you know the little guy

404
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:22,679
to uh people that fight for the UFC um

405
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:25,120
we we we've actually sold pots to people

406
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,559
like jabastian Sebastian Janikowski and

407
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,198
uh you know big football players and I

408
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:31,399
mean it's it's they the guys they they

409
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:33,439
just can't they can't get enough of the

410
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:35,278
space Dragon man it's just it's it's

411
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,920
strong it's devastating it lays you out

412
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,320
and and and you really can't think on it

413
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:40,078
you know it's one of those even for the

414
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,639
heavy smoker if you're looking for

415
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,120
something like that that just you really

416
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:44,680
want to get stoned you know I mean just

417
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
really I mean because you build up

418
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,159
toleran over years and years and years

419
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,120
doing this and you look for sought out

420
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,919
strains that you you know that that

421
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,360
won't burn you out and you know seven

422
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,958
eight years I can still smoke this stuff

423
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,440
and it still does the same effect to me

424
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,838
that it did back in the day you know and

425
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,560
so we're so we're trying to old school

426
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,360
new school kind of a combo there it it

427
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,518
like you said very diverse genetics you

428
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,839
know taking something from here in

429
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,078
America and then taking it with the best

430
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,240
of the you know the East you know and

431
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:11,719
across the world you know and just

432
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,759
trying to combine those genetics to give

433
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:17,360
somebody something really really special

434
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,440
I'm imagining kind of a real spicy uh

435
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,000
real hashy earthy spicy kind of a smell

436
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,199
it is real earthy and it has a spice to

437
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,679
it but it's actually it it's really hard

438
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,278
to really describe Jeff it's it's it's

439
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,559
it's been described as like really sweet

440
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:32,078
but also has like a very over ing sent

441
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,479
of Bo like body odor I love that kind of

442
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:37,078
weed the Jeff OG he's playing with has a

443
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,278
like a swampy funky foot boo kind of

444
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:40,719
exactly it's it's really Bo to it but

445
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,799
it's it's on the sweeter side and it has

446
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,440
that that the kind of citrusy twang kind

447
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,519
of Funk from the Kim 91 in there you

448
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,040
know it's it's really original it's

449
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,879
really really unique and anybody that's

450
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,879
ever had it's really truly enjoyed it

451
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:54,958
nice well I look forward to my seed pack

452
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,600
absolutely absolutely coming soon you

453
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,119
like that or my clone you know there's

454
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,320
yeah I can do that like a clone from

455
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,639
your bro so that was two strains you got

456
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,278
the cham and then you got your space

457
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,480
Dragon what's strain number three that

458
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,519
was the blueberry oh the blueberry

459
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,039
you're right sorry see dabs dab I'm

460
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,240
going to blame it on a head injury I can

461
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,958
probably I can prob do one or two more

462
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,759
episodes with a head

463
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,399
injury if you guys have been listening

464
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,879
and you heard about that I had a serious

465
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,000
I had a serious concussion but I had a

466
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,879
minor brain bleed and I was down for

467
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,399
about it's been 7 days now and I'm still

468
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,919
a little goofy when I wake up and it

469
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:28,360
takes me like an hour to get my [ __ ]

470
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:29,958
together but I'm going to be fine guys a

471
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,639
couple people told to get well I

472
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,439

473
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,360
inside my head yeah my eyes were

474
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,800
wobbling and [ __ ] it was a little goofy

475
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,278
so if you've listened to the last two

476
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,958
episodes I was doing that fully

477
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:43,679
concussed holy

478
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,439
[ __ ] yeah that's good uh apparently I

479
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,198
blew off two people I was supposed to

480
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,040
meet somebody somewhere and I blew them

481
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,639
off completely like I had no idea my God

482
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:53,480
and so somebody was not nice enough to

483
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:55,198
say he hit his head please be nice about

484
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,159

485
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,318

513
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,879
massive green houses and his plants look

514
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,360
beautiful and amazing and he's been

515
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,639
growing the same strains the blueberry

516
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,199
yum yum um Gainesville green and things

517
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,959

523
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:11,199
skunks the old original skunks they've

524

all either been outcrossed I mean

525
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,199
there's things that you can find in

526
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,078
Florida that are very close but it's an

527
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:18,439
outcross I grew up in SoCal and there

528
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,438
was a skunk strain there that I've never

529
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,679
smelled since I've left that area I was

530

543
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:51,558
as close as I've gotten since I left

544
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:54,960
California to the smell of just that

545
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:56,480
Cali dank I kind of miss it and every

546
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,679
once in a while you do you come across

547
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,159
that and and and it's very rare though

548
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:02,159
now nowadays you know that it hasn't

549
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:04,159
been put its hands on or it's it's

550
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:06,559
really locked down on inner circles all

551
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:08,840
right all right Mr can Adventure do you

552
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,558
prefer to grow or breed sativas or

553
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,798
indicas I said a weird I [ __ ] that

554
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:13,519
question up do you prefer to grow and

555
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,759
breed indors or sativas is what I was

556
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:19,079
aiming for take more dabs I'm going to

557
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:22,000
dab while you answer yeah oh man

558
00:18:19,079 --> 00:18:23,918
preferably man I like uh I like to smoke

559
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,798
like sativa hybrids you know what I mean

560
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,360
okay so I mean I don't know I do I do

561
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:32,639
breed with some uh straight up 100%

562
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:35,678
real D Ana D stuff but uh we got to keep

563
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,080
those you have to yeah the CBD patients

564
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,440
and the Inda patients need a medicine to

565
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,119
yeah all right so you have to you have

566
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,960
to you have to so a little bit of both I

567
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,879
I tend to catch myself breeding heavier

568
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,038
toward the sativa side just cuz you like

569
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,000
it I like the C plants I think that 10

570
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:52,000
or 17 day extra longer flowering period

571
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,519
really does something to a plant I'm

572
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,119
just not an Inda smoker you know even at

573
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,038
night time dude you know now that I've

574
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,918
gotten older I feel like smoking Inda

575
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,640
just makes me too lazy I own a I've got

576
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,720
got a job I got [ __ ] to do you know I

577
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,360
got to be so I take dabs of sativa to

578
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,839
keep me moving and

579
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,158
motivated I really don't smoke I mean

580
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,519
yeah I really don't smoke into because

581
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,880
man you know what I mean good enough

582
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,599
yeah yeah I mean you still have some

583
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,720
that you love you know that you know

584
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,038
that that are good but I don't know

585
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,440
preferably yeah something I find weird I

586
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:23,599
like growing smoking and breeding

587
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,880
completely different strains for

588
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,399
different reasons if I'm going to grow

589
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,880
one I pick a room for growth if I'm

590
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
going to breed I want these and if I'm

591
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,480
going to smoke I want this like

592
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,359
completely different batches of PL

593
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,519
absolutely totally how about yourself

594
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,519
man do you prefer I'm actually an IND

595
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,839
guy I'm an Inda guy and I like OG kushes

596
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,000
a lot that's that's pretty much what I

597
00:19:38,839 --> 00:19:41,599
like I like stuff that puts me to the

598
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,319
couch I kind of need it nowadays I've

599
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,759
been doing this a really long time and

600
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:46,960
uh I've always had a lot of strong pot

601
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,879
around you know that that's the thing

602
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,720
with me I didn't really grow up smoking

603
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,760
swag I always had good hom grown you

604
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,519
know and that toleran whenever you're

605
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:59,119
like 15 years old and you can outsmoke

606
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,879
your you know your parents yeah but um

607
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,439
you know that so so it takes something

608
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,679
like that for me but like like you said

609
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,080
like when I when I'm working um if I'm

610
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,080
doing some like you know heavy labor or

611
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,399
anything like that working in the

612
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:10,038
gardens and things like that is the

613
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,759
great that's that's when the Blue Dream

614
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:14,279
comes out you know and yeah that's

615
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,599
pretty much my main sativo that I will

616
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,678
run is my Cali cut blue dream all right

617
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,759
is that the cut that goes around this

618
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,798
town a lot real tall it it is it's got

619
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,919
the thin nice thin blade super super

620
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,119
Frosty I hit that with uh Grateful Dog

621
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,240
pollen and she's been called blue healer

622
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:30,239
yeah absolutely she does that that that

623
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,200
cut does wonderful work with every it is

624
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,079
a true breeding cut I can't hardly get

625
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,640
it to it is a hard to cut even to get to

626
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,119
reverse it is yeah it is so St stable

627
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,679
you can stress it out kick it down the

628
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:41,119
street it's going to perform every

629
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,759
single time no matter really what you

what I mean as far as PR count I mean

645
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:14,759
totally you know it's undeniable really

646
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,759
honestly the reason I did it was because

647
00:21:14,759 --> 00:21:18,440
I wanted to replicate a strain

648
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,640
absolutely that I didn't have a good

649
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,480
another cross for I was like I don't

650
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,200
want to outbreed I want to duplicate

651
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:26,079
that so I just selfed it and made that's

652
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,480
how I made a 85% you know what I mean

653
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:29,399
right off the bat you know what I mean

654
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:31,278
so okay totally totally there's

655
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,480
definitely a reason for it's easy to do

656
00:21:31,278 --> 00:21:35,159
you know what I mean there's not a whole

657
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,079
lot going on there just reverse a plant

658
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:39,440
you know I don't I don't make it near as

659
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,960
much pollen as I do regular and that's

660
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,159
that's why I don't that's you guys

661
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,038
that's why everybody sold out of my

662
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,640
seeds right now cuz I can't make enough

663
00:21:44,038 --> 00:21:47,079
pollen it's definitely a sacrifice I've

664
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,520
got room for all the plants I just can't

665
00:21:47,079 --> 00:21:50,439
make enough pollen to hit all these

666
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,480
plants with it get it gets ridiculous

667
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,640
all right I'm going to take a dab and

668
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,120
then I'll tell you why I was talking

669
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,320
about femin Siege I'm honestly going to

670
00:21:54,119 --> 00:21:58,839
try to remember while I take this St hit

671
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:00,918
your head

672
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:03,278
no there's a purpose for

673
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,759
sure absolutely you

674
00:22:03,278 --> 00:22:06,798
know you know like like Jeff was saying

675
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:08,720
you know it's a lot about the

676
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,038
preservation the preservation of Clone

677
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,720
only or you know say even if it's your

678
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,119
own hybrid and you you run through 100

679
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,000
seeds and you find that one perfect

680
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,639
female that super female you know that

681
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,839
that that right there that's perfect

682
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,480
perfect example of why you should

683
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:22,399
feminize that strange stabilize it right

684
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,759
out the gate and that's what we've done

685
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,559
with our space dragon as a matter of

686
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,079
fact it's just to S1 it give everybody

687
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:29,359
the same version that we've grown to

688
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:31,319
love for seven eight years you know and

689
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,439
the only way to really do that truly is

690
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,759
to not outcross it is to feminize it

691
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,159
yeah it's a lot more fun outcrossing it

692
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:38,200
though isn't it it is because of the

693
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:39,960
variety like you were saying the

694
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,558
diversity of genetics Define what watch

695
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,240
nature take over the natural selection

696
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:45,440
and just watch you know just just watch

697
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,038
it take hold and really do what nature

698
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,240
does you know do what nature does I want

699

735
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,759
when when we all met up at the cup they

736
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,558
swerve and the whole gagee crew they all

737
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:06,278
gave me mad mad love I spent most of my

738
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,319
time at the Cali Connection booth and

739
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:10,679
the rest of my time at the gauge

740
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,839
Booth yeah at the C at the Cup last year

741
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,080
so I remember what I was going to say

742
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:18,158
about uh reversing plants I took a

743
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:19,918
strain that I so I had a plant and I

744
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,720
selfed it and made seeds out of that and

745
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,679
I kept the original Mommy and then I

746
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,798
took seeds and grew the seeds until I

747
00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,080
found one that looked just like Mommy

748
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,200
and then I reversed mommy again and put

749
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:33,558
that pollen on this female and I can't

750
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:35,200
get that Offspring to reverse I found a

751
00:24:33,558 --> 00:24:36,519
beautiful female that is amazing she's

752
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,120
been labeled

753
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,240
gd77 uh and she can't I cannot reverse

754
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,079
her with that's crazy undiluted

755
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,558
collodial silver or not collodial silver

756
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:48,480
silver tho sufate 100% just and she just

757
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,839
looked at me like nope spray like every

758
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,399
day that's great man that's really true

759
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:54,240
keeper there that's that's the true

760
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:55,398
breeding but I kind of hos myself cuz

761
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,079
that's one of my breeders and I was

762
00:24:55,398 --> 00:25:00,398
hoping to be able to still reverse that

763
00:24:57,079 --> 00:25:03,359
so I had to go backwards to go back to

764
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:04,759
the but yeah that is definitely I'm I

765
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,240
was told I'm one of the only breeders

766
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:09,440
that's uh doing solid stress tests on my

767
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,839
seeds what do you mean uh when I before

768
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,159
I'll breed with a female I'll take like

769
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:14,519
say I'm going to breed with blue dream

770
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,159
you know I would take blue dream and put

771
00:25:14,519 --> 00:25:19,038
her in a in a room by herself or with

772
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,440
whatever else I'm testing and run the

773
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,640
light cycle for two weeks the way she

774
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,120
should and flower and then disrupt it

775
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,080
and like turn it to the opposite and see

776
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,079
if I can make her Herm yeah and if

777
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:31,199
that's your mom yeah yeah now then I'll

778
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:32,599
use those to breed if they if I really

779
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,840
got to kick their ass to make them Herm

780
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:35,519
then I'll use them if they Herm too

781
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,480
easily I'll toss them I won't even waste

782
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,158
my time with it yeah I don't I don't

783
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,319
want to put out more Herm stuff totally

784
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:41,440
makes sense so here's something I've

785
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:42,839
talked about a couple times I'm way off

786
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,360
of my notes but this is fun I just like

787
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:46,000
this random chatter maybe you guys will

788
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:48,319
have an answer to this question I

789
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,000
reversed a Golden Goat plant and I took

790
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,960
the pollen and I put it on four other

791
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,200
plants and it made great stuff one of

792
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,919
the plants the headband plant shriveled

793
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:59,319
up and died when the pollen hit it like

794
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:01,679
theow the pistols went knew and it

795
00:25:59,319 --> 00:26:04,038
shriveled up and I straight up died the

796
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,038
pl died it died I the lights went off

797
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:07,398
the lights were going off you know what

798
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,278
mean I pollinated right before sunset or

799
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:11,319
lights out hit the pollen I watched hung

800
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,519
out for a minute you know I was like oh

801
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,798
lights are going out I'm out of here I

802
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:16,038
left the room I came back the next day

803
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:17,480
to see next day plant was dead bro the

804
00:26:16,038 --> 00:26:19,079

careful don't go to the hydro store just

874
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,919
move just move yeah or Legalize It where

875
00:28:28,359 --> 00:28:31,278
you are because the states that have

876
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,799
legal cannabis are getting full and

877
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,398
prices are going up everybody's rents

878
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,158
going up everywhere now in Colorado so

879
00:28:35,398 --> 00:28:38,239
yeah Legalize It where you are so that

880
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,519
that way you don't have to move here and

881
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,919
pay 1,200 bucks for a small apartment

882
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:44,558
that's what's

883
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,200
happening all right so I'm going to ask

884
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:49,158
the qu the crazy question now how do you

885
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,519
guys feel about autoflowering seeds oh

886
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,840
it sucks I love you

887
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:57,000
already me hor it's horrible I I I I

888
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:58,519
really don't I really don't care for

889
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,599
particularly I really don't like to grow

890
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,278
them myself I have grown plenty of them

891
00:29:00,599 --> 00:29:03,879
I understand the breeding process of

892
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:06,839
them I have been asked to grow them and

893
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,799
breed them but I I feel a true Auto

894
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:12,519
Autoflower needs to be 80 90 days to 120

895
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,918
days from start to finish and not these

896
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,919
60-day 30day whatever they're trying to

897
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,480
push on the market right now there's no

898
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:21,799
way for a plant to get properly mature

899
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,240
to give you really anything worth a dime

900
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:26,000
at the end of it or worth its weight and

901
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,359
the effort that you put into that plant

902
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,519
when you can do the same thing I have

903
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:32,199
grown regular seeds 12 and 12 from seed

904
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,278
and got ounces off of them before and

905
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,798
that's that's that's faster than 90 days

906
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:37,038
it's faster than what an Autoflower can

907
00:29:35,798 --> 00:29:38,839
give it to you and you're going to not

908
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:39,839
you're not going to suffer your potency

909
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:42,398
yeah

910
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,639
now for cash croppers and things like

911
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,000
that that's that's probably where

912
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,679
they're probably most appealing getting

913
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,079
multiple crops or they do I I feel they

914
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,720
do have a little bit of a place in like

915
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,839
stealth place like Florida places like

916
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,000
that you could do small grows small

917
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:58,519
little plants and do a bunch of them do

918
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,079
feminized

919
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,000
you know yeah yeah autoflowers and stay

920
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:05,480
under the radar very well Outdoors there

921
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,240
was a huge uh a cartel that got busted

922
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,159
in a national forest around here running

923
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,159
a bunch of Auto flers exactly and in my

924
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,320
opinion that's where they originally

925
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:14,880
started from they Auto they grow about

926
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:16,639
waste time just flower you know so they

927
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,080
could just line them up they did a plot

928
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,360
of like 50 feet by 50 feet here and then

929
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,678
wait 3 weeks and plot another plot

930
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,439
absolutely and then there's a lot of

931
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,480
things that go around online and on the

932
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,200
internet and different hearsay about

933
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,839
where aut flowers originally came came

934
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,880
from whether it came from low r or this

935
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,359
that and the other and that's really

936
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,000
truly where it came from Jeff was the

937
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,000
Mexican drug cartels and they learned

938
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,679
how to they breed they started breeding

939
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,720
their own cannabis with Kansas City

940
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,559
ditch weed basically hemp yeah rud rales

941
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,679
rud rales to get us to flower automatic

942
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,079
automatically absolutely and they

943
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,919
figured out they could get three seasons

944
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:48,960
a year in the same time and push it out

945
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:52,399
and that's why the swag just became even

946
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,399
more Swagger and to this day though what

947
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,959
we're seeing is a good thing you know

948
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,000
we're seeing the push of that away star

949
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,759
they're not even selling any weed

950
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,839
anymore to America the Mexican is not

951
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,759
even worth a dime coming over the Border

952
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:05,759
it's it's exactly the opposite of what

953
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:07,798
the government said would happen yeah

954
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,038
yeah uh they're actually but it pissed

955
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,119
them off I hear that they're doing other

956
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:12,519
things to like try to make more money

957
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:13,719
and get back at us now because they're

958
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:15,120
mad but of course that's how they're

959
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,639
going to roll right stealing they're

960
00:31:15,119 --> 00:31:19,879
stealing limes I don't know as far as

961
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:22,038
indoors growing Autos indoors I mean

962
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:24,039
you're saving two weeks get better at

963
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,359
beds you know right really for real yeah

964
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:27,519
learn learn to canopy management like

965
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:29,199

before I even leave that party sorry

1022
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:08,120
y'all but that's what we do uh so you

1023
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,359
guys you're both from different states

1024
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:12,239
uh you grew in other states where it was

1025
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:13,959
crazy and now you came here and you're

1026
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,919
able to set up shop and grow and do your

1027
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:17,240
breeding thing and I know that it's a

1028
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,919
lot less stressful the breeding laws

1029
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,200
here are it's kind of gray area in the

1030
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:23,120
breeding but they keep changing the

1031
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,558
rules everywhere we move to grow they

1032
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:26,638
keep changing the rules is that messing

1033
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:30,480
you guys up no not at all I'm from

1034
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:32,359
Virginia no matter what happens here I'm

1035
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,240
good you know what I mean no matter what

1036
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:35,798
there you go I think I think I think I

1037
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,798
think what it really boils down to when

1038
00:33:35,798 --> 00:33:38,398
like he's saying you know when you're a

1039
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,278
true grer nothing's going to stop you

1040
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,119
doing what you love yeah I well I

1041
00:33:40,278 --> 00:33:44,319
totally agree with that totally agree

1042
00:33:42,119 --> 00:33:46,398
with that you and I think then not just

1043
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:47,720
cannabis or growing I think it goes for

1044
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:49,278
all levels if something that you really

1045
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,360
love to do regardless of who is the

1046
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:51,519
government to tell you that you can't

1047
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,599
cannot do there's nothing I could I

1048
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,759
could never stop it it was but it's it's

1049
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,959
it's really not going to affect me to

1050
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,119
much fun

1051
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,319
my Mountain County things like that so I

1052
00:34:00,119 --> 00:34:03,879
really don't have to worry about the new

1053
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:06,678
but the ordinances now with the uh you

1054
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:08,720
know like peblo no more outdoor growing

1055
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,159
in city limits really yeah you can't

1056
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,799
grow outdoors in our city limits at all

1057
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,280
that was killed by a couple of specific

1058
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,519
Growers because they had the Dank

1059
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,040
outside and they just had six foot tall

1060
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:19,358
plants over the fence that smelled all

1061
00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:21,398
the way down to the high school down the

1062
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,039
street so that pissed off kind of a few

1063
00:34:21,398 --> 00:34:25,078
people that sucks so here's a question

1064
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,199
I've never asked anybody on the show if

1065
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:31,639
you had to pick one either growing or

1066
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:34,918
smoking cannabis growing Absol I agree I

1067
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,159
agree growing that's so awesome I'm glad

1068
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:38,239
that that means we're all in this right

1069
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,000
thing for we're all in it with our

1070
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:41,959
hearts I love that you guys didn't even

1071
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,918
have to think about it absolutely not

1072
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:45,559
man that is so cool if even if I

1073
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,440
couldn't smoke cannabis my lungs gave

1074
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:49,639
out tomorrow and or some or some crazy

1075
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,480
reason that I couldn't smoke cannabis

1076
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:53,079
it's still it's not it's it's a learning

1077
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,760
tool it's it's it's a fun experience

1078
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,079
it's like Jeff you say you play drums um

1079
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,599
it's it's that release that least that

1080
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,480
you get and it's your energy going into

1081
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,760

1328
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,519
to just somebody else somebody buys them

1329
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:06,400
