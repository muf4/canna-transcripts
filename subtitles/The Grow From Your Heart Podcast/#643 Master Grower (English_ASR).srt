waste a lot of time at the start of the

56
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:47,519
show i've got a bunch of

57
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,039
uh small topics i want to cover not one

58
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,798
big topic i'm going to delve

59
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,640
really deeply into today we're going to

60
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,240
cover a bunch of topics i've written a

61
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
bunch of notes as time goes on

62
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,438
and i've got a little like a pdf file or

63
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,718
a google document

64
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:00,078
of things i want to talk about on the

65
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,280
show i try to make a show out of that

66
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,039
these are a few things that didn't

67
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
qualify for a full show

68
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
but should be mentioned on a show so

69
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,080
here are a few of these uh small notes

70
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,000
compiled into a thursday

71
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,360
episode uh without too much more

72
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
rambling let's talk about one of the

73
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,599
first ones on the list it says

74
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,120
quarantine incoming clones that's right

75
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,719
we've talked about clones on a previous

76
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,599
episode i've talked about sharing clones

77
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,359
with your friends

78
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,199
it's never a bad idea to get clones from

79
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,080
friends or get maybe even get them from

80
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,679
a dispensary

81
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,520
however you get them it's always fun to

82
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,599
get new genetics but if you do that it

83
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,159
is very important it is very critical

84
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:32,079
that

85
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:33,519
we quarantine these clones they are

86
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,040
coming into our garden

87
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,360
they are being introduced to your grow

88
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,519
they can contaminate your entire grow

89
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
with whatever problems they've got they

90
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
come with free bugs they come with free

91
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,719
mildew they come with

92
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,598
all kinds of free funk that you did not

93
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:47,840
expect so

94
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,000
as a responsible grower as a responsible

95
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,878
farmer it is your responsibility

96
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,519
and your job to quarantine that incoming

97
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:55,199
clone

98
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,480
if you get a new plant a little baby

99
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:57,359
plant i don't care how big it is how

100
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,959
small it is

101
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,480
i don't care how much you trust that

102
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,640
other person ah

103
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,079
if you get a plant quarantine it treat

104
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,518
it like it's got a problem

105
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,599
treat it with the fungicide treat it

106
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:08,158
with the pesticide do whatever your

107
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,000
routine

108
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,158
is to make sure that it does not have

109
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,598
problems i treat things in a certain way

110
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,039
because i work in a commercial grow

111
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,878
environment i am exposed

112
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,878
to a lot of things i expose those

113
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,799
commercial grows to a lot of things

114
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,479
i can't get a clone from a friend that's

115
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,519
got mites on it and then take it to a

116
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,719
commercial grow

117
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,158
and contaminate one of those

118
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:27,039
multi-million dollar commercial

119
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:28,959
facilities

120
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,878
so when i get a clone the first thing i

121
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
do is i treat it with pesticides i'm not

122
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,598
even going to tell you what i use

123
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,439
because i will get flack for it i'll get

124
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,878
feedback all i have to do is say the

125
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,158
word pesticide on the show

126
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,239
and people start messaging me and

127
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,079
leaving poor comments so

128
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,239
pesticide there you go but it will be

129
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,239
treated with appropriate pesticides

130
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,878
appropriate fungicides to ensure that i

131
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,719
do not get any bugs or problems from an

132
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:51,199
incoming clone i don't want bonuses with

133
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,719
my

134
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:56,878
clones i want genetics not bugs not

135
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,878
mildews not issues not problems

136
00:03:56,878 --> 00:04:00,318
uh not [ __ ] that i did not expect so

137
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,239
it's my responsibility

138
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,759
to put that clone in another area i've

139
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,280
got a main grow space

140
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,959
a little further away from that main

141
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,479
growth space i've got another small

142
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,680
light where i can house a couple of

143
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:10,959
incoming plants

144
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,560
it's nothing major it's not an

145
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,158
impressive growth space but it will keep

146
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
plants there for a week and it will keep

147
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,478
them alive

148
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,160
that way i don't have to introduce them

149
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,719
to the general population

150
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,000
get everybody in general population sick

151
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,759
i'm sure you understand

152
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,839
with the the pandemic we just went

153
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,840
through you can get everybody sick with

154
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,839
just one contaminated infected person

155
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,039
the plants work the same damn way

156
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,959
so when the plants are coming into the

157
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,600
grow from a friend let's quarantine them

158
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:35,680
for

159
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,439
seven to ten days if you can at least

160
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
five to seven days keep them away from

161
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,040
the rest of the plants

162
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,879
treat them with the appropriate

163
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,400
pesticide fungicide maybe you're going

164
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,600
to put predator mites on them maybe

165
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,239
you're going to put it in a really hot

166
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,520
room and

167
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,120
heat up the temperature to get rid of

168
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,120
the bug eggs i don't know your approach

169
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
but have a strategy

170
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,759
to make sure that those bugs are gone

171
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,079
before you get to the main grow space

172
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,360
imagine if i brought just a clone home

173
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,519
and it had mites on it

174
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,439
i took it into my grow space then i went

175
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,359
to do a consultation at a

176
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,279
commercial cultivation facility and they

177
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,240
got my spider mites how bad of a dick

178
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:09,758
would i be

179
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,840
uh they probably wouldn't even know that

180
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,680
the mites came from me but i would know

181
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,279
and then i can't be mad at the person

182
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
that gave me spider mites it is my

183
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:19,119
responsibility

184
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,719
to protect myself everybody says i don't

185
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,199
have mites dude i don't have mold i

186
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,520
don't have

187
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,199
thrips i don't have anything get a clone

188
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,079
from them that's how you find out that

189
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,960
they do

190
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,839
have spider mites they do have thrips uh

191
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,918
so

192
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,359
i am not perfect you guys why am i

193
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:34,159
talking about this because guess what i

194
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,000
got a clone

195
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,080
that i thought i quarantined it properly

196
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,120
i thought i did the appropriate measures

197
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,800
uh but it had some uh ferocious [ __ ]

198
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,478
spider mites on it so i ended up dealing

199
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,759
with a little bit of a spider my battle

200
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,279
not a big deal i'm an experienced

201
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,439
gardener i know what i'm doing

202
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,478
but i had to go to the big two

203
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,600
commercial grows where i've been

204
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,199
recently and say hey

205
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,720
i had spider mites and it's like going

206
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,800
to somebody and saying like [ __ ] hey

207
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,160
i had a [ __ ] up std test and you might

208
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,840
want to get tested too

209
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,439
it's the same [ __ ] feeling so i had

210
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,038
to go to these girls and say hey guys

211
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,839
i had mites in my garden dude you might

212
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:06,240
want to uh up your game or do some extra

213
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:07,918
[ __ ]

214
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,600
i didn't take plants to there grow but

215
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,758
i've been there ah

216
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,759
i [ __ ] i'm sure i carry a spider mite

217
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,520
on me you know i came from one grow

218
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,800
to the other the mites were microscopic

219
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,719
one could have been uh

220
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
on my pants on my shirt someone's gonna

221
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,919
say they're in your dreads i'm waiting

222
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,600
for the joke to come already nothing new

223
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,758
but yes it's very likely i carried a

224
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,160
spider mite to these commercial grows

225
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,840
uh luckily we are very diligent with our

226
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,360
pest management systems at those

227
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:32,239
commercial growers we do things when we

228
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,240
walk in

229
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,680
uh we suit up at one of the places we

230
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,519
actually wear tyvek suits

231
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
got my hair in a bun and in a hat with

232
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,799
like a hairnet thing over it

233
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
that place is fairly well protected the

234
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,079
other place is so uh pesticide

235
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,359
crazy and uh they're really clean about

236
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:48,639
everything i don't think we're gonna get

237
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
any bug problems but

238
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,000
it is possible so i went there and i

239
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,079
said hey guys guess what

240
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,279
i had spider mites so you might too and

241
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,758
really it's the same feeling

242
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,959
as giving a [ __ ] negative std result

243
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,840
you're like you gotta call people and be

244
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,239
like hey uh

245
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,318
you might wanna go to the doctor but

246
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,478
again it was my responsibility just like

247
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
an std test it was my responsibility to

248
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,598
make sure my [ __ ] was safe

249
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,119
just like it's your responsibility all

250
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,120
right i said i wasn't going to go on too

251
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,639
long about one thing i think we went

252
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,560
long enough about quarantine your

253
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,680
incoming clones treat them the day you

254
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,120
get that clone treat it with the

255
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,478
pesticide put it in a room

256
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,240
turn the light off for an hour treat it

257
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:23,680
with a pesticide whatever you prefer

258
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,879
however you prefer to do it

259
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,400
treat it with something that's going to

260
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:27,519
ensure you that you're not getting a

261
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,839
problem

262
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,439
maybe this plant is an incoming mother

263
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,198
plant maybe you're not even going to

264
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,079
consume this plant maybe this is just

265
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,160
the one that's coming

266
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,000
in you can spray that one with [ __ ]

267
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,759
anything you choose if you're not going

268
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,879
to consume it just blast it with

269
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,400
something crazy

270
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,159
put it in the grove let it grow take a

271
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:45,519
few clones out of it i know people are

272
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,680
going to say half-life and that good

273
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:50,240
stuff but sometimes you've got to do

274
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,038
what you have got to do if if your life

275
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,720
and your

276
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,318
your goals and your business depend on

277
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,759
it you may have to do some things

278
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,360
just if you're not going to consume that

279
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,720
plant you can treat it with whatever

280
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,560
down the line people are gonna say that

281
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,400
pesticides in there but we will clone it

282
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
it will work itself out over time

283
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,918
we just need to get rid of that bug to

284
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,639
get this plant into the grow so we can

285
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,639
work with it

286
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,478
to save it to make it acceptable so

287
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,680
treat that plant however you feel

288
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,399
necessary but

289
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,519
beware incoming clones especially from a

290
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,519
dispensary grow

291
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,959
that's going to have bugs on it dude not

292
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,038
to point fingers at the dispensaries

293
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:22,959
it's just hard it's such a big facility

294
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,079
once you get a pest outbreak it becomes

295
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,839
challenging so

296
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,598
if you got the clone from the dispensary

297
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,119
please do quarantine it treat it

298
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,120
treat it the day you get it then treat

299
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,560
it like three to five maybe seven days

300
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,399
later treat it again

301
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,079
then pull a leaf off of it look at it

302
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,120
under a microscope under a magnifying

303
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,719
glass do you see

304
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,240
you may see some dead eggs you may see

305
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
some [ __ ] left on there from before but

306
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
do you see anything

307
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,040
moving anything viable anything alive

308
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,759
anything that will be a problem or a

309
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,759
threat

310
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,519
if so leave that [ __ ] in quarantine

311
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,319
and keep treating it until the problem

312
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,240
is gone

313
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,920
if it's a small plant you can dunk it

314
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,839
i've showed you in previous episodes how

315
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,679
to do a dunk that dunk we did

316
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,040
uh right before we pop the clones into

317
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,039
the the clone gel

318
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,719
uh you can hold the plant so if you've

319
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,519
got the plant coming out of a cup or a

320
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,120
small pot

321
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,039
i've got big hands i can put my hand

322
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,639
over the top of the pot and basically

323
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,079
hold most of the soil in

324
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,319
and have the stick coming out from

325
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,240
between my fingers so that my hand is

326
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
working like a lid to cover the soil the

327
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,799
stem of the plant still sticks up

328
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,399
between my fingers

329
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,079
i just flip the plant upside down and

330
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,519
gently dunk it into the pesticide give

331
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
it a couple of swooshes a couple of

332
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,720
plunges

333
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,639
take it out let it dry off if you want

334
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
to rinse it with clean water

335
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,720
after that that is acceptable or spray

336
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,320
it down with clean water

337
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
this plant should be big enough and safe

338
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,480
enough to where it's not going to get

339
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,640
any

340
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,879
photo toxicity oh yeah in a previous

341
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,080
episode i did say the word phytotoxicity

342
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:41,519
i didn't have any notes and i was

343
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,200
talking fast

344
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,799
i said the wrong word you're correct uh

345
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,480
thank you for the updates sometimes i'm

346
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,838
gonna say the wrong [ __ ] you talk for

347
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,519
countless hours

348
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,040
by yourself and don't say anything wrong

349
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,360
anyway give that plant

350
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,958
a dunk give it a rinse if you want don't

351
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
put it under light for several hours let

352
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,599
that pesticide work its thing let it

353
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,040
kind of dry off under there

354
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
then when it's time put the lights back

355
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,599
on check the plants make sure there's no

356
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,838
bugs

357
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,079
all right for a quick [ __ ] chatter on

358
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,360
that one i went for a long time

359
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,519
let's see we've been going for we got

360
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,039
plenty of time all right um i also saw

361
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,679
somebody on social media

362
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,360
say that the wreck market was looking

363
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,239
sad in colorado that the medical

364
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,000
marijuana

365
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
is much better than the recreational

366
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,078
cannabis and

367
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
i just had to chime in with a small

368
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,159
correction i asked them what is the

369
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,680
difference between the recreational

370
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,519
cannabis and the medical cannabis and

371
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,599
they couldn't tell me any differences

372
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,639
in the actual plants and the flowers

373
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,440
they kept saying

374
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,159
that the taxes were too high and that

375
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
none of their

376
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,399
statements supported the statement that

377
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,320
the product was better or that there was

378
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,679
a difference and that's because

379
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,480
um i work in recreational and commercial

380
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,519
grows

381
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,839
i was a cultivation manager

382
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,679
for a facility that on one side of the

383
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,320
building one side of the parking lot

384
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:56,799
we had a recreational grow on the other

385
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,839
side

386
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,599
we had a medical grow and they were

387
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,440
grown the exact same way we modeled the

388
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,278
two grows after each other to where we

389
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,880
could have standard operating procedures

390
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,639
that worked in both buildings

391
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,399
so we didn't have to train new growers

392
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:11,919
like hey we grow the medical weed this

393
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,078
way and we grow the wreck weed this way

394
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,799
no we grow it all the best we [ __ ]

395
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,239
can we had the same oh let me be honest

396
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:19,759
with you in one building we had better

397
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,879
[ __ ] because it was a newer building and

398
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,240
we learned a lot but

399
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,078
that was just timing that was just

400
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,839
[ __ ] because of it was the future

401
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:26,958
like the next podcast studio will be

402
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,320
better because it will be better

403
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,799
there'll be new [ __ ] we'll have learned

404
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,399
something

405
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,240
but it will be mirrored after this just

406
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,159
upgraded so honestly it was a little bit

407
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,000
different just because technology but

408
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,519
uh then the next grow will be a little

409
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
bit better but we're doing all the same

410
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,720
[ __ ] in both facilities

411
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,278
we've got the same lighting the same

412
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,320
hvac system the same nutrients

413
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,639
it is the same clones we were

414
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,079
uh so you're allowed to enter clones

415
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,439
into your system at a certain time when

416
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,679
your facility is new

417
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,800
um you can get them from certain sources

418
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:56,638
we were able to get

419
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,159
the same clones sourced for the

420
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,879
commercial or for the recreational

421
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,120
facility

422
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,639
as we did the medical so we've got pick

423
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,639
a strain i'm just going to say arise we

424
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,159
got a rise at the medical and a rise at

425
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,320
the recreational facility

426
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,679
same clone same cut same plant same

427
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,680
breeder shout out to arise by the way

code that'll help you out but so we got

435
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,078
a rise in the recreational and a rise in

436
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,879
the medical growth guess what i feed

437
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:27,359
them both

438
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,480
the exact same nutrients i feed them the

439
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,159
same day

440
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,240
the same [ __ ] thing they get sprayed

441
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,319
the exact same pesticides they get

442
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,759
sprayed the same foliar feeds

443
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
they get popped and twisted and

444
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,759
defoliated the same then guess what here

445
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,159
is something that may blow your mind

446
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,519
they are watered and fed by the same

447
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,958
growtax that's right we have two

448
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,440
buildings across the street from each

449
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:47,439
other

450
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,200
these guys work over here from morning

451
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,480
till lunch then they travel across the

452
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,079
way and then from lunch to the end of

453
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,759
the day they work on the other side

454
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,199
the same dudes are watering the same

455
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,679
plants doing the same popping and

456
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,600
twisting and lollipopping the same techs

457
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,519
are working on the recreational and the

458
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,959
medical marijuana plants

459
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,399
i don't like the word marijuana plants

460
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,078
it didn't feel good recreational

461
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,000
cannabis when i say medical marijuana it

462
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,838
flows it works but recreational

463
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
i'm not gonna say recreational marijuana

464
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,040
again that was weird you guys i'm good

465
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,720
in stone i had some fatty dabs today

466
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:15,838
shout out to the dirty business dabs

467
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,320
from green dot labs

468
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,240
i enjoy that [ __ ] um so it's the same

469
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,639
grotex then guess what

470
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,959
at the end it is the same harvest crew

471
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,440
the same trimmers trim the recreational

472
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,879
and the medical herb the same people

473
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,240
they just move from building to building

474
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,919
we can't move the product because

475
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,560
technically legally license wise the

476
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,399
product has to stay where it is but

477
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,759
the team can move they're they're mobile

478
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,720
they're [ __ ] they just walk across

479
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,720
the parking lot

480
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,278
so sometimes we start the day with like

481
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,000
ah grow tech a and grow tech b you're in

482
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,240
building one

483
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,078
grow tech c and grow tech g you're in

484
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,480
building two and then trim crew we need

485
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:50,479
you

486
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,000
over here and that's how the day starts

487
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,278
we just assign people to rooms and

488
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,559
buildings and they go where they need to

489
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:55,838
go and they get comfortable and they do

490
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,518
the day in that building

491
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,000
or we'll do half of it over here half of

492
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,198
it over here uh being the

493
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,399
lead guy i do [ __ ] half of it in this

494
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:05,919
building half of it in this building

495
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,360
than the other half in the office and i

496
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,639
know that's three halves of a day but

497
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,360
you be the manager and you'll know what

498
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,198
the [ __ ] i mean

00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,838
grower

535
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,599
knows what is going on somebody in the

536
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,120
building has got a map and unless you're

537
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,879
the one with the map that knows

538
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,399

544
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:29,519
[ __ ] tremors

545
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,880
are just as important as the grow techs

546
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,480
are just as important as the [ __ ]

547
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,600
tech leads or just as important as the

548
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,320
master grower

549
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,720
are just as important as the consultant

550
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
are just as important as the investors

551
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,920
are just as important as the owners

552
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,879
because without all of them

553
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:46,799
the [ __ ] does not work uh if the owner

554
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,600
doesn't own it and pay all the people

555
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:48,879
down the line

556
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,720
the [ __ ] doesn't happen but if the

557
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:52,799
trimmers don't trim the herb there's no

558
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,639
[ __ ] product to be [ __ ] had and

559
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:56,240
everybody down the line has to do their

560
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,839
part so figure out

561
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,839
under try to understand the bigger

562
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,279
picture in the cultivation facility it's

563
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,720
not just you're sitting there trimming

564
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,519
weeds so that the owner can drive a

565
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
porsche

566
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,759
uh the owners got a lot on the [ __ ]

567
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,440
line the owner had to establish money to

568
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,120
acquire licenses and buildings and

569
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,040
they're giving you a job so

570
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
understand how it the whole dynamic of

571
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,120
that building it's not just

572
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,920
you listening to 311 all day [ __ ]

573
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,919
trim and herb

574
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,679
or you sprinkling water on these plants

575
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,120
or you being tortured because you've got

576
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:25,039
to defoliate all day

577
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
it's a big big picture in there so be

578
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,000
part of the team

579
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,399

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,839
watch those videos on youtube where the

582
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,680
people from other cultures

583
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,440
can grab a fruit off the tree and cut it

584
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,120
into the shape of a butterfly and season

585
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,880
it and [ __ ] serve it to you in 17

586
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,600
seconds and do 30 of them without taking

587
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,759
a break

588
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,600

597
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,399

598

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,440
grow

637
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,038
when you work at the brewery the term is

638
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,960
master brewer but nobody's getting

639
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,798
uptight over the master brewer

640
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,160
we did not assign ourselves the [ __ ]

641
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,079
royal master grower

642
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,679
it's on the application it's a [ __ ]

643
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,558
job title we're not trying to say i'm

644
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,919
the master

645
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:19,839
i don't have a [ __ ] black belt in the

646
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,240
crown no i'm the [ __ ] one

647
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:23,519
in charge of the [ __ ] grow uh there

648
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,279
are other people in the grove that can

649
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,879
have a little say and some opinions

650
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:28,720
but when it comes down to it i'm the

651
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,280
[ __ ] captain now and we're doing what

652
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,200
i say

653
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,798
that's all the term master grower means

654
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,038
don't get it twisted don't think that it

655
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,558
makes me think i'm the [ __ ] master

656
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,640
no i'm the [ __ ] boss it's just the

657
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,399
way of saying [ __ ] that is in

658
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,919
charge that's what master grower means

659
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,759
so quit [ __ ] giving people [ __ ] about

660
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,600
it quit being a crybaby about it that's

661
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,359
my two cents on the phrase master grower

662
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,439

689
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,240

are you even proud of it probably not

697
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,759
but if you took your time

698
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,519
took some effort put some energy into it

699
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,119
put some thought and some heart into it

700
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,038
even if your painting looks like [ __ ] in

701
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,918
the end everybody else you can be proud

702
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,640
of it because

703
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,480
you put pride into it your flowers your

704
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,120

705
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,000

708
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,240
um again though don't go over there in

709
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:13,599
there and [ __ ] just

710
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,279
over love it sometimes you just gotta

711
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,918
get out of there and let it do its thing

712
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,639
but you wouldn't take a puppy home and

713
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
not have

714
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,038
a leash a collar a puppy bowl like a dog

715
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:25,038

716
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,798

717
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,158
some pee pads and some [ __ ]

718
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,519
napkins or something to clean up all

719
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
this dog piss and [ __ ] you're gonna have

720
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,839
to deal with

721
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
you kind of prepare you don't bring a

722
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,119
baby home without a [ __ ] bassinet and

723
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:36,639
a blanket and a crib

724
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,239
at least most of us don't a lot of us

725
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,720
maybe you [ __ ] did and sorry

726
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,159
if i'm calling you out but my point is

727
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,400
if you've got cannabis plants

728
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,000
be [ __ ] prepared you've got pets

729
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,120
you've got plants you've got a project

730
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,960
you've spent money

731
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,479
on the lights the soil the grow space

732
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
you have built some stuff

733
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,000
uh you care about it enough to have an

734
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,280
environment for it now let's put some

735
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,558
thought into it let's understand the

736
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,079
plants have a goal

737
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,319
do you know your goal do you know your

738
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:00,798
strategy do you know what you're doing

739
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:02,480
or

740
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,000
are you coming to social media every

741
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,599
monday saying what should i have done to

742
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,960
my plants what is going on because

743
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,480
that's going to set you up for

744
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,919
failure i love social media i love the

745
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,880
internet i'm on the internet teaching

746
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,400
you how to grow

747
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,159
but everybody thinks they know how to

748
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,360
grow and they don't know your situation

749
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,840
they don't know what you're doing and

750
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,959
they think

751
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:23,839
their way is the best and the only way

752
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,120
as a experienced long-time cultivator i

753
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,879
know that there are

754
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,279
thousands of ways to skin this [ __ ]

755
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,240
cat we can grow cannabis on the moon we

756
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,558
can grow cannabis

757
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,759
in dirt we can grow cannabis in soilless

758
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:35,599
mixes cocoa

759
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,279
we don't even need dirt you can suspend

760
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,519
that [ __ ] in water and grow it

761
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,038
all of those ways are right they're all

762
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,798
absolutely correct

763
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,240
you can top it you can film it you can

764
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,599
pop it you can twist it or you can leave

765
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,839
it the [ __ ] alone and guess what

766
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,119
all of those ways are correct so when

767
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,558
you go to the internet and somebody says

768
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,399
you have to do this

769
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:53,599
you don't have to do [ __ ] you have to

770
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,960
have fun in there and you have to grow

771
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:55,439
it not burn the place down that's

772
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,919
[ __ ]

773
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,360
basically all you have to do is if the

774
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,400
plants die or the place burns down you

775
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,599
[ __ ] up and failed

776
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,519
if you're happy with your outcome you

777
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,719
did it right but if you have a strategy

778
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,440
and you know what you're doing you got a

779
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,279
book and a goal and some sort of ideas

780
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,960
you'll have a much more successful

781
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,200
outcome so set a strategy

782
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,038
set a goal read some books read about

783
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
like week one this is what i should

784
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,798
expect

785
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,319
when you're gonna have a baby they sell

786
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,918
you that book what to expect when you're

787
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,158
expecting and it tells you on a week

788
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,759
on month one expect this month to expect

789
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,960
this and then it's like on month nine

790
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,879
you're gonna have a [ __ ] baby or

791
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,519
month 10 the baby comes out then you get

792
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,360
this

793
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,038
there are books for cannabis just like

794
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,038
that and they'll tell you what to expect

795
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,960
every week and there's only nine weeks

796
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,960
of flowers you've only got to read nine

797
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,480
weeks and it's about a page per week

798
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,558
should be able to figure that out so get

799
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,759
a book listen to some podcasts and know

800
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,519
what to expect

801
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,960
every week that's coming up that way you

802
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,158
can be prepared you don't have to go to

803
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,519

828
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,440
why also don't be afraid to ask somebody

829
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,798
why

830
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,798
when somebody says do this to your

831
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,158
plants say why

832
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,000
they should have a reason if they can't

833
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,280
explain to you why they don't know what

834
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,079
the [ __ ] they're talking about i can
