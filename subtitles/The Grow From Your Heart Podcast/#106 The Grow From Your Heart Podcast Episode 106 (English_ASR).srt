I quit the spot and let you know what's

85
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,179
going on cuz I don't want you to think

86
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,849
that I hate the spot or than anything

87
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:08,180
shitty happened I've been at the spot

88
00:03:04,849 --> 00:03:09,859
since the middle of July and we have

89
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,860
been building and getting things

90
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:14,480
finalized and there is no sign of having

91
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,350
plants in that building for at least

92
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,789
another month or two and I am not I'm

93
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:22,909
not a plumber I'm not a construction

94
00:03:19,789 --> 00:03:24,620
worker I can do basic things but I've

95
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:26,840
been trying to find stuff to keep me

96
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,430
busy for 40 hours a week in the spot for

97
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,769
the past month and there's nothing to do

98
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:33,319
and without plants in there I've been

99
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:34,879
going crazy you guys the building is not

100
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,239
ready for plants they're not ready to

101
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,579
cultivate I was expected to be there and

102
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,989
perform so it was hard to be there

103
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,269
everyday with nothing to do it was

104
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,799
making me super anxious I was making me

105
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:47,629
bored I was spending way too much time

106
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:50,390
on social media because I was bored at

107
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:52,699
the shop so when my buddy hunt called

108
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:54,649
and said hey we need help here at green

109
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:56,979
and healthy it felt like the right thing

110
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,719
to do to jump on and be part of the team

111
00:03:56,979 --> 00:04:02,539
at the spot they run hydro it's a big

112
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:05,539
huge hydro set up I am NOT a hydro

113
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:08,030
grower I am a soil farmer at the green

114
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:11,929
and healthy grow we're running three

115
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,310
gallon pots of soilless mix with plants

116
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,530
already in the building they're our

117
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,060
plants they're waiting for me so Friday

118
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,620
I'm going to move plants to the

119
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,120
flowering room and I'm going to give

120
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,879
them a little bit of time to veg in the

121
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,220
flower room in their new home

122
00:04:21,879 --> 00:04:26,319
in about 10 to 14 days after that I plan

123
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,810
to flower the first crop for green and

124
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,449
healthy wellness so I'm leaving a

125
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:33,250
facility that will not have plants until

126
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:35,560
my first harvest at my new facility is

127
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:36,910
finished is what it feels like and I'm

128
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,259
in it to grow you guys that's what I'm

129
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:40,810
here for I want to grow and produce

130
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:42,339
quality cannabis so I had to make a move

131
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,530
I had to make a huge move this is an

132
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:47,169
hour drive to and from work every single

133
00:04:44,529 --> 00:04:49,629
day but you know what it's a soil garden

134
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,000
with my homies with a grimy Gatsby and

135
00:04:49,629 --> 00:04:54,870
dude it's damsel and John Randall's jr.

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,519
so in my mind this is the right decision

137
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,990
sometimes you gotta just you got to make

138
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:00,339
a move that scares you you got to make a

139
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,509
move that puts you on the spot you got

140
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:04,119
to make a move that breaks you out of

141
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,860
your routine and I feel like my life has

142
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,379
really been routine for the past couple

143
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,439
of years and shaking myself up like this

144
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:13,360
really puts it lights a new fire under

145
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,910
my ass so to speak it puts fresh ideas

146
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,850
in my head I find a new inspiration I

147
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:21,460
meet new people I go new places I really

148
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:24,310
improves my life overall when I put

149
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:26,349
myself in a uncomfortable position when

150
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,000
I break out of my comfort bubble and put

151
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:29,620
myself in a position where I'm not

152
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,129
exactly sure how this is gonna play out

153
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,480
it always works very well for myself so

154
00:05:33,129 --> 00:05:36,100
if you guys are scared to do something

155
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,509
if there's something you're thinking

156
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,470
about doing if there's a big change in

157
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:41,709
your life that you're thinking about

158
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,410
making all I can say is grab your balls

159
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:46,419
and do it just do it don't be afraid

160
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,830
success is scary but once you succeed

161
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,110
and you see what it's like to succeed

162
00:05:47,829 --> 00:05:51,579
and not fall down from that all you're

163
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:52,840
gonna do is want to succeed more and

164
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,519
more and more your goals are gonna get

165
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,469
bigger your dreams are gonna get bigger

166
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,779
your abilities to reach those dreams

167
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:00,430

170
00:06:02,649 --> 00:06:05,379
do it and what's gonna happen you're

171
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:07,539
gonna try and you're either gonna

172
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,620
succeed or you're gonna fail if you fail

173
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,660
you're gonna be right where you are

174
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,340
you're not gonna go backwards by failing

175
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:14,110
because trying something is going to

176
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,339
give you skills you're gonna at least be

177
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:18,220
trying something you're gonna feel

178
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:19,929
better and if you succeed holy [ __ ] you

179
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,460
just succeeded it's something you just

180
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:23,470
opened a new door to your life you just

181
00:06:21,459 --> 00:06:25,689
have a new thing you can do or somewhere

182
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,370
else you can go and what is that gonna

183
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:29,110
do that's gonna be a building block for

184
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:31,780
the next places you can go and the next

185
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,979
things you can do so if you're scared if

186
00:06:31,779 --> 00:06:34,089
you're stuck in your comfort zone if

187
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:34,930
you're stuck in your little bubble you

188
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,758
guys all

189
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,220
I can say is snap out of that and try to

190
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:40,720
do some new things I have some faith in

191
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,639
the world have some faith in yourself

192
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,350
have some faith in life even if you're

193
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,509
not a spiritual or a religious person

194
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:50,379
you can have some confidence you can

195
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:52,000
have some some I guess faith is what you

196
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:55,509
need to have and don't have fear of

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,250
failing your life if your life is good

198
00:06:55,509 --> 00:06:58,479
right now and you try something and you

199
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,550

201
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:04,780
from you because you messed up trying

202
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:06,280
something new and anybody that does talk

203
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:07,598
[ __ ] to you and disrespects you because

204
