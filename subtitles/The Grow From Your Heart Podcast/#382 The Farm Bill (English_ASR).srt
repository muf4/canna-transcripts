and the lung there from that last day we

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,410
took not to brag not to talk about how

21
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,698
good our dabs are but we took a little a

22
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:58,919
apothecary farms internally flawless

23
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,198
series diamond broke a few little pieces

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,850
off of that they're heated up the banger

25
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:06,920
dropped the diamond into there and then

26
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:10,409
dropped a fat glob of lemon Geoffrey

27
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,849
full terpene hive terpene full spectrum

28
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,520
extract damn I forgot the words now

29
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:16,739
basically lemon Jeffrey Terps right on

30
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:18,209
top of that dab then capped it up Mike

31
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:19,739
took a little tiny micro dab it took a

32
00:01:18,209 --> 00:01:21,438
pretty big fat dab of it we both sat

33
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:23,640
here and coughed and changed colors

34
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:25,139
played a fun game with Mike ride as he

35
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,579
blew out the damn I said real quick name

36
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,079
this new cross I made and he tried to

37
00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,978
spit out stray names and it was funny to

38
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,959
watch him scramble

39
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:32,188
making words was hard enough then trying

40
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:33,899
to put them together to make this train

41
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:36,500
name was pretty funny to watch so words

42
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,990
were hard good words were not possible

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:42,118
we were smoking on I was the internally

44
00:01:39,989 --> 00:01:44,339
flawless diamonds with the elimin

45
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:46,469
Jeffery Terps on top of that before that

46
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,049
we may have had a few other random dabs

47
00:01:46,469 --> 00:01:50,969
we may have hit the star dog we probably

48
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:52,920
hit the guerrilla glue oh wait wait the

49
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:54,959
GG for you can't say gorilla glue

50
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,019
anymore and the goat power

51
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,188
we took a dope power it smells

52
00:01:58,019 --> 00:02:00,269
straight-up like golden goat I don't

53
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:02,758
know what else that could be I think

54
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,408
it's just gold and goat but anyway we've

55
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:06,269
had plenty of dabs I think Mike is well

56
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:07,618
lit I am heavily medicated there may be

57
00:02:06,269 --> 00:02:10,848
a dab break here in the middle of the

58
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:13,889
show but welcome to the show everybody

59
00:02:10,848 --> 00:02:16,530
welcome folks yeah right over there Mike

60
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:18,149
I'm good your eyes are we had a slight

61
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,099
technical glitch at the beginning and

62
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:22,439
Jeff pointed out something on the screen

63
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,568
and I'm having trouble not watching the

64
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,219
audio for you record itself it's still

65
00:02:24,568 --> 00:02:28,349
it's still doing the thing we're cool

66
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,719
I'm confident that that works it's got a

67
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,009
lava lamp like appeal oh yeah bro you

68
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:33,780
just want to stare at it and watch that

69
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:36,989
thing move up the drive really hard not

70
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,400
to see to watch my words make lines

71
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,959
I put the computer in a different spot

72
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,849
so that I wouldn't do what mike is doing

73
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:43,170
right now I catch myself staring at the

74
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:44,699
little graph that you know when you talk

75
00:02:43,169 --> 00:02:45,869
into audio software that makes a little

76
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,179
graph it shows how high it looks like a

77
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,009
lie-detector test on the screen if you

78
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,450
think about it that way it looks like

79
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:53,069
the ones it's doing that with my voice

80
00:02:51,449 --> 00:02:54,569
that's jumping up and down I see Aaron's

81
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,859
staring do it while I talk and that's

82
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:57,060
why I use the headphone so I can stare

83
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,470
into the screen and I can hear you

84
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,699
clearly and I have to look and look

85
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,319
around the table to hear people and I

86
00:02:59,699 --> 00:03:02,429
stay with my voice onto the mic and I

87
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,780
can look into the thing but now you're

88
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,310
mesmerized they may have to move it in

89
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,050
the future so then right I'm trying to

90
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,819
focus on your notepad and notes right

91
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,900
now and it's not working because it's

92
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:11,669
upside-down to you and you've got

93
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,680
terrible eyesight if you haven't picked

94
00:03:11,669 --> 00:03:15,238
up on it yet work blazed

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,250
we might have smoked a lot of dabs

96
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:22,049
before this show Happy New Year you guys

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,620
um Mike do you want to jump into this

115
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,930
farm bill stuff are you ready for all of

116
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,849
that and we most certainly can okay I am

117
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,349
going to admit I said I'm gonna read

118
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:03,060
this farm bill thing it might ghost bro

119
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:04,289
it's like a hundred and something pages

120
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,969
and I was like well maybe I'll let you

121
00:04:04,289 --> 00:04:07,679
just tell me about it and it's it's not

122
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:09,659
just like a hundred pages it's like the

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,909
first hundred pages of Harry Potter it's

124
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:14,430
a hundred pages of some of the most dull

125
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:17,219
language you could ever come across

126
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,228
lawyers are evil they literally lawyer

127
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,750
means [ __ ] up language no enough

128
00:04:19,228 --> 00:04:23,038
understands that we arguing like I'm

129
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:26,550
married to one I was asked to have an

130
00:04:23,038 --> 00:04:27,120
expert yes yes but for those of you who

131
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,650
took a look

132
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,319
it didn't feel like reading it we're

133
00:04:28,649 --> 00:04:33,929
gonna do kind of a light gloss over of

134
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:38,459
what the farm bill is what all is jammed

135
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,519
into it why this year's was special hint

136
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:45,899
it has to do with hemp legalization and

137
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:47,909
what that means for hemp market CBD all

138
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,409
that good stuff I'm so glad this is a

139
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:53,460
Thursday episode and not a Monday

140
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,930
episode I think I'm spoiling of him I

141
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,909
think I said I was not going to put out

142
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,129
a Thursday so to say I feel a little

143
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,770
extra off leash because for two reasons

144
00:04:59,129 --> 00:05:02,909
one you straight-up told people on

145
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:06,299
Monday you weren't gonna do with

146
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,919
Thursday show and I respected that as a

147
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,889
listener because it's [ __ ] New Year's

148
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,299
go have some fun buddy but we had a

149
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,918
chance to get together so why not do it

150
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,439
there's a [ __ ] yeah that's reason one

151
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,930
reason to I'm just in a really good mood

152
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:20,699
and we've been having fun good fun

153
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:23,009

154
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:24,180
you extra high so well we got extra

155
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:27,149
height together I'm not gonna blame it

156
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:30,060

157

another dab you dig in that pile that

160
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,909
this pile is inviting too but it's the

161
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:40,620
same [ __ ] that's in that pile just last

162

different chemical oh yeah I'm gonna

164
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,780
skip that in not dab and knock you Baker

165
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,960
that igner word it's just fun to say

166
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:54,589
take the higher stoned err yep stoned

167
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:57,478
then people are just [ __ ] tunings how

168
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:59,069
gone on this episode so the farm bill

169
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:02,279
farm bill dive right into it

170
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,339
we will we are gonna miss if we dive too

171
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:07,559
hard so let's just wait and then gently

172
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:09,569
head will gently lay floor alright so

173
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,288
kick your flip-flops off and slowly wade

174
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:15,719
into this is getting weird the farm bill

175
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:18,360
is a major piece of federal legislation

176
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,800
that we do every four years I think it

177
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,129
is might be every five pretty sure it's

178
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,870
every four years and it covers a huge

179
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:30,389
range of topics everything from how and

180
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:34,110
where different agricultural crops get

181
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:37,319
grown to food safety testing that's

182
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,319
required to food stamps and nutrition

183
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,779
programs at schools

184
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:45,199
I mean it's a massive bill that covers

185
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:48,619
all sorts of different things that are

186
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,259
very very loosely related to agriculture

187
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:52,759
and food and some of it gets very

188
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:55,069
scientific and you wouldn't think about

189
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,170
it when you think like farming or the

190
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:59,180
farm bill it has to do with like lab

191
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:03,290
testing equipment and FDA rules and

192
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:06,199
regulations also it also has things like

193
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:07,640
crop insurance for farmers so if a

194
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:10,639
tornado shows up and [ __ ] up their

195
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:12,860
soybean harvest they're not just broke

196
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,060
and destitute now that there's a form of

197
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,069
federal insurance that they can apply

198
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,490
for and things like that so the farm

199
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:22,099
bill is massive and because it's huge

200
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,560
and politics is kind of weird and quirky

201
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,100
a bunch of different things get attached

202
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,269
to it every time they do it and

203
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:31,629
politicians use it as a way to get

204
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:33,379
leverage on other people sometimes or

205
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:35,569
you're not willing to jeopardize

206
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:37,909
something you care about in it so if

207
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,949
they slip in a pet project of theirs

208
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:41,720
you're not going to torpedo their pet

209
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:44,870
project because it's part of this thing

210
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,420
you care about in one of those little

211
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:52,240
attachments this year was legalizing

212
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:55,520
hemp Republican senator from Kentucky

213
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,939
attached it to this year's farm bill and

214
00:07:55,519 --> 00:08:03,289
it passed without any fanfare outside of

215
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:06,800
our small community which is kind of

216
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:10,720
surprising the hemp has been illegal to

217
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,600
grow in the US for like 60 or 70 years

218
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,100
it was banned after World War two it was

219
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,560
rebuilt after World War two it was

220
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:21,220
banned before World War two also but it

221
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,220
was rebound

222
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,149
you could hide marijuana in hemp fields

223
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,800
which if you know anything about the

224
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:30,409
cannabis plant isn't really a thing they

225
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,389
both kind of ruin each other and if

226
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:34,639
you're growing the hemp for a reason and

227
00:08:32,389 --> 00:08:36,080
you grill marijuana and cross pollinate

228
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,879
you're gonna [ __ ] up your hemp harvest

229
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,530
and if you're having harvest cross

230
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:41,809
pollinate your cannabis harvest you're

231
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:45,860
gonna ruin your cannabis harvest also

232
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,089
not immediately but especially 40 50 60

233
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,230
years ago when they were having this

234
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:53,149
argument it was exceptionally illogical

235
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:55,300
because unfamiliar wasn't a thing crops

236
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:57,649
operation like we know now is the thing

237
00:08:55,299 --> 00:09:01,309
it would have been a major issue but

238
00:08:57,649 --> 00:09:02,779
they managed to attach it to cannabis

239
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:05,419
prohibition in general and fighting

240
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:09,169
marijuana and has been illegal to grow

241
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:11,240
across the u.s. for decades and every

242
00:09:09,169 --> 00:09:13,009
time somebody brings up how moronic this

243
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,049
is and how many different products that

244
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:18,980
hemp could be and currently is being

245
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:22,729
used in across the US but we can't grow

246
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:25,129
it usually the DEA brings up their

247
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:28,820
original objections it can be used to

248
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:30,139
hide marijuana or high THC crops

249
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:34,240
it'll be confusing for law enforcement

250
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:34,240
spend another one that I've always loved

251
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:39,020
they they were real vocal in the 90s and

252
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:41,179
early thousands about how we can't

253
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,699
legalize him because cops could never be

254
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:45,439
trained to tell the difference and they

255
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,600
were open and honest about how they were

256
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
sure that was a thing well if you look

257
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,629
at the two plants side-by-side if I took

258
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:51,980
you to a hemp farm and I was like bro

259
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,939
show me the cannabis and show me the

260
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,980
hemp you couldn't tell the difference

261
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:57,200
like if we went out to the big hemp farm

262
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,670
out here on the highway on ninety six

263
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,780
there's a giant one on the right side of

264
00:09:58,669 --> 00:10:00,319
the road there you see it when you drive

265
00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:02,360
out there

266
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,590
those look like cannabis plants if you

267
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,269
get close and rub them they've got

268
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:08,750
trichomes if you smell your fingers it

269
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:10,490
smells like arm that Tora Bora that we

270
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,899
used to grow it's got that Afghani

271
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:13,759
cherry smell to it they're growing a

272
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:16,759
real Afghan cherries they're grown of

273
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,740
our sincerity right yeah yeah it's a

274
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:21,019
specific type a hemp that they're using

275
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,310
that grows similar to the plants we're

276
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:25,460
talking about a lot of the hemp for

277
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:29,809
textiles is like 11 feet tall okay it

278
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:31,970
looks like more like sugar cane or reeds

279
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:35,750
in the river all right then it does like

280
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,430
a bushy Chris yeah very skinny single

281
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,649
stock that goes way up and then you get

282
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:41,899
a little kind of looks like a bud at the

283
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:45,019
very top but the field looks very

284
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:46,429
different you can pull up him for

285
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:51,199
victory and look at the two plants and

286
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:54,109
they look fairly dissimilar okay but how

287
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,330
the main issue with hemp being an

288
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:59,300
illegal is hundreds and hundreds of US

289
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:00,980
companies have to import it and it's

290
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:03,259
been this weird rule where you can't

291
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,509
grow it but you can buy all of it that

292
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:08,458
you'd like and if these objections are

293
00:11:06,509 --> 00:11:11,039
for the growing plant they had their

294
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:13,708
similarly true or equally true for the

295
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,078
harvested plant but we can import all we

296
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:18,359
want you've been able to buy

297
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,979
I mean hamsas the brand that I always

298
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,310
think of because it's the one my mom's

299
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:26,070
used for 20 years but like the lotions

300
00:11:23,309 --> 00:11:27,659
you should have one of her friends

301
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:29,879
turned her on to the lotion back in like

302
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:31,559
nine I call it candle shop hemp lotion

303
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:33,088
yeah what that makes me think it's just

304
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:36,119
hemp seed oil is one of the ingredients

305
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:38,550
in them in the lotion product but they

306
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,379
have to import all of that from another

307
00:11:38,549 --> 00:11:43,109
country to use in their products here

308
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:44,909
and so what this year's farm bill did is

309
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,889
it finally opened up the market to US

310
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:49,019
farmers so now we can produce our own

311
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,789
hemp which is huge in the fact that

312
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:53,070
nobody spoke up with any of the dumbass

313
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:56,240
objections in the past is I think

314
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:58,769
another big symbol that legalization

315
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,159
moving forward through education is

316
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:03,810
definitely happening absolutely now we

317
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,549
don't have to import a large import

318
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:08,458
product from Canada I feel like that's

319
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:10,229
what it was coming from I mean all over

320
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:11,698
the planet China grows have Canada grows

321
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:13,949
have Japan grows hemp

322
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:17,939
I'm Japan have bright now to clean up

323
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:19,649
Fukushima yeah it's a incredibly

324
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:23,550
versatile plant that's being used all

325
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:26,250
over the world for I mean literally

326
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:28,679
thousands of different uses and we

327
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:30,539
couldn't grow it here I remember when I

328
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,750
was in college and a couple years after

329
00:12:30,539 --> 00:12:35,698
so early 2000s there was this Indian

330
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:39,839
Reservation that I want to say in Texas

331
00:12:35,698 --> 00:12:42,659
and just by fate their location

332
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,089
coincides with an old hemp farm or

333
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:47,159
whatever and so there's just feral hemp

334
00:12:45,089 --> 00:12:49,440
all over this Indian Reservation and

335
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:51,719
every five or ten years the cops would

336
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,060
show up be like you [ __ ] know you're

337
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,709
growing weed get down right and they'd

338
00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:58,679
spend ten days being like it's [ __ ]

339
00:12:55,708 --> 00:13:00,299
feral hemp like come look around no

340
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,479
one's growing it no one's harvesting it

341
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:05,338
[ __ ] off in the local population got so

342
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,649
fed up with these like every five six

343
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,480
years as soon as the cop in charge of

344
00:13:07,649 --> 00:13:12,089
the last raid isn't in charge of the

345
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,490
raids anymore someone sees the field

346
00:13:12,089 --> 00:13:15,689
from the air and freaks out again and so

347
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,039
they started coming up with different

348
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:18,659
uses for it and I think these are the

349
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,209
people that really found it like hemp

350
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,679
Cree in the US

351
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:23,540
and a couple of other things and then

352
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,099
we're building whole houses where

353
00:13:23,539 --> 00:13:27,709
everything except the glass and the

354
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,050
doorknobs and stuff out of the hemp

355
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,990
plant from the concrete to the the

356
00:13:30,049 --> 00:13:35,240
insulation to the the roofing panels

357
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:36,169
were pressed out of something else like

358
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,700
it was intense

359
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:38,870
yeah I've seen the hempcrete blocks and

360
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:40,370
they try to light them on fire and

361
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,019
they're really fire resistant it's

362
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,330
impressive how much heat they take but

363
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,889
uh even after they started all that the

364
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:47,209
feds showed up a handful of times so

365
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:50,120
we're like what's with this big weed

366
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:50,838
field like that's just we can't do

367
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,759
anything about it

368
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:55,010
it's feral right we keep cutting it down

369
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:58,429
it comes back sir but all of that is

370
00:13:55,009 --> 00:14:00,889
over the weird little tidbit of this

371
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:02,899
that I'm looking forward to is the feds

372
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:06,769
have been including feral hemp seizures

373
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:08,570
in their average potency numbers for the

374
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:11,480
entire length of have marijuana

375
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:13,070
prohibition oh because I did not know

376
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,769
that they just don't think anybody knows

377
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,390
that they just don't care it's it's as

378
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:20,149
far as they're concerned it's all

379
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:23,208
cannabis and it's all the same illegal

380
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:24,019
because under the lie was and so they'd

381
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:26,599
seize it

382
00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:29,689
they test it and they throw it away and

383
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,519
by their process of doing it is they

384
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:34,130
just grab all of the plant material and

385
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,569
stuff in a trash bag and then someone

386
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:39,350
takes a handful of material out of that

387
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:42,140
trash bag and they test it is their

388
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:46,220
average potency numbers eaves sticks

389
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:49,220
dirt dirt bird nests oh my okay so

390
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:52,519
they've been hard there just when they

391
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:54,860
went in and really just tried to take

392
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,870
the plant they're still taking from the

393
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,278
root the the top or the base of the

394
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,220
stock right where it meets the root ball

395
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:03,708
up all of that's just a handful that's

396
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,810
going into their testing mix and that's

397
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:07,819
gonna be high THC one of the big

398
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:09,649
anti-pot talking points for a long time

399
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,720
is like modern marijuana is so much

400
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,578
stronger than before and now that helps

401
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,320
not part of those numbers I'm gonna I'm

402
00:15:13,578 --> 00:15:18,019
gonna laugh when the average gets really

403
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,490
hinky over the next couple of years when

404
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:21,110
the data comes out okay

405
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,459
that'll be neat to watch yeah I'm gonna

406
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,870
laugh if there's a huge spike because

407
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,399
the number seems low to me right now

408
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,909
they're they're still reporting it

409
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:27,909
around twelve

410
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,850
is that a nationwide number yep we keep

411
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:36,009
in mind not everybody is in Colorado and

412
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,540
not everybody's got the labs that the

413
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:39,370
legalized states have so if you're in

414
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:40,719
pick a state that's got some legal

415
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,679
cannabis where I can get caught with

416
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,589
some weed and be [ __ ]

417
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,009
Arkansas okay let's say Arkansas imagine

418
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,779
the left

419
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,759
sorry Arkansas imagine the backasswards

420
00:15:46,778 --> 00:15:51,129
live equipment in Arkansas to test for

421
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,539
THC content they're using the same

422
00:15:51,129 --> 00:15:54,850
equipment that they use for the rape

423
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:57,458
kits and stuff so it's decent equipment

424
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,259
it's just how they're testing and what

425
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,759
they're testing and also who's been a

426
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:03,278
part of that for for who's growing in

427
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,159
Arkansas who's the lead grower in Little

428
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,970
Rock units they do all the busts they

429
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,069
got to do their [ __ ] on the down-low

430
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:11,230
they got a sneek again they got to drive

431
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:12,610
one dudes car to the gross store and buy

432
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,110
[ __ ] then drive that car to the house

433
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,639
and pull in the garage and load up the

434
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:17,500
other car and drive that and sneak it

435
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:21,129
all into the dark they're back in that

436
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,289
era so one feral hemp bust serve all

437
00:16:21,129 --> 00:16:26,230
over the country you see we get at least

438
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:28,208
one or two good ones a year where the

439
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,100
rear initial report is like massive

440
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:32,439
marijuana fields found in middle of

441
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:35,620
nowhere and then you know the next day

442
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,990
is cops tear down 10,000 plants 15,000

443
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,730
plants called a sophisticated operation

444
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,620
a week later

445
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:44,440
turns out it's a feral hemp spend there

446
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,389
for 30 years it was just particularly

447
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,070
wet this spring and so the it got out of

448
00:16:46,389 --> 00:16:49,838
hand more seeds germinate someone

449
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,430
noticed and yeah

450
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,380
it happens I mean it's happened in the

451
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,088
same spot access like 10 times since

452
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:55,899
I've been an adult it was a pretty

453
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:58,300
common occurrence

454
00:16:55,899 --> 00:17:00,159
ooh that'll be fun watching all this

455
00:16:58,299 --> 00:17:02,588
change and it'll be fun seeing the the

456
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,539
first hemp fields go up and then seeing

457
00:17:02,589 --> 00:17:06,850
the high school kids get busted thinking

458
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:08,470
that the signs that everywhere is saying

459
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:09,789
this is HAP you can't get stone from it

460
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:11,980
please don't break in and kill our

461
00:17:09,789 --> 00:17:13,928
plants people are still gonna hop that

462
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,419
fence come in cut a plant down and run

463
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:19,540
away get pulled over you know a mile

464
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:20,860
later feel stupid have a big ol stinky

465
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,328
stinky plant in their car that's not

466
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:26,500
worth a [ __ ] yep unless you're trying to

467
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:27,609
make a necklace yep but I'm really glad

468
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,440
this past there's been a lot of

469
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,089
foolishness kind of in our community

470
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,970
about this piece of the farm bill

471
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:36,339
there's a lot of I didn't read it and

472
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:40,799
I'm assuming and I had bad information

473
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:43,349
before this happened and now I'm angry

474
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,109
that put too fine a point on it if that

475
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:49,589
sounded like I was talking about you mm

476
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:53,429
Jake your social media I'm staying

477
00:17:49,589 --> 00:17:55,500
silent over there it's uh a lot of

478
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:59,070
people were hoping that this would mean

479
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,680
all CBD products were a hundred percent

480
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:06,200
legal for all uses and all marketing

481
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:09,029
ploys and that's just an insane idea

482
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:11,009
that's not how this works that's how any

483
00:18:09,029 --> 00:18:15,990
of this work is they said hemp not CBD

484
00:18:11,009 --> 00:18:19,559
um this is a huge move for textiles for

485
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:21,870
seed production for paper production I

486
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:25,440
mean you can make anything that we make

487
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:27,529
currently from trees oil or cotton you

488
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,640
can make with the hemp plant and that's

489
00:18:27,529 --> 00:18:31,859
thousands of thousands and thousands of

490
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,480
things like most of the equipment we're

491
00:18:31,859 --> 00:18:36,659
using to make this show comes from some

492
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,400
of those like all our clothes everything

493
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,769
for a table we're sitting at yeah

494
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,240
drywall behind us

495
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:44,910
the gasoline and the cars where I used

496
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,099
strawberry or like all of it we can make

497
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:51,170
with him and so all of that's on the

498
00:18:47,099 --> 00:18:53,490
table for production now but CBD and THC

499
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,400
especially if they're marketed with any

500
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:58,769
sort of health effect at all is covered

501
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,480
by the FDA just like they would be if

502
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:03,059
they were any sort of other plant

503
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,589
compound if you market something in the

504
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,629
US with any sort of health claim

505
00:19:04,589 --> 00:19:09,419
whatsoever whether it's a mood

506
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,040
stabilizer helps with anxiety depression

507
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,300
doesn't matter what it's helping with if

508
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,509
it's supposed to help with anything but

509
00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:17,639
[ __ ] I'm hungry it's got to go through a

510
00:19:15,509 --> 00:19:21,210
special set FDA approvals so is

511
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,920
basically the difference on that um say

512
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,420
this is the pad let's grab a product I'm

513
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,220
just grabbing a thing that's on my table

514
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:29,039
so that I have an example this label

515
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:33,480
right here is not a food product so what

516
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:35,849
was I trying to say if I put aa sooths

517
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:37,829
hand pain suddenly I have to have an FDA

518
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:40,889
thing but if I'm the back I just put the

519
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:42,539
word CBD in my ingredients if it just

520
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,340
has CBD in the ingredients I don't have

521
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:46,619
to have an FDA stamp but as soon as I

522
00:19:44,339 --> 00:19:51,029
make a claim is that what I have to add

523
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:53,429
that stamp the F at FDA is food and so

524
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:59,160
they also oversee [ __ ] like cucumber

525
00:19:53,430 --> 00:20:01,320
lettuce tomatoes popsicles and so if you

526
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,090
have a CBD food item that you would like

527
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:08,399
to make in Colorado and sell in

528
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:10,470
Washington and say was a gummy that had

529
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,570
CBD in it and as long as you weren't

530
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,180
like hyper marketing it you would

531
00:20:12,569 --> 00:20:17,220
probably just have to go through the

532
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,590
food approvals okay

533
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,509
um because at that point it's just an

534
00:20:19,589 --> 00:20:24,569
ingredient like sugar or high fructose

535
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:26,879
corn syrup and red dye 907 yeah however

536
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:29,279
as soon as you slap it on the front of

537
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,550
the package and call it like these are

538
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:35,759
CBD gummies the FDA is probably gonna be

539
00:20:32,549 --> 00:20:38,849
want to know like is that a flavor it's

540
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:41,039
not a flavor all right what is it it as

541
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:42,689
soon as that person being asked that

542
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:45,119
question starts talking they're gonna

543
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,700
end up like or let they're gonna likely

544
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,109
end up in a place where that would have

545
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,970
to go through the drug approvals as well

546
00:20:49,109 --> 00:20:53,609
right and if you go to a health food

547
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:56,250
store all of those herbal supplements

548
00:20:53,609 --> 00:20:57,659
have been through most of this or all of

549
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:59,039
it depending on what they're claimed

550
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,110
they get the little purple star and they

551
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,609
say FDA approved yep talking about a

552
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:03,719
very specific brand because I worked at

553
00:21:02,609 --> 00:21:07,729
a health food store for quite a while

554
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,170
FDA approved doesn't mean it's a good

555
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:13,049
effective treatment for whatever it just

556
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,509
means they there's enough evidence to

557
00:21:13,049 --> 00:21:18,480
say that that claim is probably true and

558
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:20,339
that it's also not bad for you like it's

559
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,559
not gonna kill you not indicated yeah

560
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:23,849
like you if it's got sesame seeds in it

561
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,109
and you're allergic to sesame seeds

562
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:29,339
that's not what we're talking about here

563
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:32,579
but in our nation's history we had a

564
00:21:29,339 --> 00:21:34,829
huge problem with fake medicines being

565
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:37,199
marketed and this is an answer to that

566
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:40,409
and there are a lot of people in our

567
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,230
community that were outraged when the

568
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:45,390
farm bill passed almost immediately

569
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:47,849
after like the FDA knew this was coming

570
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,620
they know that these issues are a cop a

571
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:53,099
hot topic of conversation so they

572
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:54,929
released a memo or I don't remember what

573
00:21:53,099 --> 00:21:56,969
they called it I'm missive to the public

574
00:21:54,930 --> 00:22:00,890
right after the farm bill with signs

575
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:03,289
saying this is awesome but calm down

576
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,280
this doesn't apply to THC and CBD

577
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:06,990
anything marketed

578
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,889
with those two specifically because

579
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:13,349
they've been marked as FDA compounds and

580
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:16,320
further anything that claims to be a

581
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:17,909
health food item that gets marketed in

582
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,490
the US has to go through our approval

583
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,019
process and that still applies to all

584
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,539
these CBD stuff that's hitting the

585
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:26,789
market right now and the FDA's been

586
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:29,849
working for a couple of years now to

587
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:32,639
rein in the CBD health market because a

588
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:34,379
lot of it's just random nonsense claims

589
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,850
that have no support I did an episode

590
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:38,280
called something fishy

591
00:22:35,849 --> 00:22:41,519
it's about funky CBD products they've

592
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,950
found products on the market that claim

593
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:45,000
to have one thing that and they can't

594
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,460
find it or they find it in different

595
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,680
amounts right it says 100 milligrams of

596
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,920
CBD they find not a hundred milligrams

597
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,330
sometimes they find none at all

598
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,670
sometimes they find compounds that

599
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:59,879
aren't on the label I was reading this

600
00:22:56,670 --> 00:23:03,240
it was a crazy report that came out with

601
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,390
the farm bill we're right around the

602
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:08,099
same time about a CBD bust where they

603
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:11,009
went and bought up a whole bunch of the

604
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:12,629
vape cartridges and they ordered some

605
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:14,730
online and they bought some from local

606
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,920
vendors and one of the products that

607
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,140
kept turning up is one of the same ones

608
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,480
that they put in spice and k2

609
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:23,970
oh [ __ ] and that herbal crap you buy

610
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,789
that's fake marijuana yeah that won't

611
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,650
hit pop or pop hot on a drug test but

612
00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:30,480
it's a synthesized compound that's

613
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:33,509
coming out of find some secret lab in

614
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,710
China or somewhere that's very similar

615
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:39,059
to Delta 9 THC but won't come up in a

616
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:41,970
standard drug strain and they're finding

617
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:44,369
it in CB pure CBD vape pen cartridges

618
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:45,690
and [ __ ] in places like Alabama Wow

619
00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:49,049
because the market is really

620
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:51,539
unscrupulous like that's what the FDA is

621
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:53,730
there for like when you buy something

622
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:55,589
with that stamp that says FDA approved

623
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:59,640
that company's been inspected they're

624
00:23:55,589 --> 00:24:03,240
regulated they follow rules surprise

625
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,120
inspections product testing like

626
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,069
rigorous [ __ ] product testing all of

627
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,509
it so that it they know that when

628
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:13,439
millions of these go out on the public

629
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:15,539
there's not gonna be a crazy scare it's

630
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,840
like it's not I don't know there's so

631
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,668
many

632
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:19,470
want to cut our community that freaked

633
00:24:17,669 --> 00:24:21,659
out about this like oh my god look what

634
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,150
you did now that the FDA is gonna take

635
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:26,640
away CBD now the cannabis industry is

636
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,470
the biggest conspiracy theorist like as

637
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,330
soon as one thing happens they start

638
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,850
projecting seven thoughts into the

639
00:24:30,329 --> 00:24:34,918
future that mean to just you you

640
00:24:32,849 --> 00:24:36,449
remember the old hippie cliche to sit

641
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,220
around and smoke a joint freaked out

642
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:40,048
about the government man that's what

643
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,640
they [ __ ] do for real in our industry

644
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:46,288
a lot a little bit too much yeah it's

645
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,259
it's not necessarily our fault it it

646
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:51,179
comes from an honest place I think for a

647
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,398
long time in our history if you stood up

648
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:55,860
and were Pro cannabis you were risking a

649
00:24:53,398 --> 00:24:58,259
lot and so the only people that stood up

650
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:00,898
had nothing to lose and the people with

651
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:03,808
nothing to lose usually like they never

652
00:25:00,898 --> 00:25:05,369
had anything to lose and that's why they

653
00:25:03,808 --> 00:25:08,250
have nothing to lose now and that's not

654
00:25:05,369 --> 00:25:10,379
necessarily the best spokesman and that

655
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,298
didn't help us at all and in our fringe

656
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,760
in black market

657
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:16,798
like conspiracy theories have always

658
00:25:14,759 --> 00:25:18,359
been part of the community make sense

659
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,250
the good old days it's something about

660
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,648
that type of person the black market

661
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,329
grower the recluse we're all like super

662
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:25,589
extra paranoid you got a stand and peek

663
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:27,869
out the windows and then your only

664
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:29,428
friend is the internet YouTube starts

665
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:31,109
telling you that everyone's watching you

666
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:34,680
and then the Illuminati wants to steal

667
00:25:31,109 --> 00:25:35,808
your bacon right it starts getting weird

668
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:38,250
[Laughter]

669
00:25:35,808 --> 00:25:40,710
so that's the farm bill everybody if you

670
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:42,599
have questions about the farm bill other

671
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:45,419
provisions if you want me to elaborate

672
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,459
more about what it means for textile

673
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,020
production or what other stuff you can

674
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,069
make them have like you can google most

675
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:52,889
of that [ __ ] but if you want a tweeted

676
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:55,288
me it's at nema 1-15 Nemo Punk 15 on the

677
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:56,640
tweeter or also what about pueblos for

678
00:25:55,288 --> 00:25:58,619
sensible cannabis laws if you do that

679
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,210
you have lawful assent I find me on

680
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:02,000
Facebook at pueblos for sensible

681
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:04,710
cannabis laws as well there you go

682
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,089
email me might have to search for that

683
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,590
one a little harder if you're not

684
00:26:06,089 --> 00:26:10,109
already familiar with the Facebook page

685
00:26:07,589 --> 00:26:11,339
are they blocking the cannabis pages the

686
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:14,339
Facebook's been doing that for months

687
00:26:11,339 --> 00:26:17,418
now okay go search for you haha maybe

688
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:20,788
six eight months ago Facebook decided to

689
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:23,038
make it much harder to find anything

690
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,690
cannabis related which made me laugh my

691
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,148
ass off because both sides of the

692
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,009
conversation tend to use the words

693
00:26:27,148 --> 00:26:32,099
cannabis or marijuana Oh

694
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:34,289
names and so all of the anti-pot in

695
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:37,169
cannabis pages vanished just as

696
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:38,609
thoroughly as all of the pro hahaha it

697
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:40,590
makes me laugh yeah

698
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:45,719
well it's got a play fair got a play

699
00:26:40,589 --> 00:26:48,289
fair so with this um farm bill do you

700
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:51,420
see in the future that hemp will be

701
00:26:48,289 --> 00:26:53,460
tested in the same manner as cannabis

702
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,680
not just for cannabinoid content to

703
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,690
ensure that it is not hot as the word we

704
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:59,310
use for th see if it's got too much THC

705
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,920
we call it hot it's got to be destroyed

706
00:26:59,309 --> 00:27:03,690
or reallocated for different purposes or

707
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,460
it can be constant ran into a

708
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,320
concentrate and in that concentrate can

709
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,420
be separated I'm gonna be separated yeah

710
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:10,829
something I learned recently um do you

711
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:12,840
feel that they will be doing pesticide

712
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:15,689
testing um

713
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:20,759
they're gonna do so it depends with the

714
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:23,190
crops being produced for right Wow it's

715
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:27,390
gonna go through very separate testing

716
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:29,340
so when you buy hold hemp seed at the

717
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,680
health food store which you've been able

718
00:27:29,339 --> 00:27:33,869
to do for decades it goes through the

719
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:36,330
same food testing as the sunflower seeds

720
00:27:33,869 --> 00:27:38,479
at the gas station okay alright so

721
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:42,269
there's no Michael butanol in those

722
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,009
[ __ ] shouldn't be the same things with

723
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:46,529
the textiles like if you buy a hem

724
00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:48,539
t-shirt at the mall or it online or

725
00:27:46,529 --> 00:27:49,680
whatever it should have got all the

726
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:51,089
material that went into that should have

727
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,009
gone through the same testing is the

728
00:27:51,089 --> 00:27:54,720
cotton shirt or the polyester shirt that

729
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:56,160
you bought to so that will in the future

730
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,710
all of the hemp will have to be tested

731
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,210
for pesticides it's currently not to my

732
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,590
best understanding like if we went out

733
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:04,140
to one of the local hemp farms they

734
00:28:01,589 --> 00:28:06,059
don't have to they do have to adhere to

735
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,130
Department of Agriculture pesticide

736
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:11,460
rules and laws but after that there's no

737
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:12,960
testing for pesticide presence or mold

738
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,759
and mildew 'he's like we also test for

739
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,319
in the industry they don't test for any

740
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,180
of that stuff so i I look forward to

741
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:22,259
when they have to test for that sorry

742
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,700
you guys worse multiple product well

743
00:28:22,259 --> 00:28:25,019
we're gonna be eating a lot of stuff we

744
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,690
we mentioned earlier goes into gummy

745
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:29,190
bears but if it goes into a salve or I I

746
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:30,330
have family members I don't to call

747
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:31,860
anybody I don't get anybody in any

748
00:28:30,329 --> 00:28:33,509
trouble I have a family member who has

749
00:28:31,859 --> 00:28:35,250
very bad arthritis and they use a lotion

750
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:38,160
quite frequently I don't want them

751
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:41,420
rubbing [ __ ] floral my lotion for

752
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,490
skin they're getting all underneath that

753
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:45,440
that should go through all the same

754
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:48,009
testing that that everything else goes

755
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,470
through one of the the big upsides to

756
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:54,109
federal legalization um that we just got

757
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:56,360
with HAMP is we already solved all these

758
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:58,279
[ __ ] problems for ninety percent of

759
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,750
what we deal with every day like you

760
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,639
don't have these worries when you buy a

761
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:03,440
shirt or a hat or shoes online

762
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,230
you never think was are these socks

763
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,789
treated with pesticides nope like I make

764
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:09,890
a point to wash new clothes when they

765
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:12,019
come into my house but that's more like

766
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:13,790
a paranoia thing because there's like

767
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:16,549
three episodes of shows I watched as a

768
00:29:13,789 --> 00:29:18,409
kid where the plotline was like kid gets

769
00:29:16,549 --> 00:29:21,129
sick from genes that didn't get washed

770
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:24,680
we've already solved all these protect

771
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:26,300
her food safety for clothing and textile

772
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,370
safety all these rules are already in

773
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:30,379
place for a thousand other products we

774
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:33,019
just weren't allowed to use that

775
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,270
infrastructure for him right

776
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:37,869
because hemp was federally illegal it

777
00:29:35,269 --> 00:29:42,920
was a Schedule one substance just like

778
00:29:37,869 --> 00:29:45,009
cannabis the the farm bill actually

779
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,210
removed him from Schedule one and

780
00:29:45,009 --> 00:29:49,940
changed the official wording of our

781
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,410
federal drug statutes and I mean that's

782
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,779
what I mean when I say that it's weird

783
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:55,610
that the DEA

784
00:29:52,779 --> 00:29:58,129
and the drug czars office and all of

785
00:29:55,609 --> 00:30:00,829
that federal machinery didn't have

786
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,900
fuck-all to say about this when they

787
00:30:00,829 --> 00:30:04,669
were quiet about it is this was leading

788
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,460
up to is it gonna get put in the farm

789
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:09,620
bill oh it's in is it gonna get passed

790
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,600
by the Senate is gonna get passed by the

791
00:30:09,619 --> 00:30:13,939
house okay well is the president gonna

792
00:30:11,599 --> 00:30:15,679
sign it all of that they were quiet and

793
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,380
people like me they've been following us

794
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,910
for 20 years we're like well where's the

795
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,560
normal course at [ __ ]

796
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:25,190
yeah and they just weren't there it was

797
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,210
just really kind of big news did once

798
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,279
again I'm going back to the devil's

799
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,870
advocate was that the right hand going

800
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:31,009
like this over the left hand he come

801
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,329
over here and pull some [ __ ] while we

802
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:33,410
were going look at the farm bill thing

803
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:35,059
look at the farm bill thing and they're

804
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:37,610
over here just [ __ ] not really hasn't

805
00:30:35,059 --> 00:30:40,250
merchandise out the back door it wasn't

806
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:42,979
like when they're doing something for a

807
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,960
distraction they shout about it and they

808
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,329
just Marshall there's some waving

809
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:49,220
there's some blood

810
00:30:46,329 --> 00:30:51,379
something yeah and with this there was

811
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,630
just like hey you know we've got

812
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,860
bipartisan support for a farm bill isn't

813
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,750
that nice

814
00:30:54,859 --> 00:30:58,369
and everybody was like yeah but what

815
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,808
about they were like no that's cool

816
00:30:58,369 --> 00:31:03,319
we're just doing this real quick it's

817
00:30:59,808 --> 00:31:05,058
done and at the end of the day we Pro

818
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:08,359
cannabis news outlets and a couple

819
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:11,089
others like yay how's legal and the FDA

820
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:12,439
was like yeah but CBD and THC are under

821
00:31:11,089 --> 00:31:14,269
the same rules that are applied as

822
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:17,450
always and that was pretty much it

823
00:31:14,269 --> 00:31:19,099
outside of the cannabis community like

824
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,929
even the people like dr. Bronner's

825
00:31:19,099 --> 00:31:22,278
weren't like and I was gonna bring up

826
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,750
dr. Bronner's I wanted to make a joke

827
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:26,690
really is anybody heard from dr. Bronner

828
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:28,250
yeah the stinky past so it's company I

829
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:30,230
kind of expected someone from his

830
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,339
company or from a similar industry to be

831
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,409
like you know we're really thrilled

832
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:35,839

833
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:38,659

00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:41,629
Bronner's soap every single day I own a

835
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:45,289
number of have clothing items that I've

836
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:47,929
had free years because they they just

837
00:31:45,288 --> 00:31:50,419
last longer you pay a little more but it

838
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:52,460
never wears out ever yeah that is the

839
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:53,630
truth yeah good him quality I'm looking

840
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,700
to see what I'm wearing now there's no

841
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:57,769
hemp on me oh my socks maybe him I'm not

842
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:59,058
sure though I've known countless people

843
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:00,620
that were to that dr. Bronner's so

844
00:31:59,058 --> 00:32:02,720
that's one of the things that made me

845
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:05,839
laugh is shadow I said the dreadlock

846
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,360
crew the anti pop crowd kind of freaked

847
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,579
out with this now like you know I'm sure

848
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:13,519
this is just backdoor legalization again

849
00:32:10,579 --> 00:32:15,138
and you know the farm bills bad and look

850
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,058
at this hemp product I found at Target

851
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:19,668
the other day and it was it was actually

852
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:22,519
the house brand and I just laughed so

853
00:32:19,669 --> 00:32:25,100
hard and I'm like wait you're half the

854
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:27,470
age of my mom she's been using that

855
00:32:25,099 --> 00:32:29,658
lotion all time you've been alive and

856
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:31,308
you think this has something to do with

857
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:32,870
the farm bill that goes into effect in

858
00:32:31,308 --> 00:32:35,028
January for his name and Jenny refers to

859
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,678
a lady like they're just so [ __ ]

860
00:32:35,028 --> 00:32:37,940
stupid yeah well once you're against

861
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:39,380
something you're against it much you're

862
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,778
programmed you're programmed and unless

863
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:44,330
you get reprogrammed or unprogrammed you

864
00:32:41,778 --> 00:32:48,589
might be stuck that's true for most

865
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:50,538
topics but like at this point anyone who

866
00:32:48,589 --> 00:32:54,019
cares enough to have an opinion either

867
00:32:50,538 --> 00:32:56,509
way is checked on it a little bit in the

868
00:32:54,019 --> 00:32:59,929
only people left in the hardcore anti

869
00:32:56,509 --> 00:33:02,599
camp are either a long time ago they

870
00:32:59,929 --> 00:33:04,190
committed to a life of talking bad about

871
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:07,418
pie and getting paid for it

872
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:07,419
and that's their thing

873
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:11,740
if they go outside of that at all they

874
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,900
have to come up with a whole new

875
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,849
everything a lot of those people have

876
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:17,860
that story of how I sound like an

877
00:33:15,849 --> 00:33:20,199
[ __ ] right now how one of their

878
00:33:17,859 --> 00:33:22,059
friends drank 17 beers at a party and

879
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:23,289
smoked a joint and then left and got in

880
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:26,799
a wreck and killed themselves and they

881
00:33:23,289 --> 00:33:29,109
blame cannabis yeah that's a bunch of

882
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,759
them the big one Kevin Sabet just he

883
00:33:29,109 --> 00:33:32,379
figured out when he was in college that

884
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:34,809
he could get people to give him money

885
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,940
for being the guy that wears a suit it

886
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:39,730
is like I'm kind of likable in

887
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,799
marijuana's terrible I mean he's he's

888
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:43,420
made her up this is a good life it's a

889
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:45,669
basic good description of that guy - I

890
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:47,769
wear a suit and kind of likeable he's

891
00:33:45,670 --> 00:33:50,019
worked for three presidents two or three

892
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:53,170
presidents I think he might have worked

893
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:55,329
two administration's for Bush and then

894
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:57,580
one for Obama I think this is his claim

895
00:33:55,329 --> 00:34:00,250
to fame but he might have been Clinton

896
00:33:57,579 --> 00:34:01,839
Bush Obama I'm not sure but he worked

897
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:05,230
for the drug czars office for a while

898
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,639
and now he's got a company where people

899
00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:08,889
just give him money that they worked

900
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:12,360
hard for so that he can continue to go

901
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:15,940
around the country in bash legal weed

902
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:18,010
it's kind of nuts in here about five

903
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,079
years ago made a point to stop taking

904
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:21,910
donations from these peoples companies

905
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,549
that like drug test or run rehabs and

906
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:27,159
stuff and he only takes checks from the

907
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:28,480
person themselves and so like if Jeff

908
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:30,009
you were to send me a check in this

909
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,230
manner you wouldn't send it from Ira

910
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,990
genetics Colorado you would send it from

911
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:37,329
Jeff really and so that way I could be

912
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:39,569
like I only take donations from private

913
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:42,789
citizens I don't take corporate money

914
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,710
that's wack but it's a cute little place

915
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:46,869
yeah I don't know where this change came

916
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,980
from but enjoy that tidbit folks there

917
00:34:46,869 --> 00:34:49,480
you go that's a great way to start

918
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:52,030
segwaying since I'm getting my cadaver

919

922
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:01,690

wait through this [ __ ] on their own and

927
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:16,059
make sense of it like it's designed to

928
00:35:14,139 --> 00:35:17,739
be really complicated and kind of hard

929
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:19,059
to understand yeah I just tried to kill

930

Mike what the day I was gonna give him

931
