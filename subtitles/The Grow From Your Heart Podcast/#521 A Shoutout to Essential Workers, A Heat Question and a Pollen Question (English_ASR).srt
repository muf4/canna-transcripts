dot-com you know i like to start the

21
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,988
podcast off by talking about what I'm

22
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:54,090
dabbing I just took a ridiculous dab of

23
00:00:51,988 --> 00:00:56,250
star dog batter from our friends at

24
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:01,050
apothecary farms on the label it says

25
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:03,359
the product contains 63.2% THC and 74%

26
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:05,459
total cannabinoids I'm having a hard

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,228
time keeping my eyes open wide enough to

28
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:09,390
read the label because the dab I just

29
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:12,299
took was ridiculous I'm gonna crack open

30
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,280
the jar and give it a fresh smell I love

31
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:16,618
star dog I've always been a big fan of

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,329
star dog this batter came out

33
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,489
beautifully the first thing I noticed is

34
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,859
when I crack it open it is a beautiful

35
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,140
golden yellow color it looks like a nice

36
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:26,819
piece of golden yellow cheesecake batter

37
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,549
it is delicious looking this is

38
00:01:26,819 --> 00:01:31,919
beautiful batter then this aroma hits me

39
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:34,170
in the face there's a spicy watermelon

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,030
gassy strawberry sort of a thing that

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,540
punches me right in the face I really

42
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,549
love it

43
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,610
then I took a dab of it and it made me

44
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,500
stoned as [ __ ] I am stoned I'm high I'm

45
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:45,149
sitting down in the chair bro Melo I'm

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,519
kind of hunched over and my eyes are

47
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:50,129
definitely squinty and bright red so I

48
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,408
am impressed and heavily medicated off

49
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:54,989
of the star dog batter from our friends

50
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:56,520
at apothecary farms big shout-out to all

51
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:58,859
of my friends over there at apothecary

52
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:00,509
farms while I'm doing shoutouts let's

53
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,539
send a shout-out to everybody who is

54
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:05,909
working for or at a dispensary right now

55
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,829
in the state of Colorado and I think in

56
00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:10,289
most states which offer medical and/or

57
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:11,969
recreational cannabis medical and rec

58
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,349
cannabis have been deemed essential

59
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:15,180
businesses during the

60
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:17,609
quarantine during the lockdown time of

61
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,960
the kovat 19 virus so big shout-out to

62
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,910
all of my friends working in the

63
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,950
industry risking their health risking

64
00:02:20,909 --> 00:02:25,020
their lives to be out there to keep us

65
00:02:22,949 --> 00:02:27,329
supplied with medicine we do appreciate

66
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:29,340
you all so big shout out to everybody

67
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,440
who is working to keep the world moving

68
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,509
while most of us are hiding in our safe

69
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,039
homes to keep ourselves safe and healthy

70
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:36,870
thank you I know you're out there

71
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,340
working your ass off you're wearing

72
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,439
extra personal protective equipment

73
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,479
you're probably wearing a mask you're

74
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:44,159
probably scared shitless you probably

75
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,479
have to come home and do extra [ __ ] at

76
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,069
the end of the day just to make sure not

77
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,319
to contaminate your friends your family

78
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:50,549
your home probably your children who

79
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:52,560
knows what kind of environment you're

80
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:55,560
coming home to potentially bringing home

81
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,909
danger so I appreciate you thank you

82
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,800
there are a lot of extra steps that

83
00:02:56,909 --> 00:03:01,949
people have to take today it is not

84
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360
going unnoticed by me I see it thank you

85
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,949
I know it's hard to deal with some [ __ ]

86
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,840
right now so if you're taking extra

87
00:03:04,949 --> 00:03:08,339
precautions if you have to go to work if

88
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,560
you work in the grocery stores the

89
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:12,629
dispensaries the post office if you're

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,370
delivering things right now if you're I

91
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,139
got a grocery delivery today and it was

92
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,330
perfect the grocery shopper did a damn

93
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,279
good job thank you all of those people

94
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:22,440
that are doing those types of jobs and I

95
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,060
can't remember everybody I just told you

96
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:25,500
I took a giant dab if you're doing

97
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:27,210
something out there putting yourself at

98
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,199
risk and I didn't mention you I include

99
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,270
you in that thank you

100
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:32,339
I need you we all need you you are

101
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,870
keeping the world moving the rest of you

102
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,969
if you don't have to go out there keep

103
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:38,340
your ass at home let's try to minimize

104
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:40,530
social activity social interaction let's

105
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,719
minimize the movement and spread of this

106
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,580
virus hopefully soon we can all get back

107
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,500
to our normal activities but the only

108
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,290
way I feel that that is going to work is

109
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,300
if we just stop spreading it or we all

110
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:53,099
have to get it and just get it as a

111
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:55,170
normal virus a normal thing that our

112
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,870
bodies adapt to which will probably have

113
00:03:55,169 --> 00:03:59,129
a huge outcome that'll have a what's the

114
00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:00,780
word I'm looking for an aftermath will

115
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,009
fall out as the word I'm looking for I

116
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,689
don't want to deal with that

117
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:06,479
I would rather everybody go inside and

118
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:08,219
stop following this virus let's hang out

119
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,389
all right enough ranting about this

120
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:11,099
virus I know we've all heard enough

121
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,079
about that I want to thank everybody

122
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,969
who's putting themselves at risk out

123
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,650
there especially all of the medical

124
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:18,509
professionals who are working extra

125
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:19,979
shifts who are having to witness and

126
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,959
deal with all of this stuff thank you

127
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,530
guys I do notice it and I do appreciate

128
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,659
it

129
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:26,609
now one positive thing I have noticed

130
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,180
during this quarantine or this lockdown

131
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,860
peer

132
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,228
this isolation time whatever you want to

133
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:34,110
call it what I have noticed is that many

134
00:04:31,228 --> 00:04:37,050
content creators podcasters YouTube

135
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:39,300
video makers instagramers so many people

136
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:41,610
have been making so much more great

137
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,650
quality content being cooped up has

138
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:44,970
inspired people to put out ideas that

139
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:46,500
have probably been in the back of their

140
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,880
heads for a while they haven't had the

141
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,620
time or the energy to do it

142
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:51,060
now people are cooped up they can't go

143
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,918
to work they can't go to the park they

144
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,089
can't go to the gym people are freaking

145
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:56,339
out without going to the gym that is

146
00:04:54,089 --> 00:04:58,379
many people's biggest outlet we can't go

147
00:04:56,339 --> 00:05:01,138
we closed those immediately so there are

148
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:03,629
so many great YouTube and Instagram

149
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,939
videos and Instagram lives so many

150
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:07,918
musicians and other artists are going

151
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,139
live and doing their craft alive so that

152
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,788
we can participate and watch I think

153
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,038
that is a great thing to see in this

154
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:15,629
sort of a lockdown period all the

155
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:17,909
creative people all of the content

156
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:19,288
creators we are still creating content

157
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,090
we've still got all this creative energy

158
00:05:19,288 --> 00:05:22,500
and it's gonna come out we're gonna be

159
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:24,810
cooped up you're gonna see our energy

160
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,860
come out in different creative ways so

161
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,079
that's gonna be one of the silver

162
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,610
linings through this weirdness so I just

163
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:31,589
try to find the positive that's one

164
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,419
great thing that I have seen a lot of

165
00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:36,029

217
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:45,579
this it says Rasta Jeff I appreciate

218
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:48,879
what you've been telling your listeners

219
00:07:45,579 --> 00:07:51,550
about being safe with the CB 19 virus

220
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,478
serious respiratory infections are

221
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,629
dangerous I contracted h1n1 11 years ago

222
00:07:55,478 --> 00:08:00,968
and I thought I would die I was off work

223
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:04,389
for a month I am being particularly

224
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:07,300
cautious since I am now a senior and in

225
00:08:04,389 --> 00:08:09,610
the danger zone yes I've been trying to

226
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,860
warn my audience to take this very

227
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:13,810
seriously many people are taking it as a

228
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,430
joke many people are not taking the

229
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:17,889
appropriate precautions and they're

230
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:19,718
putting other people at danger such as

231
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:22,538
yourself somebody who has already

232
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:24,459
suffered a major respiratory disease

233
00:08:22,538 --> 00:08:26,889
somebody who's already faced death and

234
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:29,168
now somebody who is a senior who is in

235
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:30,968
the danger zone and is well aware of it

236
00:08:29,168 --> 00:08:33,158
that has got to be scary to look outside

237
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:35,500
and see [ __ ] running around putting

238
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,299
you in danger that must put fear in you

239
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,908
there's also something very interesting

240
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:42,848
I took in this email I did not realize I

241
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:44,588
had a large senior audience I've gotten

242
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,300
several messages recently from people

243
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,040
telling me that they're older than me or

244
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:49,838
that they're seniors and they appreciate

245
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,509
the show it is great knowing that I am

246
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,580
helping out a broader audience I am more

247
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:56,500
broad audience than which I realized so

248
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:58,570
thank you for adding that little detail

249
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,129
into there that does help me out there

250
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:02,320
is a lot more to the message it says I

251
00:09:00,129 --> 00:09:03,490
am attaching some photos of my golden

252
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,740
goat so our friend here is growing

253
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,539
golden goat it says I picked golden goat

254
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:08,950
because I live in Topeka and if you've

255
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:11,259
listened to the story of golden goat

256
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,509
golden goat came from Topeka from a guy

257
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:14,919
named mr. dank that is a great story so

258
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:17,139
I'm glad you're growing the golden goat

259
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:18,639
there in Topeka I talks a little bit

260
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,708
about the photos they sent me we don't

261
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,240
need to discuss too much of that then it

262
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:24,159
says we're planning a vacation to the

263
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,500
Buena Vista area yeah I'm sure that

264
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,088
vacation may get delayed or adjusted

265
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,919
keep in touch we may be able to meet up

266
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:32,440
they do ask if we can hang out during

267
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,208
that trip yes if beings come together we

268
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,459
may be able to hang out let's not make

269
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:39,009
any arrangements that far with all this

270
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:40,778
chaos then it goes on to say in case you

271
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:43,569
were looking for show topics I'm

272
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:46,208
wondering about budget growing in a hot

273
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,760
room while I have a pretty good AC set

274
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:51,099
up I can't add AC beyond the central air

275
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,519
because the window unit will light leak

276
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,560
and the free-standing AC may be beyond

277
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,419
my budget this summer so that's a very

278
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:00,009
good question they wrap up the email

279
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:02,199
with will keep up the good work and an

280
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:05,049
update on your Mac project would be nice

281
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,450
then they wrap up the email with used to

282
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:09,129
be cool big shout-out to my friend used

283
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,020
to be cool I see your name pop up quite

284
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:12,909
a bit I did not realize you were a

285
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:15,699
senior and I definitely did not know you

286
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:17,409
survived the h1n1 virus I'm glad you

287
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:19,600
made it through that hey thank you for

288
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:21,399
the great message and I'm glad that

289
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,769
somebody out there appreciated my

290
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,600
episode on the corona virus I got a

291
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,578
couple of messages telling me to stop

292
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,560
spreading fear and hype and stuff like

293
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:31,269
that I tried to ignore it because I knew

294
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:33,278
that I could stand behind the episode

295
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:35,350
that I put out so thank you for the

296
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,269
support and the feedback on that part of

297
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,310
the email now let's move on to the

298
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,500
question you've got a grow space and

299
00:10:39,309 --> 00:10:43,599
it's getting too hot and you cannot add

300
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,698
a window air conditioner because it will

301
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,949
possibly give you light leaks also I

302
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:50,259
find they are very good opportunities

303
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:51,969
for a thief all you have to do push or

304
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:53,708
pull that air conditioner now you've got

305
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:55,329
an open window going in get what you

306
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:57,309
need you've got an end you've got an out

307
00:10:55,328 --> 00:10:59,139
doesn't take very long it happens way

308
00:10:57,309 --> 00:11:01,389
too often those air conditioners are

309
00:10:59,139 --> 00:11:03,100
dangerous my first recommendation was

310
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,019
going to be one of the portable air

311
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,540
conditioners that has the hoses for an

312
00:11:05,019 --> 00:11:08,439
in and an out they are very useful they

313
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,240
are not super

314
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,070
efficient on electricity and they are

315
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,529
expensive but it says in here a

316
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:17,260
free-standing AC may be out of my budget

317
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:20,350
this summer so if we do not have the

318
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:23,110
option to create cooler air the only

319
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:25,960
option is to remove that hotter air and

320
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,480
hopefully replace it with cooler and B

321
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,850
an air from your main air conditioner in

322
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,009
your house it won't help to add more

323
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,930
fans it won't help to just blow that

324
00:11:33,009 --> 00:11:37,659
heat around you're going to actually

325
00:11:34,929 --> 00:11:40,839
need to remove the heat or add colder

326
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:42,909
air hopefully we can do both in one move

327
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,610
what I would recommend is getting a

328
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:48,250
carbon filter and a blower either a four

329
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:49,810
or a six inch inline fan hook up the

330
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,850
carbon filter to where the air is

331
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,369
sucking through the filter then through

332
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,560
your inline fan then I would run ducting

333
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,450
out of that gross space I don't know if

334
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:59,829
that gross space is in a closet I don't

335
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,140
know if it's in a bedroom I don't know

336
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,210
where it's located you may need a hole

337
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,429
you need some way to get that air out

338
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,620
you need a four or six inch hole in a

339
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:10,929
wall in the ceiling going up to the

340
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,360
attic going out of that room we need to

341
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:15,279
vent that air out of there somehow move

342
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,080
it as far as you can run that ducting

343
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,209
possibly out of a window

344
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,670
be careful if you do run it out of the

345
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:23,980
house camouflage it cover it in some way

346
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:25,809
don't make it obvious for neighbors for

347
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,670
thieves for the guy who comes and checks

348
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:29,529
the meters the guy that checks the gas

349
00:12:27,669 --> 00:12:31,449
meter the water meter the electric guy

350
00:12:29,529 --> 00:12:32,919
make sure it's covered up you never know

351
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,600
who could end up in your yard on the

352
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:36,819
side of your house try to be smooth

353
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,800
about that [ __ ] but we've got two duct

354
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,900
this hot air out of there somehow

355
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,669
so we've hung a carbon filter we've got

356
00:12:40,899 --> 00:12:44,740
a blower we've got ducting running to

357
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:47,229
another spot where we can dump this warm

358
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,210
air when we plug in that blower it is

359
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,009
going to move a lot of air that is going

360
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:53,230
to cause displacement there's going to

361
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:55,838
be air missing in your grow space it

362
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:58,120
will need to be replaced most of that

363
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,710
air will replace itself by coming in

364
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,720
through the crack underneath your door

365
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,060
and the gap in your door between the

366
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,740
door and the door jamb if that blower is

367
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:07,239
pulling a lot of air you may hear a

368
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,129
little bit of whistling happening in

369
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,899
there that is not a problem that is just

370
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:12,399
a sign of a lot of air flow and you were

371
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:14,350
getting negative pressure it's trying to

372
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,569
suck the door in which is not a bad

373
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,330
thing what is also happening at that

374
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,920
time is you were sucking fresh air into

375
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,910
the room hopefully you were bringing

376
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,469
cool

377
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,149
in from the rest of the house from the

378
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,190
central air whatever type of air

379
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:29,259
conditioning you've got so I don't have

380
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,790
a whole lot of details on this girl

381
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:32,799
environment like I said earlier I don't

382
00:13:30,789 --> 00:13:35,079
know if this is a closet a bedroom an

383
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,299
attic a basement this could be any type

384
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,250
of space what I do know is that we can't

385
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:40,929
add an air conditioner so we cannot cool

386
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,840
the air which means we have got to

387
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:45,549
remove the hot air and hopefully replace

388
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,620
it with cooler air just by air

389
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:50,199
displacement that would be my first

390
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,899
approach the next approach may be to

391
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,610
turn down the light or possibly replace

392
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,769
the light can you get a smaller light

393
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:59,860
and run a lighter light in that room

394
00:13:56,769 --> 00:14:02,620
just for one season here in Colorado I

395
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,169
adjust my entire grow two times a year

396
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,060
just based on the seasons in the summer

397
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:09,099
I cannot run the same type of setup

398
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:10,719
which I run in the winter and we are

399
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,190
quickly approaching the time of year

400
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,680
where I have to start paying attention

401
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,180
to the weather every day to think oh do

402
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,889
I need to start making those adjustments

403
00:14:16,179 --> 00:14:19,870
because once I make them they're done

404
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:21,939
I'm not gonna go rebuild again and then

405
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,649
rebuild again it takes a little bit to

406
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,540
do it so I have to pay attention to the

407
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:27,459
weather you may need to reconsider

408
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:29,199
hanging a different light maybe a

409
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,120
smaller light if you're running an HID

410
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,770
maybe it's time for an LED if you're

411
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,049
running an LED maybe it's time for a

412
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:36,879
smaller LED again I don't know what

413
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:39,339
you've started with so I don't know what

414
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,009
to adjust to but that is an option maybe

415
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,110
run a smaller or if you've got multiple

416
00:14:42,009 --> 00:14:45,909
maybe it's time for less lights

417
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:47,200
many of the modern lights have a switch

418
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:49,089
you could just turn them down a little

419
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,670
bit those will help cool the room for

420
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:53,139
you also maybe consider using a ducted

421
00:14:51,669 --> 00:14:55,750
light if we're hanging ducks and a

422
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:57,519
carbon filter the old ducted hoods those

423
00:14:55,750 --> 00:15:00,009
work really well for keeping the room

424
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,319
cooler unfortunately there are no real

425
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,720
magic tricks when it comes to cooling a

426
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,610
room the light creates Heat that heat is

427
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,470
going to be in the room there's no trick

428
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,000
to dissipating heat you either have to

429
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,830
get it out of there or you have to fight

430
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,809
it with an air conditioner you have to

431
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:16,060
battle the heat somehow it sounds like

432
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:18,250
you've got to duct the heat from the

433
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:20,229
room if that is not an option maybe

434
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,149
reduce the amount of lights you are

435
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,070
putting into that room that light is

436
00:15:22,149 --> 00:15:26,470
what is creating the heat reduce that

437
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,750
you'll reduce your overall heat problem

438
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,180
now they did wrap up the email with an

439
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:34,419
update on the Mac project would be nice

440
00:15:31,179 --> 00:15:35,839
I did make the Mac to arise I took the

441
00:15:34,419 --> 00:15:38,059
Mac female the Mac one

442
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,970
cut from cab you later I pollinated that

443
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:43,789
with my arise my king Soloman male the

444
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,529
first time I did that I did a very small

445
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:47,059
plant I'm holding my hands up to show

446
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,220
you how big it is can you see that

447
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:51,169
that's how tall the plant was the plant

448
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,180
was maybe 2 feet tall at the most I

449
00:15:51,169 --> 00:15:56,179
pollinated the plant it got hit with a

450
00:15:53,179 --> 00:15:58,219
lot of pollen that plant made I think it

451
00:15:56,179 --> 00:15:59,959
was 5 or 6 seeds it made five that look

452
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,820
good and one that kind of looks like it

453
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,820
might go and I have not tried to

454
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,220
germinate those yet however I did put a

455
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,990
larger Mac plant in the flowering room

456
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,570
this time and I pollinated it with the

457
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:13,820
King Solomon again I basically had that

458
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,129
Mac plant leaning up against the male

459
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,530
plant as it started to pollinate it got

460
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:20,779
the very first dumps of pollen it got

461
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:23,509
the early pollination it looks like I

462
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:25,730
probably had more success this time but

463
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:28,159
I felt like the calyxes looked like they

464
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:30,529
were seeded last time as well so it may

465
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:32,269
be deceiving me once again that is one

466
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:33,620
of the best parts about breeding you

467
00:16:32,269 --> 00:16:35,779
don't know how many seeds there are

468
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,730
until you cut it down you start sorting

469
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:39,529
it out you realize I pollinated right on

470
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,960
time or I [ __ ] up and missed the

471
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:44,720
pollination point so I don't have a real

472
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,400
update on the Mac to arise I didn't make

473
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,259
enough seeds to make it worth my while

474
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,029
last time there were a couple there to

475
00:16:48,259 --> 00:16:51,889
play with they don't look super healthy

476
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,569
they don't look super viable I didn't

477
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:55,100
try to germinate them just so I don't

478
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,410
break my own heart they're still there

479
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,090
at this point they are Schroedinger

480
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,829
seeds they could be alive they could be

481
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,379
dead we don't know I can't cry over

482
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,329
seeds that I don't know about yet but

483
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,339
they're there i've also attempted to

484
00:17:05,329 --> 00:17:09,199
make another batch if I do have a lot

485
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,149
more I will play with them for sure and

486
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,709
you know that I will let you know I'll

487
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,240
let you know on social media you'll see

488
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:16,400

503
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:43,190
alright let's move into email number two

504
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:46,190
for this episode

505
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:48,559
this one goes just like this it says hey

506
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,580
Jeff my name is Riley feel free to use

507
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,190
my name that makes

508
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:53,990
so easy Thank You Riley it goes on to

509
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:56,299
say I'm a medical patient here in

510
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:58,640
Illinois and I recently had a plant hurm

511
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:00,980
on me after it running to dry while I

512
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,810
was out of town for a couple of days and

513
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:05,059
he says at least that's why I think it

514
00:18:02,809 --> 00:18:07,069
earned unlikely I don't think it earned

515
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:08,450
on you because it was too dry I think

516
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:10,250
there was another issue we will get to

517
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,960
that in a moment he says I immediately

518
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,450
cut this plant down and checked for

519
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,460
signs of pollination on my other plants

520
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:18,620
and I thought I was in the clear until

521
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:20,990
about one week later I noticed my two

522
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:23,719
gorilla [ __ ] were showing signs of

523
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:25,759
pollination I'm cutting this crop down

524
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,440
today and starting over and I wanted

525
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:30,140
your advice on how I should be

526
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,420
sterilizing my grow to avoid future

527
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,100
Paula Nations that is a great question

528
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,930
there's more I want to cover in the next

529
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:37,579
paragraph before I answer because this

530
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,070
will contribute to part of the first

531
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:42,049
question it says I am growing in a 10 by

532
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:43,970
10 spare bedroom where I keep the door

533
00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:46,430
crack during the daytime to keep the

534
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,410
temperatures down I use grow tent frames

535
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,900
to hang my lights but I only use the

536
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:52,790
removable flooring to set my plants on

537
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,769
there is carpet in the bedroom as well

538
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:58,369
as blackout curtains and black garbage

539
00:18:54,769 --> 00:19:00,200
bags for any additional light leaks now

540
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,089
since you immediately start talking

541
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,470
about light leaks and you also mentioned

542
00:19:02,089 --> 00:19:05,899
that you are opening and closing this

543
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:09,380
door during the day I am going to assume

544
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:11,509
that at least once or twice you may have

545
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,130
fallen asleep or got too stoned or got

546
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:14,539
too involved with your video games or

547
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:16,340
whatever it is you do I'm not judging

548
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,619
you I'm not blaming you this is my

549
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:21,230
stoner assumption maybe once or twice

550
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:23,509
two or three times you probably forgot

551
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,490
to close that door at the right time and

552
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:26,599
they got a little bit of light leak that

553
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,730
light should have gone off it should

554
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:30,889
have gotten dark but it didn't that is

555
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,440
what I'm going to suspect led to your

556
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,360
plants becoming hermaphrodites honestly

557
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,860
a plant that expresses hermaphroditic

558
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,539
traits under a little bit of stress like

559
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:40,549
that it was a herm

560
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:42,170
anyway it was carrying intersex traits

561
00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:44,089
all you had to do is give it the

562
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,980
environment or give it the triggers to

563
00:19:44,089 --> 00:19:47,899
show you that that was in its genetic

564
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:50,750
code so it is better off that you found

565
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,180
out now it's gone not a big deal but I

566
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:55,430
assume it was from you leaving that door

567
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:56,900
open it was from a white leek I would

568
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:59,660
not blame it on the plant getting too

569
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,400
dry it was more likely from a light

570
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:03,560
problem it goes on to say if you need

571
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,880
additional info please let me know

572
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:07,129

00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:46,370
that rabbit hole

00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:48,680

598
00:20:56,089 --> 00:21:00,439
little rabbit hole to dig down enjoy

599
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:01,880
that my friend all right we're getting

600
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,920
toward the end here it goes on to say

601
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,810
I'm looking forward to getting my hands

602
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:08,630
on some lemon Jeffery seeds after i

603
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:10,879
recoup from this herm situation would

604
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,770
you recommend getting FEM seeds being a

605
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,230
med patient I can only grow 5 plants

606
00:21:12,769 --> 00:21:17,960
above 6 inches tall so it is hard to

607
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,269
Fino hunt much love from your buddy

608
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,980
Riley Riley the answer to the lemon

609
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:24,529
Jeffery question is simple it is only

610
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,319
available in feminized seeds so I do

611
00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:29,450
recommend lemon Jeffery feminized seeds

612
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:31,879
and the part where you say you can only

613
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:34,819
grow 5 at a time so a final hunt is

614
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,980
difficult why not grow 5 see which one

615
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:39,769
is your favorite out of those 5 cut down

616
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,599
the other 4 plant 4 more seeds grow

617
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:44,029
those 4 see which is your favorite out

618
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:46,009
of all 5 of them cut down the other 4

619
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:48,170
repeat the process until you have got

620
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:49,849
the phenotype that you were looking for

621
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,470
you can go through as many seeds as you

622
00:21:49,849 --> 00:21:54,049
want you can take as much time as you

623
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:56,089
want this is not a race too many people

624
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:58,099
are racing too many people are in a rush

625
00:21:56,089 --> 00:21:59,899
when it comes to cannabis take your time

626
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:02,359
one of the beautiful things about

627
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,250
cannabis especially growing it is that

628
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:06,289
it makes you take your time when you

629
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:08,539
smoke you're supposed to slow down and

630
00:22:06,289 --> 00:22:10,039
chill out growing cannabis is that

631
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:12,799
feeling tenfold

632
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:15,109
be in the garden be present chill out

633
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,180
enjoy yourself let's not get in so much

634
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:19,369
of a hurry but you can break up your

635
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:21,350
fino hunt by multiple rounds just to

636
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:23,779
keep yourself within the numbers you can

637
00:22:21,349 --> 00:22:25,429
run five pick your favorite repeat the

638
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:26,990
process and just keep picking your

639
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,700
favorite one each time maybe you picked

640
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,440
the same one two or three times in a row

641
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,299
and that's how you know you're not gonna

642
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:34,070
find a better keeper that's how you can

643
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,859
make that decision now let's move back

644
00:22:34,069 --> 00:22:38,569
up to the part where you talk about

645
00:22:35,859 --> 00:22:41,929
pollination and Herms and how do I

646
00:22:38,569 --> 00:22:44,089
remove this pollen there is one very

647
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,810
easy thing you can do to get rid of

648
00:22:44,089 --> 00:22:49,309
pollen pollen is deactivated by water so

649
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:51,440
spray down the room with water

650
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:53,059
get yourself a pump sprayer just put

651
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,440
water in there if you're going at it why

652
00:22:53,059 --> 00:22:56,779
not put some bleach or maybe some

653
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,940
five-and-twenty or maybe put some h2o

654
00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:01,160
too or some zero tall in there and just

655
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:03,860
spray down everything the entire grow

656
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,390
space just mist it really lightly if you

657
00:23:03,859 --> 00:23:07,069
don't want to ruin any electronics if

658
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,600
you're not gonna take down the gear just

659
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:10,519
mist it enough just to where everything

660
00:23:08,599 --> 00:23:12,289
has a nice little layer of water maybe

661
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:13,730
do it two or three times and you will

662
00:23:12,289 --> 00:23:15,740
get rid of all the pollen in there

663
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,569
definitely shot back all the corners

664
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:19,160
sweep up real well anything you can

665
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:20,839
reach hit it with a broom dust

666
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,420
everything really nicely wipe it all

667
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,639
down but water is going to kill and

668
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,730
deactivate any active pollen in that

669
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:30,770
room so spray it down get it wet and the

670
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:33,200
pollen will be unviable it will be

671
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:34,910
basically dead now another important

672
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,190
thing to think about is why did those

673
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:39,440
plan turn was it genetics or was it

674
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:41,450
environmental I don't think it was from

675
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,830
the dryness I would assume more like I

676
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:44,720
said earlier that it would be a light

677
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:47,480
leak so let's make sure we don't have

678
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,210
any light leaks in the room when you

679
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,400
think the lights are out in the room go

680
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,529
in that room turn off the lights in the

681
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,720
room and stand in there and give

682
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:59,240
yourself five solid minutes for your

683
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,960
eyes to adjust and see if there are any

684
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:05,480
light leaks at all anywhere if you can

685
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,390
see any light it is too much we need

686
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,430
zero light if you can see your hand in

687
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,020
front of your face we have more light

688
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,330
than what we need for the plants to

689
00:24:12,019 --> 00:24:16,400
respond appropriately to a dark cycle

690
00:24:14,329 --> 00:24:18,710
maybe you've got equipment in the room

691
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,900
that is lighting up you have a blue LED

692
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:23,120
light on your mp3 player do you have a

693
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,920
blue light on some clock or something in

694
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,569
the room is there a red light on

695
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,370
something the only acceptable light

696
00:24:26,569 --> 00:24:30,859
should be a green light and that is

697
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:32,629
still questionable in some cases so

698
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:34,219
let's make sure there are no light leaks

699
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:36,650
in that room so that we don't have

700
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:38,480
another firm problem in the future and

701
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:40,160
we end up sweeping up and cutting down

702
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,400
plants and doing this whole panic move

703
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:46,040
all over again so my short answer for a

704
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,019
really long answer is water is what

705
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,298
kills pollen all you have to do is spray

706
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,160
it down with water and those pollen

707
00:24:50,298 --> 00:24:52,940
grains hidden in the room will be

708
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,590
destroyed

709
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:57,500
make sure you dust everything if you've

710
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:59,389
got like some panda film on the floor or

711
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,279
if you've got a tray somewhere move that

712
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:03,710
tray get underneath it flip those trays

713
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,569
over spray the bottoms get everywhere

714
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,179
because that pollen went in places you

715
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:10,668
would never imagine it is very tiny

716
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:12,380
microscopic dust flakes of pollen it's

717
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:14,270
been blown around by the fan it's

718
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:16,100
underneath [ __ ] it's on the bottom sides

719
00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:17,990
it's in the corners it's everywhere

720
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:20,808
make sure you sweep up get a shot back

721
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:23,690
then spray everything down maybe spray

722
00:25:20,808 --> 00:25:25,308
it down a couple of times now also keep

723
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:26,870
in mind that the only plants that can

724
00:25:25,308 --> 00:25:29,210
receive pollen are the plants that are

725
00:25:26,869 --> 00:25:31,219
in flower and have pistols so you've got

726
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,929
until you get more flowering plants in

727
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,759
there to keep spraying so if you're

728
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:36,650
going to apply a pesticide to that room

729
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:38,329
if you put veg plants in there you're

730
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:40,190
gonna hit them with the pesticide just

731
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:41,990
go crazy with the [ __ ] pesticide and

732
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:43,910
get the whole room wet all over again

733
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:46,339
and that way you can be sure that you're

734
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:47,480
actively destroying any pollen that may

735
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:49,099
have been left behind

736
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,599
all right Riley I want to thank you
