30
00:01:09,879 --> 00:01:14,158
driving up to Colorado Springs to go see

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,320

00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,799
Springs was going to go pay them a visit

35
00:01:21,078 --> 00:01:26,279
and uh the [ __ ] transmission went out

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,000
on my car about uh a mile from Colorado

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,439
Springs I could see the first exit in

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159
Colorado Springs I could see the damn

39
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,359
Circle Drive Lake Avenue sign right in

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,478
front of me but I just couldn't get off

41
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:37,920
the highway my car pretty much exploded

42
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,438
it felt like I was doing a good 75 mph

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,478
on the interstate in the rain uh it felt

44
00:01:40,438 --> 00:01:45,478
like my car downshifted uh from 75 I

45
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,239
immediately was going about 45 miles an

46
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,359
hour uh it sounded like uh sort of like

47
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:52,239
and then it was like is what it felt

48
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:53,718
like to me uh it felt like my engine was

49
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,000
trying to jump out of the car and into

50
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:57,519
my lap so of course I hit the brakes uh

51
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,599
signal got over as quickly as I could

52
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,640
got to the side of the road turned on

53
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:03,438
the hazards C AAA it took AAA they

54
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:07,718
quoted me 85 minutes to get there they

55
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,560
got there in 65 so uh [ __ ] 85 minute

56
00:02:07,718 --> 00:02:11,280
is a long 85 minute wait is a long wait

57
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,318
65 minutes was less than what they

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,439
promised me so I guess that that's a

59
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,919
good job on aaa's part I made friends

60
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,280
with the triple a tow truck driver I

61
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:19,958
wish I had your business card with me

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,039

pills for that I've been taking two a

113
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,479
day and I can feel a sharpness in my

114
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,719
brain my vocabulary is stronger um I had

115
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,840
a problem after I hit my head I would

116
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,598
try to recall words and I'd say hey can

117
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,878
you hand me my my and I just couldn't

118
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:15,919
think of what basic words were like

119
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,319
screwdriver or flashlight sometimes I

120
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,000
would just forget words but the Alpha

121
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,918
Brain is making that [ __ ] come back to

122
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,000
me uh it's making me a better speaker

123
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:25,918
it's making me remember and recall more

124
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,399
uh it's making me calmer I've described

125
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:28,680
it as maybe I've said this on the show

126
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:30,399
maybe I'm full of [ __ ] with my memory

127
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,079
thing but I've described it as a my

128
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,519
brain has the main track that's

129
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,959
happening there's like the you got to

130
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,240
wake up you got to poop you got to brush

131
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:37,519
your teeth you got to get to work on

132
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,360
time you got to do your chores you got

133
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,519
to call this person you know that track

134
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,120
is playing in your head but there's

135
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:45,079
always that side [ __ ] that goes on

136
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,600
in your head like taxes and it just

137
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:49,879
Whispers at you occasionally or I wonder

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,360
what that girl's doing or I miss

139
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:52,439
somebody or just [ __ ] that happens

140
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,240
in your head that you really don't need

141
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:56,279
to be focusing on right now I feel like

142
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,240
weird things pop up into your head and

143
00:04:56,279 --> 00:05:00,359
the Alpha Brain has kind of quieted that

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,560
secondary track so where able to focus

145
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,919
on what I'm supposed to focus on which

146
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,038
gets me to my point the podcasts are

147
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:08,159

152
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,879

00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:42,439
episode Floria is a medicated personal

164
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:45,439
lubricant which means it is a uh it's a

165
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,918
sexual lubricant that contains cannabis

166
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,360
uh somebody heard that I talked about it

167
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:51,560
on the show and they gave me a product

168
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,120
called evos and from what I can tell

169
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,439
evos and Floria are very very similar

170
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,959
fairly similar was what I wanted to say

171
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,839
uh they are both coconut oil and fused

172
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:04,198
with cannabis and they are meant to be

173
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,799
applied to you know the instructions

174
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,639
pretty much say apply it to the female's

175
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,520
parts so I'm going to be straight up

176
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,280
about this I got some uh evos and I uh

177
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:17,560
sprayed it up on my partner's goods and

178
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:19,478
uh it made a difference it definitely uh

179
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,000
there was nothing to complain about

180
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:22,598
before everything was going just fine

181
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,478
but when we added that stuff it made it

182
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:27,439
a little uh it made my junk warm it felt

183
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:29,758
like she it's already warm I know but it

184
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:32,360
felt a little warmer and tingli it made

185
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,720
stuff feel a little more alert like it

186
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,479
was definitely a heightened experience

187
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,000
and she agreed she said that it was

188
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,318
definitely a heightened experience uh

189
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
it's just coconut oil and cannabis so I

190
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,800
had no uh worries about putting it on my

191
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,918
body or in her body or whatever uh it

192
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,199
washed off really cleanly and really

193
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:50,758
quickly uh one funny thing that I said

194
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,120
when I was done and I'm sorry if I'm

195
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,560
being too explicit you guys but it's my

196
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,680
podcast and I'll talk about my dick if I

197
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:00,280
want uh when I was done uh I was I felt

198
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,000
I wasn't around I was okay I was all

199
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,198
done and soft right I'm all floppy but I

200
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,360
felt like my dick was Fluffy like I've

201
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:07,879
given somebody a massage with apana

202
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,160
lotion before and I've explained my

203
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,280
hands like feeling like I was wearing

204
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,639
Mickey Mouse gloves my dick felt like it

205
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,719
was Fluffy like to the touch if I would

206
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:18,560
touch it I felt like it was thicker than

207
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,319
it was that's a weird uh okay enough

208
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,519
about my dong on the show but I tried

209
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,039
the evos and uh if you're looking for

210
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:25,279
something to add to the bedroom fun and

211
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:27,399
you want to go to the dispensary and

212
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,000
spend a few bucks uh there was nothing

213
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:30,439
wrong with evos it worked I would use it

214
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,598
I would do that again if you're

215
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:35,399
listening let's do that again so we

216
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,759
talked about Alpha Brain we talked about

217
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:39,519
evos let's change the tone a little bit

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
this is something that is not good that

219
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,839
happens um I was trying to explain to a

220
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,159
friend something and I don't know the

221
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:48,119
science behind it but I know that this

222
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:50,439
is happening when my dab rig gets dirty

223
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,000
my chunk of globby resin in there and

224
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:53,598
this probably applies to the bong with

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,680
bong resin if you're just smoking flower

226
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:58,279
but I've noticed that when I'm hitting

227
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,038
the dab rig um once the rig gets dirty I

228
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:02,598
feel like that chunk of res in there is

229
00:08:00,038 --> 00:08:04,120
actually stealing part of my dab I feel

230
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:05,560
like when you've got a big floater if

231
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,000
you look at my rig right now there is

232
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,158
like a quar gram of hash just floating

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,279
in my rig water and it's not old the rig

234
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:14,560
water's only been in there for three or

235
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,079
4 days at the most we just dab heavy the

236
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,598
seil never turns off you guys it's like

237
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:19,839
the coffee pot it turns on at a certain

238
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,000
time in the morning and then it goes off

239
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:24,399
right when I go to bed so I'm taking big

240
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,360
fat Globs right I'll clean the rig and

241
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:27,878
take fat Globs fat Globs I get super

242
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,319
baked like just like I should but as the

243
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,360
rig gets dirtier I stop getting high and

244
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,120
stop choking and stop enjoying my dab as

245
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,800
much as it gets dirtier I think that

246
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,479
chunk of resin in there collects the

247
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,000
resin that's the smoke it collects all

248
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,560
your canabo and your smoke and your

249
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,120
whatever you're trying to get it sticks

250
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,479
to that ball and it's ripping you off so

251
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,399
my point clean your [ __ ] rig go get

252
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,000
some rubbing alcohol if it's really

253
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,120
super sticky get yourself some kosher

254
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,879
salt fill the rig halfway up with

255
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,120
alcohol put a little bit of kosher salt

256
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:55,480
in there the salt is working as an

257
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,799
abrasive it's going to scratch all that

258
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:00,120
resin off of there cover up both

259
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,719
holes go somewhere you got a carpeted

260
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,078
floor if you're a pothead and just shake

261
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,399
the [ __ ] out of that rig and the reason

262
00:09:03,078 --> 00:09:05,799
we're going to the carpeted floor is so

263
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,240
that when you drop the rig you you have

264
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:09,879
a better chance of living uh just be

265
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,759
careful just go shake the [ __ ] out of

266
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:14,200
that rig and then uh yeah I know it's

267
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,600
disgusting but just pour all that

268
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:17,160
[ __ ] reclaim right down the drain and

269
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,200
get rid of it you don't want that I know

270
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,719
a lot of people that use it I'm not

271
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,879
going to hate on you if you do I

272
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,680
wouldn't use it especially if you just

273
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,078
mix alcohol into it but flush that [ __ ]

274
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,439
right down the drain get rid of it and

275
00:09:25,078 --> 00:09:28,639
then rinse the rig out a couple of times

276
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,399
with super hot water let it dry let it

277
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,838
cool down to a normal temp fill it back

278
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,200
up with water the right uh depth what is

279
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,040
that a right amount of water whatever

280
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:37,800
the right level throw your nail on there

281
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:39,639
and get down on some clean tasty dabs

282
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:41,240
and enjoy the flavor of your dabs again

283
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:43,838
I really think a clean rig is more

284
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:45,480
important than uh people realize all

285
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,320
right that's enough of that PSA I've got

286
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,079
more [ __ ] written down here what else is

287
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,680
next um somebody was asking me I got an

288
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:54,159
email or a Facebook message I cannot

289
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,199
recall where it came from right now but

290
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,519
somebody was asking me about rig

291
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,839
selection how do I choose a good rig

292
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,360
personally if you're dabbing uh I prefer

293
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,880
a small rig over a big piece the reason

294
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,759
we used to smoke pot out of a giant bong

295
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,399
is so that you can fill all that space

296
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:14,000
with a big thick chunky hit of smoke and

297
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,600
then when you pull that carb or you pull

298
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
the bull out or you take your finger off

299
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,680
however you carb your B your bong if

300
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
you're from the 70s you just take your

301
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:21,319
finger off that hole in the back if

302
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,000
you're from the future you got to pull

303
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,800
the stem out when you carb it you're

304
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,639
supposed to get all that [ __ ] smoke

305
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,479
into your lungs right at once boom you

306
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,000
just got a big old bong hit that's why

307
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,440
you get baked from the bong that's the

308
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,120
purpose fill that piece clear it get all

309
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,480
your smoke when we're smoking

310
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,399
dabs your dab is just burning up right

311
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,159
when you put it on the nail and you

312
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,958
start smoking and you're getting it I

313
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,000
don't think we need a big ass piece for

314
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:45,359
a dab I like a little tiny rig to where

315
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,600
when you put it on there you put the

316
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,919
carb cap on there you inhale you get

317
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,120
that smoke right to your face we're not

318
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,919
trying to build a whole bunch of smoke

319
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,480
into one chamber and then clear it we

320
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,360
just want that dab to go through the rig

321
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,440
through the water to cool and then into

322
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,600
your face so my main recommendation is

323
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,800
something kind of small my favorite rig

324
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,200
and you're going to think I'm crazy but

325
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,958
my favorite rig is my Hitman side car

326
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,079
it's just the right height I'm thinking

327
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,838
that's probably 5 in tall something like

328
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:15,799
that if you go up to the mouthpiece it's

329
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:18,160
probably s inches tall um it's a little

330
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:21,319
rig I like my mad Rob rig that sucker is

331
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:24,159
probably 4 in tall at the most um you

332
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,760
don't need a lot of percolation on a rig

333
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,519
uh if you've got something that gets

334
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:29,600
plenty of bubbles you don't need a lot

335
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,278
of diffusion all you want to do is calm

336
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,079
cool your dab smoke you don't want it

337
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,399
coming off of that hot nail directly

338
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:35,879
into your lungs so you put a little

339
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,078
water through there just enough to cool

340
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:40,958
it like I don't like a lot of water on

341
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:43,319
my rig and also I think over percolation

342
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,000
on a dab like if you've got too many

343
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,760
sections of water you're kind of

344
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,799
overdoing it I like the Toro cans that

345
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:50,000
have the the tree perk and then it's got

346
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,919
the little shower head perk in the

347
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,200
middle those are great but my favorite

348
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,958
is the Hitman uh I really do like the

349
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,839
mothership rigs those things hit like a

350
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,119
boss but you're looking at like 2500 to

351
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,000
3,000 for a rig if you're asking me for

352
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,799
advice you don't need advice on a mother

353
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,919
ship uh get yourself a nice Hitman rig

354
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,359
don't be afraid of uh you don't have to

355
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,838
buy name brand glass just keep in mind

356
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,480
that if you're buying Chinese made glass

357
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:15,720
there's probably some Chinese little kid

358
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,360
making it in unsafe conditions they

359
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,839
don't have good eye protection they're

360
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,399
probably Barefoot just try to if you can

361
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,839
buy some American Glass do that it's

362
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,799
worth the extra few bucks just to know

363
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,199
that you have ethically made glass I

364
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,439
think it's some Karma uh like I said

365
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,759
hitman's a good company they don't

366
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,519
support the show or anything but they're

367
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,559
always innovators they lead the glass

368
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,639
game in my opinion if you want to go

369
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:39,479
expensive get yourself a uh a coil or

370
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,159
some beer glass or something like that

371
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,600
coil is going to be ridiculous you guys

372
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm just talking about my favorite rigs

373
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,000
here one thing I'm going to mention so

374
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,759
get a small rig without without a lot of

375
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,320
percolation uh something that keeps the

376
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:51,639
nail a little bit away from your face

377
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,320
when you're checking out these rigs at

378
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:55,278
the store try to put the nail that

379
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,560
you're going to buy right on that rig

380
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:59,838
and then see how far away that nail is

381
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:01,958
from your face cuz I don't really like

382
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,680
the nail higher than the mouthpiece or

383
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,559
real right in my face I need it a couple

384
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,958
inches away from my nose so that I can

385
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:08,159
see where I'm putting the dab I don't

386
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,679
want to go

387
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,159
crossy all right the important part the

388
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:14,799
most important part when you're buying a

389
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,958
rig is the nail that's what you're

390
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,240
heating up to a couple hundred degrees

391
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,719
that's what you're putting your extract

392
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,079
on it's going to be heated and cooled

393
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,160
and heated and cooled all the time oh

394
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:27,159
excuse me I'm burping here I'm going to

395
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:27,159
take a drink right quick excuse me

396
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:36,000
all right I apologize for the silence I

397
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:37,719
needed a drink um so get a good quality

398
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,399
titanium nail the only brand I will

399
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,440
recommend for titanium is highly

400
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,958
educated titanium they make a nail for

401
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,600
your rig no matter what you're trying to

402
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:48,759
do Highly Educated has got the perfect

403
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,278
nail for you I promise if you need

404
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:52,000
guidance on the nail hit me up send me a

405
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:53,679
picture of your rig I'll tell you what

406
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,958
kind of nail to

407
00:13:53,679 --> 00:14:00,519
buy um I do really like the quartz nails

408
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,479
if you get a good quality quartz nail uh

409
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,720
I recommend the Halen honey hole if you

410
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,920
do big fat dabs if you're into smoking

411
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,839
solventless and BHO definitely get the

412
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,319
honeyhole it holds a lot of heat for

413
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:12,199
when you smoke solventless it's got a

414
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:16,199
lot of room to get a big solventless dab

415
00:14:12,198 --> 00:14:17,439
in there I also like the quave Banger um

416
00:14:16,198 --> 00:14:19,599
the qu Banger is going to be a little

417
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,279
bit pricey but they are awesome they

418
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,839
taste super clean uh who just made the

419
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:25,639
trough was that Joel Halen that just

420
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,160
made the trough I not had a chance to

421
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,320
try the trough yet but they look amazing

422
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,679
if it's made out of good quality quartz

423
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,240
I bet it's going to be a good quartz

424
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,559
Banger uh there is a company that is

425
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,198
selling uh they call them quartz bangers

426
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,958
it's the nail that uh it's quartz it

427
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:42,559
looks like a faucet spout kind of with a

428
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,278
little bucket at the end of it you put

429
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,679
your dab in the bucket part um guys

430
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:47,838
there's a company that's selling those

431
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:50,078
that's claiming their quarts and they

432
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,519
are glass be careful you don't want to

433
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,519
buy glass and reheat it and let it cool

434
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,039
and reheat it and let it cool it's going

435
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:55,679
to break you want a good quartz piece

436
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:57,879
quartz can handle the

437
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,239
[ __ ] also we go back to that stuff

438
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,480
talking about what's made in America

439
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,600
what's made in China try to do that with

440
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,800
your quartz products also uh get a Halen

441
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,600
honey hole get a real quave Banger or

442
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,439
get yourself a real Highly Educated

443
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,120
titanium nail those are the only Nails I

444
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,079
will support on this show so come on

445
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,198
guys send me some Nails not really I'm

446
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,479
just kidding I've got all the nails I

447
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:20,639
can use right now uh so good nail is key

448
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,879
that's the point here also recently I

449
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,959
discovered something that the people in

450
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:27,240
Colorado may be excited about

451
00:15:23,958 --> 00:15:29,679
occasionally uh kind love in Denver has

452
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:32,360
occasionally been putting out clones of

453
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,919
my lemon Jeffrey they were uh they

454
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,519
actually bought seeds from me at an

455
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,439
event they bought several packages of

456
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,159
seeds and they ran the lemon Jeffy and

457
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,440
they found their phenotypes that are

458
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:44,240
killer I've seen the lab tests uh

459
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,440
they've tested from the 24 to 26s and

460
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,879
they actually said that they could have

461
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,600
grown the herb better but there was an

462
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,679
issue so that means that next time

463
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,879
you're going to see 28 to 29% on the

464
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:54,799
limit Jeffrey from kind love so

465
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,759
occasionally you can pick up lemon

466
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,039
Jeffrey clones at kind love and they are

467
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,278
beautiful I've seen pictures of them

468
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:02,078
they're big fat healthy luscious clones

469
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:04,278
I definitely recommend that call before

470
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:05,919
you drive uh they will not reserve a

471
00:16:04,278 --> 00:16:07,519
clone for you so you have to call you

472
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,759
have to say do they have this clone and

473
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,318
if they say yes then you got to get in

474
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,800
the car and haul ass over there because

475
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:13,599
they will not reserve a clone for you

476
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,559
but they might have

477
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
it all right I feel like I'm talking a

478
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,078
million miles an hour um I'm going to

479
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,319
press pause take a dab and then we're

480
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:23,479
going to get into some news I'll be

481
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:24,679

that's that's cool uh we got to the club

574
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,639
and when it was time to seat us the

575
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,120
seating people kind of looked at each

576
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,919
other with some concern and the one guy

577
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:42,319
said you [ __ ] up you go tell him so

578
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:43,200
the one seating person I don't know what

579
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:44,678
he's called I'm going to call him an

580
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
usher that sounds about right but the

581
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,159
one Usher dude had to go tell two people

582
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,239
that they had to move because the seats

583
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:54,000
that they were sitting in up front had

584
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,880
been reserved for Doug's VIP special

585
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,919
guests um I felt bad for that because

586
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
those people probably waited in line for

587
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:02,480
a good hour while I was at the Mellow

588
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,720
Mushroom eating pizza or in the car

589
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,079
taking fat

590
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,839
dabs um well I'm thinking about it shout

591
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,879
out to Claud the candy man I ate a sweet

592
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,359
Stone candy uh CLA bear before I went

593
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,679
into the show about two hours before the

594
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:17,279
show and by Showtime woohoo I was sweet

595
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,400
stoned for sure so they had to go and

596
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:23,038
move these two people because I've got

597
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:25,038
this VIP pass so they sit Clint and I in

598
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,079
the most Prime [ __ ] seats in the club

599
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,919
right up front and it's kind of awkward

600
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,000
I could feel hatred people were staring

601
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,400
at us like we were huge dicks uh and

602
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,759
then eventually the guy sitting next to

603
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,919
us got tired of the tension and he just

604
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,038
said so who the [ __ ] are you guys and

605
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:40,320
Clint said nobody I'm with him and

606
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:41,919
they're like who are you and I was like

607
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,439
we're just friends of Doug and they said

608
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,919
yeah they moved our friends because you

609
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,840
guys are Doug's special guests and I

610
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,559
felt kind of like a [ __ ] for that so

611
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:52,480
I do apologize but I had a great ass

612
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,038
time up front that was a good ass show

613
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,558
um let's go and read this article I've

614
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,240
been talking for a long time about it

615
00:20:55,558 --> 00:21:00,960
and I've just got an article written um

616
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,519

those not the not the dab the throat

622
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,918

he announced his guests he said Ricardo

624
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,640

708
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,038

709
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,320
some recording equipment I'm blowing

710
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,519
some [ __ ] up um I've got the air

711
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:24,240
conditioner next to me and I don't think

you guys can hear it but the uh the

713
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,480
recording equipment is struggling to

714
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:28,519
keep me and this [ __ ] air conditioner

715
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,919
separate in the recording here it's

716
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:33,000
pretty neat watching the lights light up

717
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:35,679
anyway this one hits close to home

718
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,240
because I do live in PUO Colorado uh I

719
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,798
am actually the grower at a very popular

720
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,960
dispensary in Pueblo West Colorado uh

721
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:45,679
peblo West is like a sub uh development

722
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,399
just outside of the city of Pueblo it's

723
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,320
about 10 minutes to the West obviously

724
00:24:47,398 --> 00:24:51,558
it's Pueblo West it's a little nicer uh

725
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,079
well I don't know that it's exactly

726
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:55,000
complete a little completely a little

727
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:57,038
nicer it's newer so it doesn't have Old

728
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,640
Town problems it doesn't have the old

729
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,798
rickety parts of town so it looks lot

730
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:03,240
nicer uh we also have a part that we

731
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:04,720
call the county which if you drive

732
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,440

733
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,839

me guys I'm sorry he said there isn't uh

767
00:26:15,558 --> 00:26:21,200

public over uh they did vote and uh they

769

772
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,038
uh until they vote

773
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,120
again which will be in November so you

774
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,119
guys if you live in poblo you have to

775
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,798
drive 15 minutes to the county or to

776
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,398
Pueblo West to go purchase your cannabis

777
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:44,038
and then drive back and then the city

778
00:26:42,398 --> 00:26:46,439
that you live in isn't getting your tax

779
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:48,200
money for the Cannabis that you're able

780
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,759
to purchase because of these stupid

781
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,278
[ __ ] regulations that Pablo's been

782
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,558
juggling

783
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,960
with I've been in the legal medical

784
00:26:53,558 --> 00:26:58,359
marijuana industry in this city uh since

785
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,679
sh we had the first shop I think I think

786
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:03,319
that was 9 years ago when we had meamar

787
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:04,960
downtown and since that is closed uh

788
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:06,639
there has not been another medical shop

789
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,960
or a recreational shop in the city that

790
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,559
was legally licensed there have been

791
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,679
places that popped up randomly and were

792
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:14,240
closed but I think it's kind of [ __ ]

793
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:15,840
I shouldn't use the word [ __ ] that's

794
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,640
mean to the [ __ ] people I think it's

795
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,639
ridiculous and stupid that we are not

796
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,360
allowed to have a recreational cannabis

797
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,759
shop within City

798
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:26,278
Limits they need the tax money this town

799
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:29,398
is broke and hurting bunch of weed money

800
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:30,880
would really help this city all right um

801
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,719

802
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,960

857
00:29:29,798 --> 00:29:33,398
wrong um I'm going to continue the

858
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,719
article a search of his vehicle found an

859
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:37,798
additional 78 gram of liquid marijuana

860
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,120
he probably had some tincture you guys

861
00:29:37,798 --> 00:29:40,679
uh he had previously mailed two

862
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,839
additional packages that were seized by

863
00:29:40,679 --> 00:29:47,240
law enforcement those packages contained

864
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:50,639
3,654 G of marijuana in total inspectors

865
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:52,839
learned that Elvin sent 11,026 G of

866
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,519
marijuana law enforcement also had

867
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:55,480
seized during the investigation more

868
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:58,079
than

869
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,880
$53,000 in cash which was the proceed

870
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,038
proceeds from his illegal narcotics

871
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,640
transaction that money was forfeited to

872
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:06,119
the government as part of elvin's ple

873
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:07,440
agreement Elvin pled guilty to three

874
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:08,918
account three counts of possession of a

875
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,759
controlled substance with the intent to

876
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:14,600
distribute he now faces more than 20

877
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:18,278
years in federal prison and up to a $1

878
00:30:14,599 --> 00:30:21,558
million fine per count so my point here

879
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:24,079
people is quit mailing weed out of

880
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:27,038
Colorado unless you want to end up in

881
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,879
federal prison doing 20 years and facing

882
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,480
up to one million dollar in fines per

883
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,679
count there are several reasons we

884
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,599
shouldn't be mailing cannabis out of the

885
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,159
state you

886
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:37,119
guys first off it's illegal and you're

887
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,240
going to go to prison and you're going

888
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,599
to get butt raped doesn't sound like fun

889
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,839
to me doesn't sound like the [ __ ]

890
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:45,079
profit I'm making from it not at all

891
00:30:42,839 --> 00:30:47,759
second of all in Colorado the people

892
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:50,119
that have fought hard to legalize

893
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:52,480
cannabis medically and recreationally we

894
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:54,359
did it for here and you're [ __ ] it up

895
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,038
by mailing it somewhere else it's their

896
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:57,558
respon wherever you're sending it

897
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:00,278
they're responsible for legalizing

898
00:30:57,558 --> 00:31:02,158
cannabis in their area not us and by

899
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:04,079
sending it out you're [ __ ] up what we

900
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,960
worked hard for we're making something

901
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:07,798
shiny we've got a system that works we

902
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,440
have created laws and we're playing by

903
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:11,599
the rules and then you're going to be a

904
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,360
[ __ ] [ __ ] and take the rules that

905
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:15,199
we've made you can grow and smoke all

906
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,879

907
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,399
Colorado quit sending it out of state

908
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,840
you don't need to do that that's [ __ ]

909
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,000

910
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:24,079

916
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:36,240

917
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:38,480
legalize cannabis everywhere do your

918

920
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:43,519
where you are and get it legalized in

921
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:44,879

925
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,519
medicine here and we're sending that

926
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,200
[ __ ] to other states to make a profit

927
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,599
that's [ __ ] up take the money out of

928
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,519

30 minutes episodes over the hourong

974
00:33:29,798 --> 00:33:34,638
episodes um I think it's better when I

975
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:36,558
do two 30 minute episodes instead of the

976

long hour and you guys really listen

977
