00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,478
a friend made a mistake in the grow room

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
they actually had a an equipment failure

52
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,000
and a lot of people uh they jumped on

53
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,680
that person and they gave them a bunch

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,680
of negative uh feedback a bunch of

55
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
negative criticism the feedback was kind

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,000
of 50 50. some people said you can do it

57
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,318
ah just try again grow harder but a lot

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,400
of people were very uh not super kind

59
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,238
about that you guys people are going to

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
make mistakes this person took it to

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,759
heart when you guys talk trash to them

62
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,679
kind of messed up their day people are

63
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,359

schedules you're going to mismeasure

69
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,879

75
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,919
episode about making major mistakes and

76
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:49,439
grows i've destroyed entire crops i was

77
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,119
halfway through a flowering crop one

78
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,280
year

79
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,719
maybe last year maybe the year before i

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,400
was trying new lights i was halfway

81
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,158
through a flowering crop it was fully

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,519
seeded i would have been a great market

83
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,759
run you guys would have really enjoyed

84
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,920
those seeds i was not satisfied with the

85
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,318
quality of those plants i cut them down

86
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,719
i made mistakes i cut my losses cleaned

87
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:10,799
up regrouped started over it hurt it

88
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,359
hurt my uh it hurt my little ego it hurt

89
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,280
my feelings it hurt my budget definitely

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,440
but i learned a lot from it i learned

91
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,878
not to use that lighting in the winter i

92
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,719
learned not to switch lighting in the

93
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,639
middle of a grow i learned how to use

94
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,479
those lights eventually it was a great

95
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,238
learning experience so you guys when you

96
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:27,840
do make mistakes i'm not going to say if

97
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,360
i'm going to say when you do make a

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,640
mistake because it's going to happen if

99
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,239
if you're not a robot if you're not a

100
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,399
machine and still then those things make

101
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,480
[ __ ] mistakes if you make mistakes if

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,920
you make errors if your plants die it's

103
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,000
not the end of the world that is just

104

division is now passing out uh this

234
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,240
paperwork when you buy concentrates

235
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,680
you're supposed to pass this to a

236
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,079
customer that buys concentrates in the

237
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,400
dispensary the top of it says

238
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,079
colorado department of revenue marijuana

239
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,638
enforcement division

240
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,918
use of regulated marijuana concentrate i

241
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,038
just thought this was interesting so i'm

242
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,399
going to share this with you we're going

243
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,000
to kind of mock this a little bit is

244
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,839
what's really going to happen here uh

245
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,279
they gave this to me which i thought was

246
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:12,318
funny he laughed when he gave him he

247
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,519
said i have to give this to every

248
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
customer who buys a concentrate and i

249
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:18,000
was like oh good because i'm new

250
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
of all people that needed some dabbing

251
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,879
advice it is definitely me this is the

252
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,038
medical and retail marijuana stores are

253
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,800
required this says that medical and

254
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,800
retail marijuana stores are required to

255
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,960
provide this resource to individuals

256
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,959
purchasing regulated

257
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,918
marijuana concentrate i feel like nancy

258
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,918
grace when i say marijuana concentrate

259
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:40,718
you guys excuse the raspy voice also

260
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,718
that's from way too many dabs but life

261
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,680
goes on we must do a podcast

262
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,760
ah this does say examples of a serving

263
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:51,039
size for each type of concentrate it

264
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,319
describes the expected serving sizes for

265
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,879
a concentrate it goes on it says

266
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
regulated marijuana stores offer various

267
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,838
categories of marijuana concentrates

268
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,360
stores may refer to marijuana

269
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,000
concentrates using different names

270
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,440
including but not limited to terms like

271
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,720
shatter wax butter sugar hash resin and

272
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,480
rosin so they talk about all the

273
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,680
different names then here's where they

274
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,200
get serious

275
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,919
start low

276
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,839
and go slow that's that's real advice i

277
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,000
once heard a guy say you can't unsmoke

278
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,080
that joint can you and he was [ __ ]

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,639
right uh but it says start low and go

280
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,959
slow then it says vaping vaporizers heat

281
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,439
marijuana concentrate to release thc for

282
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:30,399
inhalation the serving size should not

283
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,040
exceed one in inhalation lasting two

284
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,039
seconds per serving so they want you to

285
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,879
vapors the heat concentrate the serving

286
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,399
size should not last exceed one

287
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,240
inhalation

288
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,120
lasting two seconds that's

289
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,480
one one thousand two one thousand

290
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,080
that's what they want you to do that

291
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,440
makes sense bro if you're new that'll

292
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,639
work for you i don't hold in a dab for

293
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,200
very long either i think that you get

294
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,480
what you need i think you just get copd

295
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,519
from holding in smoke for too long

296
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
that's all you're going to get i think

297
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
you absorbed what you're going to absorb

298
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
unless you take a giant dab then i think

299
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,160
some of it may stick to my lungs and i

300
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
just absorb it slowly over time as my

301
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,439
lungs eat it up let me get back on track

302
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,278
this says inhalation other than vaping

303
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
then it says when consuming regulated

304
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:11,600
marijuana concentrate by inhalation

305
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,839
other than vaping and this is an example

306
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,560
dabbing the recommended serving size is

307
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,560
a sphere with the diameter no larger

308
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,399
than the dot below and i'm going to show

309
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:22,159
you the dot here i'm going to hold this

310
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
up as close to that camera as i can get

311
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,199
it from my seat without messing

312
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,278
everything up but look at the size of

313
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,278
the dot

314
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,600
i tried to move that around a couple of

315
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,720
times to where i can find an edible

316
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,040
edited edit to edit a bowl do you say

317
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,480
edit a bowl quickly a spot where i can

318
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,599
edit to where we can put that picture in

319
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,120
there really good you can see it maybe

320
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,959
we could blow it up maybe i'll pick a

321
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
picture of it and drop it in but that

322
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,799
dot that's on there is not a very big

323
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,519
dot they want you to do a dab that is

324
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,599
that size in diameter like a full ball

325
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
of that most people that might get you

326
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,800
high but for me that's that's going to

327
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,479
make me wish that you would give me a

328
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,359
dab is all that's gonna do so they're

329
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,440
telling you to inhale for one inhalation

330
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,120
lasting two seconds and that's uh that's

331
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,519
if you're vaping all right and then uh

332
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,360
inhalation uh the serving size this fear

333
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,078
no larger than the dot below then it

334
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,399
says risks and precautions this is the

335
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:20,639
part where i got excited here use of

336
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,200
marijuana concentrate may lead to

337
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,159
psychotic symptoms and or psychotic

338
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,079
disorder including but not limited to

339
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:31,439
delusions hallucinations or difficulty

340
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:32,879
distinguishing

341
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,560
reality

342
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,559
that's [ __ ] extreme you've got to

343
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,719
what are you dabbing can i get some of

344
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,119
that whatever made that person get uh

345
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,079
delusions hallucinations and difficulty

346
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,078
distinguishing reality may i please i'll

347
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,159
take a gram i'll take a four gram jar

348
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,559
i'll pay cash where do we go from here

349
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,919
mental health symptoms and problems it

350
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:52,719
doesn't list any of those but it gives

351
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,919
you the

352
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,160
the thing that it looks like there's

353
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,559
more coming after that but there's no uh

354
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:00,799
stuff coming after that then it says uh

355
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,078
cannabis hyperemesis did i say that

356
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,078
right the fr that might be the first

357
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:06,319
time i ever said that correctly cannabis

358
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:08,159
hyperemesis syndrome or chs which is

359
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,079
known as uncontrolled and repetitive

360
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,000
vomiting

361
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:14,799
i think that's pesticide exposure i'm

362
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,559
not a scientist a scientologist a doctor

363
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,399
i just have a podcast i did stay at a

364
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:19,679
holiday in one time

365
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,480
but

366
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:26,319
i really think chs is probably most

367
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,800
likely a pesticide exposure i could be

368
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,360
wrong let's keep moving then it says

369
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,958
cannabis use disorder and dependence

370
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,919
including physical

371
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,159
and psychological dependence so they're

372
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,679
warning you that you may you just may

373
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:43,439
get addicted to dabbing bro um

374
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,719
i don't i don't see that happening

375
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,240
people i don't think you get addicted to

376
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,920
dabbing you may enjoy it you may want to

377
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,919
do it a lot but it does i don't in my

378
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,838
opinion i don't i don't know anybody i'm

379
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,519
not a once again i'm not a behavioral

380
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,200
therapist i'm not a an addictive

381
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,159
medicine specialist we got to call in dr

382
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,000
drew for that i do however uh maybe i am

383
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,199
addicted since i'm justifying [ __ ] here

384
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
i do take breaks and i was gonna

385
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,560
encourage you to take breaks

386
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,720
occasionally um if you follow my social

387
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:10,000
media if you watch my instagram live you

388
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,920
watched uh last year i took a couple of

389
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,679
one-week breaks and then i took a 12-day

390
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,000
break where i didn't smoke any cannabis

391
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,919
or eat any edibles for a stretch of 10

392
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,759
days and then i was one week it was 7

393
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:21,039
days and then i went for 10 days and at

394
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:22,958
the end of 10 days i said well that was

395
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,958
fun let's just keep going i went for 12

396
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,799
days uh then i just wanted to smoke just

397
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,078
because i wanted to but maybe just check

398
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:29,919
yourself occasionally take a little

399
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,958
break see if uh if that's something you

400
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,120
need to do also i consume medical

401
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,638
cannabis and would you stop taking your

402
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,078
medicine do you need a break from your

403
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,680
medicine the things that make you not

404
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,198
sick or something like that that's kind

405
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,198
of the way i see it but i do take breaks

406
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,039
occasionally it's always fun to clean up

407
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,958
the system you don't smoke for 10 days

408
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,120
and then when you do take a dab

409
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:50,479
it is [ __ ] tremendous you do notice

410
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,759
that one all right let me get myself

411
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,959
back on track there's more to this paper

412
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,039
we'll wrap this up and then start

413
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:56,399
talking about male plants here next up

414
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:58,559
on the paper it says consuming

415
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,120
concentrates via inhalation will cause

416
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,479
immediate effects that is accurate

417
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,720
that's accurate i feel like when i take

418
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
a dab if i take the appropriate size dab

419
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,600
by the time i'm done blowing it out i'm

420
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,440
like oh i'm high there it is like booyah

421
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,800
it got me and then i got to let that dab

422
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,399
kind of sink in for a few minutes and

423
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,439
let that immediate part of the dab kind

424
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,360
of wear off because it could be

425
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,279
overwhelming when you take a monster dab

426
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,839
so that is accurate it does come on

427
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,600
immediately then it says marijuana

428
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,360
concentrates and this is in bold

429
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,440
marijuana concentrates are not

430
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
recommended for inexperienced marijuana

431
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,800
users

432
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,639
then back to our normal size font thc

433
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,559
concentration amount of concentrate

434
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,198
consumed and frequency of use can result

435
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,559
in both short-term and long-term effects

436
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,399
there's moderate evidence that

437
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,479
individuals who use marijuana with thc

438
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,320
concentration greater than 10 percent

439
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,480
are more likely than non-users to be

440
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,720
diagnosed with a psychotic disorder such

441
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,800
as schizophrenia

442
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,600
and they said ah loose right they did

443
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,359
say

444
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,839
there's moderate evidence they don't

445
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,039
have solid evidence it kind of it kind

446
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
of looks like this that's what they're

447
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,039
saying that's not [ __ ] real evidence

448
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,719
then it says marijuana concentrate is

449
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,399
not approved by the fda and claims that

450
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,160
medical benefits are not supported by

451
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,600
the fda that's that makes good sense you

452
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,679
got to put that in there for legal

453
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,600
[ __ ] uh marijuana concentrates are

454
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,319
not recommended for anyone under the age

455
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,720
of 25 except if recommended by a doctor

456
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,480
people under 25 may be at greater risk

457
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,120
of potential harm because the brain is

458
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,879
not fully developed so they don't want

459
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,159
you dabbing until you're 25. sorry kid

460
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,278
you got to quit dabbing you got to wait

461
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,719
a couple years

462
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,559
keep doing your thing then it says

463
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,680
regulated marijuana stores cannot

464
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:35,039
provide medical advice i actually

465
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,399
uh i like that um they're not doctors

466
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,078
they're bud tenders most of them are

467
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
just 20 something year old chicks and

468
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,198
bros that definitely have no

469
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,320
qualification to give any medical advice

470
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,000
don't go in there and ask them what to

471
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
smoke for your seizures

472
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,639
don't do that do your own research find

473
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,639
the strains of work for you don't rely

474
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,839
on those folks don't put that pressure

475
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,919
on them don't do that don't put your

476
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,600
devil magic on me ricky bobby then it

477
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,360
says any questions related to the health

478
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
or safety of marijuana concentrates

479
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,879
should be discussed with a patient's

480
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:02,160
recommending physician or an adult

481
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,519
consumers primary care physician and

482
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,600
then as a little disclaimer on the

483
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,759
bottom this will be what we wrap up with

484
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,360
the risks are these risks are based on

485
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,639
colorado department of public health and

486
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,720
environment evidence statements where

487
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,639
there is either moderate or substantial

488
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
evidence where moderate means strong

489
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,600
scientific findings that support the

490
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,919
outcome but these findings have some

491
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,600
limitations and substantial means uh

492
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,278
robust scientific findings that support

493
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,800
the outcome with no credible opposing

494
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,879
scientific evidence that's a lot of

495
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,479
scientific gibberish that means uh we

496
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,240
did a study and nobody challenged it

497
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,680
that's why what i think no credible

498
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,278
opposing scientific yeah nobody

499
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,239
challenged it that's what i think that

500
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,078
says um on the other side it says uh the

501
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,519
following statements must be included on

502
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,039
every container of marijuana and it

503
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,278
shows you some regulations and some

504
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,719
other things and um some other stuff

505
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:46,240
that doesn't really matter on this one

506
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,959
then on the back here we have a bunch of

507
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,198
reporting agencies uh the rocky mountain

508
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:54,239
poison and drug center uh suicide

509
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,838
prevention line um youth and marijuana

510
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,799
just weird propaganda phone numbers on

511
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,920
the back here if you do have some

512
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,198
problems with something like that please

513
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:00,958
do reach out to somebody take care of

514
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,120
your mental and physical well-being and

515
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,558
if somebody you know is in uh

516
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,318
immediate imminent danger please do

517
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,759
reach out and get them the proper care

518
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,918
that's a responsible thing to say as an

519
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,439
adult with uh a show but um there's a

520
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,720
lot of stuff here on the back that i

521
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,079
really honestly found this to be

522
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,279
entertaining when he handed it to me

523
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,558
he's like here bro i have to give you

524
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,720
this when you dab and i was like bro

525
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:20,399
we've been buying dabs for years and

526
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,959
they just now realized we needed a

527
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,720
little propaganda pamphlet uh pretty

528
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,558
funny pretty cool hope you guys enjoyed

529
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,480
it i'm gonna take a quick drink then

530
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,319
we're gonna talk about a male plant

531
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,319
question that i got from our friends on

532
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,319
youtube

533
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,240
all right as promised i took a drink and

534
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
now i am back to talk about a mail

535
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,839
question that i did get from youtube

536
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,200
most of the time i don't check a lot of

537
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,240
the youtube comments and answer a lot of

538
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,519
the questions from there because i

539
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,359
prefer them to come in an email it's

540
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:49,759
easier to print and manage however this

541
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,519
one did get my attention

542
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,679
it goes a lot like this first of all it

543
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:57,119
came from be real but not the original

544
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,400
be real it is be real the other be real

545
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,639
and it says how do you measure the

546
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,880
potency of a male plant that's a very

547
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,320
good question uh with a female plant we

548
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,480
get buds we get flowers you dry them

549
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,918
cure them smoke them enjoy them and then

550
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,599
you go that one's good that one's not as

551
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,759
good that one tastes good you get your

552
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,119
own judgment your own opinions or you

553
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,400
can take it to the lab that's always an

554
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,839
option but

555
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,519
you don't get that option with the mail

556
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,959
plan there's a different process with

557
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,319
that i do have a bunch of notes here let

558
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
me keep myself on track because i do

559
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,480
like to start rambling talk over my

560
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,840
notes so male potency question how do

561
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,480
you measure the potency of a male the

562
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,918
first thing i do when i'm growing a male

563
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,000
plant and looking to work with the male

564
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,360
plant is it's always a visual inspection

565
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,558
you got to look at it what does it look

566
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,319
like does it have the traits you're

567
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,480
looking for does it re reach the

568
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,000
criteria meet the criteria which you

569
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,200
have set for that male plan what's your

570
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,079
goal what are you trying to do now

571
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,120
potency um if it makes trichomes it's

572
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,359
going to be potent that's one of the

573
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,038
visual cues for potency probably the

574
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,038
main visual cue but make sure it's got

575
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:52,960
all the other criteria potency isn't the

576
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:55,038
only thing that you're looking for when

577
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,919
it comes to a male you need structure

578
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,558
vigor shape resistance to pathogens

579
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,799
resistance to bugs

580
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,399
appropriate flowering time

581
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,599
amount of pollen that it dumps there's a

582
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,440
lot of other things to think about i've

583
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,879
done a lot of shows about that so

584
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
visually look at the plant make sure

585
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,679
it's something you want to work with do

586
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,199
you see trichomes that is going to be a

587
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,880
good indicator of a nice potent male now

588
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,038
the next step since we don't get to

589
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,799
smoke the male plant i mean you can but

590
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:21,919
uh dj short does it that's not my style

591
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,839
i don't want to smoke the male plants i

592
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,960
don't want to dry them out smoke them i

593
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:28,720
instead i do this i find multiple female

594
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,079
plants i've got one male plant a dude

595
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,600
that i think is going to be good this is

596
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,678
why breeding takes a while that's why

597
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,839
selection takes a minute so my seeds are

598
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,440
expensive you find one male plant that

599
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:39,839
you want to work with this is at least

600
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,440
how i would so i'd grow a few males i'd

601
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,759
grow a few males and i'd look look

602
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,440
visually and i'd pick one out of those

603
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,720
and that one that i selected all the

604
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,840
others would be gone all the pollen

605
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,919
would be cleaned up now if you've got a

606
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,359
fresh room with one male plant i would

607
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,759
introduce multiple female plants of

608
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,519
different genetics there would be like

609
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,440
in my case it'd probably be a strawberry

610
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,359
starburst plant a sun-kissed plant a

611
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,919
blueberry cookies plant a lemon skunk

612
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:07,199
plant those plants are all different

613
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,600
enough in growth flavor aroma

614
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,519
leaf shape plant structure that i can

615
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,359
tell what the male plant is going to add

616
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,759
when i breed to those

617
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,839
so i would pollinate several female

618
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,480
plants that are different in lots of

619
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,079
ways visually aromatically buzz wise

620
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,919
flowering times

621
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,839
so that we can kind of what we're trying

622
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,000
to do is we're mixing this paint with

623
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,279
other colors to see what other colors we

624
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,119
create that's really what we're doing

625
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,798
but we want to be able to see

626
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,959
the other colors and we want to see what

627
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,079
mixes what these two colors mix like so

628
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,360
we're trying to put reds and blues

629
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,558
together to get purple if you put a

630
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,240
bunch of purple together you're just

631
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,158
going to get more [ __ ] purple and you

632
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,000
won't know what happened so try to find

633
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,440
reds try to find blues try to find

634
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,359
things that are opposite so we can blend

635
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,798
those breed those together and see what

636
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,599
we've created so the first step

637
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:54,319
pollinate no first step selection

638
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:57,199
select males select females do a

639
00:20:54,319 --> 00:21:00,000
pollination one male to several female

640
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,519
plants finish them gather the seeds keep

641
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,880
the seeds separate the seeds that came

642
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,158
out of the strawberry plant they're

643
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,919
staying over here the seeds that came

644
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,520
out of the sun kiss staying over here

645
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,799
seeds that came out of blueberry cookies

646
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:10,000
staying over here same with all the way

647
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,519
down the line i think lemon skunk was

648
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
the other one i said we're gonna keep

649
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:16,240
all those seeds separate labeled sealed

650
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,480
safe secure then i'm gonna grow as many

651
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:21,359
as i can of each one of those batches of

652
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,200
seeds in the same uh as close to the

653
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,119
same environment as i possibly can i'm

654
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,558
going to try to get somewhere between 10

655
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,558
and 100 seeds we're just going to say

656
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,079
the blueberry cookies to our new mail

657
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,319
i'm going to bust out a hundred seeds of

658
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,759
those and grow them and see what i get

659
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,279
i'm gonna take a lot of notes i'm gonna

660
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,879
talk about i'm gonna note the growth

661
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,879
structure the speed of the growth the

662
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,799
leaf shape the shape of the plant uh

663
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,320
different phenotypes that i see i'm just

664
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,879
gonna make notes are there any weird

665
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,558
anomalies is there are there any weird

666
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
mutations or strange things that i

667
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,879
notice in that batch make all of the

668
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,640
notes you can think about then once

669
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,919
you've grown that batch run another

670
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,038
batch of something different i said the

671
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,320
blueberry this time let's do the

672
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,319
strawberry next time cause that's gonna

673
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,918
be way different you got blueberry and

674
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,000
kind of funky skittles and you got sweet

675
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,679
strawberry bubblegum watermelon let's do

676
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,240
that one so we run the strawberry to our

677
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,159
new male once again look for anomalies

678
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,919
look for growth structure look for shape

679
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,120
look for any sort of things that stand

680
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,480
out document everything that you can

681
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:16,399
we're going to do this with all of the

682
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,279
seeds that we have made with every batch

683
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,280
the strawberry blueberries uh sun kiss

684
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,678
and the lemon skunk and now what we're

685
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:26,158
going to start to see is what that male

686
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,320
adds to the mix with each plant because

687
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,039
if you only pollinate one plant then you

688
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,200
only know it's kind of a what is it a 50

689
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:35,038
50 crapshoot maybe that's what it does

690
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,880
but if you pollinate multiple different

691
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:39,440
females then you can see

692
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,159
what that male uh does what it provides

693
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,279
what it offers to other female plants

694
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,440
when you breed to it because it's all

695
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,879
about the combination what comes out we

696
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,880
want a new plant that uh outperforms the

697
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,440
original plant in a couple of ways but

698
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:56,240
we also need vigor structure

699
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,840
resistance potency aroma we need all of

700
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,519
that stuff and it needs to be better

701
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,599
than the original plant we started with

702
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,279
or we're not doing the plant any good

703
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:05,119
we're moving backwards in the evolution

704
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,759
of cannabis so pollinate a bunch of

705
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:09,199
females grow them out then take a lot of

706
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,440
notes and see what you've got then

707
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,880
compare your notes as the grower as the

708
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,798
breeder this will start coming to you

709
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,960
naturally as you're doing it you'll say

710
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,798
oh i added let's just say that you're

711
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,000
male maybe i'm going to say that it had

712
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:21,599
chocolate we're just going to guess

713
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,519
chocolate chocolate's a good flavor a

714
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,879
good trait something we would all enjoy

715
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:26,960
we're going to say that male adds

716
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,480
chocolate we don't know that yet but

717
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,038
we're going to breed that male 2

718
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,798
blueberry strawberry orange and lemon

719
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:34,640
powder it happened now we grow it now

720
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,679
we're starting to get in the blueberry i

721
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:39,440
noticed like a chocolate dark chocolate

722
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,798
blueberry peanut butter sort of a smell

723
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,919
going on that's kind of interesting some

724
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:43,519
of the phenotypes have a lot of

725
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,278
chocolate in them i grew the strawberry

726
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:46,879
out got a lot of strawberry terps

727
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,119
there's some watermelon terps like we

728
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
expected but then some of them have

729
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,558
chocolate hey guess what i wonder if

730
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,559
that male is contributing chocolate

731
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,639
terps is that what it's doing also i

732
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,399
noticed that they all grow super wildly

733
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,159
tall is that what the male's doing

734
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
you'll start noticing commonalities

735
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,760
amongst the different crosses that

736
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,519
you've made and that's how you identify

737
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,038
what the male is doing you'll start

738
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,359
noticing when i cross it to the lemon

739
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,798
skunk that i get chocolate and lemons

740
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,038
and that's how you say oh maybe that

741
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,319
plant puts out chocolate turps or maybe

742
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,079
it makes i said a minute ago it gets

743
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,599
really tall or maybe you'll notice that

744
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,240
everything you bread it to

745
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:22,240
flowers super quickly also there could

746
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,679
be negative traits sometimes the male

747
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,038
plants if they don't get enough light if

748
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,798
they start to get root bound if they get

749
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,400
thirsty if they get over fed they'll

750
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,319
just start auto flowering without you

751
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,759
telling them to that's a problem for a

752
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,918
male plant because that trait will be

753
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,278
passed on to its progeny those plants

754
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,120
will start flowering whenever there's a

755
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,880
problem and your customers or you or

756
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,399
whoever ends up with those seeds will

757
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,200
not be happy with that if they're

758
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,440
looking for a regular photo period plant

759
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,038
so the best way to do it

760
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,278
pollinate them pollinate a bunch of

761
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,679
females keep the seeds separate grow

762
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,359
them observe take notes then find

763
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,440
commonalities to see what that male

764
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,678
plant is doing i know it sounds like a

765
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,519
lot of work and it is

766
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,960
each pollination is going just to veg

767
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,798
and flower the plants you got a hundred

768
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,558
days right there then you've got to grow

769
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,400
out those seeds there's another 100 days

770
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,759
right there depending on how many you

771
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,600
can grow you've got to do multiple

772
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,200
cycles so that could take you quite a

773
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:12,719
while that's why seeds are expensive

774
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,558
that's why breeders

775
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:16,480
charge money for our work that's why we

776
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:17,599
ask for a compensation for the seeds we

777
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,679
give you that's how we build a

778
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,199
reputation is by doing that work and

779
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,200
putting out seeds that we know will be

780
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,798
reliable that you have shown a track

781
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,960
record that we do make good selections

782
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,639
with um let me get back on my notes

783
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,640
let's see visually pollinate grow the

784
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,799
seeds find the females finish them oh

785
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,400
yeah here's one of the best parts smoke

786
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,240
them you get to grow out these plants

787
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,240
these female plants that you just made

788
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,120
and you get to smoke them that's how we

789
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,960
find out uh what is really the best did

790
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,399
you now here's here's what you have to

791
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,278
do next once you've got a bunch of seeds

792
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
and you've grown them and smoking you

793
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:48,240
have to do it again with a different

794
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,759
male and see which one's better that's

795
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,599
that's a whole another what did i say

796
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,960
300 days worth of research now we're

797
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:54,959
already at two years into this project

798
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,960
just finding a mail plan that's why

799
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,640
seeds get expensive so

800
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,000
you get to grow them then you get to

801
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,520
smoke them and then you get to find out

802
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,960
what those traits are that were passed

803
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:07,918
along there are some other options that

804
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,159
you can do you can send your male plant

805
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,400
to the lab and they can test your male

806
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,799
plant for the presence of cannabinoid

807
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,000
precursors you can also test your

808
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,278
finished plant if you've got a male

809
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,640
plant that kicks out flowers you can

810
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,200
send it to the lab for testing for

811
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,400
potency that is a thing

812
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,880
you could

813
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,559
get uh precursor plants from multiple

814
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,159
male plants and send those to the lab

815
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,558
and test for the presence of cannabinoid

816
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,760
precursors and your males and that may

817
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:35,519
help you speed up your selection process

818
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:38,000
uh you could do precursory tests on

819
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,359
males and females um that'll definitely

820
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,038
speed up your process should we talk

821
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:44,240
about that a little bit does that make

822
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:45,599
any sense what we're able to do um

823
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,120
let's just say we're looking we're going

824
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,119
to breed plants and i'm looking for a

825
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,119
female plant that is super i'm looking

826
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:54,239
for only plants that are super high in

827
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,839
thc that's that's a silly goal but with

828
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,120
this project it will work for what i'm

829
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:58,240
going to talk about

830
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,678
um

831
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,919
we would grow these plants until we were

832
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,679
big enough to get a leaf sample i only

833
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,679
need two true leaves once these plants

834
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,840
have two true leaves i take a sample

835
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,960
that is the size of the the back end of

836
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,199
this pin the parts you click the

837
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,519
annoying part i need a sample that big

838
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,720
from each plant we send that sample to a

839
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:19,839
lab they test it that lab can identify

840
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,919
the presence of the precursors that will

841
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:26,240
later turn into thc so it knows that the

842
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,799
uh precursors to those cannabinoids are

843
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,720
available in that plant so they will say

844
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,119
uh this plant shows markers that are

845
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,880
high in the precursors this plant's not

846
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,558
so high in it this plant is super high

847
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,399
in it so at that point if we were

848
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,720
breeding for potency what you would do

849
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,959
is just eliminate all of the low testing

850
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,558
number plants at that time and if you're

851
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,558
looking for boys looking for girls you

852
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:47,918
can run the test at the same time to

853
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:49,678
find male and female so if you're

854
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:50,880
looking for that highly potent female

855
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,200
you got her if you're looking for that

856
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,278
highly potent male you got it now what

857
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,600
you would do what i would do since i've

858
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:59,278
already eliminated the low number plants

859
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,959
i already know that my high potency

860
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:04,159
plants are in the batch now i will look

861
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,278
for structure vigor growth uh aroma

862
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,799
color

863
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,440
resistance all of the other things that

864
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,720
may be desirable at this point

865
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,320
for the plant we already know that

866
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,679
they're super potent so now i'm pheno

867
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:15,599
hunting backwards now i don't have to

868
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
smoke it i've already eliminated a bunch

869
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:19,599
of plants through science through what

870
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,079
is known as predicative testing through

871
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:24,079
looking for the presence of cannabinoid

872
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,519
precursors i would assume you could do

873
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,599
that with the male plants i don't know

874
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,679
anybody that is doing that yet you would

875
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,439
be revolutionary you would be the first

876
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,240
uh send that [ __ ] in get it tested see

877
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,798
what pops up um breathe the mail read

878
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,399
the same email to several females and uh

879
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,079
experience and see what that mail does

880
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,000
take notes and have fun that is the last

881
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,519
of my notes that i've got down uh the

882
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,558
most important part is that you have fun

883
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,918
if you're not having fun with your

884
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,000
breeding projects if you're stressing

885
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,880
yourself out if it's driving you crazy

886
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,798
take a big breath and step back smoke

887
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,880
some good weed take some dabs dive

888
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,119
yourself into a state of which where do

889
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,480
we want to use cannabis use disorder or

890
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,719
maybe get yourself some psychotic

891
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,319
symptoms or psychotic disorder walk

892
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,480
around the block giggle a couple times

893
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:05,759
think about it snap out of it then go

894
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,919
back to the grow room back to the

895
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,919
drawing board and have fun grow from

896
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,520
your heart breed with love that is what

897
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,960
it is all about

898
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,960
the goal here is to create plants that

899
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,880
were better than the plants we started

900
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,159
with it sounds like you are uh you're

901
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,600
very interested in breeding this is a

902
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,159
great question i hope i gave you some

903
