4
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,388
podcast this episode of the show is

5
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,369
brought to you by my friends at seeds

6
00:00:09,388 --> 00:00:13,888
here now if you need new seeds in your

7
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:19,759
garden I highly recommend seeds here now

00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:35,210
batter from apothecary farms the label

10
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:38,340
says this product contains 68.4% THC and

11
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,079
79.9% total cannabinoids i've been

12
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,000
scooping up big chunks of the star dog

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,429
batter and then i'm dunking that in the

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,119
leftover turps from a jar of gg4

15
00:00:44,429 --> 00:00:47,128
ambrosia

16
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,140
I bought a big jar of the gg4 it had a

17
00:00:47,128 --> 00:00:51,179
lot of saucy turps in the bottom of it

18
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,878
so I am using the star dog batter as a

19
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,729
sponge to soak up the gg4 turps

20
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:58,500
and these dabs are delicious and

21
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:00,718
tremendous I'm always a fan of star dog

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,820
I am always a fan of the gg4 and when

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,710

24

61
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:19,629
where I live we'd like to get started a

62
00:02:17,289 --> 00:02:20,079
little bit early everybody is blowing

63
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:21,729
[ __ ] up

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,320

66
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,859
neighborhood the Sun just went down

67
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,540

70
00:02:30,129 --> 00:02:34,090

79
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,599
those folks who don't want to eat a

80
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:54,310
burger don't make fun of us invite us

81
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:56,560
over we want to have a good time too

82
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,949
that's all I've got for the 4th of July

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,539
let's segue into talking about 7:10 7:10

84
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:04,329
is the next big holiday we are going to

85
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:07,539
celebrate what is 7:10 some people may

86
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,030
not be up to speed on what 7:10 is as my

87
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:14,169
buddy Adam Hill puts it 7:10 is the new

88
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,110
for 27:10 upside down says oil so if you

89
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:19,899
right 7:10 flip it upside down that says

90
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:22,420
oil my friend task rock wanted something

91
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:24,640
new everybody's been talking about 420

92
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:26,679
for a long time tasks needed something

93
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,750
to help represent the oil movement so

94
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:32,050
him and a few other folks coined the

95
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,599
phrase 7:10 and the 7:10 movement became

96
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,270
the new concentrate movement 7:10 is

97
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:39,400
when you're supposed to take a fat dab

98
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:40,990
7/10 represents the oil movement so

99
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,969
that's where a 7/10 came from

100
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,400
that's what 7:10 is all about that's

101
00:03:42,969 --> 00:03:48,909
where the 7:10 culture erupted from so

102
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,580
7:10 is all about smoking oil smoking

103
00:03:48,909 --> 00:03:53,439
concentrates taking a DAB however you

104
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,620
want to do it it has evolved so far

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,599
since those days I remember just a few

106
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,219
years ago we would get concentrate that

107
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,229
we thought was the most amazing [ __ ] on

108
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:05,080
the planet we would smoke it we would be

109
00:04:02,229 --> 00:04:07,479
completely impressed it started off as

110
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,130
this kind of dark colored kind of look

111
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:10,869
like glass it kind of look like candy we

112
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,299
called it shatter it started off like

113
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,980
that then it got a little better then

114
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,720
people started making it more clear it

115
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:18,129
started getting more shattering you got

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,680
a little tastier we started learning

117
00:04:18,129 --> 00:04:22,540
more it got better then people started

118
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,220
making live resin we started seeing a

119
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:26,740
whole bunch of new consistencies a bunch

120
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:28,630
of new textures then a lot of us started

121
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,728
think it ourselves because something we

122
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:33,069
were smoking six months ago we would not

123
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,750
even touch at this new point in time and

124
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:36,970
it seems like the concentrate world

125
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,978
keeps evolving it seems like about every

126
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:40,750
six months there's a brand new tech or a

127
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:42,668
brand new product out that blows the

128
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:44,649
concentrate market away and then I laugh

129
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:46,060
because I'm thinking weren't we smoking

130
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:47,829
the best [ __ ] on the planet just six

131
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,389
months ago and now we have vastly

132
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:52,810
improved that to where the things I was

133
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:55,000
smoking in 2010 I probably would just

134
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,189
pass and laugh at now I would not even

135
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,769
consume that so we went from that

136
00:04:57,189 --> 00:05:01,060
shatter II stuff and we had live resin

137
00:04:59,769 --> 00:05:03,459
and people started making better

138
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:05,379
consistencies of live resin and then we

139
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:07,329
started seeing sauce and Terps come out

140
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:09,279
and then we started seeing big crystals

141
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:11,769
and now you can go to the dispensary and

142
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,119
you can get just about any consistency

143
00:05:11,769 --> 00:05:14,859
you want on my table

144
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,269
I don't really [ __ ] with shatter no

145
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,658
offense to the people that still smoke

146
00:05:16,269 --> 00:05:19,209
shatter

147
00:05:16,658 --> 00:05:20,620
I don't smoke shatter anymore I've moved

148
00:05:19,209 --> 00:05:22,779
forward from that no offense if that's

149
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,519
still what you're doing be in your time

150
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:27,098
do what you're doing but we went from

151
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:28,899
you can have shatter I've got some

152
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:30,908
batter here on the table that kind of

153
00:05:28,899 --> 00:05:33,758
looks like cheesecake batter I have got

154
00:05:30,908 --> 00:05:35,949
some HC FSE who just looks like diamonds

155
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,050
and little rocks I've got some turps

156
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:40,180
that is just saucy it looks like golden

157
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,189
water I've got some ambrosia it kind of

158
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,900
looks like a like a glass of tea with

159
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,939
ice cubes in it it's so beautiful

160
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:47,769
I have got some we've got all kinds of

161
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:49,839
different textures and consistencies we

162
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:52,089
have come so far in this oil industry

163
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,709
since we started this movement and now

164
00:05:52,089 --> 00:05:55,538
people are learning how to squish buds

165
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:57,879
and they're making rosin I've seen

166
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:59,288
people making diamonds solid diamonds

167
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:02,110
out of rosin that they're making at home

168
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:04,029
so the 710 movement has come a long way

169
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,430
I really give a lot of credit of the

170
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,978
coining of the phrase 7 10 to my buddy

171
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,168
task rock from highly-educated titanium

172
00:06:08,978 --> 00:06:13,300
also now highly-educated quartz they

173
00:06:11,168 --> 00:06:15,008
make great gavels and bangers so make

174
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,918
sure you check them out but it has come

175
00:06:15,009 --> 00:06:19,718
a long way so when we talk about 7/10 we

176
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,758
are generally talking about dabbing

177
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:24,098
we're talking about oil we're talking

178
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,560
about the concentrate movement that sort

179
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:29,168
of spawned from the cannabis revolution

180
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,089
there is the cannabis crowd but then the

181
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:33,129
dab crowd is a completely different

182
00:06:31,089 --> 00:06:35,859
level and you can spot the dab crowd

183
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:38,019
when you go to the cannabis events so I

184
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,360
feel like that is a great way to segue

185
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:42,788
into talking about 7

186
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,939
events what is coming up four seven ten

187
00:06:42,788 --> 00:06:47,378
what are you doing for the 710 holiday

188
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:49,210
710 falls in the middle of the week this

189
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:51,849
year so there will be events on the

190
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:54,188
weekend before and the weekend after 710

191
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:55,779
and that also means that when 710

192
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:57,759
happens in the middle of the week

193
00:06:55,779 --> 00:07:00,188
wherever you are whatever you're doing

194
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,280
it is time to get yourself a big fat dab

195
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:06,280
and join the world and take a DAB at 710

196
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:08,500
for the 710 movement I will be spending

197
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:11,288
