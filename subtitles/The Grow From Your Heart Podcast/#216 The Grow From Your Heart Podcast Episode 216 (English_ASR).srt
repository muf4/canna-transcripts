74
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,108
toilet paper in my nose to keep my nose

75
00:04:13,049 --> 00:04:24,780

impact it's having on the patient

338

community in California and how it

339
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,360
spanned the spectrum of users from

340
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,129
younger women who are looking to deepen

341

looking to deepen the level of intimacy

of their own bodies to older women who

343
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,179
are experiencing a reawakening of their

344
00:16:19,448 --> 00:16:23,889
own sexuality Gerson said there are a

345
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:26,169
large number of women who could benefit

346
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:28,360
from cannabis but who are interested in

347
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:30,458
the psychoactive component the products

348
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,938
expansion into Colorado is only the

349
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,559
beginning

Persson estimates Floria will be

351
00:16:32,559 --> 00:17:00,909
available in Washington state pot stores

352
00:16:34,539 --> 00:17:03,610
in the next few months I know a guy that

353
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:05,500
claims he made a lube using coconut oil

354
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:07,959
and cannabis and he says when he uses it

355
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,808
on chicks that they definitely enjoy it

356
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,640
a lot more than when he doesn't use it

357
00:17:10,808 --> 00:17:14,779
I just wanted I thought it'd be fun to

358
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,850
read this with four dudes at the table

359
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:20,269
an abyss a lot more when I use it right

360
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:22,969
then when I don't use it the article is

361
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:28,490
awesome it's just [ __ ] I've heard of

362
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:36,620
puns and shoot a lot of placebo warnings

363
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:38,750
about this you know whereas she's

364
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:40,789
spraying it on her [ __ ] in outer labia

365
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:42,529
it's working it's already moisten and

366
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:45,259
[ __ ] up and that's waking it up a little

367
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:48,920
so even if it doesn't work but have you

368
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:50,299
ever eaten like tincture or I guess who

369
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,400
just teams for the desert you get warm

370
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:54,109
inside like you feel warm and fuzzy I

371
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,820
can just imagine spending some tincture

372
00:17:54,109 --> 00:17:57,889
on my junk though let me get all sticky

373
00:17:55,819 --> 00:18:00,500
and gross that's what I felt that night

374
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:04,120
from that uh mountain bar you know

375
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,119

378
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:40,130
definitely does work that apotheca I was

379
00:18:38,029 --> 00:18:42,410
skeptical about it because I'm a pothead

380
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,330
if you smoke weed or consume cannabis

381
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:46,100
somehow to get high right but my

382
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:48,889
girlfriend actually the granny Gatsby

383
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:50,509
gave me a bottle of that Apothic Hannah

384
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:53,170
and I rub my girlfriend down with it for

385
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:56,000
like an hour and a half one night and my

386
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:58,160
to quote Pink Floyd my hands felt just

387
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,569
like two balloons they felt I feel like

388
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,320
that Mickey Mouse gloves on I was like

389
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:05,139
well my hands are big like fluffy and

390
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,149
bigger than they were

391
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:09,259
yeah I'd go to like scratch my face and

392
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,980
punch myself in the head a little bit

393
00:19:09,259 --> 00:19:11,980
because my fingers were

394
00:19:12,049 --> 00:19:17,269
it's like a boxing gloves on my mom used

395
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,920
that and she said she got high as [ __ ]

396
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,900
from it she I don't know about getting

397
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,640
higher [ __ ] from it but I definitely

398
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:27,860
felt my mom's a very small it definitely

399
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,070
helps I start off the massage with just

400
00:19:27,859 --> 00:19:35,509
coconut oil to kind of start a massage

401
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:36,649
you get to loosen up and get her I use

402
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:38,450
that app off the counter right away it

403
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,920
absorbs in too quickly and I don't think

404
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,360
it spreads enough so I get her coconut

405
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,250
oil and then I put the Apothecary in

406
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,899
there definitely I can tell it she can I

407
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,440
can see that she loosens up as soon as

408
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,970
that apothecary starts getting in there

409
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:56,630
so I have to use that word there's

410
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:58,220
nothing else to do but sometimes you

411
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,320
gotta take that job you say words that

412
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,269
you're trying to avoid a lot of people

413
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:14,359
don't like the word moist I've noticed

414
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:28,639
moist moist moist let go properly all

415
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:30,500
right this is written by John Engel and

headline is hash oil legality now

question for Colorado courts and then

419
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,390
the sub headline is by the end of

420
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:40,730
Wednesday hearing Denver District Court

421
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:42,320
Judge a Bruce Jones had concluded both

422
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,319
sides were wrong though it was still

423
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:47,799
unclear how he would ultimately rule

424
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:50,389
side note students name is a Bruce Jones

425
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:55,069
bad [ __ ] if your first name is

426
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:58,040
just an initial graphical error let let

427
00:20:55,069 --> 00:21:03,980
me be call her led to me being called B

428
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:06,559
for like that's frustrating

429
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,259
yeah this dude chose to do it he's a

Bruce Jones you chose to do it his

431
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:12,650
parents just tagged so I guess if I

432
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:14,570
wanted to be a poet or something my

433
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:16,220
middle name is Scott so I beat Jay Scott

434
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:18,730

00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:57,190
I'm spilling it I probably lost half a

443
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,199
gram that way and I was like you know

444

put a number to them it hurts you

519
00:26:41,878 --> 00:26:47,638
realize how far it goes it goes so

520
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:49,679
quickly every week I do an episode I've

521
00:26:47,638 --> 00:26:53,158
done a couple of episodes weeks where

522
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,840
I've done multiple episodes too but I

523
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:56,460
feel like I bore the people I don't have

524

I heard that noise there's a light

539
00:27:33,569 --> 00:28:08,129
coating of drywall and above your head

540
00:27:54,359 --> 00:28:12,418

00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:46,370
and just rinse them out a little bit

546
00:28:51,169 --> 00:29:00,509
coming out of the carp cap honestly I

547
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:06,119
probably is the carb cap dirty you think

548
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:07,529
dirt yeah a cleaner monkey that just

549
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,359
walks around behind me and cleans up

550
00:29:07,529 --> 00:29:11,369
after me all day let me tell you people

551
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:15,629
if you think you smoked a lot of dabs

552
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:18,329
like there are present I mean there's

553
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,060
[ __ ] reclaim coming off then a torch

554
00:29:18,329 --> 00:29:20,569
here

555
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:39,028
[Music]

556
00:29:20,569 --> 00:29:41,339
yeah I had someone ask before the

557
00:29:39,028 --> 00:29:43,528
reclaim in my work rig the other day and

558
00:29:41,339 --> 00:29:46,138
you know it's pretty substantial that's

559
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:49,558
just a cheap little break and as long as

560
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:51,478
I can suck through it it's cool but yeah

561
00:29:49,558 --> 00:29:53,999
I'd never even consider was like I'm

562
00:29:51,479 --> 00:30:04,739
just like mix that [ __ ] was [ __ ] with

563
00:29:53,999 --> 00:30:06,538
the 420 formula for 20 or whatever all

564
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:07,858
right all this BHO talk leads me right

565
00:30:06,538 --> 00:30:10,308
into this news article that i was

566
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:12,089
attempting to read so that's perfect

567
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:13,348
you're gonna hear a couple of weird

568
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:18,118
breasts for me I can feel my nose trying

569
00:30:13,348 --> 00:30:20,638
to run to determine the legal status of

570
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:22,558
marijuana hash oil in post legislation

571
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:23,788
Colorado resulted in the judge turning

572
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,398
up his hands and shrugging his shoulders

573
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:27,808
in exasperation Mike's pulling out his

574
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,428
phone to take a picture of me because I

575
00:30:27,808 --> 00:30:37,858
got this big wad of toilet paper stuffed

576
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:39,720
in my nose while I'm doing a podcast for

577
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:42,388
district court was to decide whether a

578
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,989
man named Paul man EOD man eonni

579
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:47,339
many-many if this guy Paul who was one

580
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:48,749
of the three people charged after an

581
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:50,398
explosion at a Southwest Denver

582
00:30:48,749 --> 00:30:51,989
warehouse can be prosecuted for the

583
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:54,538
crime of manufacturing marijuana

584
00:30:51,989 --> 00:30:55,999
concentrate the man's attorney Rob Corey

585
00:30:54,538 --> 00:30:59,460
who helped write Colorado's marijuana

586
00:30:55,999 --> 00:31:00,808
legalization law said Manny Oni can't be

587
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,879
charged because of Colorado's

588
00:31:00,808 --> 00:31:04,168
Constitution now protects the personal

589
00:31:02,878 --> 00:31:06,898
possession of marijuana and the

590
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:08,788
processing of marijuana plants the court

591
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,128
system is not to be used for marijuana

592
00:31:08,788 --> 00:31:12,118
regulation anymore Corey said I wish you

593
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:12,928
would have said cannabis it would have

594
00:31:12,118 --> 00:31:14,939
made it a lot better

595
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:17,190
the Colorado Attorney General argues

596
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,558
Manny Oni can be charged because by

597
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:21,869
virtue of a curiously placed comma in

598
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:23,970
amendment 64 the legalization measure

599
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:26,668
the protection for marijuana does not

600
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:29,608
cover cannabis oil like hash oil

601
00:31:26,669 --> 00:31:31,830
now the measure says its definition for

602
00:31:29,608 --> 00:31:33,928
marijuana does not include industrial

603
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:36,839
nor does it include fiber produced from

604
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:38,940
the stocks oil or a cake made from the

605
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,500
seeds of the plant the Attorney

606
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,538
General's Office which weighed in on

607
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,398
Manny oneis case even though it is not

608
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:47,398
prosecuting the case has made a similar

609
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:48,898
argument in a case in Mesa County by the

610
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:51,808
end of Wednesday's hearing Denver

611
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:53,759
District Judge a Bruce Jones it

612
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,230
concluded both sides were wrong though

613
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,898
it was still unclear how he would

614
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:59,880
ultimately rule Jones said he plans to

615
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:01,739
deny Corey's motion to drop the charge

616
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,649
meaning the case against Manny Oni can

617
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,210
proceed and here's kind of getting into

618
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:08,879
the part where it's all technical hash

619
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:10,679
oil is a potent goop left over after

620
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,179
marijuana's active chemicals are

621
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,909
dissolved from the underlying plant

622
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:24,809
material I tried real hard

623
00:32:14,909 --> 00:32:29,600
II tried hard everyone involved in this

624
00:32:24,808 --> 00:32:32,220
story in this article is it best trying

625
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,230
the cannabis often tries really hard but

626
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:45,089
they need somebody they need a guy like

627
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:54,720
you Mike except the wording hash Ville

628
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:58,019
is the potent goop leftover oil in the

629
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,639
pill is about hemp seed oil if you take

630
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:01,649
have a seed and you gather it up and you

631
00:32:59,638 --> 00:33:03,898
press it sort of like you do grapes to

632
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:07,138
make wine you get in oil that you can

633
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:09,209
make everything you can make with oil

634
00:33:07,138 --> 00:33:11,729
oil like Texans haul out of the ground

635
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,950
oil and that's what they're referencing

636
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:18,210
in that part of the bill hash oil isn't

637
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:20,970
oil oil or cannabis oil we just call it

638
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:32,450
oil because it kind of looks like honey

639
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:32,450
oil when it comes descriptive slang term

640
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,450
the judge isn't gonna drop the case

641
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,980
because I'm pretty sure this [ __ ] out

642
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:42,700
blow up this house yeah there's more to

643
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,870
the story let me read part

644
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:49,730
blowing up your house is long been a

645
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:51,109
crime in Colorado that something Rob

646
00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,470
quarry mentions and I'm gonna have an

647
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:56,178
argument later on in the story no I like

648
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:57,860
it I like forward-thinking people it's

649
00:33:56,179 --> 00:33:59,720
awesome we don't have to sit in the

650
00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:01,998
backseat of our minds and [ __ ] let

651
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,038
everybody else drive us think forward so

652
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:06,169
hash oil they describe it wrong and this

653
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:07,999
is a popular amateur production method

654
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,769
uses compressed butane gas which can

655
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:12,050
lead to dangerous explosions like the

656
00:34:09,769 --> 00:34:15,409
one that rocked the 1200 block of South

657
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,849
lemon Street last April mani Oni is also

658
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,309
charged with arson in connection with

659
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:21,318
that blast during Wednesday's hearing

660
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:23,750
Cory argued that home hash oil

661
00:34:21,318 --> 00:34:26,690
explosions our mistakes but not illegal

662
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:29,480
I compare it to frying a turkey Cory

663
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:31,668
said accidents don't mean a crime has

664
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:33,168
occurred Jones didn't seem impressed

665
00:34:31,668 --> 00:34:35,568
calling some of Cory's arguments

666
00:34:33,168 --> 00:34:38,029
circular but Jones also criticized an

667
00:34:35,568 --> 00:34:39,739
Attorney General's position I'm going to

668
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,230
tell him he's wrong I'm going to tell

669
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:44,358
him he's way wrong Jones said so he

670
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:46,519
compared it to if I'm cooking a chicken

671
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:50,088
and I burn the apartment building down

672
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:52,878
or a turkey then I made a mistake but I

673
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,168
think I'm still recklessly endangering

674
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:56,750
people and I think charges are gonna be

675
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:58,309
pressed on me even if I do burn down my

676
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,289
apartment building right if you're

677
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:12,799
frying a turkey in the living room of

678
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:15,199
your apartment you're cooking dinner in

679
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,730
the kitchen and I'm just cooking normal

680
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,618
food I got veggie burgers and some

681
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,170
[ __ ] vegetables and some rice and

682
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:22,670
some macaroni or whatever and I [ __ ]

683
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:24,470
I take a DAB and I come back in the

684
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,139
kitchens on fire Boosh

685
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:30,049
am I gonna mi gonna face charges for

686
00:35:27,139 --> 00:35:32,509
something now no as long as you were

687
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:35,810
just it was innocent you might you might

688
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,160
be legally liable for life damages okay

689
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,900
I don't know it depends a lot of that

690
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:40,789
depends on where you are at the time and

691
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,440
Mike's not a lawyer he just stayed at a

692
00:35:40,789 --> 00:35:44,619
Holiday Inn Express last night that part

693
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,929
of Cory's are giving

694
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:50,869
but the part does that doesn't apply to

695
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:53,179
butane hash oil it's your venting cans

696
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:57,099
of flammable gas into an enclosed space

697
00:35:53,179 --> 00:35:57,098
which is actually an OSHA crime I think

698
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:02,298
thing in the fire code for sure when now

699
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:04,519
when I asked the fire chief down here

700
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:07,880
because pueblos outlawed the making of

701
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:10,759
BHO a while ago and when the vote passed

702
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:12,410
I right after the pad passed I stood up

703
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:14,900
and walked back to the fire chief it

704
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:16,250
jokingly asked venting cans of butane

705
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:18,048
into your living room and lighting a

706
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:20,210
match has been illegal for how long and

707
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:23,298
he chuckled and went longer than I've

708
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:25,400
been on the job because that's a thing

709
00:36:23,298 --> 00:36:27,739
you can't don't gasoline around your

710
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:29,480
apartment and light a match and if

711
00:36:27,739 --> 00:36:59,989
you're venting cans of butane inside

712
00:36:29,480 --> 00:37:01,608
your venting gas on your article almost

713
00:36:59,989 --> 00:37:02,929
on the sidelines was the Denver District

714
00:37:01,608 --> 00:37:04,730
Attorney's Office which is actually

715
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:06,469
prosecuting the case a deputy district

716
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:08,030
attorney said the hash oil qualifies as

717
00:37:06,469 --> 00:37:10,189
pot but he said there's a difference

718
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:11,869
between amendment 64's protection for

719
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,608
processing marijuana and the state laws

720
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:16,280
for criminalizing of manufacturing

721
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:17,659
concentrated marijuana Jones is expected

722
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,690
to issue is ruling in the coming weeks

723
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:22,730
so they're saying that there's a major

724
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:25,119
difference between processing which is

725
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:29,469
properly doing that [ __ ] in a facility

726
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,210
in a tested authorized emedia proved lab

727
00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:34,399
that's also been state regulated by the

728
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,809
Health Department and like there's like

729
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,980
seven different agencies that want to

730
00:37:35,809 --> 00:37:40,150
come in and inspect your [ __ ] if you're

731
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,469
growing and making concentrates and then

732
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,088
manufacturing concentrated marijuana he

733
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,500
was doing that at his house open

734
00:37:44,088 --> 00:37:49,608
blasting so that I think that's where

735
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:52,309
the or the change happens yeah so I

736
00:37:49,608 --> 00:37:54,199
guess the point is don't [ __ ] blast

737
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:55,940
in doors don't open blast if you're

738
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:57,558
gonna blast get a closed loop and you

739
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,108
can still [ __ ] up do that safely

740
00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:00,119
there's

741
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:04,739
to be a news story about someone hurting

742
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:06,028
themselves making pho outside those news

743
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:07,710
stories don't happen because people

744
00:38:06,028 --> 00:38:09,690
don't get hurt that way that's kind of a

745
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:10,318
good point just taking your backyard

746
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:12,389
numbnuts

747
00:38:10,318 --> 00:38:23,400
everyone I know that's never blown

748
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:25,318
themselves up my extracts outdoors it's

749
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,670
pretty much I knew that already but

750
00:38:25,318 --> 00:38:28,829
they're like you always do this outside

751
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,680
was the first thing step one check the

752
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:35,519
weather I don't think there's any other

753
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,379
news that we should talk about someone

754
00:38:35,518 --> 00:38:45,088
blew up a house with alcohol here in

755
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:49,858
Pueblo the other day that's funny this

756
00:38:45,088 --> 00:38:51,599
is one of the largest alcohol we were on

757
00:38:49,858 --> 00:38:53,130
one of the routes for the Prohibition

758
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,989
this was a huge prohibition town we have

759
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,599
tunnels under this town where people

760
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:59,789
used to move alcohol from private houses

761
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,759
where it was made to clubs downstairs

762
00:38:59,789 --> 00:39:04,859
death why is it scares you bro my kids

763
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:19,588
are gonna grow up here my kids are while

764
00:39:04,858 --> 00:39:21,538
they're gonna find that [ __ ] I lived in

765
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:23,099
a house in an area I don't even know if

766
00:39:21,539 --> 00:39:26,160
I should talk about this oh there's a

767
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:27,749
part of town called go hill many years

768
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:28,858
ago I don't remember the exact year so I

769
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:30,480
don't want to be wrong and try to see I

770
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:32,130
have an idea in my head but many years

771
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,389
ago this town flooded up to like the

772
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:36,509
third storey window of a lot of

773
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:41,969
buildings downtown 1916 I think it could

774
00:39:36,509 --> 00:39:47,338
have been all agree with you a long time

775
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:49,738
ago when the pictures were yellow 44

776
00:39:47,338 --> 00:39:52,949
that's about it could've been so but

777
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:54,539
this town flooded there's a hill near it

778
00:39:52,949 --> 00:39:56,818
used to be First Street now it's [ __ ]

779
00:39:54,539 --> 00:39:58,650
Center Center City Drive or some city

780
00:39:56,818 --> 00:40:00,389
center drive that's so dumb it's first

781
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:02,519
Street [ __ ] why'd you change that so

782
00:40:00,389 --> 00:40:04,038
right up there there was a hill and it

783
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:07,318
was called go hill and that's where

784
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:09,089
allegedly all of the Italians that lived

785
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:10,650
here went and moved to that top of the

786
00:40:09,088 --> 00:40:12,389
hill and took all their lives

787
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:14,039
there they had goats up there and that

788
00:40:12,389 --> 00:40:18,000
part of town became known as goat hill

789
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:20,969
in my house I had a hatch that lifted up

790
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,110
in my bedroom like and he could lift up

791
00:40:20,969 --> 00:40:23,599
that and you'd end up in a hidden

792
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,950
basement part and then there was

793
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,650
definitely a hole that had been bricked

794
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:30,659
over and I'm pretty sure that that hole

795
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:33,630
was part of those tunnels and then I was

796
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:36,299
in a band that did a show at the Damon

797
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:38,610
Runyon theater downtown which used to be

798
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,110
the chief and if you go to one of the

799
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:41,910
little back areas by the kitchen there's

800
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,260
a tunnel that's blocked off and the

801
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:45,059
security guard wouldn't let me go past

802
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,470
that area because I was just in the

803
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,090
opening band and he's like you can't go

804
00:40:46,469 --> 00:40:49,619
back here unless I come in the band he's

805
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:52,590
like oh you can't go back here it's like

806
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:54,000
all right I tried so those tunnels used

807
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:56,300
to be used I bet that tunnel on the

808
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,579
tunnel I found connect somewhere somehow

809
00:40:56,300 --> 00:41:01,620
probably this and the hooch was made at

810
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:04,380
the top of the hill up on go hill and

811
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:06,869

837
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:26,990
shut up to the garden thanks for coming

838
00:42:25,429 --> 00:42:28,789
over and making me snap out of my funk

839
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:30,219
I've been moping around all day I did

840
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:32,300
get a little bit of work done I put uh

841
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:33,919
I've been talking about the black cherry

842
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,910
Kim phyno hunt that I'm doing I don't

843
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,599
know how much you've talked about it on

844
00:42:34,909 --> 00:42:40,909
the show I sprouted I spent 40 seeds and

845
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:43,250
35 of them made it to the flour room

846
00:42:40,909 --> 00:42:44,690
which is actually pretty impressive when

847
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,219
that many of them making all the way to

848
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,920
flour that means that there were five

849
00:42:46,219 --> 00:42:50,750
like maybe I don't I don't remember

850
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,550
exactly but some didn't germinate some

851
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:54,079
were runts and then some I just didn't

852
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,780
feel like if they were worth the space

853
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,829
so 35 of them made it to flour today I

854
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:02,780
moved 11 of them into another room

855
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:05,090
because they are males my goal is to

856
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:06,680
find a purple male and a green male

857
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,700
hopefully the light went off I gotta go

858
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:08,629
check that it's supposed to go off at

859
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:10,579
9:00 they're in a new room that got

860
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:13,099
started tonight we'll see how that works

861
00:43:10,579 --> 00:43:15,289
yeah hopefully I find a purple male on a

862
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:17,690
green male and hopefully I find a purple

863
00:43:15,289 --> 00:43:20,480
female and a green female and I'm going

864
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:24,289
to kinda collect pollen and sort of cube

865
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,840
things and see if I can't make f two's

866
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:29,269
that come out consistently purple and I

867
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:30,890
want to work them to f5 honestly it

868
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:32,750
sounds ridiculous but I want to work

869
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:33,920
into f5 to where they're purple clones

870
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,570
of each other when they could have a

871
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:41,059
problem we're having with that one I

872
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:42,880
want the same thing so happens I can't I

873
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:46,610
can't get it back that's what I want

874

dude strong [ __ ] I'm not sure what any

875
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:49,849
of that meant but that's why we bring

876
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:52,509
out I know that's why I just ran right

877
00:43:49,849 --> 00:44:00,190
nobody else did either they're all

878

879
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:03,849
working together and he turns around and

880
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:17,469
glares at me thirty seconds later he

881
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:19,299
turns around and glares again way across

882
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:20,799
the room perfectly into the trash can

883

listening to the banter that was

934

there's two of us in the room they just

974
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:43,159
yeah I got somebody else grow many

975
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:45,660
projects so many seeds to so many people

976
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:55,319
yeah guys I was promising more seeds

977
00:49:45,659 --> 00:49:57,960
nature's green remedies up all the seeds

978
00:49:55,320 --> 00:50:00,210
that I made and honestly I'm gonna get

979
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:02,159
my crew around here seeds before I mail

980
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:04,050
a lot of [ __ ] out to a distributor it

981
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:06,750
just seems like growth from the heart is

982
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:09,180
my my name of my show it's been my motto

983
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:10,619
for years and I feel like my community

984
00:50:09,179 --> 00:50:12,539
is right here and I don't need to go

985
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:14,250
sending stuff out to somewhere else it

986
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:15,869
helps you produce a better product it

987
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,338
does because I get to see clones I get

988
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:19,410
to go to these people's gardens I get to

989
00:50:17,338 --> 00:50:20,820
see what's happening guys you'll get

990
00:50:19,409 --> 00:50:24,480
seeds from me I promise I'm always

991
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:27,210
making more we're working on the team

992
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,670
now he's making more I've got breeding

993
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:31,199
space somewhere else now I promise I'm

994
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:32,550
always making more just hard to keep up

995
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:39,389
dude you guys are hungry for the seeds

996
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:40,650
thank you and I apologize yeah yeah I've

997
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:45,449
been one seed since I've been here I

998
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:48,780
just never had money at the time so

999
00:50:45,449 --> 00:50:49,889
which one do you want oh my god the ones

1000
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:59,670
that you're throwing away over there

1001
00:50:49,889 --> 00:51:02,309
would be cool getting your mail started

1002
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,780
and then if I put three or four or four

1003
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,789
or five females in the room with that

1004
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:08,490
mail sometimes they have to go into

1005
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:10,139
flour four or five six or seven eight or

1006
00:51:08,489 --> 00:51:12,299
ten days apart from each other to time

1007
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:14,909
up when the females are ovulating to

1008
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:16,930
take that pollen for sure and different

1009
00:51:14,909 --> 00:51:19,480
males don't pit different times yeah

1010
00:51:16,929 --> 00:51:21,460
honestly what I did I'll admit this I

1011
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:23,230
make my own silver thiosulfate and I

1012
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:26,318
tried a new method and I over applied

1013
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:28,719
and my male plants turned male super

1014
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,800
quick quicker than I've ever seen but at

1015
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:33,098
the same time they didn't make any

1016
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,720
pollen they made some but not nearly as

1017
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:36,818
much as I had anticipated not what I'm

1018
00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:47,169
used to so I got about a quarter amount

1019
00:51:36,818 --> 00:51:49,329
of the seeds mistakes a high-level

1020
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:58,450
mistake too so yeah if you're making

1021
00:51:49,329 --> 00:52:08,309
that you know times

1022
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:08,308
[Music]

1023
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:15,480

1024
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,829

learn that's what I think I taught you

1027
00:52:19,568 --> 00:52:28,509
that but I [ __ ] up on a big scale like

1028
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:30,460
I was going big and I kind of ruined

1029
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:32,920
some [ __ ] by doing it but we all do a

1030

1318

review episode yeah I can't believe this

1319
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:51,179
was such a big part of the end of our

1320
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:53,488
year especially with the secret cups oh

1321

1323
01:08:56,099 --> 01:09:01,349
of people in Denver through that yeah

1324
01:08:58,769 --> 01:09:02,849
people still talk to me like I'm part of

1325
01:09:01,349 --> 01:09:04,409
your crew like do you agree that well

1326
01:09:02,849 --> 01:09:06,569
and I'm like I didn't grow it do that's

1327
01:09:04,408 --> 01:09:08,308
they grow it they [ __ ] pop the seeds

1328
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:10,380
they shatter it they blasted it's all

1329
01:09:08,309 --> 01:09:11,819
fam so I have to correct people a night

1330
01:09:10,380 --> 01:09:13,498
I let them know that you drew that I

1331
01:09:11,819 --> 01:09:14,969
never take credit for your guys's grow I

1332
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:17,969
didn't grow that snuff you guys it was

1333
01:09:14,969 --> 01:09:19,739
them soil to oil yeah actually the stuff

1334
01:09:17,969 --> 01:09:22,588
for I may have grown a couple of theirs

1335
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:24,689
but I've taken credit for those so this

1336
01:09:22,588 --> 01:09:27,238
is kind of a random note a lady messaged

1337
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:29,969
me on Instagram and kind of called me

1338
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:31,408
out she said that and I'm sure I said

1339
01:09:29,969 --> 01:09:33,779
this but I don't remember the exact

1340
01:09:31,408 --> 01:09:35,278
words in an older episode I kind of

1341
01:09:33,779 --> 01:09:37,019
tried to cover my ass legally with the

1342
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:38,639
disclaimer like if you live in an

1343
01:09:37,019 --> 01:09:40,829
illegal state don't grow weed follow the

1344
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:42,868
rules and all that [ __ ] I gotta say that

1345
01:09:40,828 --> 01:09:44,248
kind of [ __ ] to cover my ass I don't

1346
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:45,479
know technically if I come on the air

1347
01:09:44,248 --> 01:09:47,158
and I say hey if you live in Florida

1348
01:09:45,479 --> 01:09:48,658
[ __ ] all the rules girl all the weed you

1349
01:09:47,158 --> 01:09:50,638
can I don't know if I'm gonna get in

1350
01:09:48,658 --> 01:09:52,229
trouble for that to cover my own ass I

1351
01:09:50,639 --> 01:09:53,940
just say follow the follow rules you

1352
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:55,229
guys but I think that you should grow

1353
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:56,638
your own cannabis if you're smoking

1354
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:58,618
cannabis if you're consuming cannabis if

1355
01:09:56,639 --> 01:10:00,420
you like it recreationally if you like

1356
01:09:58,618 --> 01:10:01,259
it medically grow the [ __ ] out of it

1357
01:10:00,420 --> 01:10:02,940
everywhere

1358
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:04,380
that's my new stance on it over grow the

1359
01:10:02,939 --> 01:10:06,089
government they can't arrest us all they

1360
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:07,498
might arrest me for saying that but if

1361
01:10:06,090 --> 01:10:09,449
they do somebody else make a badass

1362
01:10:07,498 --> 01:10:13,710
podcast and keep these going for me and

1363
01:10:09,448 --> 01:10:15,479
I mean if you are gonna do it illegally

1364
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:16,859
you know if you do it somewhat

1365
01:10:15,479 --> 01:10:18,899
responsibly and you're willing to go to

1366
01:10:16,859 --> 01:10:21,268
court for that then so be it I mean you

1367
01:10:18,899 --> 01:10:22,849
may be the change that your state or

1368
01:10:21,269 --> 01:10:25,310
your

1369
01:10:22,850 --> 01:10:26,720
yeah your communities needed to plant

1370
01:10:25,310 --> 01:10:28,310
more seeds you guys grow more weed I

1371
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:29,750
can't be a hypocrite I grow a lot of

1372
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:31,310
cannabis I think you should too but also

1373
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:36,590
know the risks if you've got kids in the

1374
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:38,150
house you could lose the kids when they

1375
01:10:36,590 --> 01:10:39,560
come in the door think about that kind

1376
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:40,759
of [ __ ] it's gonna be traumatizing it's

1377
01:10:39,560 --> 01:10:42,560
gonna [ __ ] up your life if you're

1378
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,780
prepared for that if you can handle that

1379
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,160
if you're a man and or woman enough if

1380
01:10:44,779 --> 01:10:47,300
you're transgender enough I'm not trying

1381
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:50,840
to exclude anybody I'm trying to include

1382
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,909
all of you can handle that [ __ ] grow

1383
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,920
cannabis do your thing just know what

1384
01:10:52,909 --> 01:10:56,619
the risks are there we go I'm not being

1385
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:58,789
a hypocrite

1386
01:10:56,619 --> 01:11:01,309
yeah she also called me out for dabbing

1387
01:10:58,789 --> 01:11:02,810
in the car and telling people not to I'm

1388
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:04,010
a professional lady I could dab in the

1389
01:11:02,810 --> 01:11:05,600
car if you find yourself to be a

1390
01:11:04,010 --> 01:11:07,159
professional dab in the car the people I

1391
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:15,020
was talking [ __ ] to we're not profession

1392
01:11:07,159 --> 01:11:17,840
I'm a professional card ever it's always

1393
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:30,290
parked in very certain locations where

1394
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:33,770
it's like this is dab approved places

1395
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:36,019
between here and like Boulder Fort

1396
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:37,070
Collins that I know to pull off like I

1397
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:38,450
could pull off right here there's a

1398
01:11:37,069 --> 01:11:39,889
little gas station with a car wash I

1399
01:11:38,449 --> 01:11:43,510
love to go in the car wash at the gas

1400
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:43,510
station and get my car washed

1401
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:51,530
nobody can see cars covered at all

1402
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:53,840
angles in there damn the Master Shake -

1403
01:11:51,529 --> 01:11:55,579
that's a perfect little car rig it's

1404
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,140
hard for the car Master Shake is a

1405
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:58,460
little ten mill rig it there's no way to

1406
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:00,200
hold it up in the car there's nowhere to

1407
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:09,859
put it it just falls over when you drive

1408
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:16,099
so this is mostly the hit man take more

1409
01:12:09,859 --> 01:12:18,479
than one he Nelson the cars always

1410
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:20,660
driving with the Pelley nail in the car

1411
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:23,759
you see that dude a bit in strip clubs

1412
01:12:20,659 --> 01:12:25,260
on an airplane did he really take the

1413
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:50,310
dad or did he just show off the rig I

1414
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:53,820
didn't see the real I might have been

1415
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:55,620
hypocritical but just trying to cover my

1416
01:12:53,819 --> 01:12:57,090
own ass is all I'm try not to go to jail

1417

1478
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:51,130

participate on that it's not gonna go

1480

the way you want it to and you're

1481
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:56,500
looking at local bands like Colorado

1482
01:15:54,069 --> 01:15:57,969

1493
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:19,659
job is to keep the constituents happy

1494
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:21,219

1495

1496
01:16:21,219 --> 01:16:23,710

1497
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:26,169
relationship for us because I know it's

1498

1501
01:16:30,069 --> 01:16:33,759
myself knowing what you know about

1502
01:16:32,109 --> 01:16:35,250
growing or knowing what Spence knows

1503

01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:03,130
aren't any seeds in the prize packages

1533
01:19:01,569 --> 01:19:05,288
because of legal reasons these prizes

1534

are available to almost anybody in the

1535

United States unless you're here at the

1536
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:09,880
table or you're too closely affiliated

1537
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,319
with the show by the way I make the

1538
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:24,960
[ __ ] rules they can change any time I

1539
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:27,250
decided I'm sorry we'll make a Colorado

1540
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,658
contest where I can put some ira seeds

1541
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:30,010
in there eventually I just got to figure

1542
01:19:28,658 --> 01:19:32,738
out how to do that it'll just be a local

1543
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:34,270
thing those guys dude Matty you

1544
01:19:32,738 --> 01:19:36,158
something great on a microphone you were

1545
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:40,809
you need to be podcasting all the time

1546
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:43,269
thank you yeah we have a discussion

1547
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:44,980
table every night when we take jabs we

1548
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:48,420
usually just have a session sit down and

1549
01:19:44,979 --> 01:19:51,729
talk for an hour - and just [ __ ] and

1550
01:19:48,420 --> 01:19:52,960
honestly it could be on a podcast that's

1551
01:19:51,729 --> 01:19:54,399
why I've said it before on the show that

1552
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:57,158
your table is part of what inspired this

1553
01:19:54,399 --> 01:19:58,960
podcast you guys his friend I won't say

1554
01:19:57,158 --> 01:20:00,488
his name he used to come and pick my

1555
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,618
brain for two hours at a time at your

1556
01:20:00,488 --> 01:20:04,328
table and I thought I should record all

1557
01:20:02,618 --> 01:20:06,098
this to write it down and just refer him

1558
01:20:04,328 --> 01:20:08,349
to my recordings I wish I could just

1559
01:20:06,099 --> 01:20:09,760
bring thoughts back that I have like I

1560
01:20:08,349 --> 01:20:11,889
remember something we were talking about

1561
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:14,170
but I don't remember the specifics one

1562
01:20:11,889 --> 01:20:15,079
time on an older podcast that I used to

1563
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:17,300
do

1564
01:20:15,079 --> 01:20:19,369
December lanai on the blocks on that

1565
01:20:17,300 --> 01:20:21,320
podcast we had a recording issue and our

1566
01:20:19,369 --> 01:20:23,059
whole recording got lost and we decided

1567
01:20:21,319 --> 01:20:24,559
let's just try to redo it and mimic it

1568
01:20:23,060 --> 01:20:26,120
about ten minutes in we're like this

1569
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,810
feels so fake there's no way to bring

1570
01:20:26,119 --> 01:20:32,090
back those thoughts in that conversation

1571
01:20:28,810 --> 01:20:47,330
so remaking a talk is and it's not the

1572
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:48,920
most legit thing yeah I just I wasn't

1573
01:20:47,329 --> 01:20:50,329
feeling it like it was time to record

1574
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,970
and I just wasn't in the mood and now

1575
01:20:50,329 --> 01:20:54,680
I'm way more comfortable at it so did 50

1576
01:20:52,970 --> 01:20:57,619
episodes in on this show and then I did

1577
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:58,670
about 50 with another show also so then

1578
01:20:57,619 --> 01:21:00,439
that's some time to get company yeah

1579
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:01,460
yeah I've only been a host for 50

1580
01:21:00,439 --> 01:21:02,960
episodes I feel like you've only been a

1581
01:21:01,460 --> 01:21:08,180
host for about 30 episodes to tell you

1582
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:10,130
the truth yeah yeah I'm thinking about

1583
01:21:08,180 --> 01:21:11,090
doing more frequent episodes cuz we get

1584
01:21:10,130 --> 01:21:12,350
more to listens when they're more

1585
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:14,980
frequent but I don't want to bore people

1586
01:21:12,350 --> 01:21:17,060
also I don't want to be that podcast

1587
01:21:14,979 --> 01:21:19,159
just appears for three months and then

1588
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:23,330
comes out with the show and then comes

1589
01:21:19,159 --> 01:21:24,859
out but I also don't want you to have to

1590
01:21:23,329 --> 01:21:26,149
listen to me four times a week like Joe

1591
01:21:24,859 --> 01:21:29,449
Rogan because I don't even have time to

1592
01:21:26,149 --> 01:21:31,579
hear all the Joe Rogan stuff yeah yeah

1593
01:21:29,449 --> 01:21:36,710
alright just grab the mic from Adi he

1594
01:21:31,579 --> 01:21:38,449
smacked her with it violently it's when

1595
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:45,409
they do it how about you Spence you got

1596

01:21:48,140 --> 01:21:59,450

01:22:03,050 --> 01:22:06,500
of

1603
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:08,269

1604
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:11,000
be done now is you know kind of share

1605
01:22:08,270 --> 01:22:12,260
the genetics for people there's always

1606
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,520
gonna be cuts people are gonna hold

1607
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:15,380
that's just how it works

1608
01:22:13,520 --> 01:22:45,440
but you could still share at the same

1609
01:22:15,380 --> 01:22:46,970
time yeah try not to be a clone hoarder

1610
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:49,719
I know that's hypocritical because I'm a

1611
01:22:46,970 --> 01:22:52,430
breeder and I'm kind of a clone hoarder

1612
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:54,199
but everybody's got this couple that if

1613
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:57,590
you got something to tie and CBD or is

1614
01:22:54,199 --> 01:23:01,579
really good medicine cuts are one thing

1615
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:04,909
seeds or another yeah yes I think should

1616
01:23:01,579 --> 01:23:06,289
be given out that's why you guys are

1617
01:23:04,909 --> 01:23:07,849
frustrated with me there's not a lot of

1618
01:23:06,289 --> 01:23:09,229
stuff at nature's green remedies calm

1619
01:23:07,850 --> 01:23:12,350
it's because all my locals are getting

1620
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:15,289
it there is obviously a markup when you

1621
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:16,789
go through a dealer a distributor and

1622
01:23:15,289 --> 01:23:18,470
I'm skipping that markup and getting the

1623
01:23:16,789 --> 01:23:20,810
seeds to my locals at wholesale prices

1624
01:23:18,470 --> 01:23:21,980
cuz it feels good doing that sorry that

1625
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:23,420
you guys didn't get a lot on nature's

1626
01:23:21,979 --> 01:23:24,649
green remedies who get the next the

1627
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:25,850
whole batch will probably go to you

1628
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:35,839
because my locals are served up

1629

1775
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:11,988
think about the fact that it's the it's

1776
01:31:06,590 --> 01:31:13,969
the web I said print ads to nature's

1777

1784

[Music]

1785
01:31:30,399 --> 01:31:34,670
could probably tell you by looking at

1786
01:31:32,510 --> 01:31:35,900
the the logistics on my website it tells

1787
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:38,328
me where yeah I can see where

1788
01:31:35,899 --> 01:31:40,578
everybody's IP addresses but the problem

1789
01:31:38,328 --> 01:31:42,380
is if people cheat on their IP addresses

1790
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:43,639
they can't be looking at certain [ __ ]

1791
01:31:42,380 --> 01:31:45,078
where they're from so they got to go in

1792
01:31:43,639 --> 01:31:48,288
somewhere else and then come back to

1793
01:31:45,078 --> 01:32:13,549

01:32:14,599 --> 01:32:20,210

1802

2086
01:46:21,689 --> 01:46:24,809

2087

2090

2140
01:50:55,310 --> 01:50:58,730
on this podcast so far I know remember

2141
01:50:57,649 --> 01:51:00,139
that night we sit here we talked about

2142
01:50:58,729 --> 01:51:01,339
it earlier we sat here you said across

2143
01:51:00,140 --> 01:51:03,350
the table from me and we tried to do a

2144
01:51:01,340 --> 01:51:05,239
show for like three hours and I don't

2145
01:51:03,350 --> 01:51:15,920
know if it was the dabs or if it was

2146
01:51:05,238 --> 01:51:28,369
just the focus of the group walks up in

2147
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:29,779
the room I had a recording her tour I

2148
01:51:28,369 --> 01:51:31,250
didn't delete one of the pre-recorded

2149
01:51:29,779 --> 01:51:32,389
tracks from another recording session

2150
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:33,829
and when he came around to that that

2151
01:51:32,390 --> 01:51:37,520
recording dropped into while we were

2152
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:39,019
talking perfect hey it's me man what's

2153
01:51:37,520 --> 01:51:49,810
going on it just starts talking

[Music]

2157
01:51:58,630 --> 01:52:27,409
I don't need edibles be careful please

2158
01:52:24,500 --> 01:52:28,729
luckily that's a medical only but yeah I

2159
01:52:27,409 --> 01:52:39,979
think they can only sell hundred gram

2160
01:52:28,729 --> 01:52:44,449
edibles incredible yeah I mean yeah like

2161
01:52:39,979 --> 01:52:46,969
it's read the [ __ ] life like that's

2162
01:52:44,449 --> 01:52:48,800
what that was the big lesson of 2014 is

2163
01:52:46,970 --> 01:52:50,960
why happens if you legalize weed oh as

2164
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:54,770
it turns out people don't read labels

2165
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:58,489
for [ __ ] anything ever we just take

2166
01:52:54,770 --> 01:53:00,020
pot all remember the chips that gave you

2167
01:52:58,489 --> 01:53:03,199
anal leakage like they were looking for

2168
01:53:00,020 --> 01:53:05,660
fat free and a major [ __ ] drip on the

2169
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:07,489
front of the bag and they still sold

2170
01:53:05,659 --> 01:53:09,979
everywhere and it's because people don't

2171
01:53:07,489 --> 01:53:12,500
relate those in with edibles that leaves

2172
01:53:09,979 --> 01:53:14,359
you the whole hugging a pair of weird

2173
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:16,310
jeans in a hotel room and then writing

2174
01:53:14,359 --> 01:53:20,149
about it for the New York Times we may

2175
01:53:16,310 --> 01:53:21,560
try not to shoot himself with a little

2176
01:53:20,149 --> 01:53:24,920
black kid that always says you mean to

2177
01:53:21,560 --> 01:53:26,420
tell me that yeah but you mean to tell

2178
01:53:24,920 --> 01:53:27,980
me there was some [ __ ] chips that

2179
01:53:26,420 --> 01:53:29,789
caused anal leakage and people were

2180
01:53:27,979 --> 01:53:41,759

2196
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:42,079
three-day pass I'm just working on a

2197
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,090
book in a hotel room

2198
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:46,760
I've actually got a ticket to see Doug

2199
01:55:44,090 --> 01:55:49,369
Benson on full house nine o'clock house

2200
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:51,949
it's just me I just roll solo and do the

2201
01:55:49,369 --> 01:55:53,960
back get in the car and leave when I

2202
01:55:51,949 --> 01:55:59,149
want door I wha I'm just gonna be me

2203
01:55:53,960 --> 01:56:01,550
doing the backpack in the car yeah extra

2204
01:55:59,149 --> 01:56:03,349
money I've gone with the crew of people

2205
01:56:01,550 --> 01:56:06,110
and I've gone by myself and it's easier

2206
01:56:03,350 --> 01:56:07,640
for me just going I like going I don't

2207
01:56:06,109 --> 01:56:09,109
like going with the crew but I like to

2208
01:56:07,640 --> 01:56:11,090
especially me when I'm trying to like

2209
01:56:09,109 --> 01:56:13,849
talk to people with kind of it's kind of

2210
01:56:11,090 --> 01:56:19,880
hard having 15 people when you're trying

2211
01:56:13,850 --> 01:56:21,260
to even trying to be people walk up and

2212
01:56:19,880 --> 01:56:22,880
want to talk to me they know who I am

2213
01:56:21,260 --> 01:56:24,350
so if you're hanging out with me you're

2214
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:35,960
just hanging out by yourself pretty much

2215
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:38,079
so I roll solo so crowded so well

2216
01:56:35,960 --> 01:56:38,079
attended

2217
01:56:38,279 --> 01:56:55,019
[Music]

2218
01:56:56,050 --> 01:57:02,659
there's no more playing games and I'm

2219
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:05,210
trying to come out and take some cake

2220
01:57:02,659 --> 01:57:06,859
there you go I'll be trying to talk to

2221
01:57:05,210 --> 01:57:28,520
somebody like hanging out with Mila and

2222
01:57:06,859 --> 01:57:32,059
then the people with me there's

2223
01:57:28,520 --> 01:57:34,310
something I don't understand right now

2224
01:57:32,060 --> 01:57:37,130
it'll probably explain later with this

2225
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:39,719
guy even lunch can be a mild adventure

2226
01:57:37,130 --> 01:57:41,579
where famous people just appear

2227
01:57:39,719 --> 01:57:43,560
you just gotta accept it it's bizarre

2228
01:57:41,579 --> 01:57:45,930
you just got to know how to put yourself

2229
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:47,250
in the position and line yourself up to

2230
01:57:45,930 --> 01:57:48,719
meet the people you want to meet without

2231
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:50,310
being creepy and realize they're just

2232
01:57:48,719 --> 01:57:52,079
[ __ ] people - and if they open with

2233
01:57:50,310 --> 01:57:53,100
the right lines they're just humans -

2234
01:57:52,079 --> 01:57:55,979
and they realize that you're not a

2235
01:57:53,100 --> 01:58:00,420
stalker they want I did I have nobody

2236
01:57:55,979 --> 01:58:02,698
perfect and I'm sure I kind of got a

2237
01:58:00,420 --> 01:58:04,469
nice dude that it tells the truth most

2238
01:58:02,698 --> 01:58:06,119
the time I thought maybe when DNA

2239
01:58:04,469 --> 01:58:07,649
genetics walked up to me and shook my

2240
01:58:06,119 --> 01:58:09,448
hand because they recognized me and my

2241
01:58:07,649 --> 01:58:10,649
logo from Instagram like hey I know who

2242
01:58:09,448 --> 01:58:12,210

2243
01:58:10,649 --> 01:58:13,979
me he gave me props for my work that

2244
01:58:12,210 --> 01:58:15,448

2258
01:58:58,670 --> 01:59:01,770
[Music]

2259
01:59:02,090 --> 01:59:05,850
I'm so much more comfortable on a mic

2260
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:07,230
night is swing the mic in front of me I

2261
01:59:05,850 --> 01:59:09,720
don't do that edit the shows anymore I'm

2262
01:59:07,229 --> 01:59:11,759
just like podcast time I feel better

2263
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:14,159
putting some of me into the show instead

2264
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:15,480
just being all information I feel like

2265
01:59:14,159 --> 01:59:18,389
I've made a lot of friends now and from

2266
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:20,279
listening to I listen to The Nerdist and

2267
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:22,350
I listened to Doug Benson and now when I

2268
01:59:20,279 --> 01:59:23,849
see those guys like I saw Nerdist Chris

2269
01:59:22,350 --> 01:59:25,289
Hardwick at Red Rocks it was like

2270
01:59:23,850 --> 01:59:27,810
watching one of my friends achieve a

2271
01:59:25,289 --> 01:59:28,909
goal so I feel like maybe my listeners

2272
01:59:27,810 --> 01:59:30,720
feel like I'm one of their buddies

2273
01:59:28,909 --> 01:59:32,250
especially the people to interact with

2274
01:59:30,720 --> 01:59:34,650
me on Twitter and [ __ ] I know I'm their

2275
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:37,439
friends like if I met mr. Romney oh he

2276
01:59:34,649 --> 01:59:38,729
lives in the UK if he showed up he'd

2277
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:40,199
bring the doorbell he'd come in to take

2278
01:59:38,729 --> 01:59:42,149
dad's and hang out dude I'd make a cup

2279
01:59:40,199 --> 01:59:45,149
of yerba mate and we chill on he'd be my

2280
01:59:42,149 --> 01:59:47,639
bro and just because I have a podcast so

2281
01:59:45,149 --> 01:59:48,960
that guy's my friend now from that Fred

2282
01:59:47,640 --> 01:59:50,610

01:59:48,960 --> 02:00:12,930
take dabs we just killed Mike with the

2284

nicotine shout out oh don't do that

2286
02:00:16,260 --> 02:00:19,770

2287
02:00:17,609 --> 02:00:25,229

2288
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:28,400

2289
02:00:25,229 --> 02:00:30,419
dough torch to the dome

2290
02:00:28,399 --> 02:00:34,889

2291
02:00:30,420 --> 02:00:36,960

2292
02:00:34,890 --> 02:00:40,650

2293
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:41,789
borderline all right does anybody else

2294
02:00:40,649 --> 02:00:43,439

2301
02:00:57,989 --> 02:01:03,420

2302
02:01:02,069 --> 02:01:05,969

02:01:23,909 --> 02:01:27,210
much and in realize you absorb so much

2308
02:01:25,409 --> 02:01:28,529
of what I taught you I learned from you

2309
02:01:27,210 --> 02:01:30,359
guys - it's not just me teaching you

2310
02:01:28,529 --> 02:01:31,949
guys I come and pair it a lot of [ __ ]

2311
02:01:30,359 --> 02:01:33,299
that Spence says just in my own language

2312
02:01:31,949 --> 02:01:44,789
you know what I mean I learned [ __ ] from

2313
02:01:33,300 --> 02:01:47,279
you guys every day yes even Clint and

2314
02:01:44,789 --> 02:01:51,119
Mike Mike stop me gross [ __ ] on accident

2315
02:01:47,279 --> 02:01:52,679
just not just refreshing your mind think

2316
02:01:51,119 --> 02:01:54,329
about growing is about growing there's

2317
02:01:52,680 --> 02:01:56,400
simple [ __ ] in your grow room that Mike

2318
02:01:54,329 --> 02:01:57,539
may go why is that turned alley if you

2319
02:01:56,399 --> 02:01:59,729
turn that way you'd get better air flow

2320
02:01:57,539 --> 02:02:02,369
and I'm just giving random examples

2321
02:01:59,729 --> 02:02:04,519
there's like physics and [ __ ] to be done

2322
02:02:02,369 --> 02:02:07,229
in the grow room shot a Tony also sorry

2323
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:08,520
he keeps the website going he keeps the

2324
02:02:07,229 --> 02:02:11,609
feed going and he's one of them when I

2325
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:13,650
sent physics I thought it was about air

2326
02:02:11,609 --> 02:02:14,789
flow and a lot of that [ __ ] so good even

2327
02:02:13,649 --> 02:02:16,319
if your friends aren't the best growers

2328
02:02:14,789 --> 02:02:18,239
you can learn accidentally about HVAC

2329
02:02:16,319 --> 02:02:19,859
you can learn plumbing like all that

2330
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:22,409
[ __ ] comes in handy so don't ever take

2331
02:02:19,859 --> 02:02:24,599
anybody for granted octave on ya and

2332
02:02:22,409 --> 02:02:28,340
Scott and Scott don't ever listen to

2333
02:02:24,600 --> 02:02:28,340
this probably but they at least deserve

2334
02:02:29,180 --> 02:02:37,099
[Music]

2335
02:02:40,130 --> 02:02:44,369

02:02:46,409 --> 02:02:49,609
dissing you on the other show bro I'm

2339
02:02:48,329 --> 02:03:27,000
sorry

2340
02:02:49,609 --> 02:03:29,519
also shot at the dreadful J version

2341
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:31,590
somehow every single in the day I used

2342
02:03:29,520 --> 02:03:33,030
to play like Marlon Asher and popular

2343
02:03:31,590 --> 02:03:36,650
reggae and they never flagged any of my

2344
02:03:33,029 --> 02:03:36,649
shows but I only have like 100 listens

2345
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:46,810
[Music]

2346

2349
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:05,420
promise I'll have everybody here again

2350
02:04:06,828 --> 02:04:11,189
it's harder to get ladies on the show

2351
02:04:08,969 --> 02:04:12,539
there aren't as many ladies guys have

2352
02:04:11,189 --> 02:04:13,799
more [ __ ] to talk about cuz we're kind

radio I haven't paid too much attention

2397
02:06:44,569 --> 02:06:47,659
to how to do it but it sounds like a

2398
02:06:45,800 --> 02:06:49,909
great idea to where it will give me

2399
02:06:47,659 --> 02:06:51,829
money to give away to my listeners and

2400
02:06:49,909 --> 02:06:53,779
also help fund the podcast a little and

2401
02:06:51,829 --> 02:06:55,880
like Maddy said I do put some time into

2402
02:06:53,779 --> 02:06:57,319
this they everybody here spent about an

2403
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:58,909
hour with me before we even recorded

2404
02:06:57,319 --> 02:07:01,159
putting the show together

2405
02:06:58,909 --> 02:07:03,019
I was thinking what we were talking what

2406
02:07:01,159 --> 02:07:06,019
it would cost to get all of us in a room

2407
02:07:03,020 --> 02:07:11,870
huh say for like a two hour consultation

2408
02:07:06,020 --> 02:07:15,350
with the business and it's expensive for

2409
02:07:11,869 --> 02:07:16,970
that kind of if you think it is upfront

2410
02:07:15,350 --> 02:07:19,250
and honest as we are at the podcast I'm

2411
02:07:16,970 --> 02:07:22,430
sitting thinking about the content over

2412
02:07:19,250 --> 02:07:27,109
the last 50 episodes and if you go back

2413
02:07:22,430 --> 02:07:28,940
and cherry-pick say like the outdoors or

2414
02:07:27,109 --> 02:07:30,429
and they're growing and caring and

2415
02:07:28,939 --> 02:07:34,460
harvesting episodes

2416
02:07:30,430 --> 02:07:37,340
that's like job training if you pay

2417
02:07:34,460 --> 02:07:39,170
attention to take notes you can fully

2418
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:41,690
have a career based on that information

2419
02:07:39,170 --> 02:07:43,760
if you put a couple of years of practice

2420
02:07:41,689 --> 02:07:45,229
into it and do your own independent

2421
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:55,310
research that's the found it that's like

2422
02:07:45,229 --> 02:07:57,349
a bachelor's degree lessons this year me

2423
02:07:55,310 --> 02:08:00,620
through my outdoor this year you know

2424
02:07:57,350 --> 02:08:02,450
there was a wheat dried and cured

2425
02:08:00,619 --> 02:08:03,890
absolutely and then Shawn came and

2426
02:08:02,449 --> 02:08:05,689
talked to you about organics and taught

2427
02:08:03,890 --> 02:08:07,460
you how to not go buy bottled nutrients

2428
02:08:05,689 --> 02:08:09,529
anymore and I mean just yesterday I

2429
02:08:07,460 --> 02:08:16,550
mixed up a girl Kashi you know I'm

2430
02:08:09,529 --> 02:08:18,109
saying like right here that will teach

2431
02:08:16,550 --> 02:08:20,420
us how to make cash but at the same time

2432
02:08:18,109 --> 02:08:21,679
that's risky because we can't teach you

2433
02:08:20,420 --> 02:08:29,659
how to open blast because that's not

2434
02:08:21,680 --> 02:08:31,280
legit and then nobody wants to give will

2435
02:08:29,659 --> 02:08:35,569
get Fred Morris or somebody to come

2436
02:08:31,279 --> 02:08:37,189
teach you how to make water hash please

2437
02:08:35,569 --> 02:08:39,559
I want you to come on and teach us how

2438
02:08:37,189 --> 02:08:41,479
to make water hash you know cross the

Angeles where most of our favorite

2650
02:19:35,489 --> 02:19:38,610
comedians seem to have gotten their

2651
02:19:36,929 --> 02:19:41,700
start at least at least went through

2652
02:19:38,610 --> 02:19:44,040

2653
02:19:41,700 --> 02:19:46,769
his comedy last night man he tore it up

2654
02:19:44,040 --> 02:19:48,510
so I have never seen or paid attention

2655
02:19:46,769 --> 02:19:49,889
to Steve Simone on the way up

2656
02:19:48,510 --> 02:19:52,020

2657
02:19:49,889 --> 02:19:53,909
opening act dude Steve Simone was

2658
02:19:52,020 --> 02:19:55,710
amazingly funny he's a mostly clean

2659
02:19:53,909 --> 02:19:58,500
comic he didn't I don't think he ever

2660
02:19:55,709 --> 02:20:00,299
said [ __ ] he might have but I mean it

2661
02:19:58,500 --> 02:20:03,450
was in passing I think it was something

2662
02:20:00,299 --> 02:20:06,688
where it was it was so fun he just he's

2663
02:20:03,450 --> 02:20:10,650
a ball of energy and he's still in sixth

2664
02:20:06,689 --> 02:20:13,470
or fifth grade yeah thirty-five-year-old

2665
02:20:10,649 --> 02:20:15,449
sixth grader yeah yeah it's kind of cute

2666
02:20:13,469 --> 02:20:17,340
it's adorable man watching him wiggle

2667
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:19,290
around all uncomfortable but comfortable

2668
02:20:17,340 --> 02:20:20,579
you know like like he's got all that

2669
02:20:19,290 --> 02:20:22,560
attention that he wanted but now he's

2670
02:20:20,579 --> 02:20:24,420
like oh [ __ ] I've got the attention and

2671
02:20:22,559 --> 02:20:26,159
he starts wiggling but he tore it up he

2672
02:20:24,420 --> 02:20:28,350
crushed it was real fun and then

2673

2872
02:27:42,029 --> 02:27:48,088
want Angela used to dab with me like a

2873
02:27:46,109 --> 02:27:50,219
[ __ ] champion do Angela used to smoke

2874
02:27:48,088 --> 02:27:52,109
fat joints she would roll joints the

2875
02:27:50,218 --> 02:27:53,818
size of my middle finger and I've got a

2876
02:27:52,109 --> 02:27:56,009
big middle finger and her and I would

2877
02:27:53,818 --> 02:27:57,628
smoke them just to the dome and then

2878
02:27:56,009 --> 02:27:58,949
she'd roll another one and smoke weed

2879
02:27:57,629 --> 02:28:01,709
smoke half of that and then put it out

2880
02:27:58,949 --> 02:28:04,319
and smoke it later so she was a heavy

2881
02:28:01,709 --> 02:28:07,109
smoker one day she had a mean headache

2882
02:28:04,318 --> 02:28:09,059
and somebody did the hippy pressure

2883
02:28:07,109 --> 02:28:10,709
point where they squeeze between your

2884
02:28:09,059 --> 02:28:12,028
forefinger and your thumb there's a

2885
02:28:10,709 --> 02:28:13,079
little spot in there that all your old

2886
02:28:12,029 --> 02:28:14,520
hippy friends will tell you if you

2887
02:28:13,078 --> 02:28:16,828
squeeze that and rub that a little bit

2888
02:28:14,520 --> 02:28:18,859
your headache will go away so one of our

2889
02:28:16,828 --> 02:28:22,199
silly hippy friends did that and she

2890
02:28:18,859 --> 02:28:24,270
completely blacked out I did a little

2891
02:28:22,199 --> 02:28:25,619
fluttering and she hit the floor and

2892
02:28:24,270 --> 02:28:29,039
when she came to she was really

2893
02:28:25,619 --> 02:28:30,929
disoriented and kind of groggy and it's

2894
02:28:29,039 --> 02:28:33,539
been labeled a seizure is what everybody

2895
02:28:30,929 --> 02:28:36,299
any medical person has called it and so

2896
02:28:33,539 --> 02:28:37,560
she went home she got home from work and

2897
02:28:36,299 --> 02:28:38,909
what's the first thing you want to do

2898
02:28:37,559 --> 02:28:40,078
after that you want to go [ __ ] smoke

2899
02:28:38,908 --> 02:28:41,458
a joint after you just had some

2900
02:28:40,078 --> 02:28:45,478
traumatic [ __ ] like that happened to you

2901
02:28:41,459 --> 02:28:47,310
she tried that and she told me that she

2902
02:28:45,478 --> 02:28:49,108
felt like she was tripping she's like

2903
02:28:47,309 --> 02:28:51,478
I'm hallucinating I'm seeing [ __ ] and

2904
02:28:49,109 --> 02:28:52,859
she put a blanket over her head and laid

2905
02:28:51,478 --> 02:28:55,618
down on the couch in the fetal position

2906
02:28:52,859 --> 02:28:57,658
and wouldn't talk to me for like an hour

2907
02:28:55,619 --> 02:28:59,429
yeah she was hating life and this is a

2908
02:28:57,658 --> 02:29:01,529
girl that I've seen take half gram dabs

2909
02:28:59,429 --> 02:29:03,898
and laugh at me she just make fun of

2910
02:29:01,529 --> 02:29:05,158
Adam we would smoke and Adam what a POW

2911
02:29:03,898 --> 02:29:08,328
and want to go home and she'd be like

2912
02:29:05,158 --> 02:29:08,328
come on [ __ ] smoke a joint

2913
02:29:14,079 --> 02:29:18,440
she said that she used to smoke two

2914
02:29:16,129 --> 02:29:20,089
grams of wax a day by herself and her

2915
02:29:18,440 --> 02:29:22,340
and I hanging out together we kill and

2916
02:29:20,090 --> 02:29:24,200
hate the hash and a day just on a normal

2917
02:29:22,340 --> 02:29:26,960
day just her and I smoking yeah

2918
02:29:24,200 --> 02:29:28,970
yeah so she went home and smoked one

2919
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:30,799
joint or one dab or whatever and was

2920
02:29:28,969 --> 02:29:32,389
freaking out and she thought maybe it's

2921
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:33,679
just today you know she gave it some

2922
02:29:32,389 --> 02:29:34,699
time and what about her life but she

2923
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:37,130
still had a headache and didn't feel

2924
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:38,600
right and so she smoked more weed and

2925
02:29:37,129 --> 02:29:40,819
every time she would smoke weed she

2926
02:29:38,600 --> 02:29:41,840
would just get ridiculously high it was

2927
02:29:40,819 --> 02:29:46,100
like hanging out with a high fifth

2928
02:29:41,840 --> 02:29:47,809
grader like it's really what was

2929
02:29:46,100 --> 02:29:50,390
happening to her she went from a pro to

2930
02:29:47,809 --> 02:29:51,529
Clint yeah just we had to babysit her

2931
02:29:50,389 --> 02:29:53,449
when she would get high and she'd get

2932
02:29:51,530 --> 02:29:55,520
super-anxious a lot of anxiety from

2933
02:29:53,450 --> 02:29:57,320
smoking weed so we found a few strains

2934
02:29:55,520 --> 02:29:58,819
that would work better the Platinum og

2935
02:29:57,319 --> 02:30:00,920
was working well and the Girl Scout

2936
02:29:58,819 --> 02:30:02,690
cookies was getting her to high but it

2937
02:30:00,920 --> 02:30:05,030
was the kind of a more comfortable high

2938
02:30:02,690 --> 02:30:06,440
floor it seemed like so she didn't feel

2939
02:30:05,030 --> 02:30:08,150
he was it's been about a month and she

2940
02:30:06,440 --> 02:30:10,370
really did not feel good a few days ago

2941
02:30:08,149 --> 02:30:38,209
it's been about a week right yeah and

2942
02:30:10,370 --> 02:30:40,670
she felt like [ __ ] yeah and not being

2943
02:30:38,209 --> 02:30:42,799
able to obviously you kind of Jones for

2944
02:30:40,670 --> 02:30:44,059
some smoke because it's ritualistic it's

2945
02:30:42,799 --> 02:30:45,559
not just wanting to get high her and I

2946
02:30:44,059 --> 02:30:47,000
used to pass a joint back and forth and

2947
02:30:45,559 --> 02:30:48,649
lay around and smoke a joint together it

2948
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:52,040
was like you just feel good feels good

2949
02:30:48,649 --> 02:30:53,600
to get stoned and smoke and like being

2950
02:30:52,040 --> 02:30:56,060
sick and not being able to smoke the

2951
02:30:53,600 --> 02:30:57,440
medicine that she relied on it's driving

2952
02:30:56,059 --> 02:31:00,350
her crazy I can [ __ ] see it it's

2953
02:30:57,440 --> 02:31:02,329
making her kind of grouchy so we going

2954
02:31:00,350 --> 02:31:03,800
we call my friend Joey at natural mystic

2955
02:31:02,329 --> 02:31:04,879
cannabis caregivers about a week ago and

2956
02:31:03,799 --> 02:31:06,889
I'm like hey bro do you have any high

2957
02:31:04,879 --> 02:31:08,839
CBD and he said I sure do come on up to

2958
02:31:06,889 --> 02:31:10,250
the shop we'll get you set up I wish I

2959
02:31:08,840 --> 02:31:12,260
could remember the bud tenders name she

2960
02:31:10,250 --> 02:31:14,510
was beautiful she was super helpful and

2961
02:31:12,260 --> 02:31:16,670
I would hire her if I owned a shop any

2962
02:31:14,510 --> 02:31:18,319
day that girl knew about cannabis she

2963
02:31:16,670 --> 02:31:19,399
had great skills I wish I remembered her

2964
02:31:18,319 --> 02:31:20,510
name cuz she was awesome I don't know

2965
02:31:19,399 --> 02:31:21,239
that she'll ever listen to this but she

2966
02:31:20,510 --> 02:31:23,399
deserves a shot

2967
02:31:21,239 --> 02:31:26,728
so we go through we get the CBD medicine

2968
02:31:23,399 --> 02:31:28,619
and we got canna tonic can ASSU and Tora

2969
02:31:26,728 --> 02:31:35,129
Bora and they're all super high CBD

2970
02:31:28,620 --> 02:31:37,650
strains and we okay okay thank you but

2971
02:31:35,129 --> 02:31:38,939
we get we get to the car I'm trying to

2972
02:31:37,649 --> 02:31:40,500
be discrete but we go to the [ __ ] car

2973
02:31:38,940 --> 02:31:42,750
and she wasn't gonna wait she rolled up

2974
02:31:40,500 --> 02:31:44,579
the joint and she started smoking it and

2975
02:31:42,750 --> 02:31:46,290
she got about halfway through the joint

2976
02:31:44,579 --> 02:31:47,909
and I looked over like you're smoking

2977
02:31:46,290 --> 02:31:49,050
like a lot of weed over there for

2978
02:31:47,909 --> 02:31:50,819
someone that has panic attacks or

2979
02:31:49,049 --> 02:31:59,219
smoking weed and she looked at me and

2980
02:31:50,819 --> 02:32:01,978
she goes I'm high and smiled okay it was

2981
02:31:59,219 --> 02:32:03,719
definitely so for myself I've smoked a

2982
02:32:01,978 --> 02:32:05,279
lot of CBD cannabis and I've written it

2983
02:32:03,719 --> 02:32:07,289
off because it didn't seem to really do

2984
02:32:05,280 --> 02:32:08,940
anything for me it didn't do I want to

2985
02:32:07,290 --> 02:32:11,490
get high when I smoke I want to feel

2986
02:32:08,940 --> 02:32:12,720
that cycle or that psychedelic it's

2987
02:32:11,489 --> 02:32:16,978
slightly I don't even know what to call

2988
02:32:12,719 --> 02:32:18,869
that head change and CBD doesn't do that

2989
02:32:16,978 --> 02:32:20,489
so I've written it off if they're like

2990
02:32:18,870 --> 02:32:21,600
this is a high CBD strain I'm like well

2991
02:32:20,489 --> 02:32:23,219
I'm not gonna smoke at all that you

2992
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:24,750
smoked it cuz you have pain and enjoy it

2993
02:32:23,219 --> 02:32:27,959
because I'm just wasting that dab or

2994
02:32:24,750 --> 02:32:30,329
that joint and so I know it's helpful

2995
02:32:27,959 --> 02:32:32,789
for patients but watching her it changed

2996
02:32:30,329 --> 02:32:35,010
our entire day just she smoked that

2997
02:32:32,790 --> 02:32:38,729
joint and half of another one and then I

2998
02:32:35,010 --> 02:32:40,409
smoked half of one with her and I had

2999
02:32:38,728 --> 02:32:42,179
taken a couple dabs we stopped a smoke

3000
02:32:40,409 --> 02:32:43,319
on the drive and I we pulled over and

3001
02:32:42,180 --> 02:32:45,210
got out and did a little hike and she

3002
02:32:43,319 --> 02:32:47,309
and I took a couple dabs but then after

3003
02:32:45,209 --> 02:32:49,559
I smoked that joint it felt like my dad

3004
02:32:47,309 --> 02:32:51,029
hi was kind of diminished it was like

3005
02:32:49,559 --> 02:32:52,439
now you're not as high as you used to be

3006
02:32:51,030 --> 02:32:54,600
I was like why am I getting

3007
02:32:52,440 --> 02:32:57,810
Mellott but it made me higher for a

3008
02:32:54,600 --> 02:32:59,760
really long time and we got giggly we

3009
02:32:57,809 --> 02:33:03,329
both got Connie and I don't get giggly

3010
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:06,000
from smoking weed but CBD after a couple

3011
02:33:03,329 --> 02:33:08,219
of dabs changed dabs don't give me an

3012
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:09,950
eye high when I smoked weed back in the

3013
02:33:08,219 --> 02:33:11,909
day my eyes would get all droopy my

3014
02:33:09,950 --> 02:33:14,520
dad's don't do that to me

3015
02:33:11,909 --> 02:33:16,079
but the CBD weed totally put that back

3016
02:33:14,520 --> 02:33:17,940
it did that so I think I'm missing

3017
02:33:16,079 --> 02:33:19,590
something when I'm dabbing I think I

3018
02:33:17,940 --> 02:33:22,770
need to smoke more flowers and I think I

3019
02:33:19,590 --> 02:33:24,360
also need to incorporate more CBD excuse

3020
02:33:22,770 --> 02:33:26,920
me and get clogged up yeah do you feel

3021
02:33:24,360 --> 02:33:30,189
like CBD is like a like a

3022
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:31,540
No not to call marijuana like a hard

3023
02:33:30,189 --> 02:33:34,899
drug or anything but do you feel like

3024
02:33:31,540 --> 02:33:37,060
CBD is a drug unto itself like THC is

3025
02:33:34,899 --> 02:33:39,850
what drug and then see CBD is a drug

3026
02:33:37,059 --> 02:33:42,909
calm like you you like when you get your

3027
02:33:39,850 --> 02:33:44,260
tolerance going for THC maybe that's not

3028
02:33:42,909 --> 02:33:45,939
the same tall and she would have 4c be

3029
02:33:44,260 --> 02:33:47,739
right it's a different compound it's

3030
02:33:45,939 --> 02:33:49,809
affecting a cv d receptor instead of a

3031
02:33:47,739 --> 02:33:51,549
THC receptor which is also a cannabinoid

3032
02:33:49,809 --> 02:33:52,930
receptor but it's gonna affect you

3033
02:33:51,549 --> 02:33:54,549
differently yeah well that sounds like

3034
02:33:52,930 --> 02:33:57,159
something that that people should be

3035
02:33:54,549 --> 02:33:58,509
aware of like no it's not just marijuana

3036
02:33:57,159 --> 02:34:00,280
it's like no you need to kind of know

3037
02:33:58,510 --> 02:34:02,649
what's in that like or what style

3038
02:34:00,280 --> 02:34:05,470

3076

3077
02:35:50,209 --> 02:35:57,470
can say yeah I can say that there are

3078
02:35:53,379 --> 02:35:59,720
over 200 lights and that it's hydro and

3079
02:35:57,470 --> 02:36:01,699
that the rooms are [ __ ] awesome like

3080
02:35:59,720 --> 02:36:02,840
I've been in a water grows a lot of big

3081
02:36:01,700 --> 02:36:04,940
grows and when I walked in there I win

3082
02:36:02,840 --> 02:36:06,799
damn you guys did this [ __ ] right yeah

3083
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:08,659
like there's a showroom you open these

3084
02:36:06,799 --> 02:36:09,829
two swinging doors I dunno if it's

3085
02:36:08,659 --> 02:36:11,539
double doors or one door it's a huge

3086
02:36:09,829 --> 02:36:12,560
[ __ ] door you open it you walk in and

3087
02:36:11,540 --> 02:36:15,351
there's a showroom

3088
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:17,869
that's the grounds are glass so that you

3089
02:36:15,351 --> 02:36:20,450
can see into two rooms ocean the water

3090
02:36:17,870 --> 02:36:23,030
room yeah so there will be they plan to

3091
02:36:20,450 --> 02:36:36,230
do like visual tours and [ __ ] haha I'm

3092
02:36:23,030 --> 02:36:39,320
down yeah get me on that that's just

3093
02:36:36,229 --> 02:36:40,579
cool yeah it is yeah I'm hoping to do a

3094
02:36:39,319 --> 02:36:42,909
lot of things with there I've got ideas

3095
02:36:40,579 --> 02:36:45,890
they've got ideas we just need to agree

3096
02:36:42,909 --> 02:36:48,079
yeah so she's backing up another bowl

3097
02:36:45,890 --> 02:36:49,909
over there about of that CBD has it been

3098
02:36:48,079 --> 02:36:51,379
other than today has it been helping you

3099
02:36:49,909 --> 02:37:00,470
I know today was an extra stressful

3100
02:36:51,379 --> 02:37:02,629
shitty day for you for sure I'm pretty

3101
02:37:00,470 --> 02:37:06,560
sure if I smoke this before work that I

3102
02:37:02,629 --> 02:37:10,009
would have felt better than to bail out

3103
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:15,560
halfway through so why would you do that

3104
02:37:10,010 --> 02:37:17,510
I don't work she works with the person

3105
02:37:15,560 --> 02:37:19,190
that did the hippy [ __ ] hand

3106
02:37:17,510 --> 02:37:22,010
technique and he's kind of sympathetic

3107
02:37:19,190 --> 02:37:25,100
still so you should play that card

3108
02:37:22,010 --> 02:37:25,100
[Music]

3109
02:37:28,659 --> 02:37:33,171
that's basically what it is I'm gonna

3110
02:37:31,700 --> 02:37:35,091
take a dabble you want to hit that bowl

3111
02:37:33,171 --> 02:37:36,711
while I take a DAB clips not smoking

3112
02:37:35,091 --> 02:37:38,780
this evening Clint saw I got a drive

3113
02:37:36,710 --> 02:37:41,079
here pretty soon and I'm not uh I'm not

3114
02:37:38,780 --> 02:37:41,079
capable

3115
02:37:42,069 --> 02:37:45,739
it's a Saturday night and there's a UFC

3116
02:37:44,601 --> 02:37:47,690
fight and there will be police

3117
02:37:45,739 --> 02:37:50,091
everywhere where you're headed yeah so

3118
02:37:47,690 --> 02:37:52,399
I'm just gonna chill out and hang out

3119
02:37:50,091 --> 02:37:54,620
with the listeners maybe you guys are

3120
02:37:52,399 --> 02:37:57,171
smoking maybe you're not I think that's

3121
02:37:54,620 --> 02:37:59,421
the best part about this podcast is it's

3122
02:37:57,171 --> 02:38:01,431
just information you know and then

3123
02:37:59,421 --> 02:38:03,440
Jeff's doing a good job of trying to

3124
02:38:01,431 --> 02:38:06,591
make it a fun and educational I know

3125
02:38:03,440 --> 02:38:08,569
you're making educational finding that

3126
02:38:06,591 --> 02:38:10,399
borderline that's that's the tough part

3127
02:38:08,569 --> 02:38:13,039
is because you guys can ramble on about

3128
02:38:10,399 --> 02:38:14,720
a lot of stuff but that's like you said

3129
02:38:13,040 --> 02:38:16,250
earlier as maybe I'm the guy that

3130
02:38:14,720 --> 02:38:19,310
because I don't know a lot about this

3131
02:38:16,250 --> 02:38:21,380
stuff even the questions between CBD and

3132
02:38:19,310 --> 02:38:24,140
THC I just don't know I guess I should

3133
02:38:21,380 --> 02:38:26,449
talk more about CBD I don't have a book

3134
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:27,289
or website I'm just kind of spat out on

3135
02:38:26,450 --> 02:38:30,440
my head

3136
02:38:27,290 --> 02:38:34,131
CBD is a cannabinoid I think it's

3137
02:38:30,440 --> 02:38:36,440
pronounced canna Biddy all it works more

3138
02:38:34,130 --> 02:38:38,869
as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory

3139
02:38:36,440 --> 02:38:41,450
it's known to have antibacterial

3140
02:38:38,870 --> 02:38:43,579
properties it's really well known for

3141
02:38:41,450 --> 02:38:45,620
and this is a good segue it's really

3142
02:38:43,579 --> 02:38:48,800
well known for stopping people who have

3143
02:38:45,620 --> 02:38:50,030
tremors and seizure type disorders or

3144
02:38:48,800 --> 02:38:51,619
conditions I won't even call it a

3145
02:38:50,030 --> 02:38:52,700
disorder that's a condition calling it a

3146
02:38:51,620 --> 02:38:55,160
disorder makes it sound like you're

3147
02:38:52,700 --> 02:38:57,950
[ __ ] condemned or something yeah this

3148
02:38:55,159 --> 02:39:00,021
people with seizure conditions so I was

3149
02:38:57,950 --> 02:39:01,730
telling a random story that I will tell

3150
02:39:00,021 --> 02:39:04,011
on the show in a second I was telling a

3151
02:39:01,729 --> 02:39:09,289
story to a friend who is a paramedic and

3152
02:39:04,011 --> 02:39:11,450
she said that CBD stops an electrical

3153
02:39:09,290 --> 02:39:15,230
firing in your brain that causes

3154
02:39:11,450 --> 02:39:17,240
seizures so that's awesome yeah and so

3155
02:39:15,229 --> 02:39:19,909
it that's gonna be really helpful for

3156
02:39:17,239 --> 02:39:21,500
anybody with seizures CBD definitely

3157
02:39:19,909 --> 02:39:23,750
makes me hungry that's why I'm not

3158
02:39:21,500 --> 02:39:27,500
smoking that ball it's like my first or

3159
02:39:23,750 --> 02:39:28,970
second hit off a CBD my stomach does so

3160
02:39:27,500 --> 02:39:30,351
if you got some cancer and you're not

3161
02:39:28,970 --> 02:39:33,859
eating from the chemotherapy

3162
02:39:30,351 --> 02:39:36,381
dude smoke some canna tonic that stuff

3163
02:39:33,860 --> 02:39:38,261
makes me starve like we would do it

3164
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:39,550
watch and then smoked

3165
02:39:38,261 --> 02:39:46,001
after lunch and I was like we got to go

3166
02:39:39,550 --> 02:39:51,010
back in there yeah that stuff just makes

3167
02:39:46,001 --> 02:39:52,690
you want to eat um it made my I can play

3168
02:39:51,011 --> 02:39:53,771
guitar longer I've noticed that I got a

3169
02:39:52,690 --> 02:39:55,271
new guitar for Christmas and I've

3170
02:39:53,771 --> 02:39:57,971
noticed if I play too long my wrists in

3171
02:39:55,271 --> 02:39:59,440
my forearm yeah yeah I don't I just keep

3172
02:39:57,970 --> 02:40:02,109
going now really and I may just be

3173
02:39:59,440 --> 02:40:03,911
building up endurance but I don't feel

3174
02:40:02,110 --> 02:40:06,511
any pain from it I would [ __ ] up after

3175
02:40:03,911 --> 02:40:08,649
a while I know I'm not so this stuff is

3176
02:40:06,511 --> 02:40:10,421
instead of like the head high that I

3177
02:40:08,649 --> 02:40:11,501
normally get where I'm just flying

3178
02:40:10,421 --> 02:40:13,810
through the cosmos

3179
02:40:11,501 --> 02:40:15,251
now it's more of a body high is that

3180
02:40:13,810 --> 02:40:17,050
what you're saying like you would

3181
02:40:15,251 --> 02:40:19,630
probably experience a body high yeah

3182
02:40:17,050 --> 02:40:22,600
because you're really low tolerance to

3183
02:40:19,630 --> 02:40:24,550
any first but people that have smoked a

3184
02:40:22,601 --> 02:40:26,021
little bit it just goes straight to pain

3185
02:40:24,550 --> 02:40:27,700
I feel like it knows where the pain is

3186
02:40:26,021 --> 02:40:28,931
it's like Oh your arm hurts I'm gonna

3187
02:40:27,700 --> 02:40:30,430
drive right up to your arm I'm gonna

3188
02:40:28,931 --> 02:40:31,690
park here let out my little CBD

3189
02:40:30,431 --> 02:40:33,701
paramedics oh we're gonna work on your

3190
02:40:31,690 --> 02:40:35,831
arm or your head or your neck and

3191
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:37,600
shoulders cuz she's had a lot of weird

3192
02:40:35,831 --> 02:40:38,890
symptoms lately sorry I cut off my

3193
02:40:37,601 --> 02:40:40,360
description of what kind of video all is

3194
02:40:38,890 --> 02:40:42,040
but it's it cannabinoid it's the

3195
02:40:40,360 --> 02:40:43,661
opposite of THC it's the the one that

3196
02:40:42,040 --> 02:40:45,300
goes down and stead of up and it's I

3197
02:40:43,661 --> 02:40:47,351
think it tastes like cherries I

3198
02:40:45,300 --> 02:40:50,560
definitely think that a water herb that

3199
02:40:47,351 --> 02:40:53,711
has CBD in it and extracts made with CBD

3200
02:40:50,560 --> 02:40:55,540
they often have a cherry like a cherry

3201
02:40:53,710 --> 02:40:57,010
hall's cough drop or a Luden's kind of a

3202
02:40:55,540 --> 02:40:59,979
taste to it that's what I've always

3203
02:40:57,011 --> 02:41:01,181
thought of CBD I'm high in random I've

3204
02:40:59,979 --> 02:41:02,710
talked about how it affects me it makes

3205
02:41:01,181 --> 02:41:04,751
me hungry it made me really mellow it

3206
02:41:02,710 --> 02:41:06,630
made me kind of smiley like put a grin

3207
02:41:04,751 --> 02:41:09,251
on my face like a giggle and then

3208
02:41:06,630 --> 02:41:15,460
there's a really a random story you

3209
02:41:09,251 --> 02:41:17,591
ready for this one over there so we had

3210
02:41:15,460 --> 02:41:19,240
a long day we went to Springs and bought

3211
02:41:17,591 --> 02:41:21,190
some cannabis which is an hour drive

3212
02:41:19,240 --> 02:41:23,860
away we went to lunch and then we came

3213
02:41:21,190 --> 02:41:30,961
home and like two beautiful people do we

3214
02:41:23,860 --> 02:41:34,391
uh we're both loving what we were doing

3215
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:35,920
and after about an hour of us giving it

3216
02:41:34,390 --> 02:41:39,069
to each other I kind of looked at her

3217
02:41:35,921 --> 02:41:42,130
like um I love what you're doing but I'm

3218
02:41:39,069 --> 02:41:43,810
never going to finish like this is

3219
02:41:42,130 --> 02:41:46,859
perfect you've done everything I love

3220
02:41:43,810 --> 02:41:48,761
and this is not gonna happen like

3221
02:41:46,860 --> 02:41:50,850
nothing's Ryan she kind of looked at me

3222
02:41:48,761 --> 02:41:52,319
like me too and I'm gonna

3223
02:41:50,850 --> 02:41:55,050
you but it usually doesn't take much for

3224
02:41:52,318 --> 02:41:56,639
her to be done like she gets three to my

3225
02:41:55,049 --> 02:41:58,139
one cuz she's a girl yeah I'm not

3226
02:41:56,639 --> 02:41:59,608
complaining but I mean I didn't even see

3227
02:41:58,139 --> 02:42:01,618
one is she's obvious when it happens I

3228
02:41:59,609 --> 02:42:04,140
didn't see one and I was like well she's

3229
02:42:01,619 --> 02:42:06,239
not either so she goes I think that CBD

3230
02:42:04,139 --> 02:42:08,219
and I was thinking it right as she said

3231
02:42:06,238 --> 02:42:10,590
it she was I think that CBD weed killed

3232
02:42:08,219 --> 02:42:12,629
it and it was the whole time it was

3233
02:42:10,590 --> 02:42:14,639
happening it was like I was almost there

3234
02:42:12,629 --> 02:42:16,198
so it was [ __ ] amazing the entire

3235
02:42:14,639 --> 02:42:20,579
time but he just wouldn't

3236
02:42:16,199 --> 02:42:21,840
there was no grand finale there I was

3237
02:42:20,579 --> 02:42:24,209
like it's not you and she's like it's

3238
02:42:21,840 --> 02:42:27,299
not you so we so I talked to my

3239
02:42:24,209 --> 02:42:29,158
paramedic friend and she said that that

3240
02:42:27,299 --> 02:42:32,039
same electrical firing in your brain

3241
02:42:29,158 --> 02:42:33,750
that causes a seizure is the same one

3242
02:42:32,040 --> 02:42:36,210
that causes you to orgasm oh Sh

3243
02:42:33,750 --> 02:42:38,728
and by smoking CBD you pretty much just

3244
02:42:36,209 --> 02:42:48,629
turned that sucker off and she said

3245
02:42:38,728 --> 02:43:37,289
we'll do it turns off that electrical

3246
02:42:48,629 --> 02:43:38,488
firing mechanism honest part of the

3247
02:43:37,290 --> 02:43:40,649
reason I don't smoke is because we

3248
02:43:38,488 --> 02:43:42,238
bought a limited supply I don't need to

3249
02:43:40,648 --> 02:43:43,799
waste it it doesn't do much for me other

3250
02:43:42,238 --> 02:43:45,959
than make me hungry and not make me nuts

3251
02:43:43,799 --> 02:43:48,059
so what's the price comparison on you

3252
02:43:45,959 --> 02:43:50,158
know that dispensary is very completely

3253
02:43:48,059 --> 02:43:52,260
fair and it's they have three different

3254
02:43:50,158 --> 02:43:54,510
price points of that herb and it

3255
02:43:52,260 --> 02:43:57,180
averages at $200 an ounce but it's a

3256
02:43:54,510 --> 02:43:58,439
medical only shop oh yeah so you have to

3257
02:43:57,180 --> 02:44:00,898
have a medical card to get in there but

3258
02:43:58,439 --> 02:44:02,550
$200 an ounce is a very good price yeah

3259
02:44:00,898 --> 02:44:04,359
because she works at a dispensary and

3260
02:44:02,549 --> 02:44:08,389
did you sell an ounce today

3261
02:44:04,360 --> 02:44:13,610
no we barely ever because it's like 560

3262
02:44:08,389 --> 02:44:16,519
out the doors after taxes everything a

3263
02:44:13,610 --> 02:44:18,590
little white bag that walks to even

3264
02:44:16,520 --> 02:44:20,000
carry your ounce out in it's like the

3265
02:44:18,590 --> 02:44:21,680
first accessory you didn't even like

3266
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:23,000
you're gonna because you have to have

3267
02:44:21,680 --> 02:44:24,139
that to leave the dispensary because

3268
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:26,478
that's childproof that's how the

3269
02:44:24,139 --> 02:44:29,689
dispensary watches their ass Wow yeah

3270
02:44:26,478 --> 02:44:32,179
that's that's weird I didn't know that

3271
02:44:29,689 --> 02:44:33,620
that's so they actually have to sell you

3272
02:44:32,180 --> 02:44:36,290
that bag or they that's kind of like

3273
02:44:33,620 --> 02:44:37,970
given with the 560 that's what the 560

3274
02:44:36,290 --> 02:44:40,610
but they could some dispensaries charge

3275
02:44:37,969 --> 02:44:44,090
you for that is that what the 560 we had

3276
02:44:40,610 --> 02:44:48,860
the childproof bottles we are supposed

3277
02:44:44,090 --> 02:44:52,969
to charge for the bags because they're

3278
02:44:48,860 --> 02:44:54,770
buying a lot of stuff yeah they stock up

3279
02:44:52,969 --> 02:44:57,409
at that shop that people really like to

3280
02:44:54,770 --> 02:44:59,180
stock up when they come it's fun

3281
02:44:57,409 --> 02:45:01,219

are all from Texas yeah so they hate

3327
02:46:44,398 --> 02:46:48,349
they hate Texas because they have to

3328
02:46:46,049 --> 02:46:50,068
drive from there just to get legal weed

3329

area so that you don't have to drive all

3333
02:46:59,488 --> 02:47:03,619
the way to Pueblo Colorado to come by

3334

limit us to like 6 plants per household

3365
02:48:01,139 --> 02:48:03,898
and you have to grow it in an

3366
02:48:02,219 --> 02:48:07,920
outbuilding not attached to your house

3367

conversation with people but I I smoked

3394

one hit off of my little pipe and I am

3395
02:49:26,889 --> 02:49:32,889
like thirty seconds so I'm like what was

3396

3403
02:49:42,219 --> 02:49:46,478
these tangents I get excited there was a

3404
02:49:44,860 --> 02:49:48,010
pause at one point when we were driving

3405
02:49:46,478 --> 02:49:49,750
I don't remember who was talking but

3406
02:49:48,010 --> 02:49:50,829
there was a pause and we looked at each

3407
02:49:49,750 --> 02:49:53,940
other and I just go

3408
02:49:50,829 --> 02:49:53,940
[Music]

3409
02:49:56,659 --> 02:49:59,728

3410
02:49:58,318 --> 02:50:01,109
conversation or if you're trying to be

3411
02:49:59,728 --> 02:50:03,510
the cool guy

3412
02:50:01,109 --> 02:50:06,689
maybe marijuana like for the first time

3413
02:50:03,510 --> 02:50:08,488
isn't the right thing to do and I wasn't

3414
02:50:06,689 --> 02:50:09,750
even planning on smoking at the show I

3415
02:50:08,488 --> 02:50:11,789

doesn't drive when he's like cashed

3470

02:53:36,090 --> 02:53:41,760
ambassador for as I see it like with

3472

trying to make weed as acceptable as

3474
02:53:45,149 --> 02:53:48,569
possible

3475
02:53:45,930 --> 02:53:52,579

hippie I mean you've both got dreads but

3477
02:53:52,579 --> 02:53:58,829
you don't need to be making the classic

3478
02:53:56,639 --> 02:54:01,199
mistakes at every stoner movie like

3479
02:53:58,829 --> 02:54:03,479
showcases like oh he's so stoned that he

3480
02:54:01,200 --> 02:54:05,460
can't get off the couch or always see in

3481
02:54:03,479 --> 02:54:07,079
six shades of grey or something like

3482
02:54:05,459 --> 02:54:09,119
that because he smoked himself

3483
02:54:07,079 --> 02:54:11,459
colorblind or some [ __ ] I don't know

3484
02:54:09,120 --> 02:54:14,040
it's just yeah it's the dude where's my

3485
02:54:11,459 --> 02:54:15,959
car effect where everybody's an idiot

3486
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:17,940
what kind of brought it up was there was

3487
02:54:15,959 --> 02:54:19,228
traffic was going crazy up ahead of us

3488
02:54:17,940 --> 02:54:22,319
and I wasn't sure what happened

3489
02:54:19,228 --> 02:54:24,659
and I said pay attention to which which

3490
02:54:22,319 --> 02:54:26,789
way the turn signals go and Clint found

3491
02:54:24,659 --> 02:54:29,100
that to be some sort of genius [ __ ]

3492
02:54:26,790 --> 02:54:30,689
observation yeah because that the mile

3493
02:54:29,100 --> 02:54:32,100
ahead I can see the turn signals flicker

3494
02:54:30,689 --> 02:54:33,329
in and I know if I need to start going

3495
02:54:32,100 --> 02:54:34,770
left or right now cuz I'm just gonna

3496
02:54:33,329 --> 02:54:36,239
copy the turn signals and I'll be in the

3497
02:54:34,770 --> 02:54:37,860
proper lane instead of fighting for it

3498
02:54:36,239 --> 02:55:01,139
when I get up there yeah getting cut off

3499
02:54:37,860 --> 02:55:03,150
by two Priuses was cool turn signals are

cracker it's just you know and for the

3532
02:56:17,159 --> 02:56:20,939
longest time it was it was it was

3533
02:56:19,049 --> 02:56:22,619
something where weed was dangerous

3534
02:56:20,939 --> 02:56:24,360
because we're indoctrinated with that

3535
02:56:22,620 --> 02:56:26,579
through dare and all this stuff yeah

3536
02:56:24,360 --> 02:56:28,950
well back in the day and the they taught

3537
02:56:26,579 --> 02:56:30,689
us that the Mexicans and the black jazz

3538
02:56:28,950 --> 02:56:31,470
musicians would smoke weed and rape

3539
02:56:30,689 --> 02:56:33,238
white [ __ ]

3540
02:56:31,469 --> 02:56:36,059
yeah always you turn into a demon and

3541
02:56:33,238 --> 02:56:37,590
rape the white women yeah for madness

3542
02:56:36,059 --> 02:56:40,260
it's what we were taught propaganda and

3543
02:56:37,590 --> 02:56:41,549
people my grandparents like they they

3544
02:56:40,260 --> 02:56:43,228
were smart enough to go away that's

3545
02:56:41,549 --> 02:56:44,849
[ __ ] but their dad friends that were

3546
02:56:43,228 --> 02:56:46,198

3565
02:57:26,699 --> 02:57:31,439
marijuana for the longest time was in

3566
02:57:29,010 --> 02:57:33,779
that same category like everybody

3567
02:57:31,439 --> 02:57:36,449
thought that that's oh it's it's all the

3568
02:57:33,779 --> 02:57:38,880
same you know but nobody talks about

3569
02:57:36,449 --> 02:57:45,149
like oh I can go into a 7-eleven at any

3570
02:57:38,879 --> 02:57:46,828
time before 2:00 a.m. and go buy as much

02:58:01,139 --> 02:58:05,189
years then I had to quit I had to quit

3578
02:58:03,629 --> 02:58:06,898

02:58:05,189 --> 02:58:09,809
fortunately I didn't get withdrawals

3580
02:58:06,898 --> 02:58:11,969
when I decided to quit but I do know

3581

3596
02:58:41,609 --> 02:58:44,880
at alcohol commercials they make you

3597
02:58:42,988 --> 02:58:47,100
think that if you drink dose icky

3598
02:58:44,879 --> 02:58:48,269
you are the most interesting man in the

3599
02:58:47,100 --> 02:58:49,890
world I don't always drink though

3600
02:58:48,270 --> 02:58:51,630
sadiki's but what I do but I don't

3601
02:58:49,889 --> 02:58:53,908
always drink alcohol but when I do I get

3602
02:58:51,629 --> 02:58:57,658
two chicks I got a boat I get a cool

3603
02:58:53,908 --> 02:59:00,029

just cuz I drink some dose at keys yeah

3606
02:59:01,859 --> 02:59:05,699
but but on the opposite hand like

3607
02:59:04,079 --> 02:59:07,318
anytime that you're smoking weed you're

3608
02:59:05,699 --> 02:59:09,180
the stoner that sits on the couch and

3609
02:59:07,318 --> 02:59:11,398
you're just so typecast as that and I

3610
02:59:09,180 --> 02:59:13,680
think that's such [ __ ] yeah so I

3611

3625
02:59:45,120 --> 02:59:47,790
goes around my chest area when I think

3626

03:00:17,639 --> 03:00:21,809
about us not being able to finish our

3635
03:00:20,129 --> 03:00:23,549
sexual escapades because I wanted to be

3636
03:00:21,809 --> 03:00:24,959
respectful about it and I would have to

3637
03:00:23,549 --> 03:00:26,459
play the episode for you and let you

3638
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:28,858
edit out anything you didn't like anyway

3639
03:00:26,459 --> 03:00:39,809

03:00:56,040 --> 03:01:04,530
novelty like definitely wears off kind

3646
03:00:58,889 --> 03:01:06,389
of quickly when people come in for the

3647

first time and they're really excited

3648
03:01:06,389 --> 03:01:14,629

[Music]

3820
03:08:11,841 --> 03:08:22,771
without that for comedians that's not

3821
03:08:14,399 --> 03:08:24,630
bad you know you said how comedians or

3822
03:08:22,771 --> 03:08:26,280
friends it felt like once we hung out

3823
03:08:24,630 --> 03:08:27,989
with Ari for just a couple of seconds it

3824
03:08:26,280 --> 03:08:32,159
just seemed like just some other dude oh

3825
03:08:27,989 --> 03:08:33,479
yeah and it didn't even seem like we're

3826
03:08:32,159 --> 03:08:34,950
smoking with the celebrity he just

3827
03:08:33,479 --> 03:08:35,399
smoked weed he's like alright guys I

3828
03:08:34,950 --> 03:08:37,950
gotta go

3829
03:08:35,399 --> 03:08:39,359
it had some phone texting going on I

3830
03:08:37,950 --> 03:08:41,101
think he had some booty call to go tend

3831
03:08:39,360 --> 03:08:42,569
to and he was out yeah he was just a

3832
03:08:41,101 --> 03:08:44,011
nice guy I mean there was literally a

3833
03:08:42,569 --> 03:08:47,610
couple of minutes there were nobody was

3834
03:08:44,011 --> 03:08:49,290
talking and everybody gets so amped

3835
03:08:47,610 --> 03:08:51,181
around like celebrities but I really do

3836
03:08:49,290 --> 03:08:52,950
feel like Ari Shaffir is a celebrity

3837
03:08:51,181 --> 03:08:55,471
he's put in so much work to get to where

3838
03:08:52,950 --> 03:08:57,631
he's at and his special was so good and

3839
03:08:55,470 --> 03:08:58,710
his special just came out so you know

3840
03:08:57,630 --> 03:09:00,840
