welcome to the show cannabis community

2
00:00:01,589 --> 00:00:06,449
it's time for episode 365 of the Grove

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:07,890
from your heart podcast this episode is

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,809
brought to you by the hell a dank seed

6
00:00:09,808 --> 00:00:15,108
garden I highly recommend the hella dank

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,109
seed company and you can find them at

www.nasa.gov

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:25,528
two day I've been taking dabs of this

10
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:27,868
bubble Jack full-spectrum extract and I

11
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,730
love the flavor and aroma of this stuff

12
00:00:27,868 --> 00:00:31,768
it smells like bubblegum and cotton

13
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,359
candy when I dab it it goes straight to

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:35,640
my head it makes my brain go superfast

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,558
it makes my mouth go super fast so I

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,439
think this will be a great concentrate

17
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:41,669
for smoking before a podcast all right

18
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:43,468
before we get too deep into this episode

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,050
I want to give a few people a shout-out

podcast I really do appreciate all of

26
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,719
the support ladies and gentlemen this is

27
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:02,759
going to be another grow lesson I have

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,530
been doing a long series of grow lessons

29
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:06,599
I hope you have been following along if

30
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,060
you are interested I recommend you go

31
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:11,099
back to episode 351 that's where I start

32
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,750
this long series of grow lessons start

33
00:01:11,099 --> 00:01:13,349
there and get caught up if you feel like

34
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,509
you're up to speed

35
00:01:13,349 --> 00:01:17,669
welcome to the grow lessons in the last

36
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,439
two episodes we talked about sprouting

37
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:21,840
seeds we also talked about cutting

38
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,849
clones in this episode we're going to

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,728
talk about putting those seeds and those

40
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:29,158
clones into containers of soil or

41
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:30,868
soilless mix so let's start with the

42
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,368
seeds we talked about germinating in

43
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,290
paper towels I may have covered this

44
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:35,578
briefly in the previous episode but

45
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,229
we're going to talk about it a little

46
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,658
bit of a recap right here just to make

47
00:01:37,228 --> 00:01:41,400
sure everybody is up to speed so we

48
00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:43,469
started a few seeds that we folded a

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,299
paper towel we soaked it we put seeds on

50
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:47,548
the paper towel we folded it again to

51
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,200
secure the seeds inside maybe we put

52
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:51,210
that in a baggie maybe we put that in a

53
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,460
warm place the seeds have now sprouted

54
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:55,530
hopefully they've got little tiny tails

55
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,149
maybe a quarter of an inch maybe a half

56
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:59,099
inch hopefully you didn't go any more

57
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,909
than one inch long here is how I

58
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,658
recommend planting those seedlings I

59
00:02:01,909 --> 00:02:05,250
generally try to stay away from

60
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,750
recommending products every time I

61
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,878
recommend a product I get emails from

62
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,770
people saying I did something wrong but

63
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,560
I want to make this easy for everybody

64
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,939
so I recommend light warrior soil from

65
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,949
far

66
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:18,079
Barnes for your new seedlings it is

67
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:20,780
readily available it is affordable and

68
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,950
it works very well I'm sure other people

69
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,319
will have other ideas and other

70
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:25,310
suggestions I am okay with that do what

71
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,439
you're comfortable with

72
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:29,539
I recommend this product because like I

73
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,219
said it's available it's affordable and

74
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,959
I know that it works I'm not gonna send

75
00:02:31,219 --> 00:02:34,490
people on some crazy mission looking for

76
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:36,680
a product that's hard to find or

77
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:38,510
overpriced so we've got our medium you

78
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,040
can probably get away with one bag of

79
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:42,139
light warrior soil now we need

80
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,989
containers to put this soil in to put

81
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:47,359
our seedlings in I recommend small pots

82
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,670
for small plants there's no reason to

83
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,470
fill up a big three gallon pot and then

84
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,000
plant a little tiny seedling in there

85
00:02:51,469 --> 00:02:55,400
and then you have to water that entire

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,770
space of soil you have to put water and

87
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,020
nutrients in all of that space just to

88
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:01,580
water that plant properly if you've got

89
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:03,500
your seedling inside of a little tiny

90
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:05,090
cup you only have to water that much

91
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,349
space you don't have to waste water you

92
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:08,870
don't have to waste nutrients and you

93
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:11,329
don't have to waste space a lot of new

94
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:13,280
growers really like to drown seedlings

95
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,719
in larger pots if they put a seedling in

96
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,550
a larger pot they've got a water all of

97
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,259
that soil so they go and they pour an

98
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:20,239
entire pitcher of water right on top of

99
00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:22,189
that three gallon pot then that seedling

100
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,569
gets washed away in all that water who

101
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:25,039
knows where it goes sometimes when

102
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,900
people apply water they do it kind of

103
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:28,669
heavily the seed gets washed away it

104
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,620
gets lost in there they kill the seeds

105
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:32,149
they drown they fail with the seeds they

106
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:34,909
get discouraged so I highly recommend

107
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,860
starting with a smaller pot maybe a four

108
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:39,259
inch net pot maybe a six inch net pot

109
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,900
maybe a four inch square pot maybe a six

110
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:44,389
inch circular pot something that size

111
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:46,280
I honestly start my seedlings in a beer

112
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:48,169
cup I take a few beer cups I stack them

113
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,000
up on top of each other then I put a

114
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:51,979
drill through the bottom of them I can

115
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,629
go through about eight cups at a time I

116
00:03:51,979 --> 00:03:55,280
poke one big hole through the bottom

117
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:56,629
then I'll do a few smaller holes on the

118
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,610
side just to give some proper drainage

119
00:03:56,629 --> 00:04:00,979
and I feel like beer cups are the

120
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,930
perfect size for new baby seedlings the

121
00:04:00,979 --> 00:04:04,518
seedlings can sprout in there they can

122
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,469
get a good start they can develop a good

123
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:07,909
root system and by the time they get big

124
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:10,250
enough you can just up pop them into

125
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:12,349
there 3 or 5 gallon pot and it works

126
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:14,360
really well so let's talk about actually

127
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:15,859
putting these seedlings into I'm gonna

128
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,900
go with the beer cup for this method

129
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,810
I've got my beer cup I've got my white

130
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:22,849
warrior soil mix I'm gonna fill my beer

131
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,740
cup most of the way up with soil I want

132
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,030
to pack it down fairly tight then I'm

133
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,350
gonna fill it up with soil and leave

134
00:04:26,029 --> 00:04:29,209
myself about a quarter of an

135
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,680
so that when I water I've got plenty of

136
00:04:29,209 --> 00:04:32,779
room for water and it doesn't just run

137
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,699
off the top of the cup so I fill it up

138
00:04:32,779 --> 00:04:38,059
I've got about quarter inch of space

139
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:40,219
left on the top then I water that soil

140
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,170
before I even put my clone or my

141
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,790
seedling into it in this case we're

142
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,110
gonna put a ceiling in there so I would

143
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:47,090
water it since I'm going with the

144
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,819
ceiling I do not use any nutrients at

145
00:04:47,089 --> 00:04:51,739
this time I'll water it I'll let all

146
00:04:49,819 --> 00:04:53,870
that water soak through the bottom then

147
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,519
I take my pointer finger and I dig a

148
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:57,199
little hole just right to the first

149
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,029
knuckle of my finger then I put that

150
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,099
little freshly sprouted seedling right

151
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:03,199
inside that hole if the ceiling has

152
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,939
developed a long tail that tap root if

153
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,099
that tap root has gotten long you need

154
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:09,469
to make that be facing down and the seed

155
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:11,750
facing up you want the seed coming up in

156
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:14,390
the tap root going down so gently place

157
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,009
that seed facing down or the tap root

158
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,300
facing down the seed pointing up place

159
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:18,829
that right in the dirt dig the hole as

160
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,480
you need as deep as you need to dig it

161
00:05:18,829 --> 00:05:21,740
if you've got a longer tap root just

162
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,140
push your finger in there as long as you

163
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,790
need to go then gently set that tap root

164
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,319
down in there and then you just want to

165
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,790
put the dirt right over it real gently

166
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:30,170
you don't need to pack it down just make

167
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,760
sure that it's covered up for the lights

168
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,140
not getting to it and it is packed in

169
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,060
there tight enough when you water it the

170
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:36,560
next time that water will probably pack

171
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,030
it just tight enough for you you don't

172
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,709
need to press it down too much at this

173
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,479
point you don't want to risk crushing

174
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:43,399
that seedling so if you've got a real

175
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,689
short tail just go knuckle deep drop

176
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,159
that little sealing right in there and

177
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:47,930
bury it if you've got kind of a long

178
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,850
tail you've got to dig a little deeper

179
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,680
of a hole set that tail down in there

180
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:54,110
and then just carefully bury that be

181
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,540
really careful not to disturb that white

182
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:58,270
tap root that is really delicate and

183
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:00,560
it's important that it is not disrupted

184
00:05:58,269 --> 00:06:02,990
now your new seedlings are basically

185
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,089
potted in their cups of dirt I would

186
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:07,610
place them under a t5 light with the t5

187
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:09,619
light about 8 to 12 inches away I would

188
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,689
try to keep them around 75 to 85 degrees

189
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,730
and I would try to keep it quite humid

190
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:15,199
around these little tiny baby plants now

191
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,120
when it comes time to water these new

192
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,819
seedlings we have to be very careful for

193
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,759
the first few days I recommend using a

194
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:24,709
sprayer to water new seedlings I got a

195
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:26,810
tiny 1 gallon pump sprayer from the

196
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:28,669
local hardware store I mix it with my

197
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:30,680
whatever nutrient solution I'm gonna use

198
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:32,870
or just plain water that's been pH

199
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,418
balanced correctly then I pump it real

200
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,189
hard and I just spray the topsoil with

201
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:38,990
that water instead of pouring a heavy

202
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:40,149
dose of water in and risking drowning

203
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,160
those seeds or

204
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,750
RUP ting those seeds I just spray it

205
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,040
from the top I kind of spray it at a few

206
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:47,050
angles that way get all the soil

207
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,490
saturated and it works just like the

208
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,500
morning dew would so I feel like

209
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,420
spraying them is really gentle and it

210
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,220
works really well for new growers to not

211
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,810
drown these plants and not flood the

212
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,940
soil when they're starting baby

213
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,430
seedlings now let's briefly talk about

214
00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,469
when to start feeding our seedlings I

215
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:05,290
like to start feeding when I see the

216
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,090
first set of truly developed leaves when

217
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:09,010
you see the first set of five or seven

218
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:10,389
or nine depending on what variety you're

219
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:12,490
growing when you see the first set of

220
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:14,889
full leaves that's when I like to start

221
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,990
adding nutrients depending on your brand

222
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:18,819
and your product I usually recommend you

223
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:21,250
start with about a quarter strength if

224
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:22,750
the bottle says to use 40 milliliters of

225
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,279
a certain product I would recommend you

226
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,019
start with 10 milliliters of that

227
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,819
product and then as that plant gets

228
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,069
bigger and stronger and more developed

229
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:31,599
then you can increase your nutrient

230
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:33,339
feedings to those plants but while

231
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:34,900
they're small let's feed them lightly so

232
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:36,909
we don't roast them now let's talk

233
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:38,799
briefly about what to feed them these

234
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:40,780
plants need a little bit of nitrogen

235
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,730
they need a very small amount of

236
00:07:40,779 --> 00:07:44,619
phosphorous and a very small amount of

237
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:47,110
potassium oast of your basic grow

238
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,269
nutrients will be just fine for small

239
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:52,180
seedlings I would recommend adding a

240
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:54,699
root inoculant product something like

241
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,650
mammoth pea something like great white

242
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,899
something like recharge something like

243
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:00,879
plus life any of those products will

244
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,799
work for you do a little bit of research

245
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,719
find what's available in your area find

246
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,420
what fits your price range and get the

247
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,860
product that will work best for you

248
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,900
something is better than nothing when it

249
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:12,879
comes to root inoculants and microbes

250
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:14,709
and beneficial fungus and bacteria I

251
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,149
highly recommend it for small plants and

252
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:18,939
I highly recommend it throughout the

253
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:20,259
entire growing process so when your

254
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:21,910
plants are little they're not going to

255
00:08:20,259 --> 00:08:23,230
need a whole lot of nutrients just a

256
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:25,630
base nutrient and I highly recommend

257
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,490
some sort of root inoculant they won't

258
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:29,620
need cal-mag probably until we

259
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,449
transplant them into the next pot if you

260
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,070
want to add a full Vic or a humic acid

261
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,049
that's always good for the plants at all

262
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:37,360
stages but at this point I mainly like

263
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,099
to focus on healthy plants with strong

264
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,840
roots so I really focus on root

265
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:43,060
development at this stage of the game

266
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:45,340
I'll add microbes and beneficial fungus

267
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:46,809
and then I'll also add carbohydrates but

268
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,120
at this point like I said I am mainly

269
00:08:46,809 --> 00:08:51,039
focusing on root development until I

270
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,870
transplant those plants into their next

271
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,159
pots so we talked a little bit about

272
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:56,948
what to feed these little baby

273
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,439
let's talk about pH for small seedlings

274
00:08:56,948 --> 00:09:01,870
I like to keep my pH around five point

275
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,970
eight to six point two once they get a

276
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,679
little bit larger I will increase the pH

277
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,930
slowly and I'll move up towards six

278
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,939
point three or six point four but for

279
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:12,698
these small babies let's stay closer to

280
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,620
five point eight or six point two now

281
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:16,000
really take your time increasing the

282
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:17,620
amount of nutrients you give these

283
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,289
plants and also take your time

284
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:21,909
increasing the pH of these plants they

285
00:09:20,289 --> 00:09:24,039
need to grow they need to get a root

286
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:25,688
system to be able to process all of the

287
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:28,000
stuff you're giving them these little

288
00:09:25,688 --> 00:09:29,828
tiny plants don't want a lot and you do

289
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,350
run the risk of burning them if you

290
00:09:29,828 --> 00:09:35,049
overfeed them so pay attention and go

291
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,819
slow now after several days these

292
00:09:35,049 --> 00:09:38,649
seedlings will start taking off they'll

293
00:09:36,818 --> 00:09:40,419
start getting full-sized leaves and they

294
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:42,938
will start catching up to the same size

295
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:45,669
as the clones we cut once they reach

296
00:09:42,938 --> 00:09:47,919
that size I consider them to be small

297
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:50,139
veg plants and I treat them just like I

298
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,509
do my small veg plants and we will talk

299
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:55,480
about caring for and feeding small veg

300
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:57,399
plants here in the near future next

301
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:59,438
let's talk about planting our rapid

302
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,328
rooters maybe we planted some seedlings

303
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:03,099
in Rapid rooters maybe we cut some

304
00:10:01,328 --> 00:10:05,078
clones and rapid rooters and put them in

305
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,990
a dome and now they are sprouting roots

306
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:10,120
and it is time to plant them how do we

307
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:12,639
know when it is time to plant our rapid

308
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:14,350
Rooter ceilings or clones I like to

309
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,180
plant seedlings as soon as I see that

310
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,220
first taproot coming out of the rapid

311
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:20,169
Rooter I don't want to let that taproot

312
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:22,300
get too long too leggy and too stretchy

313
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:25,028
so I do my best to get those into soil

314
00:10:22,299 --> 00:10:26,469
right away when I cut clones and rapid

315
00:10:25,028 --> 00:10:28,929
rooters I like to make sure they are

316
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:31,329
sufficiently rooted before I try to put

317
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:33,008
them into soil make sure your clones are

318
00:10:31,328 --> 00:10:34,870
properly hardened off we talked about

319
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:37,449
this in a previous episode we have to

320
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:39,039
expose our domed clones to fresh air for

321
00:10:37,448 --> 00:10:41,198
durations of time and extend that

322
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,208
duration over a period of time to make

323
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:45,250
sure the clones are ready to not be in a

324
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:47,018
humidity controlled environment we need

325
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,269
to get them used to being in our regular

326
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:50,709
veg environment so we've been hardening

327
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:52,959
off our clones and they show sufficient

328
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:55,628
roots what do I mean by sufficient roots

329
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,938
I want at least five maybe ten or twelve

330
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:59,289
white thick roots popping out of that

331
00:10:57,938 --> 00:11:01,419
rapid Rooter I want them to be just

332
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:02,528
busting out of there and kind of thick I

333
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:04,179
want them to look like they're just

334
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:06,308
little worms coming out looking for

335
00:11:04,179 --> 00:11:07,989
somewhere to go if you've got more than

336
00:11:06,308 --> 00:11:09,639
five maybe more than 12

337
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,528
and they start building up in there you

338
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,569
were really doing well we want to

339
00:11:11,528 --> 00:11:16,179
develop a nice root system before we pot

340
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,220
it but there is a fine line between just

341
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:20,379
enough and too much if you lift that

342
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,000
little clone up out of that tray and the

343
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:23,588
roots have begun wrapping a round of the

344
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,899
Rooter you've gone too far

345
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:27,399
if those roots are hanging down inside

346
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,500
the root or tray and hanging into the

347
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,208
water we have gone too far we want to

348
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,730
get those into our soilless mix as soon

349
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,500
as possible I want just a little bit of

350
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,209
dreadlocks just hanging out of there not

351
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,429
a lot just maybe a little tiny mop just

352
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:40,899
a little fuzz ball maybe ten or twenty

353
00:11:39,429 --> 00:11:43,239
of them just hanging out that is prime

354
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,070
time to pot those and I want them about

355
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,799
a half inch to an inch and a half long

356
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,870
is perfect now let's put these rapid

357
00:11:47,799 --> 00:11:52,449
rooters into our beer cup full of light

358
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:53,950
warrior soil or whatever size pot and

359
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:55,600
whatever soil makes you choose to use

360
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:57,700
just make sure it's a quality soil mix

361
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,230
with plenty of aeration and make sure

362
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,300
whatever size or whatever container to

363
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,889
use has plenty of drainage we don't want

364
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:04,599
our plants to get muddy at the bottom

365
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:06,669
get stagnant water that will totally

366
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,350
drown and destroy our roots will get

367
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:11,229
root rot it will be a mess it will be

368
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:13,540
disgusting so quality soil pots with

369
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:15,789
good drainage that is a requirement now

370
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:17,799
just like we did the beer cups for our

371
00:12:15,789 --> 00:12:19,809
small seedlings let's fill them up with

372
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,599
soil and leave ourselves about a quarter

373
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:24,129
of an inch of space for water now if I'm

374
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,290
putting the seedlings in the rapid

375
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:27,909
rooters into this soil I most likely

376
00:12:26,289 --> 00:12:30,849
will not give them nutrients at this

377
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:32,949
time when i put the clones into the soil

378
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,159
at this time i do like to give them a

379
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:38,320
small nutrient feeding i use a light

380
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,328
vegetative mix about a quarter strength

381
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,589
of whatever brand you're using use about

382
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:43,809
a quarter strength of whatever they

383
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,420
recommend i also like to use a microbe

384
00:12:43,809 --> 00:12:47,889
product again something like mammoth pea

385
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:50,110
something like great white shark

386
00:12:47,889 --> 00:12:52,509
something like recharge something like

387
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:54,250
plus life from veg bloom anything with

388
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,409
beneficial fungus and bacteria that will

389
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,570
encourage root growth will be great for

390
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:00,039
your small plants so we've got our light

391
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,860
base nutrients we've got our root

392
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:04,838
inoculant let's talk about pH I like to

393
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,620
keep the pH for these small clones

394
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,480
somewhere between 5.8 and 6.2 so we've

395
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,669
got our base nutrients we've got our

396
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,250
root inoculant we've got our solution pH

397
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:17,110
now I water that solution through my

398
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,669
cups of soil just pour it right on

399
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:20,919
through until it drains out a little bit

400
00:13:18,669 --> 00:13:21,759
you want to fully saturate that new soil

401
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:23,259
now

402
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,480
it's done dripping and that soil is

403
00:13:23,259 --> 00:13:27,639
fully saturated I will take two fingers

404
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:29,920
and just gently make a little hole right

405
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,198
in the center of that soil and I go just

406
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,208
a little bit deeper than the height of

407
00:13:32,198 --> 00:13:36,578
that rapid Rooter so if the rapid Rooter

408
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:38,799
is an inch tall I go maybe an inch and

409
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:41,679
1/8 or maybe an inch and a quarter deep

410
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:44,379
then I get the rapid Rooter out of the

411
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:46,899
little tray and I set it gently inside

412
00:13:44,379 --> 00:13:49,929
of that hole and I do my best to not

413
00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,820
disrupt any of those roots if it's a

414
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:53,439
seedling you've probably only got one or

415
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,209
two roots sticking out of that rapid

416
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,970
Rooter you need to be very careful

417
00:13:55,208 --> 00:14:00,189
gently set that in the soil set it right

418
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,259
inside there then backfill that hole

419
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:04,240
really carefully over that rapid Rooter

420
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,740
I like to go right over the top of it so

421
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,209
you can never tell the rapid Rooter was

422
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,620
there and just a little plant is

423
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:10,539
sticking up out of the soil

424
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,549
be really careful if you're working with

425
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:13,990
the ceiling that one tap root is all

426
00:14:12,549 --> 00:14:16,328
it's got to survive through at this

427
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,459
point if you're working with a clone we

428
00:14:16,328 --> 00:14:20,349
still need to be very careful with these

429
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,609
roots by the way we're rubber gloves

430
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,959
when you're doing all this I highly

431
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,250
recommend rubber gloves whenever you're

432
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,750
coming in contact when you're putting

433
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,220
your hands or your skin in contact with

434
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,470
the dirt with the roots with the plants

435
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,540
just try to wear rubber gloves if you

436
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,879
can or latex gloves try to glove up

437
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:36,639
whenever possible I would still suggest

438
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,439
watering that rapid Rooter sealing with

439
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,480
the spray bottle just like I recommended

440
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,040
before until it gets nice and large

441
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,839
until you are confident that you're not

442
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,490
going to drown it just water it with

443
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,980
that spray bottle make sure you fully

444
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,778
saturate the soil but it's easier to not

445
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,850
go overboard when you're spraying with a

446
00:14:49,778 --> 00:14:53,889
spray bottle because you can only spray

447
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:55,449
so much at a time if you're a new grower

448
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:56,740
and you don't have a lot of experience

449
00:14:55,448 --> 00:14:58,448
watering plants and you're new at

450
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,310
watering the clones don't be afraid to

451
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:02,049
water them with the spray bottle also

452
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:03,879
just get in there and saturate that soil

453
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,620
keep spraying until you feel like it's

454
00:15:03,879 --> 00:15:07,720
saturated and then wait until it's

455
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,068
fairly dry to water it again you'll know

456
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,660
when it feels real light when you pick

457
00:15:09,068 --> 00:15:12,309
it up you'll say oh that needs water

458
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:14,439
then just soak it until it's mostly

459
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:15,669
saturated again eventually you'll

460
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,500
realize that you're spending too much

461
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:19,299
time using that spray bottle to water

462
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,549
the clones and you'll start using a more

463
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:24,309
efficient method but it's a great way to

464
00:15:21,549 --> 00:15:26,919
learn how to not over water so I

465
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:28,899
basically fill my cup with soil

466
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:30,549
I'm oice in the soil I make a little

467
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:32,470
hole with my fingers and I set that

468
00:15:30,549 --> 00:15:34,599
rapid Rooter right inside of that hole

469
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,240
really gently really careful not to

470
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,820
damage any

471
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:39,500
those new roots then I carefully bury

472
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:43,010
that wrap and Rooter with the moist soil

473
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,778
then I put that cup underneath a t5

474
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:46,429
light again I like to keep that light 8

475
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:47,629
to 12 inches above it when they're brand

476
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,549
new like this I don't want to scorch

477
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:51,320
them I don't want to burn them then I

478
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:54,169
like to keep the temperature somewhere

479
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,970
between 75 and 85 degrees and I try to

480
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:58,129
keep the room fairly humid when I have

481
00:15:55,970 --> 00:16:00,500
new seedlings or young plants in the

482
00:15:58,129 --> 00:16:03,110
room so that is really quickly how I put

483
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:05,839
my rapid Rooter seedlings and clones in

484
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:08,209
two cups of soil let's talk next about

485
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,180
putting our clones from an easy cloner

486
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:14,179
machine or a botanic air turbo cloner in

487
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:16,429
two cups of soil my method for potting

488
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:18,379
these clones into soil starts the same

489
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:20,778
as potting our seeds or potting our

490
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:22,820
rapid rooters I start by filling my cup

491
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:25,879
or my desired container with light

492
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:28,610
warrior or my desired soilless mix about

493
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:30,679
a quarter inch away from the top I then

494
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,050
saturate that soil the same as I did

495
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:35,269
with my other cloning method I use about

496
00:16:33,049 --> 00:16:37,189
a quarter strength of my vegetative knew

497
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:41,708
and I like to use plenty of microbes

498
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:44,360
then I adjust the pH between 5.8 and 6.2

499
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:46,219
now when we cut these clones I said to

500
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,470
leave about an inch underneath the

501
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,778
neoprene collar into the water getting

502
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:52,759
hit by that sprayer that entire inch

503
00:16:50,778 --> 00:16:54,950
should have roots popping out of here we

504
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,379
should have a nice little mop of roots

505
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:59,360
before we try to pop these so I've got

506
00:16:57,379 --> 00:17:01,879
my cup of moistened soil I've got a well

507
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
rooted clone now I usually grab the cup

508
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:05,449
with my right hand I use the pointer

509
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,609
finger on my left hand and I just poke a

510
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,860
hole about an inch and a half deep right

511
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:11,359
into that soil now I may widen that hole

512
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,849
up a little bit depending on the root

513
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,828
mass coming off of that clone if there

514
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:18,318
are a lot of roots I need more room I

515
00:17:15,828 --> 00:17:21,078
don't want to crowd or crush the roots

516
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:23,149
into that soil I like to lower the clone

517
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,308
down into the soil and let those roots

518
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:27,110
spread as far as they can get so if

519
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:28,970
you've got something hanging off try not

520
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,649
to squish them try not to coil them we

521
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,259
want to encourage those roots to spread

522
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:35,660
out as far as they can go if you've got

523
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:37,730
a lot of roots maybe make a small cone

524
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,620
of soil in the bottom of the cup a

525
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:41,299
little triangle so that the roots can

526
00:17:39,619 --> 00:17:43,369
hit that triangle and spread out around

527
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,200
that instead of getting into a ball we

528
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:46,759
want the roots spread out that is really

529
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,870
important if we tangle them up if we

530
00:17:46,759 --> 00:17:49,519
twist them

531
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:51,049
suffocate themselves and they will kill

532
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:52,759
the plant and the clone will not survive

533
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:55,220
at all now if your roots have gotten

534
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,950
excessively long I recommend you trim

535
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,720
some off if there are more than 6 or 7

536
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,549
inches long just go ahead and trim the

537
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,380
bottoms of those roots off your plants

538
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:05,419
will thank you for it they won't have so

539
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,890
much root mass twist it up in the bottom

540
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,380
of that cup trying to figure out what to

541
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,360
do you'll just have a nice thick root

542
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:12,680
mass started and it works a little bit

543
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,629
like topping your plants you've just

544
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,759
created more sections for that root zone

545
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:18,890
to branch out from so your plants will

546
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:20,299
appreciate it so you pop that clone up

547
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,130
out of the EZ cloner you've got the

548
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,990
neoprene disc you take the neoprene disc

549
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:25,550
off you put that back in the hole so the

550
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:27,170
water doesn't go sprint anywhere you've

551
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:29,419
probably got the cloner turned on while

552
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:31,190
you're potting the clones then you take

553
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,870
that clone and you just set it right

554
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:34,700
inside that hole that you've created in

555
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:36,349
the soil but as you lower it down into

556
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,910
there try to spread the roots out if

557
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:39,199
they're just short and stubby they're

558
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,370
gonna go the direction they want to go

559
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,259
if they're getting long enough to where

560
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,329
you can stretch them or move them and

561
00:18:42,259 --> 00:18:45,950
encourage them which direction to go try

562
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:48,139
to make them spread out like an umbrella

563
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:51,230
we want to get them nice and far if

564
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:53,480
they're really long you can put soil in

565
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:55,670
the cup lower some of the roots down

566
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,950
into the cup then sprinkle more soil on

567
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:59,750
top of that then lower more roots down

568
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:02,330
into the cup and then sprinkle more soil

569
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,890
on top of that then no matter how much

570
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:05,808
soil you use no matter how long the

571
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,120
roots are we need to bury that clone

572
00:19:05,808 --> 00:19:10,069
deep enough into this cup to give it

573
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,419
some support to stand straight up we

574
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:13,399
need to get the soil tight enough around

575
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,050
it and get it deep enough in there to

576
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,759
get the clone to support itself and

577
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:19,549
stand straight up but at the same time

578
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,650
we need to not bury it so deep that we

579
00:19:19,549 --> 00:19:24,230
cause a root rot on that short stem that

580
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,240
is there so we put 1 inch of it

581
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,890
underneath the neoprene disc getting

582
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,259
sprayed by the water so we've got roots

583
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:32,120
about one inch then that neoprene disc

584
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:33,799
is about a quarter of an inch deep so I

585
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,049
would say probably plant it somewhere

586
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:38,419
between one and a quarter and one and a

587
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:39,950
half inches deep into your media now

588
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,990
we've already moistened the soil so the

589
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:43,940
nutrients are in there the next thing to

590
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:46,940
do is to move our potted clones

591
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,039
underneath a t5 light again for freshly

592
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,890
potted plants I like to keep that t5

593
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,899
about 8 to 12 inches away I will lower

594
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,070
that light as the plants get stronger

595
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,990
I just don't want to move them right

596
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,129
under there right away and scorch them

597
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:00,529
and burn them and give them the

598
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:01,639
opportunity to stress out for these new

599
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:03,858
baby clones I like

600
00:20:01,638 --> 00:20:06,618
to keep the temperature between 75 and

601
00:20:03,858 --> 00:20:08,328
85 degrees and I do like high humidity

602
00:20:06,618 --> 00:20:10,128
it depends on how much airflow I've got

603
00:20:08,328 --> 00:20:12,019
in the room it depends on my environment

604
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:13,578
it depends on the situation if I've got

605
00:20:12,019 --> 00:20:15,739
plenty of airflow if I can have air

606
00:20:13,578 --> 00:20:17,058
exchange I will put higher humidity in

607
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:18,288
the room if I feel like there's not a

608
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:20,618
lot of airflow and it will create

609
00:20:18,288 --> 00:20:23,450
problems I will reduce the humidity

610
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:24,769
accordingly I know I keep stressing it

611
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,778
but the most important thing to think

612
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:28,669
about when you are potting these clones

613
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:31,190
from the easy cloner from the turbo

614
00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:33,259
cloner is to not let those gangly roots

615
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,940
wrap up on themselves don't let them

616
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:37,190
bind don't let them smother themselves

617
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,528
don't let him suffocate themselves these

618
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,298
cloning machines can make roots explode

619
00:20:39,528 --> 00:20:42,558
you look in there on day 5 and you won't

620
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:44,658
have any roots you'll look in there on

621
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:45,950
day 6 you'll be getting roots you'll go

622
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:47,899
away for the weekend you'll come back

623
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,639
over the weekend on Monday the roots are

624
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:51,348
hanging down into the water they go

625
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:52,968
crazy very quickly

626
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:54,858
you will see what I'm talking about when

627
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:57,320
you get it dialed in don't take those

628
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:59,478
fat clones with big crazy roots and kill

629
00:20:57,319 --> 00:21:01,729
them by suffocating them by coiling them

630
00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:03,828
up in your soil all right so at this

631
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:06,379
point we have got a bunch of seedlings

632
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:08,628
or a bunch of clones in small pots or

633
00:21:06,378 --> 00:21:10,368
cups we've got them underneath t5 lights

634
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:12,439
or whatever light you've got available

635
00:21:10,368 --> 00:21:15,259
maybe you've got an LED maybe you've got

636
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:17,028
a small HBS maybe a 250 or a 400 if

637
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:18,950
you're using something larger that works

638
00:21:17,028 --> 00:21:20,778
just keep it further away just raise it

639
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,629
up real high so we've got it under an

640
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:25,459
acceptable light we've got it in a

641
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:28,038
desirable climate which is around 75 to

642
00:21:25,459 --> 00:21:29,509
85 degrees with the appropriate humidity

643
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:31,848
hopefully you've got somewhere between

644
00:21:29,509 --> 00:21:32,808
50 and 75 percent humidity for your

645
00:21:31,848 --> 00:21:35,509
small plants

646
00:21:32,808 --> 00:21:38,479
I would suggest either 24 hours on or

647
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:40,848
possibly 20 on and 4 off or a lot of

648
00:21:38,479 --> 00:21:44,239
people like to do 18 hours on and 6

649
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:46,489
hours off for our new small plants also

650
00:21:44,239 --> 00:21:48,348
I would recommend a light fan on these

651
00:21:46,489 --> 00:21:50,419
plants just a fan to keep the air moving

652
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:52,878
around them will prevent the plants from

653
00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:55,249
getting leggy and stretchy and I think

654
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:57,439
it just makes tougher more robust plants

655
00:21:55,249 --> 00:21:59,509
when you put a little breeze on them so

656
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,209
at this point the clones are now in our

657
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:04,429
small veg phase in a very short time

658
00:22:02,209 --> 00:22:06,558
those seedlings will catch up to what I

659
00:22:04,429 --> 00:22:09,139
consider the small veg phase which is

660
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,489
when they're about 6 inches tall and

661
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:12,588
they've got a couple of nice sets of

662
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:15,620
leaves and they can start taking small

663
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:18,919
veg nutrients I plan on doing a come

664
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:21,049
Pleet episode on small veg here in the

665
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,850
very near future that episode will

666
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:24,649
include recommended light cycles for

667
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:26,629
your veg plants that episode will

668
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,580
include recommended nutrient schedules

669
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,620
for your veg plants I'll also talk about

670
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:32,689
optimal environmental conditions for

671
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:34,308
your small veg plants then we'll talk

672
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:35,870
about transplanting our plants into

673
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:38,058
their finishing pots and we will

674
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:40,808
consider that large veg and then we will

675
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:42,680
begin to talk about our large veg phase

676

to thank you again for listening to the

694
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,370
podcast I know this was sort of a short

695
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,990
episode but I feel like I did a good

696
00:23:22,369 --> 00:23:25,909
lesson I taught you well how to

697
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:27,349
transplant your new babies I feel like

698
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,210
there was not a lot of fluff or a lot of

699
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:30,649
BS to filter through I feel like a lot

700
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,750
of people can learn from this one and

701
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,370
that is the point so short and sweet

702
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:36,769
right to the point we served our purpose

703
00:23:34,369 --> 00:23:38,569
I think Mike is on his way over so we

704
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:40,160
will record a long and rambly episode

705
00:23:38,569 --> 00:23:42,049
that will make up for the short episode

706
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,610
