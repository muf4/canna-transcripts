00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:19,109
dabbing on crescendo live batter from

31
00:01:16,438 --> 00:01:22,019
Green Dot labs the crescendo is a cross

32
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,239
of chem VI 95 and Mandarin cookies on

33
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:27,840
the package the flavor is described as

34
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:29,849
heavy chem gas and cookie dough I will

35
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,009
agree with all of that when you crack

36
00:01:29,849 --> 00:01:34,589
the jar open you are greeted with a very

37
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,868
pleasant cookie dough sweetness then

38
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,390
that is followed by a gassy chem punch

39
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:41,849
that I really enjoy as soon as it hits

40
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,340
the dab nail I get a really nice chem

41
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:46,559
gas flavor the aftertaste is a little

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,500
bit chemi with some sweetness the buzz

43
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,689

00:06:09,579 --> 00:06:13,870
kind of a bummer usually this time of

154
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,820
year I would be gearing up to go to the

155

happen for a couple of months because

162
00:06:26,649 --> 00:06:29,679
we've got to push that back there would

163
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,750
also be one other event which I would

164
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
attend usually there's one random event

165
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,100
I booked for the 4/20 weekend it is not

166
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,620
happening this year so that is kind of

167
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:40,450
weird all of my 4/20 events and

168
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,370
activities have basically been online

169
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:43,990
they've been on skype or they've been on

170
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,459
zoom' or they've been on FaceTime

171
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,889
I've done a couple of things on

172
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,589
Instagram live but that has been most of

173
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:53,379
my 4/20 celebration I did a really cool

174
00:06:50,589 --> 00:06:55,329
live show on YouTube with scotty reel

175
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,310
and tennessee gardens and our friend

176
00:06:55,329 --> 00:06:59,740
stone trout bum i thought that was a

177
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:01,810
really good time but we are lacking in

178
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,329
social interaction I need a concert I

179
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,160
need a comedy show I need some bros I

180
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:08,169
need a high-five I need some people

181
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,939
around dude it it's starting to get kind

182
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,610
of weird but then when I think about

183
00:07:09,939 --> 00:07:14,230
that I also think about how long is it

184
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,090
going to be before we are all

185
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:17,200
comfortable just congregating and

186
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,419
smoking together

187
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,979
first of all congregating together do

188
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:22,300
you want to be around a large group of

189
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,710
people right now a lot of people are

190
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,720
fine a lot of people like I don't care

191
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,069
let's do it let's [ __ ] smoke those

192
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,890
are the people we got to look out for

193
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:31,990
but how long until a lot of us are

194
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,659
comfortable getting in a big room and

195
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:36,819
just being together do you want 10

196
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,890
strangers in a small room with you and

197
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:41,560
then then we're gonna think about

198
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:43,389
smoking do you want to light up a joint

199
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,250
and put your lips on a joint that that

200
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,800
guy just put his lips on or that girl

201
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,600
just put her lips on or whichever D are

202
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,490
you a little bit worried I might be I'm

203
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,410
not sure I'm still a little bit

204
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:55,060
skeptical and brainwashed and paranoid

205
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:57,310
over the whole situation I don't want to

206
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,959
get sick I know my main risk is getting

207
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,120
other people sick because I'm fairly

208
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,649
healthy but I still don't want to get a

209
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,149
little bit sick I don't want to be down

210
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,889
for a couple of days I don't want to get

211
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:07,779
slowed down I got [ __ ] to do every day I

212
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,490
can't take a day off for a [ __ ]

213
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,769
stupid virus that tried to kick my ass

214
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,389
or kill me I don't need that so I've

215
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:15,219
been laying low during this whole

216
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:15,819
quarantine situation I'm kind of taking

217
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,700
it seriously

218
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:22,000
I think the weed growers and the video

219
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,920
gamers and also the fans all

220
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,170
girls all the girls the thirsty girls

221
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,569
the model girls the snapchat girls on

222
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,610
Instagram social media they're the ones

223
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,918
living it up we've been waiting for this

224
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,479
we're a professional since we've been in

225
00:08:32,918 --> 00:08:36,189
training for years the growers have been

226
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,440
isolated the breeders have been extra

227
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,780
isolated for a while I get a large

228
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,760
portion of my social interaction through

229
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:44,769
online stuff through Instagram live

230
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:46,000
through that sort of thing but I've been

231
00:08:44,769 --> 00:08:47,710
laying low through most of this

232
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,210
quarantine stuff because I really don't

233
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:50,620
need to be out there there's nothing for

234
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,629
me to go do everything is closed

235
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,490
everywhere is shut down I can go to the

236
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:56,529
dispensary occasionally and I can get

237
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,090
groceries and those are mainly the

238
00:08:56,529 --> 00:09:00,519
things that I need to do today I drove

239
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:02,440
through the drive-through car wash so

240
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,240
that I could wash my car because I was

241
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:06,040
just going stir-crazy I drove around the

242
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,960
block about 14 times and went through

243
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,759
the car wash once the car was all the

244
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,680
way dry I came back home that's how

245
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,240
exciting my day was today other than

246
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,819
hanging out here and smoking that's

247
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,529
about all I've done I've done ridiculous

248
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,420
amounts of online shopping but now I'm

249
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,889
getting [ __ ] delivered that I can't use

250
00:09:19,419 --> 00:09:22,269
any works I can't go anywhere to wear

251
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:23,860
any of shoes I can't go out in a new

252
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:26,199
shirt it's kind of silly right now

253
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,970
things are weird but I'm really not sure

254
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,930
how long it's going to be until it is

255
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,820
not weird

256
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:33,279
people are going to remain paranoid for

257
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:35,410
a long time even if the government or

258
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,480
whoever you trust or believe this Center

259
00:09:35,409 --> 00:09:38,980
for Disease Control or the epidemic

260
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,740
people whoever you're watching on TV

261
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,899
once they finally say it's okay for you

262
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:45,220
to go out a lot of people are still

263
00:09:43,899 --> 00:09:46,600
gonna be skeptical they're not gonna

264
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:48,910
want to go out they're not gonna want to

265
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,159
participate are you going to want to go

266
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:52,838
like I said earlier be most of the smoke

267
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,329
events we go to where you can consume

268
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:57,070
they are in fairly small buildings those

269
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:59,320
buildings are fairly tight without a lot

270
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,690
of ventilation you can see what happens

271
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:04,330
I'm a big guy I take a fairly large dab

272
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:07,300
when I take a dab and blow it out I can

273
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,020
watch my dab go across my record in my

274
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:09,789
dining room

275
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:12,549
my little dining-room area is probably

276
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:13,779
an 8 by 8 square maybe 6 by 6 square

277
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:15,250
where the table is it's just a little

278
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:17,500
tucked in like a cove part of the

279
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:19,149
kitchen off the kitchen so the dad fills

280
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,649
this area no problem within a few

281
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:22,509
seconds it drifts into the actual

282
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,100
kitchen area then it goes into the

283
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:25,629
kitchen then it moves over like toward

284
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,490
the laundry room area and then it starts

285
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:30,338
drifting down a hallway and it only

286
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:32,529
takes a minute for that dab smoke to get

287
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:34,390
all the way into my laundry room which

288
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,799
is the opposite end of the house and all

289
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,870
the way into the kitchen

290
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:39,879
or the bedroom if the exact opposite end

291
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,980
of the house takes a minute and my smoke

292
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:43,600
which is probably carrying my germs and

293
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,528
whatever else has now traveled through

294
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,690
the entire house

295
00:10:44,528 --> 00:10:48,580
it is everywhere I can watch it the Sun

296
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:50,110
shines in through this curtain I can see

297
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,759
where my smoke travels through if I take

298
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,159
a bong rip or a dab in the living room

299
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:57,009
it fills that living room as soon as I

300
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,449
exhale it comes out it [ __ ] bounces

301
00:10:57,009 --> 00:10:59,950
off of that wall it bounces off of that

302
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,540
wall you can see my smoke just kind of

303
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,879
swirling and chillin it looks like a big

304
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:05,740
presence in the room some sort of smokey

305
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,240
aberration just chilling out with us or

306
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,740
maybe it's a smoky vibration it's a

307
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,778
blessing just be in there with us but

308
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,610
you can see it just floating around in

309
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:14,559
the room so you can see my bong rip and

310
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:16,870
then when we're at events you can see

311
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,789
everybody else's dabs and bong rips just

312
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,440
circling around the room you watch

313
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:22,240
people blow out real hard so they got a

314
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:23,800
fresh lung they don't have any air in

315
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,329
their lungs they're empty they blow out

316
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,219
now they just blew out a bunch of fresh

317
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:28,809
air then they go and dab in they suck

318
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,089
that dab or that bong rip in or real

319
00:11:28,809 --> 00:11:32,768
hard and get a big fresh lung full and

320
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,290
then they blow it right back out and all

321
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:36,909
of their virus and lung junk just comes

322
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:39,099
out right into the air and now we're all

323
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:40,689
gonna breathe it together and then they

324
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,360
start coughing so they start breathing

325
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:45,399
even more heavily because they're trying

326
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,629
to recover from a big-ass dab or a fat

327
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,278
bong rip and all they're doing is

328
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:49,958
sucking in more smoke because those

329
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:51,490
events are so cloudy so it's harder to

330
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:53,679
recover it takes even longer

331
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:56,860
you're just gasping for oxygen so there

332
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,569
are several before you actually get your

333
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,339
[ __ ] together and you've just filled the

334
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,920
room with all of your junk enough

335
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:04,810
there's ten people in there imagine 10

336
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,389
people's worth of just junky breathy

337
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:09,009
filled up in the room I'm sure we never

338
00:12:07,389 --> 00:12:10,689
really thought too much about that until

339
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:12,458
now I saw people trying to take

340
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,649
precautions at events we always bring

341
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:16,419
the alcohol swabs the little while like

342
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:18,220
a handy wipe it's an alcohol swab and

343
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:20,319
just a little like a condom package you

344
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:22,269
pop it open wipe the rig down throw that

345
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,670
in the trash keep dabbing try to wipe it

346
00:12:22,269 --> 00:12:26,799
off between every user but we get lazy

347
00:12:24,669 --> 00:12:28,179
and we're friends it feels kind of rude

348
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:29,979
to be like hey bro wipe that off before

349
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,659
I smoked after you that's part of the

350
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,769
point of smoking with your friends is to

351
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,480
show that we were peaceful and were

352
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:36,519
united and we will smoke together that's

353
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,110
where the smoke circle originated you

354
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,000
know that's part of the whole deal you

355
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,860
bring the pipe I bring the goods or we

356
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,940
both bring half of the pipe and we share

357
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:44,620
the goods that way we know there's

358
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,270
nothing weird in the pipe there's a lot

359
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:47,769
of things behind smoking together there

360
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:49,639
are a lot of ceremonies and rituals that

361
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,990
involve that so

362
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:53,090
on that pipe together was part of the

363
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,889
whole thing we started seeing people

364
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,899
with a little ceramic or what's it

365
00:12:54,889 --> 00:12:58,909
silicone insert that pops into your rig

366
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:00,590
or into your bong and then you put your

367
00:12:58,909 --> 00:13:02,629
mouth on that we've seen people wearing

368
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,340
those on necklaces and lanyards we've

369
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:06,049
seen people trying to take precautions

370
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,519
but not everybody was taking anything

371
00:13:06,049 --> 00:13:09,829
seriously when we would go to these

372
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,509
events especially at some of the smoke

373
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,150
lounges and things there will be people

374
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:15,649
just lined up to hit the same rig I need

375
00:13:14,149 --> 00:13:17,240
to hit that I want to hit that you don't

376
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,159
see everybody clean it before and after

377
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:21,799
each use so how long is it gonna be

378
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:24,709
before we're comfortable congregating

379
00:13:21,799 --> 00:13:26,539
with ten people in a room 20 people 70

380
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:28,250
people some of the events we go to have

381
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,259
300 and something people some of them

382
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,639
are even larger than that how

383
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:34,490
comfortable are you gonna be with that

384
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,740
many people in there then how soon will

385
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,240
it be before you're ready to just grab a

386
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,279
joint that you just you don't know where

387
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,750
it came from you saw me hit it and then

388
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,730
I'm passing it to you you know it's at

389
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,320
least got my drool and germs on it how

390
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,120
many people before me hit it how far

391
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:48,740
down is that joint burned how

392
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,360
comfortable are you gonna be how long is

393
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:51,620
that gonna take the world is gonna be

394
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,629
different for a little bit and I'm

395
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,940
really curious to watch it go because

396
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:58,340
there are many people taking it super

397
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:00,050
seriously there are a lot of people kind

398
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,129
of doing the rules and trying to take it

399
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,629
seriously there are people who are

400
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:04,070
neutral who haven't changed their day at

401
00:14:02,629 --> 00:14:05,480
all and then there are people that are

402
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:07,430
like I don't give a [ __ ] about this

403
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,950
virus I'm gonna do everything just like

404
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:12,169
I was so I'm really curious to see how

405
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:14,330
this evolves I'm really curious to see

406
00:14:12,169 --> 00:14:17,509
what it's doing to the cannabis industry

407
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:20,420
right now cannabis is selling cannabis

408
00:14:17,509 --> 00:14:23,419
alcohol sex toys things of that nature

409
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:25,699
are selling ridiculously fast a

410
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:28,099
recording equipment is hard to buy right

411
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,840
now if you want specific good recording

412
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:32,210
equipment it's sold out at most of the

413
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,340
music vendors so some industries are

414
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,139
doing very well while many are kind of

415
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,649
at a standstill but right now the

416
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:40,730
cannabis industry is thriving

417
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:42,980
unfortunately many facilities have

418
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:45,170
minimized their staff because they don't

419
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,730
need human interaction in the building

420
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,709
if they can do the job with three people

421
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:50,450
they've got three people working if it

422
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,370
would be much easier with four or five

423
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:54,440
they still minimize it to three and let

424
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,179
those people work their asses off that

425
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:58,910
way it's just those three people coming

426
00:14:56,179 --> 00:15:01,979
and going less people less germs less

427
00:14:58,909 --> 00:15:04,259
exchange of bodily fluid and bodily air

428
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:06,450
contact that minimizes the risk to get

429
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:08,069
less people sick and those people can

430
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:10,230
handle it because they just work extra

431
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,879
hours and right now that's probably the

432
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:13,740
best thing to do is just be at work or

433
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:14,970
be at home there's no need to be out in

434
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,039
the public like I said earlier there's

435
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,170
nothing to do everywhere is closed my

436
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,789
town is a ghost town many of the

437
00:15:19,169 --> 00:15:23,250
restaurants are offering delivery only

438
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:25,769
but we've been so far into this

439
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,259
quarantine that many of my local

440
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:30,090
restaurants have closed down until the

441
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,590
quarantine is over or they have just

442
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:33,990
given up for good because they're not

443
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:35,519
making enough money to pay a staff to be

444
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,919
there to wait for the couple of food

445
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,840
orders they do get but the dispensaries

446
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,699
are swamped with customers the

447
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,070
dispensaries are doing their best to

448
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:45,840
practice safe social distancing they're

449
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,670
only allowing a certain amount of people

450
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,840
in the waiting room at a time depending

451
00:15:47,669 --> 00:15:50,669
on the size of the waiting room of

452
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,899
course if it's a six by six area you get

453
00:15:50,669 --> 00:15:53,849
one [ __ ] in there if it's a

454
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,829
little bigger we can fit more people in

455
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,570
there then once you're in the bud room

456
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,280
they're actually minimizing your time in

457
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:01,740
the bud room they request four minutes

458
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,360
per patient or customer in the bud room

459
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,759
I've been shopping at the medical and

460
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,080
recreational dispensaries the protocols

461
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,899
are a little bit different at both

462
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,090
places but it's similar at the Colorado

463
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,189
cannabis exchange they don't let you

464
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:15,660
pass really you walk in the door to the

465
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:18,330
bud room and there is a counter and an

466
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:20,549
ATM just working as a roadblock that's

467
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:21,960
as far as you can get it's very obvious

468
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,279
they don't want you going past there you

469
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,560
walk in and you're stuck right there

470
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,209
they have a few things inside of the

471
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,919
glass counter on display so that you can

472
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,780
see here are the few concentrates we've

473
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:32,759
got left and then the flowers are behind

474
00:16:30,779 --> 00:16:35,129
the budtender you can see those clearly

475
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:36,809
they do have a couple of menus printed

476
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,919
that are in the waiting room so you can

477
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:39,359
look in the waiting room and get a

478
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,610
little idea of what you want before you

479
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,930
get back there so that's helpful but the

480
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,480
shopping experience is very different

481
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:46,979
I'm used to being able to grab the jars

482
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,899
and hold them and put the jar of

483
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,970
concentrate or the jar of flowers up to

484
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:52,350
my nose and give it a smell and kind of

485
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,210
look and see if it looks appealing

486
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,009
smells appealing if it's the right color

487
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,530
and texture and that's how I make my

488
00:16:56,009 --> 00:17:00,210
decisions this time I had to kind of

489
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,879
look through the glass and hope that it

490
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:05,640
smelled good I shop with Green Dot labs

491
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,470
so it is always amazing concentrates I

492
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,509
was really satisfied with the crescendo

493
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,579
I had to go back for more and then again

494
00:17:09,509 --> 00:17:13,500
for more because it was really delicious

495
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:15,730
I that's perfect for me is right up my

496
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,558
alley but the shopping experience is

497
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,078
a little bit different but they are

498
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:22,000
selling so much product even with the

499
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,548
weird adjustments the medical and

500
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,619
recreational dispensaries are selling

501
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:29,139
there has been a line every time I have

502
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:31,329
gone part of the line could be because

503
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:33,009
it is taking a touch longer to help

504
00:17:31,329 --> 00:17:35,079
people because of the different setup

505
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:37,480
also more people are shopping I've

506
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:39,339
noticed that I see different people at

507
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,230
the dispensaries when you go to the same

508
00:17:39,339 --> 00:17:43,058
dispensaries on a regular rotation you

509
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:45,160
start seeing the same people I'm seeing

510
00:17:43,058 --> 00:17:47,139
brand new faces there are more cars

511
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,850
there's more traffic they're the only

512
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,009
places open the liquor stores the

513
00:17:48,849 --> 00:17:53,349
dispensaries very few restaurants

514
00:17:51,009 --> 00:17:55,539
the bank is open its drive-through only

515
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:57,189
there are very few places you can

516
00:17:55,539 --> 00:17:58,779
actually go to so the dispensary and the

517
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,548
carwash have been very entertaining

518
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:02,259
lately starting to feel like that weird

519
00:18:00,548 --> 00:18:03,250
guy that just shows up at the dispensary

520
00:18:02,259 --> 00:18:05,169
with nothing to do and like I'm just

521
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:07,150
here to buy two grams and to see another

522
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:09,070
human but I'm also trying not to go too

523
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,590
often so I go and I get my limit and

524
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:12,069
then I'm scary low I go back and get my

525
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,959
limit

526
00:18:12,069 --> 00:18:16,329
but I also want to go because there's

527
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,100
people there and I like people but my

528
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:20,859
point is the cannabis industry the

529
00:18:18,099 --> 00:18:23,079
recreational and medical and also the

530
00:18:20,859 --> 00:18:25,839
free market cannabis industries are

531
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:27,789
thriving here in southern Colorado we

532
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,769
are lucky enough that they have declared

533
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:32,409
cannabis recreational and medical

534
00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:34,990
cannabis to be essential businesses they

535
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,308
also did the same with alcohol and there

536
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,210
are a couple of reasons for that I think

537
00:18:36,308 --> 00:18:39,940
I've talked about this on the show

538
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:41,169
before they were going to close the

539
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,150
liquor stores they made an announcement

540
00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:46,179
hey liquor stores are to close at a

541
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:48,910
certain time on this day and everybody

542
00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:51,130
in Colorado went to the nearest liquor

543
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,808
store and got in line and it was kind of

544
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,860
funny to see that when they're like hey

545
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,808
you're not gonna be able to buy booze

546
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:57,668
everybody was like nah [ __ ] that there

547
00:18:55,808 --> 00:18:59,410
were lines around the blocks and none of

548
00:18:57,669 --> 00:19:01,270
those lines were going to be gone by the

549
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,190
cutoff time where they said hey this is

550
00:19:01,269 --> 00:19:05,740
when you close last call for alcohol and

551
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,410
so eventually our governor said hey

552
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:10,150
maybe we shouldn't do that they also did

553
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,100
that because they thought about the fact

554
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:14,559
that people will go into alcohol

555
00:19:12,099 --> 00:19:16,509
withdrawals strong alcoholics will die

556
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,519
if you cut them off cold turkey and that

557
00:19:16,509 --> 00:19:21,190
would just overload the hospitals with

558
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,808
unnecessary problems and if you don't

559
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,580
give us some weed and some alcohol while

560
00:19:22,808 --> 00:19:26,470
you lock us down for several weeks we

561
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:28,149
may [ __ ] revolt you may see more

562
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,110
problems than you were prepared for so

563
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:31,509
they decided

564
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:33,189
you leave the alcohol as essential

565
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:34,960
business and cannabis is deemed

566
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,120
essential business which I really find

567
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,980
to be a blessing that gave a lot of job

568
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:40,689
security to my industry friends because

569
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:42,548
many of my friends are in the cannabis

570
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,900
industry my other friends are in the

571
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,789
service industries and they are all

572
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,100
[ __ ] all of my comedian friends all my

573
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:49,480
waiter and bartender and staff and

574
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:51,129
whatever type of service if you bring

575
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,808
something to somebody and expect a tip

576
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,160
many of those people are [ __ ] out of

577
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:56,589
luck right now so I'm glad that at least

578
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,929
my cannabis industry friends are still

579
00:19:56,589 --> 00:20:00,579
in work and maybe it sounds a little bit

580
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:02,890
selfish but I'm really glad that I can

581
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:05,019
still get my concentrates imagine if we

582
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:07,600
we're all just cut off of all of our

583
00:20:05,019 --> 00:20:09,279
concentrates are flowers our buds our

584
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,259
dabs our edibles whatever you do to

585
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,609
medicate yourself if you use SABS or rub

586
00:20:11,259 --> 00:20:14,410
in if you go to the dispensary and buy

587
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:16,269
something imagine if they're just like

588
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:18,429
now we're shutting that down we've kind

589
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:20,470
of established a lifestyle around having

590
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:22,120
these products available it may it may

591
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,980
make a few people go a little bit more

592
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:25,479
than stir crazy you can't go outside

593
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,730
you're trapped with your family and

594
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,048
nothing to [ __ ] lubricate your mind

595
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,700
that would be fun

596
00:20:29,048 --> 00:20:32,470
you guys I just realized I've been

597
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:33,819
rambling for like a complete 20 minutes

598
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:35,110
and we haven't covered a subject we

599
00:20:33,819 --> 00:20:37,720
haven't talked about cannabis in any

600
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:39,129
sort of way it is 4/20 I just had a few

601

bowl for 4/20 so

633
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:46,509
I'm asking I'll share a little bit right

634
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,279
now I would probably put on some tasks

635
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:50,079
and lionís just because I like listening

636
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:52,269
to tasks and Linus when I'm taking dad's

637
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,339
at 7:10 then I would probably put on

638
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,930
some routes II feel and reggae maybe

639
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:58,359
some Iike Mouse or something like that

640
00:21:55,930 --> 00:22:00,250
right now then we may go on to something

641
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:01,929
a little more modern a little more well

642
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:03,609
produced cuz I want that low tone in my

643
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,380
ear we may go with some revolution or

644
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:06,549
something like that for a little bit but

645
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,560
then we're gonna have to go route C

646
00:22:06,549 --> 00:22:10,480
again then we may go some like morgen

647
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,149
heritage or something like that but then

648
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,829
we'll finish the day with fish I like to

649
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:16,450
listen to fish in the evenings just

650
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:18,639
smoked down listened to fish it lets my

651
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,110
brain wander a lot just a long fishy Jam

652
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,150
when tre is really lighting it up

653
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:25,059
everybody that listens knows I'm a huge

654
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:27,280
fish man I'm also a giant Grateful Dead

655
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:29,109
fan many of my strains are named after

656
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,180
Grateful Dead songs and Grateful Dead

657
00:22:29,109 --> 00:22:33,669
type of stuff so that is where my

658
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:36,460
musical taste is of course roots II dub

659
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:37,950
reggae fish and the Grateful Dead are

660
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:41,680
always gonna be my top three choices

661
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:44,529
then I'm a classic rock guy I was raised

662
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,090
with three stoner uncles and of course I

663
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:48,549
had two aunts and my mom who were also

664
00:22:46,089 --> 00:22:50,529
semi pot heads who liked his good

665
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:52,659
old-fashioned classic rock rock and roll

666
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,579
so I know all that stuff I love all that

667
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:57,070
[ __ ] it just feels good I'm also a

668
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:59,079
drummer I'm a musician I've been paid to

669
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:00,789
play with a lot of bands I was known

670
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,679
around here as the guy that could fill

671
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:04,779
in for your classic rock band so I know

672
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,700
all of that classic rock stuff I blame

673
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:08,259
that on my upbringing the songs were in

674
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,090
my head when I started playing drums

675
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:12,039
like well let's just learn all of this

676
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:14,319
stuff and it came out naturally I know

677
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:16,299
it it's a good time then if you want to

678
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,579
kind of delve into a little bit random

679
00:23:16,299 --> 00:23:20,710
side of my music I grew up with like a

680
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:23,139
lot of Metallica type of stuff so I know

681
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:27,250
a lot of Metallica Megadeath Pantera

682
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:29,680
Pearl Jam Nirvana all that 1995 MTV

683
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:32,289
stuff that's right up my alley I dig on

684
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,870
that [ __ ] too so that's that's what I

685
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:37,029
dig on for music when we really need a

686
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:38,589
change and the trim crew is lagging and

687
00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:40,000
we've been there too long and you can

688
00:23:38,589 --> 00:23:41,949
tell that people are dragging ass and

689
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,599
they want to go home Thursday like on a

690
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,009
Thursday it's not quite Friday and

691
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,109
everybody wishes it was Friday cuz

692
00:23:45,009 --> 00:23:48,789
Friday's got its own vibe on Thursday

693
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:53,259
that's when I put on that like cheesy

694
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:55,809
90s pop rock [ __ ] just cheesy white

695
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:57,460
guy rock music it's poppy it's Rocky

696
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,079
maybe some barenaked ladies in there

697
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,150
that's not by choice I just put on like

698
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,769
a Spotify channel and played that kind

699
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:05,860
of [ __ ] you're gonna get what are those

700
00:24:02,769 --> 00:24:08,170
guys called Sugar Ray and [ __ ] bare

701
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:09,789
naked ladies and all that cheesy [ __ ]

702
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:12,400
what's that other group that I'm

703
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,990
thinking of some body wants Tommy that

704
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,610
[ __ ] is so cheesy but when you get the

705
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:17,140
crew singing it you're all just laughing

706
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:18,849
it'll bring a totally different vibe it

707
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,830
refreshes the room so that's like my

708
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:22,899
last resort things have gone wrong

709
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:25,269
that's what we put on unites the whole

710
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,530
crew everybody knows that [ __ ] you just

711
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,849
start seeing different people seeing

712
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,230
songs and you're like I had no idea you

713
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,939
would know that one and no idea you

714
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,349
would know that one but that [ __ ] works

715
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,090
for everybody it's cheesy

716
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:35,319
you only play it for a few songs once

717
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:37,299
you get everybody going again you let

718
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:39,759
them pick their music one of my favorite

719
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:41,950
things is if I run the grow if I'm the

720
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,900
cultivation manager the first grower to

721
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,160
get there gets to select the music for

722
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:47,110
the grow part of the building the first

723
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:49,060
trimmer to get there selects music for

724
00:24:47,109 --> 00:24:50,529
the trim part of the building then we

725
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:52,359
jam their music for the first part of

726
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:54,609
the day that's just a little reward so

727
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:57,069
that is where my musical brain is I love

728
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:59,319
music I talk a lot about music what else

729
00:24:57,069 --> 00:25:00,970
are we gonna do munchies and snacks bro

730
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:02,889
you got some good music done you just

731
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:04,180
took a fat dad what are you gonna reach

732
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,120
for to put in your face so you're gonna

733
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:10,299
have some sort of a snack I honestly try

734
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,609
to not snack too much after I dab

735
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:14,740
because then I just need more dabs I

736
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:18,279
catch myself in this vicious cycle of

737
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,900
dabs snacks dad's snacks and you never

738
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,460
really get to enjoy I guess you enjoy

739
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,110
the [ __ ] out of the snacks but you're

740
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,630
always just chasing that high away by

741
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:27,639
eating snacks so I try to get fairly

742
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,230
blazed and don't eat for a long time

743
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,120
until it's like bro you better eat or

744
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:32,950
shits gonna go wrong and that's what I

745
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:35,109
liked it I have food I like to eat good

746
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,220
food I've been really not bragging here

747
00:25:35,109 --> 00:25:38,079
this sounds like [ __ ] for a minute but

748
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,970
I've really eliminated sugar and crap

749
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,259
from my diet and all the snacks have

750
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:43,720
kind of been switched over to like

751
00:25:41,259 --> 00:25:45,579
hummus and carrots and like actual good

752
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,680
fruit and [ __ ] and since I've quit

753
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:50,439
eating all the sugary stuff and spoiling

754
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,560
my face with crap fruit and real food

755
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,980
tastes amazing and when I drink kombucha

756
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,869
now the kombucha just tingles and dances

757
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:00,460
on my tongue since I'm not drinking dr.

758
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:02,169
pepper that kombucha tastes so much

759
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,549
better I know the kombucha is not for

760
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:05,380
some people if it's for you you know

761
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,089
what I'm talking about that just sweet

762
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,770
kombucha dance a nice grapefruit

763
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:10,339
sparkling kombucha oh yeah it'll put a

764
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:12,139
smile on your face

765
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:13,158
but when you get stoned what are you

766
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,778
reaching for to eat what are you

767
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:16,640
reaching for to drink I'm probably gonna

768
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:18,409
go for like maybe some strawberries

769
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,000
maybe some chopped up watermelon I like

770
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,100
a lot of fruit pieces that really makes

771
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,778
me feel good makes me not feel like a

772
00:26:22,099 --> 00:26:26,509
piece of [ __ ] for spoiling myself with

773
00:26:23,778 --> 00:26:27,859
too much crap I do catch myself eating a

774
00:26:26,509 --> 00:26:29,990
lot of peanut butter and jelly

775
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:32,240
sandwiches during quarantine I think

776
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:34,009
that is boredom eating I'm just bored so

777
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,690
I gonna make a PB&amp;J and [ __ ] snack

778
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,980
that [ __ ] down because it takes a

779
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,840
minutes all the peanut butter you can't

780
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:41,150
just shout it down so that's like my

781
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:43,009
crappy snack lately I think the jelly is

782
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:44,240
a little more sugar and junk than really

783
00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:46,069
what I need especially with all the

784
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,079
other fruit my diet and then like I

785
00:26:46,069 --> 00:26:50,148
mentioned I really like a nice kombucha

786
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:52,099
a nice cold frosty cold kombucha with a

787
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:55,219
nice fizz to it that's delicious

788
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:58,219
or I also really dig in Odwalla

789
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:00,558
the mango madness or a strawberry

790
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:02,210
protein or almost any of the Odwalla

791
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,859
hook me up with the fruity flavored one

792
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,480
I'll be just happy but that's the kind

793
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,428
of [ __ ] I reach for when it is snacky

794
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,169
time trying to be healthy trying to take

795
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:10,730
care of myself and do better I encourage

796
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,020
you to do the same thing I feel better I

797
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:13,759
feel good I know that you guys don't

798
00:27:12,019 --> 00:27:15,168
care about that this is a weed show but

799
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,558
when you take care yourself you feel

800
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:17,000
better

801
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:18,619
when you water your plants and feed them

802
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,269
better they act better your brain and

803
00:27:18,619 --> 00:27:22,969
body will do the same thing all right so

804
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:24,168
we got music we got snacks what else do

805
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,850
you do are you one of the people that

806
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:27,649
puts on a movie and watches the same

807
00:27:25,849 --> 00:27:29,298
[ __ ] movie over and over again I

808
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:31,129
can't do that once I've seen a movie
