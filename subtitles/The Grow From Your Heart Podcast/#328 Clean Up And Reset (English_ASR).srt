apothecary now if you've been following

40
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,310

41
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,530
the episodes about determining ripeness

42
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,019
of your cannabis plants then we did an

43
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,180
episode about flushing your plants then

44
00:01:34,019 --> 00:01:37,589
we did an episode about harvesting then

45
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,600
we did an episode about drying and

46
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:42,180
curing your cannabis plants then we did

47
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,250
an episode about trimming now it is time

48
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,280
to clean up the grow room and get

49
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,290
restarted for the next cycle let's talk

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,840
a little bit about after harvest

51
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,140
cleaning it sounds pretty basic but

52
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,728
there are a few things you may overlook

53
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,439
now if you had bugs or powdery mildew

54
00:01:56,728 --> 00:01:59,789
you may want to step up your cleaning

55
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:01,919
product you may want to step up your

56
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:04,350
cleaning regimen but if you didn't have

57
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,390
any bugs or any issues I think a light

58
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:07,949
bleach and water solution should work or

59
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:10,649
maybe you might want to get yourself

60
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,989
some flies in and use 15 to 20 mils a

61
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,469
thousand per gallon of water use that to

62
00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,870
clean up

63
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:18,270
whole grow either way whatever product

64
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,300
do you use let's clean everything let's

65
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:23,280
clean the walls wipe down every inch of

66
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,140
every wall start at one section at the

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,699
top and just work your way down and to

68
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:28,889
the right and then just keep going until

69
00:02:26,699 --> 00:02:31,469
you've covered every inch of that grow

70
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:33,569
room also if you can reach scrub the

71
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:36,569
ceiling if you can't reach find me I can

72
00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:37,289

73
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:39,209
the ceiling

74
00:02:37,289 --> 00:02:42,000

75
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:43,379
hot water or FISA and hot water and just

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,180

77
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,620
hiding that we don't want in that grow

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,030
on the floor the floor is gross clean it

167
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:50,430
up also here's something I should

168
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:52,289
mention if you've got light reflectors

169
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,569
with glass on them so that they're

170
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,670
air-cooled clean that glass take that

171
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:59,009
glass out wipe that [ __ ] down with some

172
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,860
Windex let it dry and put it back clean

173
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:03,899
the reflector glass also clean all of

174
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:06,030
your air conditioner filters check them

175
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:08,219
make sure they are clean if you've got

176
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:10,019
ducting anywhere check your ducting make

177
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,910
sure the ducting isn't bent in any weird

178
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:14,279
places make sure there are no clogs make

179
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,630
sure all of your duct is secured make

180
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:16,979
sure it's duct taped or clamped

181
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:18,420
somewhere so that the air you're trying

182
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,400
to move away from the grow doesn't

183
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,500
accidentally end up being blown right

184
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,479
where you don't need it if you've got a

185
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,189
leak that air is just gonna come flying

186
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,379
out of there you may just be moving the

187
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:29,790
heat from the light right back into the

188
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:31,740
grill room then your air conditioner has

189
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,689
to work harder and you can't figure out

190
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,129
why the room isn't cooling down and it

191
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:37,410
gets frustrating so check all of your

192
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:40,350
ducting check your carbon filter is that

193
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:41,430
carbon filter still filtering can you

194
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,710
smell the herb out

195
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,199
when you grow did anybody mention that

196
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,698
your harvest stunk really badly how long

197
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,009
have you had that carbon filter did you

198
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:52,439
write it down you should know when that

199
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,759
carbon filter needs to be replaced a lot

200
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,370
of the brands say they will last two

201
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,590
years I never believe in that I've never

202
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:01,350
had a carbon filter last two years

203
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:02,788
also that carbon filter cover maybe

204
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,590
you're gonna leave that filter there for

205
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:06,779
two years and it's got that little dust

206
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,939
cover on it take that ugly thing off

207
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,788
throw it in the washer with some oxy

208
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:13,800
clean and clean that thing nobody wants

209
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:16,740
to see your pictures of your black and

210
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,340
gray carbon filter dust cover that is

211
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,590
gross

212
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:21,269
also you guys get in there and clean out

213
00:07:19,589 --> 00:07:22,918
the reservoir if you've got a reservoir

214
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:25,049
that you mix your nutrients in or that

215
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:26,279
you use as part of your hydro system

216
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,350
that you're pumping your nutrients from

217
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,478
right to your plants clean that

218
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:32,280
reservoir why wouldn't you want a clean

219
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:33,689
fresh start you don't want biofilm and

220
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,179
funk in there because that's going

221
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:37,500
directly to your plants also clean all

222
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,689
of the tubing I've already said that

223
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,978
once but clean it all because all that

224
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:44,939
gunk will end up into your plants

225
00:07:42,978 --> 00:07:46,589
another thing we should remember to

226
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:48,509
clean is the emitters if you've got a

227
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:50,219
hydro system with some sprayers or

228
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,529
emitters or sprinklers at the end of a

229
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,120
line make sure you pop those emitters

230
00:07:52,529 --> 00:07:56,908
off and clean them they like to get

231
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,709
filled with some gunky funk now is the

232
00:07:56,908 --> 00:08:01,589
perfect opportunity to take all those

233
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:03,329
off and clean them up real well another

234
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:05,158
really important thing we can do while

235
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:07,168
we've got the room taken down we can

236
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:09,569
decide if we need to replace any bulbs

237
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:11,969
how long have your bulbs been in the

238
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:13,949
grow depending on what type of lighting

239
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,860
you're using it may be time to swap out

240
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:18,810
some bulbs when bulbs get old they still

241
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,090
draw the same amount of electricity but

242
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,709
they do not put out the same amount of

243
00:08:21,089 --> 00:08:24,689
light so you're paying for that

244
00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:27,089
electricity and it is not making it to

245
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:29,129
your plants so check your bulbs and see

246
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:30,598
if they need to be replaced a good way

247
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:33,658
to find out if they need to be replaced

248
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,250
is to get a lumen meter a lumen meter

249
00:08:33,658 --> 00:08:37,740
will measure how much light is coming

250
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,408
from your bulb if your bulb is putting

251
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:42,538
out less than 75 or 80 percent of its

252
00:08:40,408 --> 00:08:44,069
maximum output it is time to replace it

253
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:46,500
now how do you know what the maximum

254
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,750
output of that bulb is the way to find

255
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,909
that out is to buy a brand new bulb put

256
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,589
the bulb in your reflector and turn it

257
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:54,600
on then you've got to wait a few minutes

258
00:08:52,589 --> 00:08:55,860
and let that bulb get to its maximum

259
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,750
brightness it takes a little while for

260
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,039
the bulbs to heat up and get to the

261
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,750
right spectrum and get all the way

262
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,750
bright once it's bright and all the way

263
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,639
heated up go about 12 to 18 inches from

264
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,470
that bulb and measure what the lumens

265
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,440
are right there and write it down write

266
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,550
down the date and the amount of lumens

267
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,190
then check it now when you're cleaning

268
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:16,109
the room go the same distance away with

269
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,240
that lumen meter and see how many lumens

270
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,129
are popping up if you're not satisfied

271
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,959
with the amount of power you're getting

272
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:24,088
out of that bulb it is time to replace

273
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,679
it if you feel like you're paying for

274
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:27,509
electricity that it's not making it to

275
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,138
your plants it is time to replace your

276
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:33,360
bowl the lumen meters may be expensive

277
00:09:31,139 --> 00:09:35,519
but a lot of times the grow shop will

278
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,409
let you borrow one because they know

279
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,149
that if your bulbs are bad you're

280
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:41,789
probably just gonna come buy more bulbs

281
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:43,318
when you return the lumen meter so ask

282
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,448
him at the gross store they may have one

283
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:45,778
available that you can borrow all right

284
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:47,549
guys

285
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:49,350
most of the cleaning stuff should be

286
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:51,359
fairly obvious clean the [ __ ] out of

287
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,980
everything scrub everything if you're

288
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,419
gonna put plants in anything that had a

289
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:56,819
cleaner in it make sure you get that

290
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:59,068
cleaner out replace the bulbs replace

291
00:09:56,818 --> 00:10:01,289
the filters some other things we may not

292
00:09:59,068 --> 00:10:03,269
remember to think about our check and

293
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:05,250
reset your timers and all of your

294
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,409
programs if you've got your lights on a

295
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:09,208
certain schedule fix that schedule if

296
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:11,250
you've got your co2 or your auto

297
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:13,049
watering on a schedule make sure you

298
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:15,208
correct that schedule before you put new

299
00:10:13,049 --> 00:10:18,028
plants in here did daylight savings time

300
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:20,250
happen check that is the timer on the

301
00:10:18,028 --> 00:10:22,919
right time is your timer on the right

302
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:25,110
day a lot of the controllers have a day

303
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:26,610
that you can set is it Monday Tuesday or

304
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,188
Wednesday is that the proper day do you

305
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,899
have AM and PM set properly make sure

306
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:33,120
you check out all of your controllers

307
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,698
before you put plants in there and you

308
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,698
accidentally flower them way too early

309
00:10:35,698 --> 00:10:40,769
also check out all of your co2 controls

310
00:10:38,698 --> 00:10:43,559
another thing I like to do at this point

311
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:46,139
in time is calibrate all of my pens and

312
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,818
meters I like to calibrate my pH pen I

313
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:49,560
like to make sure that my EC meter is

314
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:50,849
working properly these are all things

315
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:52,888
that you should check on between

316
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,019
harvests I like to calibrate my meters

317
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:57,060
about once every two weeks to tell you

318
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,889
the truth probably every 10 days I just

319
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,969
like to check on them and make sure that

320
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:05,039
those things are accurate another thing

321
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:07,480
you should have a fire extinguisher near

322
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,309
your grow check on that look at

323
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,320
little gauge on there make sure it's in

324
00:11:09,309 --> 00:11:14,229
the green if your fire extinguisher

325
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,730
gauge is not in the green either buy a

326
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,409
new one or take it to the fire

327
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,079
department and have it refilled

328
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:22,149
correctly I really hope you don't have

329
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:24,399
to use that fire extinguisher but if you

330
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,649
need it I really want it to work for you

331
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,980
also check the batteries in your smoke

332
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:32,350
alarm yes I said smoke alarm your grow

333
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,360
should have a smoke alarm you don't want

334
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,980
to burn down the house because something

335
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,409
went wrong in the grow room and you did

336
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:40,300
not have a smoke detector and a fire

337
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:42,009
extinguisher so be a responsible grower

338
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:45,129
make sure that the safety precautions

339
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:46,569
are in place now since we're checking on

340
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:48,939
the fire extinguisher and the smoke

341
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,100
alarm it is a good time to check on your

342
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:52,570
respirator are you using a respirator to

343
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:54,459
apply pesticides

344
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:56,139
I really hope you're using something to

345
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,849
keep yourself safe if you're using a

346
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:59,589
respirator now is the time to check

347
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,750
those cartridges how long have they been

348
00:11:59,589 --> 00:12:05,019
on there is it time to replace them is

349
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,549
that respirator clean maybe it's time to

350
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:08,649
watch a Google video and learn how to

351
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:10,359
properly clean and take care of your

352
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:12,730
respirator that thing is going to save

353
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:15,009
your life over time take care of that

354
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,139
also it's a good time to replace your

355
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:19,629
gloves do you need more nitrile gloves

356
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:21,940
do you need more time x suits now is a

357
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:24,189
really good time to make a list and go

358
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,800
to the gross store and stock up on those

359
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,300
types of items alright so we've got the

360
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,039
grill room nice and clean we have

361
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:31,419
checked all of our safety precautions

362
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:33,969
we've refilled all of the necessary

363
00:12:31,419 --> 00:12:36,189
supplies now it's a good time to do a

364
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,470
quick inventory of your pesticides and

365
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,610
nutrients and any accessories you think

366
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,040
you may need if you're gonna need

367
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,509
pesticides or nutrients start ordering

368
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:45,278
that stuff now so that when you move

369
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:46,778
your plants back into the room you have

370
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:48,669
got all of the nutrients and all the

371
00:12:46,778 --> 00:12:51,068
supplies you need so that you don't miss

372
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:52,568
a day of the grow cycle so we've got

373
00:12:51,068 --> 00:12:53,948
everything cleaned up we've checked out

374
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:55,689
all of our safety equipment we've

375
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:57,490
restocked of our personal protective

376
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,440
equipment we have reordered all of our

377
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:01,448
nutrients now if we didn't have any

378
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,449
problems with pests or powdery mildew it

379
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:07,088
is time to start running that room and

380
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:10,328
get it prepared for the next cycle now

381
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,560
if you did have pests or problems there

382
00:13:10,328 --> 00:13:13,138
are a couple of more steps that we need

383
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:15,518
to take we need to clean this room

384
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:18,250
thoroughly we need to spray it with some

385
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,139
products we might want to go a little

386
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,100
harder with the bleach water we might

387
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:23,230
want to go a little hard

388
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,230
with some Phi's an you might want to get

389
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:27,730
a product called procure if you had

390
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,500
powdery mildew you're gonna want to

391
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:33,070
spray something to get rid of the spores

392
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:34,419
in that room if you had bugs I would

393
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,090
recommend spraying some sort of

394
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:39,309
pesticide through the entire room just

395
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:41,259
mix up your pesticide sprayer your pump

396
00:13:39,309 --> 00:13:43,119
sprayer if you don't have one go get one

397
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:44,529
from Lowe's get a good one

398
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,789
get a deck sprayer that can handle

399
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,500
bleach because you're gonna be putting

400
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:49,000
some chemicals in here they're not that

401
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
expensive you just need one that holds

402
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,220
about a gallon maybe two gallons of

403
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:55,840
water fill it up with water put your

404
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,210
cleaning product in there whether it's

405
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,980
Faiz an whether it's procure whether

406
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:01,870
it's a bunch of bleach maybe you want to

407
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:04,570
use granulated sulfur if you had a PM

408
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:06,669
issue mix that up spray the [ __ ] out of

409
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:09,100
the entire room this is your best

410
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:10,419
opportunity to spray everything and

411
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:12,279
eliminate your problem there are no

412
00:14:10,419 --> 00:14:13,659
plants in there so you can use products

413
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:15,279
that you wouldn't spray when you've got

414
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:17,500
plants in there so get in there and

415
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,970
clean the [ __ ] out of the room I would

416
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:21,190
start with the normal cleaning I

417
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:23,290
recommend it take everything down and

418
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:25,390
clean it then put it back up then setup

419
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:27,429
the room and before you put the plants

420
00:14:25,389 --> 00:14:30,129
in there go in there with this extra

421
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:32,229
hard commando cleaning spray and go

422
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:34,090
really hard you guys you got to get all

423
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:35,830
of the bugs out of there or you're just

424
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,509
gonna bring plants in there and they're

425
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,460
gonna get bugs or they're gonna get PM

426
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,439
and you're gonna have another struggling

427
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:44,050
harvest and nobody likes to struggle

428
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,670
through a harvest so now we've taken

429
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,349
everything apart we've cleaned the [ __ ]

430
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:49,569
out of the room we've replaced the bulbs

431
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:51,340
we've replaced all of our filters we

432
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:53,440
have calibrated all of our equipment

433
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,210
we've got new protective equipment we

434
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,220
have tested our safety equipment we've

435
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,379
put the room back together we've gone in

436
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:01,450
there and done another final spray maybe

437
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,460
we hit it with thighs in maybe we

438
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:04,660
sprayed procure on everything to try to

439
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,879
get rid of our problems

440
00:15:04,659 --> 00:15:09,399
maybe we just sprayed bleach water real

441
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:11,080
hot bleach water in there maybe we went

442
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:12,850
in there with some h2o too that would

443
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,379
work really well also but if you use any

444
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,759
type of product like that you guys make

445
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:18,399
sure you wear personal protective

446
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,529
equipment some goggles and a respirator

447
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,509
you don't want to spray bleach you don't

448
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,549
want to spray h2o2 you don't want to

449
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:25,990
spray flies in without some sort of

450
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,849
protective equipment that shit'll be

451
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,220
terrible for your eyes terrible for your

452
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:32,379
skin please take care of yourself and if

453
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:34,899
you're using a sprayer to spray anything

454
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:37,869
please use some sort of

455
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:39,188
respiratory protection please now once

456
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:41,920
the room is put back together

457
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:43,448
here is something I suggest I would turn

458
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,759
on the lights I would turn on your

459
00:15:43,448 --> 00:15:47,409
blowers I would turn on the fans I would

460
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,028
turn on the air-conditioner and I would

461
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:50,558
let everything run for a few minutes and

462
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:52,629
I would stand in the room and pay

463
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:54,159
attention is there anything wrong is

464
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:56,528
there anything you could dial in is

465
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:59,649
there anything you could adjust do it

466
00:15:56,528 --> 00:16:02,289
while you're in there then go outside

467
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:04,089
and walk around your grow space if your

468
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:05,558
grow is at your house just go walk

469
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,420
around the house just go pick up trash

470
00:16:05,558 --> 00:16:09,909
around the house or whatever and see if

471
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:11,349
you can identify any light leaks do you

472
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:13,928
see light coming out of your grow room

473
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,319
if you see light coming out there is

474
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:19,509
light going in we do not want and cannot

475
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,338
have light leaks in our grow room so

476
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:23,709
walk around the house walk around the

477
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:26,649
perimeter identify any possible light

478
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:29,198
leaks also listen do you hear the

479
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:31,448
blowers do you hear the fans do you hear

480
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:33,099
your air conditioner is anything outside

481
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:36,278
making it obvious that you're running

482
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,170
aggro in that house this is a good time

483
00:16:36,278 --> 00:16:40,149
to discover that we've got light leaks

484
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:41,318
or that we've got noisy equipment so

485
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,240
that we don't get ourselves in trouble

486
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:45,370
you do not want to attract law

487
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:47,948
enforcement it may be legal where you

488
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,600
grow it is legal where I grow I am still

489
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:52,448
stealth because you know who's worse

490
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,490
than law enforcement [ __ ] thieves you

491
00:16:52,448 --> 00:16:57,370
don't want people to know you've got to

492
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,539
grow in your house because somebody may

493
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:04,028
come and take your crop from you that is

494
00:17:01,539 --> 00:17:07,389
a real thing keep that in mind you have

495
00:17:04,028 --> 00:17:11,140
to be careful even in a legal state keep

496
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:15,309
your grow stealth so walk around outside

497
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:18,490
look listen smell pay attention see if

498
00:17:15,308 --> 00:17:19,720
anything is going wrong outside once

499
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,209
you're sure that everything is fine

500
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:24,578
outside that's when you can go back in

501
00:17:22,209 --> 00:17:26,409
the grow room turn off the lights in the

502
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:29,288
grow room and stand in there for about

503
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:30,760
ten minutes let your eyes adjust now is

504
00:17:29,288 --> 00:17:33,490
the time to find out if any light is

505
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:36,099
leaking into the grow now is the time to

506
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:38,649
find out if the sunshine from outside is

507
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:39,398
coming through your ducts for your

508
00:17:38,648 --> 00:17:41,500
vented hoods

509
00:17:39,398 --> 00:17:43,298
right into your light reflectors into

510
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,460
your grow room and shining light on your

511
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:47,349
plants during a dark period now is the

512
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:48,759
time to find that out now the catch to

513
00:17:47,349 --> 00:17:50,199
these last two things

514
00:17:48,759 --> 00:17:52,210
you're only gonna be able to tell if you

515
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,769
have a light leak outside if you go walk

516
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,720
around the house and it's dark outside

517
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:58,119
the only way you can tell if you have a

518
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,100
light leak inside is if it's light

519
00:17:58,119 --> 00:18:02,649
outside and you go in the grow room and

520
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:04,119
you turn off the lights on the inside of

521
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:06,190
the grow room so you're gonna have to

522
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,599
find the time of day to do that you're

523
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,730
gonna have to do some investigating and

524
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,250
some inspecting but these are very

525
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:14,410
important details to not overlook make

526
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,700
sure your grow room is light proof make

527
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:19,029
sure there's not a lot of noise coming

528
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,940
out of there and also find out if you've

529
00:18:19,029 --> 00:18:23,379
got too much aroma and correct it if you

530
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,140
do you don't want to attract attention

531
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,850
that you don't need once you've been

532
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,860
growing for a while or if you're

533
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:31,539
somebody who is looking for grows so say

534
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,459
myself I've been growing for a long time

535
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:35,529
when I used to go walk my dog in my

536
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,029
neighborhood I would always discover a

537
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:38,649
new grow I would go a different route

538
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:40,059
I'd go two blocks that way three blocks

539
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,410
that way I block that way and then I'd

540
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:43,119
come back and then the next day I'd just

541
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,160
do a different pattern I would always

542
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,079
find a new grow about once a week

543
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:48,970
because I know what I'm looking for

544
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,609
listening for and smelling for I know

545
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,870
the details I know the clues if I hear

546
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:55,990
you're weird blower at 3:00 in the

547
00:18:52,869 --> 00:18:58,149
morning going from your basement window

548
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,769
chances are you got to grow in there if

549
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:01,480
you've got an air conditioner in your

550
00:18:59,769 --> 00:19:03,819
basement window in the middle of winter

551
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,950
chances are there's a grow in there if

552
00:19:03,819 --> 00:19:07,750
you've got one window by the basement it

553
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,850
has no snow and the rest of the backyard

554
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,160
is snowy there's a grow in there if

555
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:14,019
there's one spot on your roof above one

556
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,940
bedroom that there's no snow on it

557
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:18,700
there's a girl in there there are really

558
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,710
easy signs that give it away so pay

559
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,980
attention you guys because if I can see

560
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,230
it

561
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,390
law enforcement can see it and so can

562
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,059
the thieves so be careful with your grow

563
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:30,550
try to stay stealth even in legal states

564
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:31,690
there's no reason to brag there's no

565
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,329
reason to set bait

566
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:37,180
all right podcast world I feel like that

567
00:19:34,329 --> 00:19:39,220
is a pretty good clean and reset episode

568
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:40,570
hopefully I mentioned some details that

569
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,549
you would have overlooked hopefully I

570
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:44,079
rescued you through a couple of pitfalls

571
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:47,470
now you don't have to make those

572
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,759
mistakes hopefully everything was well

573
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,960
in your grow and you don't have any

574
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:52,509
problems hopefully you don't have

575
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,519
anything funky to deal with also now

576
00:19:52,509 --> 00:19:56,259
that the grow is nice and clean let's

577
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,450
[ __ ] keep it clean let's get in there

578
00:19:56,259 --> 00:20:00,519
with a mop and a broom every day if we

579
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:01,870
need to and mop and sweep that [ __ ]

580
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:02,470
let's get in there with a shop vac and

581
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:03,939
suck

582
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:05,620
you know that [ __ ] in the corner you've

583
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,029
been looking at get the [ __ ] shot

584
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:09,069
back and back that out it's not gonna

585
00:20:07,029 --> 00:20:11,019
shot back itself and that's a great

586
00:20:09,069 --> 00:20:12,909
place for a spider mite to hang out

587
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:14,650
that's a great place for some aphids to

588
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:16,779
hang out and breed that's a great place

589
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,570
for some powdery mildew to start that is

590
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:21,099
just a vector for problems so now that

591
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:22,899
you've got it nice and clean don't be

592
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:24,159
lazy get in there and clean it as often

593
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,380
as you can

594
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,019
they say that cleanliness is godliness

595
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:31,090
and I think that most applies in

596
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,139
kitchens and grow rooms you guys so

597
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:33,879
clean up that grow room

598
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,190
give yourself a nice clean environment

599
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,510
give your plants a nice healthy start I

600
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:38,980
think your plants will be more

601
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:41,230
comfortable and I think you will also

602
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,000
notice working in a cleaner more

603
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:43,539
organized environment will make you

604
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,220
happier

605
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:47,799
it'll make you faster and more

606
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,390
productive and [ __ ] now that you're done

607
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:50,889
cleaning up the grow room why don't you

608
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,110
clean up all your supplies go organize

609
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:55,180
your nutrients go organize the

610
00:20:53,109 --> 00:20:57,219
pesticides the measuring devices your

611
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:58,870
cleaning supplies go write down a list

612
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,549
of anything that you can need anything

613
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:03,549
that you're low on go get yourself

614
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:06,730
organized also get a notebook and start

615
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:08,589
making detailed notes start documenting

616
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:10,450
when you changed your bulb start

617
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:13,119
documenting when you change your carbon

618
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,799
filter start documenting the last time

619
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,959
you change your air conditioner filters

620
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,309
it calibrated your meters start writing

621
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,690
that stuff down so that when something

622
00:21:18,309 --> 00:21:21,940
comes up you can look in there and go oh

623
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,289
that's why my pH meter isn't working I

624
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,630
have it calibrated the [ __ ] thing in

625
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,250
two months you may find some things you

626
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,450
were slipping on if you start taking

627
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,400
more notes

628
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:32,140
all right podcast rolled I feel like

629
