will admit

57
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,439
i'm not on the discord channel very

58
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,118
often there's a lot going on on discord

59
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:45,519
uh it's a lot for my eyes to follow for

60
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,118
my brain to follow on on a phone screen

61
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:48,640
so i don't do discord as much as i

62
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:49,759
should i could be there more honestly

63
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,040

of this episode i've got a message here

99
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
from patreon

100
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,039
from a person who would rather not be

101
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,719
identified their question goes

102
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:03,359
just like this we'll jump right into it

103
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,800
with hey mr rosted jeff i got a mr rosta

104
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,879
jeff out of you that's great

105
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
uh this is my first attempt at growing

106
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:10,479
out a male plant

107
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,319
for pollen collection that is always a

108
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:12,959
fun project i love growing out male

109
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,518
plants

110
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,120
i love doing a male phenohunt when i'm

111
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
searching for a male plant to breed with

112
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,480
i will grow out packs of seeds

113
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,239
and i'll find the female out of there

114
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:22,878
just like you guys do but i will also

115
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,039
find

116
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,598
a stellar amazing keeper male out of

117
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:29,120
there i will flower out my male plants

118
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,798
uh sometimes i'll flower them out to

119
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,480
like week nine or ten just to see

120
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,239
exactly what they do i want to see what

121
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,000
the blood structure looks like

122
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,680
see how they react to some abuse some

123
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,598
problems some issues

124
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,599
check out aromas and flavors look for

125
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,959
colors see how things change over time

126
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,359
when i'm growing those males

127
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,039
i love to do a nice male fino hunt so

128
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,519
let's uh read more of this message it

129
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,359
says

130
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,680
it is my understanding that a male plant

131
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
will bloom just like a female

132
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,360
plant should cycle so i'm going to

133
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,680
switch to 1212 and

134
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,760
wait uh that is exactly what you need to

135
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760
do the male plants work just like the

136
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,679
female plants they are photosynthetic

137
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,120
photosensitive just like the uh the

138
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,319
female plants it's the same plant you

139
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,640
just got boys and girls

140
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:11,359
so yes once you put them under 12 12

141
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,199
about 10 14 maybe 17 days later you will

142
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,760
definitely see that that plant is in

143
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,560
flower it will start producing pollen

144
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,759
uh you are collecting pollen right yeah

145
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,439
so you're going to

146
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,520
i would recommend that before you put it

147
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,839
into flour you have something in place

148
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,519
to start collecting the pollen maybe if

149
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,000
you've got a big piece of glass you can

150
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,319
set that

151
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,839
plant on put the pot right on a big

152
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,839
piece of glass and let the pollen rain

153
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,159
down on the glass that works

154
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,519
some people will take the pot and build

155
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,199
you take a paper plate

156
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,478
and cut a slit down the middle and then

157
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,759
you wrap that around the base of the

158
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:42,639
plant and the pollen will fall into the

159
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,040
paper plate

160
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,680
that depends on how big your plant is ah

161
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,000
i've used a 22 inch kick drum head

162
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,199
to collect pollen uh one time i did that

163
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,879
and all of the [ __ ] static

164
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,160
electricity on the kick drum head i'm a

165
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,800
drummer i got bass drum heads laying

166
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
around

167
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,919
i used the wrong damn drum head and all

168
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,918
the static made the pollen

169
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,839
uh move away from the drum head so as it

170
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:03,519
fell it did some weird static reaction

171
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:04,959
it all landed outside but

172
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:06,478
uh get creative on things you can

173
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,478
collect the pollen and start thinking

174
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,159
about that before you're into flower

175
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,240
you don't want to be moving that plant

176
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
around jostling it a bunch once it does

177
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,038
start dumping pollen

178
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,720
uh because then you'll really knock a

179
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:17,759
lot of pollen out of it it'll be easier

180
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,840
to collect if you just

181
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,840
already have your collection plan in

182
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,599
place so uh where do we go from there

183
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,959
switch it to 1212 and wait that's

184
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,479
absolutely what you do

185
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,799
it will start dropping pollen you'll

186
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,879
notice that like i said a moment ago

187
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,840
around day seven you'll start seeing sex

188
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,519
around day 10

189
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:35,359
it'll start making pollen sacks around

190
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,758
day 12 they'll start swelling

191
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,439
around day 14 through 17 they'll start

192
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,600
popping open possibly

193
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,199
by day 21 they'll definitely be popping

194
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,160
open and dropping pollen

195
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,038
they will continue to drop pollen for

196
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,840
several weeks

197
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,800
up to week 9 week 10 depending on your

198
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,319
life cycle

199
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,079
the vigor and health of your plant but

200
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:56,560
they will keep on going

201
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:58,478
that first pollen in my opinion is not

202
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,478
the most viable the most active pollen

203
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,478
you want that little bit later pollen

204
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,000
uh pre-pollen that's all i'm going to

205
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,680
say you can fill in the joke there

206
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,120
you want the viable active pollen that

207
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,079
comes out later

208
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,079
all right so the next part of the

209
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,599
question is when should i begin and end

210
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:12,879
my pollen collection

211
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,720
i've already said that you should have

212
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:17,439
your pollen collection devices

213
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,000
uh in place early so you've got your uh

214
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:20,319
your

215
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,759
your kick drum hedge your paper plate uh

216
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
your glass your mirror whatever you're

217
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,800
gonna collect that pollen on

218
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,478
if that is already in place you're going

219
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
to collect pollen as soon as it starts

220
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:29,199
falling

221
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,960
in my opinion some of the better pollen

222
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,759
is the later falling pollen so just let

223
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,519
it all fall

224
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,038
and you'll gather a little bit of the

225
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,918
pre pollen and you'll get a bunch of the

226
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:37,360
good pollen

227
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,839
all on your collection vessel there it

228
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,199
will all be great if you're going to do

229
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:43,119
a method where maybe you've got a

230
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,800
container and you use something to tap

231
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,560
the pollen into the container

232
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,478
i would wait until you see it really

233
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,000
drop in pollen it'll be

234
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,758
sprinkling a little bit and then you'll

235
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,560
see those male clusters they'll just go

236
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,400
kapow

237
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,918
you'll know you'll say well [ __ ] all the

238
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,839
male flowers look like they're opening

239
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:00,318
it it's time to collect that pollen

240
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,000
at that point get the main top of that

241
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,720
plant have whatever you're collecting it

242
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
into if it's a pie plate or a shoe box

243
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,360
or whatever you're using

244
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,439
and just tip that plant over and just

245
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
give it a little jostle and pollen will

246
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,360
go

247
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,439
all over the place you're going to get a

248
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,598
lot of pollen turn off the fans

249
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,279
don't have a lot of blowers going on uh

250
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:19,360
be wearing clothing that you can change

251
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,598
quickly or maybe minimal clothing

252
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,960
uh maybe just a t-shirt maybe no t-shirt

253
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,159
if you can head right to the shower if

254
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,719
you got some dreadlocks

255
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
have those things tied up the pollen uh

256
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,080
so you're gonna collect the pollen

257
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,519
tap that pollen into a container uh

258
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,159
where do we go i've got two directions i

259
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,159
want to go

260
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,199
the pollen is going to be very viable

261
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,880
and very potent

262
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,960
be careful when you go into your grow

263
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:41,918
room with your female plants

264
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,598
water will deactivate this pollen so if

265
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:44,000
you're going into your grow room spray

266
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,079
yourself

267
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,839
down with water change your clothes you

268
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,758
should be safe but maybe spray those

269
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:50,318
female plants in there before you as you

270
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,639
enter

271
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,319
spray them with the with the water that

272
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,319
way the water will deactivate

273
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,360
their pollen receivers and they won't

274
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,120
get pollinated

275
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,800
but water will mostly deactivate the

276
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,918
pollen if it comes in contact with it

277
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,680
you just have to make sure the water

278
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,079
contacts the pollen

279
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,000
talking about water you've got your

280
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,399
pollen in a collection vessel

281
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
we need to get all of the male flowers

282
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,918
and chunky male parts out

283
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,439
of that pollen i would start by

284
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,038
spreading it out as thin as you can

285
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,639
sometimes i use tweezers depending on

286
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:20,878
how much pollen i'm storing

287
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
i've also used different sifting

288
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,280
techniques i've used pantyhose on top of

289
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,839
a jar

290
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,159
i've used a flower sifter before get the

291
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,119
male parts out of the pollen is the main

292
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,278
part here and keep the pollen as dry as

293
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,679
you can keep it i said it a moment ago

294
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:38,000
water and moisture destroy pollen so

295
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,319
before you store your pollen airtight

296
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,440
into any container make sure that it is

297
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,240
completely 100 dry we want to dry this

298
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,760
[ __ ] out of it

299
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,600
i leave it sitting now i cover it with a

300
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,879
paper towel i'll leave the container

301
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,159
open it's just covered so that nothing

302
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,919
else gets into it

303
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,439
no wind will disrupt it but then all the

304
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:55,439
air can escape all the moisture can

305
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,880
escape once it is super crispy dry

306
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,720
i scrape it up with the credit card i

307
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,600
put it into a container with

308
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,800
a silicate packet you do not want the

309
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,639
thing you do not want

310
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,079
the the botanic the uh what's it called

311
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,720
i can't think of the humidity pack you

312
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,160
don't want the

313
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,920
the bovita that's the word my brain

314
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,199
wouldn't [ __ ] think of you don't want

315
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,079
a boveda pack

316
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,839
or a moisture pack you want a desiccant

317
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,200
pack that will suck out all of the

318
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,600
moisture you do not want

319
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,879
any moisture in your seeds once you've

320
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,560
got them sealed up

321
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,720
or dried then you can seal them up store

322
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,879
them in a cool dry dark place

323
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,000
that is how i would store the pollen so

324
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,838
let me make sure i'm answering the

325
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,799
questions put it on 12 12 yes it will

326
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,560
begin to flower

327
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,559
i'm going to switch to a 12 12 light

328
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,799
cycle and wait when should i begin and

329
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:38,719
end my pollen collection uh if you've

330
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,879
got your pie plates or your drum heads

331
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,440
in place it will begin collecting pollen

332
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,039
uh early uh that pollen will be viable i

333
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
just recommend that later pollen so

334
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,799
collect pollen for a period of time

335
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,480
and you'll have plenty of good pollen in

336
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,000
the mix there um

337
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
when should i end my pollen collection

338
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,360
once you've got enough uh if you're only

339
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,320
going to make a small batch of seeds you

340
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,039
only need

341
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,399
a small like a half a dram if you know

342
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,240
what a dram container is

343
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
a half a dram will create plenty of

344
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,480
seeds a full drum will make a lot of

345
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,920
seeds

346
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,920
any more than that you can really

347
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,639
pollinate the [ __ ] out of a room so

348
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,399
it just just depends on uh how many

349
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,159
seeds you want to make but let it go

350
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,078
uh maybe let it go like four or five

351
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,439
weeks into a drop in pollen if you can

352
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:18,000
and see the difference in the colors of

353
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
that early

354
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
pollen and the later pollen and watch it

355
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,159
change feel the dustiness

356
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,320
ah feel the grittiness it may change

357
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,439
from like baby powder to a more sandy

358
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,040
texture as the

359
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,720
the plants start dropping pollen later

360
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,078
in the game um

361
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,839
but then again make sure you clean

362
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,199
yourself up before you go in that girl

363
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,079
room if you've got grill plants and

364
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
flour because

365
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,879
that's when you do risk uh pollinating

366
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,159
plants you don't want pollinated

367
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:43,919
all right so i feel like i've answered

368
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,278
most of this uh when should i end my

369
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,240
pollen collection you've probably got

370
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:47,919
enough pollen

371
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,680
after like a week or so of collecting

372
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:50,799
pollen if you're gonna manually collect

373
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:52,559
it you could probably get it two or

374
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:53,120
three times it will keep reproducing

375
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:54,639
pollen

376
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,399
so you could tap it out collect it give

377
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,720
it four or five days tap it out collect

378
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,559
it

379
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,839
give it four or five days do it again or

380
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,278
just let it keep on growing there are a

381
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,000
lot of great methods for collecting

382
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,399
pollen

383
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,639
um it says surely the mail would be done

384
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,799
for my purposes well before say

385
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,720
week eight of a normal flowering cycle

386
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,479
yes ah they will be done

387
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,000
they could be done well before week

388
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,680
eight i save 14 days

389
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,200
to get in that's two weeks two weeks of

390
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,919
pollen collection another week just to

391
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,680
be fun

392
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,759
we're only at like five weeks total into

393
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,278
flower there so you could collect enough

394
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,480
pollen in that amount of time i may go a

395
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:26,000
little bit longer just to

396
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,600
just to have enough pollen because i do

397
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,480
larger pollinations than you're probably

398
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,560
doing

399
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,159
um i feel like i have rambled my way

400
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,078
through this question quite a bit i like

401
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:34,799
giving a lot of attention to the patreon

402
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,239
questions

403
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,078
i just feel like they deserve the extra

404
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,159
time and attention uh

405
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,919
let's see yeah i think i covered you bro

406
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,360
uh throw that [ __ ] in 12 12 and start

407
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,519
collecting pollen and then

408
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,560
have a strategy why did you select this

409
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,799
male

410
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,559
is it just the boy you've got sometimes

411
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,759
we do what we can do with what we've got

412
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:53,599
i understand but

413
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,360
did you select this male for a purpose

414
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,120
does he hold a trait that you desire to

415
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
pass on to your progeny

416
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
or does it just have a cool name that

417
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,278
you want to mix in with another name or

418
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,879
something i'm just curious why you've

419
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:04,320
chosen this male that is one of the most

420
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,240
important parts of breeding

421
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,000
then the second question why have you

422
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,039
selected the females with which you have

423
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,720
chosen to breed

424
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,240
i could just be because we are working

425
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,000
with what we've got but

426
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,600
is there some selection happening do you

427
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,360
think that this male will provide

428
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,959
something to this female structure

429
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,800
is this female lacking something the

430
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,479
male can fix is the female lacking

431
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,319
or the you know what i'm trying to say

432
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,600
bro is there a rhyme to your reason

433
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,200
are you just putting two people on a

434
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,320
date so they can sport [ __ ] or do you

435
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
have a breeding plan

436
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,760
in mind that is my main question as long

437
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,319
as it's well thought out

438
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,000
i think it will turn out very well then

439
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,278
the next fun part bro once you pollinate

440
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,679
all these plants you gotta finish them

441
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,078
out

442
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,278
then the real fun is cleaning the seeds

443
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,958
out of the weed

444
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,720
that's always a good time if you make as

445
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,479
many seeds as i do that'll take you a

446
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
minute then you get to grow out a bunch

447
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,200
of the seeds that you just made that is

448
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,879
so much fun

449
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,160
don't give out any of these seeds until

450
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,360
you've tested them out you've got to

451
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:54,799
grow them yourself

452
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,639
if you do give them to your friends make

453
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,919
sure they know that they're tester seeds

454
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
that you haven't grown them enough to

455
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:00,078
know if they're problematic

456
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:01,838
hermaphroditic

457
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,199
straight up mutants if they got terrible

458
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,519
germination ratios

459
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,759
if you got bad male to female ratios ah

460
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,320
if they throw bananas in week seven or

461
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:10,078
something

462
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,519
discover all of that stuff before you go

463
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,759
shipping them out to

464
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,759
your friends all right to my anonymous

encouragement

487

says i do have another question for you

488
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,039
i know in flower

489
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,439
most people do say that day one is when

490
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,519
they switch to 12 12. so

491
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,120
that is it says most people i'm going to

492
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,198
say that is the general

493
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,278
rule of thumb when it comes to growing

494
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,319
cannabis we switch to 12

495
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,039
12 that is day one of the flowering

496
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,560
cycle

497
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,399
a lot of people say do i wait until i

498
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,879
see pistols do i wait and tell

499
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,000
that no you are in control that is your

500
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:20,559
grow room you

501
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,600
decide that that is the day one of

502
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,399
flower the day

503
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,000
you flip that plant that light cycle to

504
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,000
12 12. so as a breeder

505
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,559
i'm putting on my packages these seeds

506
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,399
will take nine to 11 weeks to flower

507
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,319
that starts the day you flip the lights

508
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,078
that is what i'm talking about so

509
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,920
you should follow the guy who made the

510
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,439
seed packages and the standard that way

511
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:40,078
you should follow our advice in my

512
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
opinion

513
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:42,799
maybe i'm not the king or the authority

514
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,320
or something but i would recommend you

515
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,198
follow the breeders advice since we put

516
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,360
the recommendation on the seeds we made

517
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,958
yeah but then again uh a lot of breeders

518
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,800
i could be guilty of this too because of

519
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,919
phenotypes and grow rooms and [ __ ] but a

520
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,599
lot of people will tell you this will

521
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:57,039
finish in four weeks just so that you'll

522
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,480
buy it you know what i mean but

523
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,319
uh still try to take that breeders

524
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,800
recommendation and it does start on

525
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,040
the day you flip to 12 12. not when you

526
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,639
see pistols not when you see pre-flowers

527
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,078
not when the buds are setting not when

528
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,079
the trichomes pop up

529
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,000
it is the day you change the timer so i

530
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,679
know in flower most people say day one

531
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,679
is when we switch to 12 12. i'm gonna

532
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,838
say that that is when all people

533
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,439
should say uh that day one of flowers

534
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,360
but when does vegetative

535
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
growth start from what i've read it

536
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,839
seems like most people veg for about

537
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,638
four weeks

538
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,320
but what is officially day one of vag is

539
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,198
it the day the sprouts pop up out of the

540
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,800
ground

541
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,319
i would say that's the seedling stage

542
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,559
you have to go through seedling

543
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,160
then you go through veg actually i do

544
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:37,278
two different veg stages we'll touch on

545
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,000
that in a moment

546
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,039
or is it after two or three nodes grow

547
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,120
or when

548
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,519
also should day one of veg be the first

549
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,959
feeding or should i wait or have already

550
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,320
started feeding them thanks for your

551
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,599
help that's gonna play into part of what

552
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,360
i was talking about a second ago with

553
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,240
two different sizes of veg

554
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,600
so the seedling phase until you've got

555
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,480
like some true leaves

556
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,920
some real growth going on ah then i

557
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,639
would just say you're in a seedling

558
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:03,759
stage

559
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,560
once you've got a plant that you are uh

560
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,919
confident in that you think is uh so

561
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,439
it's just like taking home a little baby

562
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,639
when you take home a brand new baby for

563
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,040
that first week or so

564
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,839
you were just checking it just randomly

565
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,360
because it

566
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,560
you're it's not going to i don't mean to

567
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,120
scare anybody out there that's got a new

568
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:18,078
baby but

569
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,000
when you're a new parent you're just

570
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,039
checking on the baby is it breathing it

571
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,799
did it die

572
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,240
like you're just [ __ ] freaked out so

573
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,120
you're like that with a new baby plant

574
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,278
also right

575
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,360
once that like feeling of oh it's going

576
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,958
to live i've actually got this plant

577
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,720
i'm going to say that that's when you're

578
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:33,758
officially out of the seedling stage and

579
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,079
in a veg stage

580
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,759
for most people most people may live in

581
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,479
that [ __ ] freaked out isn't gonna

582
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,959
survive

583
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,639
stage the whole entire time excuse me

584
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,439
but once it's got its first set of true

585
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,879
leaves

586
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,880
uh not those little [ __ ] leaves that

587
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,838
grow little tiny ones not those little

588
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:49,360
weak ones that pop

589
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,199
out at first but that true set of

590
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,759
serrated leaves with all of the fingers

591
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:53,039
on it

592
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,320
that's when i'm gonna say you were

593
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,719
officially in veg now that is my opinion

594
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,199
uh i run a commercial grow i get to

595
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,920
decide when day one of veg is and when

596
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:05,279
seedling phase ends and when so another

597
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,159
thing i want to talk about is i run

598
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:10,000
two different veg phases so i start with

599
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,360
i generally don't start with the ceiling

600
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,919
in a commercial grow i'll start with the

601
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,759
clone

602
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,439
so let's just hypothetically say we go

603
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,038
from seedling phase that's probably

604
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,439
about two weeks or so

605
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,640
depending on your environment the type

606
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,480
of lights you're using

607
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,000
how vigorous your seeds are it's going

608
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,838
to be about two two and a half maybe

609
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,880
three weeks of seedling stage

610
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,558
then we're in what i would do is small

611
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,120
veg that's when i'm using either a four

612
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:36,000
inch nursery pot maybe a four or six

613
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,279
inch net pot those are my small veg

614
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,038
plants they get fed

615
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,319
a little bit lighter of a mix i'm more

616
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,079
focused on roots

617
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,678
and just establishing a plant getting

618
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:44,879
the root nice and healthy and getting it

619
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,840
going

620
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,720
i'm working on feeding at npk microbes

621
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:50,720
enzymes

622
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,400
uh mostly things uh to get like

623
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
lightning start and recharge things to

624
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,080
get those roots

625
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,879
really go and shebang then i transplant

626
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,639
into

627
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,039
a depending on where i'm at what i'm

628
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,280
doing sometimes a two sometimes a three

629
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,519
sometimes a five gallon pot at this

630
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,279
point i am in what i call large veg

631
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:08,960
so i've gone from my clone phase which

632
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,720
is a two week phase in the cloner

633
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,558
that goes into my four inch net pot or

634
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,120
my four inch nursery or my six inch net

635
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,359
pot

636
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,959
or i had my cloning phase which is just

637
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:17,519
about two weeks the same amount of time

638
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,840
as my

639
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,200
cloning phase that i say clone my

640
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,319
ceiling phase i'm not sure what i'm

641
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,000
saying i'm trying to say all this on the

642
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,960
fly i've got minimal notes you guys i

643
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,480
hope you know this is all coming out of

644
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,240
the top of my head

645
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,400
i've got a two-week either veg or

646
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,558
seedling phase then i go into a small

647
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
veg phase and a four or six inch maybe

648
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,599
an eight inch pot

649
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,199
then i go into my one three or five

650
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:38,480
gallon pot depending on

651
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,400
the environment the grow that i'm

652
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,679
working in the personal grow commercial

653
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,798
grow greenhouse grow depends on where

654
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,120
it's going

655
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,879
that is when i consider myself in large

656
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,798
veg

657
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,880
that's when i'll kind of refocus my

658
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,359
feeding regimen to go more toward

659
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,520
uh developing shoots and branches more

660
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:56,719
vegetative growth instead of focusing so

661
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,798
much on the roots

662
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,480
we're still feeding microbes we're still

663
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,000
feeding things to feed the roots

664
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,759
encourage root growth but i'm more

665
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,319
focused on getting nitrogen into the

666
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,480
plant

667
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,079
get it vigorous get it big get it happy

668
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,440
i start getting it shaped

669
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:13,519
for the flowering phase so um

670
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
i don't know that there is an official

671
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,558
uh day

672
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,240
when veg starts i say that it's when

673
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,000
those real true leaves pop

674
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,120
out and you've got a [ __ ] plant that

675
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,640
looks like a plant that you're not

676
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,359
paranoid you don't have a little newborn

677
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,200
that you're

678
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,639
cuddling in a little blanket that's when

679
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,640
i think we have actually got

680
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,720
plants that are entering the vegetative

681
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,440
phase uh so when they've got those first

682
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,519
real

683
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,960
fan leaves is when i say so the best

684
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:35,599
part about running your own commercial

685
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,279
grow

686
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,719
is that sort of stuff is up to you or

687
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,160
your own personal grow

688
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,000
that stuff is up to you you get to make

689
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,679
your own schedules your own cycles

690
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,038
your own flows your own standard

691
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,798
operating procedures

692
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:48,400
these plants are very versatile very

693
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,440
flexible ah

694
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,038
they are adaptable they can grow your

695
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,720
way you know there's no one way to grow

696
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,480
it as long as we give it a veg cycle and

697
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,279
a flowering cycle and we dry it and cure

698
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,480
it properly

699
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,918
most of the time we're going to come out

700
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,519
with a usable product it's all about

701
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,720
those details in the middle that dictate

702
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,918
quality but

703
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,038
there's no hard and fast rule set by day

704
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,360
one of veg is

705
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,558
this day unless you're in a commercial

706
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,240
environment and you've written that

707
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,000
sop and then you get to decide that day

708
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,759
one officially is this day

709
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,759
i keep saying it i think it's when those

710
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,000
true leaves first start popping out now

711
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,400
you can start feeding it before that you

712
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,679
can feed it very lightly before that

713
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,360
they've got enough energy to get them

714
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,880
going probably 14 days if you're going

715
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,158
to go a little bit longer before you put

716
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,679
it into a bigger pot or something

717
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,360
definitely feed it

718
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,360
give it a little bit of nitrogen focus

719
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,359
on building solid roots

720
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,798
something like lightning start maybe a

721
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,439
little bit of recharge in there or the

722
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,119
equivalent

723
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,880
is always a good idea maybe some mammoth

724
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,399
p just to make it go shebang and get it

725
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,840
started

726
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,000
but i don't know that there is an

727
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,798
official a book

728
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,319
a rule a referee that tells us when

729
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,720
official day one of veg

730
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,319
is so uh you get to kind of decide that

731
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,600
on your own

732
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,960
you guys excuse me for the throat

733
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:03,839
clearing i'm gonna just take a drink

734
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,840
here let's fix this right quick

735
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
once again i'm sipping on that uh

736
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,520
nudesense pineapple

737
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,158
and uh what is that pineapple and

738
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,679
coconut juice and it is divine

739
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,039
oh i could just chug that whole cup and

740
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,120
just one good fat drink there

741
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,480
all right my friend squirrel master i

742
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,719
hope i answered your question

743
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,159
uh like i said there's no hard fast rule

744
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,759
basically when you get your first

745
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,360
true leaves that is when you have

746
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,279
entered the vegetative

747
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,359
stage then you get to decide how long

748
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,599
you want to veg i do

749
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,119
about 14 days in the clone or seedling

750
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,199
stage uh

751
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:40,558
two to three maybe four weeks in a small

752
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,798
pot and then

753
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,000
uh like five to maybe six weeks in a

754
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:46,639
larger pot i got about

755
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,200
a nine week vegetative stage a nine week

756
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,200
flowering stage it works out real well

757
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,880
but it's kind of up to you all right i

758
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,440
feel like i got off on a long ramble on

759
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,120
that one

760
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,558
so let's jump into another email that

761
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,479
will keep me a little bit

762
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,158
more focused this one came from our

763
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,839
friend uh they want their name said

764
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,360
it says trolling nobody knows who

765
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:04,480
trolling is what up trolling and it's

766
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,199
not trolling with an

767
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,960
eye and it's trolling t-r-o-l-a-n a

768
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,360
little bit different than troll in

different type of vibe going on there no

770

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,600
you're getting and deserve take care

832
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:00,960
from our friend trollin

833
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,798
hey trolling first of all thanks again

834
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
for the great compliments and i'm proud

835
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,480
of you for going to school

836
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,159
for software engineering and programming

837
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,919
that sounds intimidating to me

838
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,840
uh you'll graduate in three years it's

839
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,520
awesome that you've got a plan my friend

840
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,000
now you want to know where we can get

841
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,000
you in in the cannabis industry

842
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,319
the cannabis industry like all

843
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,599
horticulture all cultivation industries

844
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,918
are rapidly evolving um

845
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,759
i know you want to maybe do things like

846
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,919
uh some sort of cultivation

847
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:31,679
stuff like tracking or something like

848
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,038
that i really like what pete is doing

849
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,880
shout out to my buddy pete from p

850
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,400
l grow also shout out to pl grow systems

851
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,600
check out their updated website

852
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,278
uh big up to my friends at plgrow um

853
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,199
he does a thing where he can take photos

854
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,960
of plants with an infrared camera

855
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,480
and identify plant issues before the

856
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,400
human eye can even see it

857
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,839
he is developing a database of photos

858
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,679
that can help us identify

859
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,199
plant issues by just taking a picture of

860
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,559
our plant it'll say oh you've basically

861
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,798
got this

862
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:57,678
there are a lot of great technology

863
00:24:56,798 --> 00:24:59,918
options in

864
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,519
the cannabis realm however what i think

865
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,278
is really practical

866
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,879
and that i think we are really lacking

867
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:07,519
in a lot of existing

868
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,240
and upcoming markets are opportunities

869
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,960
for

870
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,640
testing testing has become widely

871
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,440
popular in the markets where it is

872
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,520
available

873
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,960
but it's not available to everybody yet

874
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:20,158
in the cannabis industry

875
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,079
whether it's commercial personal growing

876
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,360
whatever if it's the caregiver model if

877
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,278
it's the commercial grow there's not

878
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,278
enough testing available

879
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,278
people can get if you run a commercial

880
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,798
cultivation you can get your product

881
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,359
tested for terpenes

882
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,278
uh for potency for mold for yeast for

883
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:37,119
contaminants for heavy metals but in

884
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,960
colorado if you've got a personal grow

885
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,918
you cannot get your product tested for

886
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,159
anything

887
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,640
so one of the first things i would like

888
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,000
to see is more available of testing part

889
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,799
of that reason is logistics and

890
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,480
legalities

891
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,480
they kind of [ __ ] blocked us on testing

892
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,400
here because of legalities but in new

893
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,960
markets you can work that into

894
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,559
the new recreational and medical rules

895
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,038
when you make that that you can have

896
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,720
a testing facility available for the

897
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:01,440
home grower that is something i think we

898
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,440
need

899
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:09,440
potency testing thc cbd cbn

900
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,200
cbg thcv and whatever new cannabinoid is

901
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,558
popular this week and by the time you

902
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,000
listen to this podcast

903
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,678
we should be testing for all of that

904
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,599
stuff everybody should have access to

905
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,600
that

906
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,959
also i think we should have access to

907
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,798
terpene testing we should be able to

908
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,679
test our flowers and concentrates for

909
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,200
terpenes

910
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,960
we should also be able to test them like

911
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,360
i said a moment ago for contaminants

912
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,919
mold mildew pathogens problems

913
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,599
also for pesticides and heavy metals i'd

914
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,038
like to see that sort of stuff widely

915
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,480
available maybe you could develop

916
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,240
something for the home grower

917
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,839
that they can do it at home maybe we can

918
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,960
submit a sample and a thing at home and

919
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,319
drop it off to you

920
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,600
and it's already just ready all you

921
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,278
gotta do is shake it or something you

922
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,359
guys could do your job really quickly

923
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:48,960
maybe you can offer something like that

924
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,000
um also a testing

925
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,120
for presence of cannabinoid precursors

926
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,558
all right i had to take a little drink

927
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,759
there i apologize for that let me jump

928
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,278
back right where i was

929
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,759
another thing we could use is the

930
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,400
testing labs that can show us the

931
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:04,079
presence of precursors for cannabinoids

932
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,159
it is very useful as a breeder

933
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,839
to be able to take a sample of plant

934
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,159
tissue send it to a lab

935
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,839
and they can tell me that these samples

936
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,720
of plants are high in cannabinoid

937
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:14,399
precursors

938
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,480
and this batch of plants isn't really

939
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,440
testing high in uh cannabinoid

940
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,599
precursors

941
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,360
we can remove the load testers from the

942
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:23,359
batch and we can actually do breeding

943
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,038
based on the predicative testing

944
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:26,959
from the presence of cannabinoid

945
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,558
precursors and move forward with those

946
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,679
high testing plants and not waste our

947
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,918
time with the low

948
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,000
testing plants if our goal is to breed

949
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,440
for high thc

950
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
so that's another lab i would love to

951
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,159
see another thing i would love to see is

952
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,278
something like

953
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,960
gene verification i don't know uh if

954
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:43,919
there's a market for this other than my

955
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,840
desire but

956
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,120
i would like to be able to i have

957
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,119
created some strains

958
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,719
so maybe i could send you a couple of

959
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,639
samples of a rise

960
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,880
maybe a couple of samples of strawberry

961
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,399
starburst maybe a morning do sample

962
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,000
and then you could take those samples

963
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:00,239
and gene sequence them

964
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,679
and put them in a database and have

965
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,159
standard samples of

966
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,240
real tested genetics that way we have a

967
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,919
real database of real tested genetics

968
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,278
there was another company doing it

969
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,278
i've looked a lot at what they have

970
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,119
posted it seems like a lot of their

971
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,079
genetics their database is a little bit

972
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:15,839
convoluted

973
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,678
there was no way to stop anybody from

974
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,319
sending a fake sample in there

975
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,000
i don't know uh how reliable that

976
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,278
database has become some of it is

977
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,440
questionable to me

978
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,880
but to do something that is a breeder

979
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,278
based gene

980
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,640
verification database would be really

981
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,880
cool in my opinion

982
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,240
like only the people that are breeding

983
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,679
these strains or people who have been

984
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,440
vetted or something

985
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,080
people with a reputation people that you

986
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,360
know and can rely on people that have

987
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,359
been vetted that's what i'm trying to

988
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,599
say people have been auditioned and

989
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,519
gone through an application process can

990
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,119
actually send you in tissue sample and

991
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,798
get these plants into a database that is

992
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,119
something i would love to see then

993
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,558
in the future if somebody's got a clone

994
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:55,759
in like five years and they're like bro

995
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:56,960
i got the grateful dog

996
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,960
you'd be like i don't know if you really

997
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,480
do just send a sample of it to you

998
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,240
and they'll go oh man you really do have

999
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,599
the grateful dog or you're full of [ __ ]

1000
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,319
that is not the grateful dog that's

1001
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,918
actually just

1002
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,158
this you could actually tell them what

1003
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,000
it is if you've got a sample of that

1004
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,840
i know that sounds crazy that could be

1005
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,240
just a dream but there's something in

1006
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:14,879
there

1007
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,079
that could be viable for all growers

1008
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,880
some sort of gene

1009
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,000
verification would be really cool now we

1010
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,520
just got to be sure

1011
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,038
not to let that get corrupted because

1012
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:24,480
that's kind of what seems like happened

1013
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,798
last time they were allowing random

1014
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,960
samples in there the samples were just

1015
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:30,558
convoluted the database got convoluted

1016
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,200
then also the company

1017
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:34,319
seemed to use our data the data they

1018
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,759
collected for

1019
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:39,439
uh unscrupulous activity maybe

1020
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:40,640
uh the the definition of it i'm trying

1021
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,399
to stay out all that right now and not

1022
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,080
get political on that [ __ ] but

1023
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:45,678
we could use a new company that does

1024
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,519
that with better interests that's kind

1025
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,720
of what i'm thinking i want to say

1026
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:52,960
um in agriculture technology there are

1027
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,880
so many people and so many things doing

1028
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,000
agricultural technology that i think the

1029
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,440
testing labs

1030
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,480
are what i desire the most um tracking

1031
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,240
is done well

1032
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,640
seed to sell points are covered quite

1033
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,679
well pesticide application and stuff is

1034
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,440
done quite well

1035
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,840
i'm not sure uh honestly as a guy

1036
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,600
who's been growing uh before all this

1037
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:16,480
technology took over

1038
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:18,158
until it gets to giant scale cultivation

1039
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,960
i think we need to get back to our roots

1040
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,440
a little bit

1041
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,120
and stop paying so much attention to the

1042
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,798
meters and the technology don't get me

1043
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,879
wrong in a big cultivation

1044
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,158
i love all of the data that i can get

1045
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,399
that is great for

1046
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,399
uh the lead grower for upper management

1047
00:30:30,398 --> 00:30:33,439
for the consultants but as grotechs and

1048
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:35,519
home growers

1049
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,038
i think most of those folks need to get

1050
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,038
away from all of the machines and

1051
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,359
devices and watch the plants

1052
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:42,240
i've been growing i don't need as many

1053
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:44,479
devices

1054
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,240
because i can look at the plants have

1055
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,880
you ever seen a guitar player get up on

1056
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,720
stage

1057
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,240
and if he doesn't need a guitar tuner

1058
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,200
doesn't he just look like that much more

1059
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,720
of a badass

1060
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,480
the guy that needs a guitar tuner you're

1061
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,159
like oh you can't tune by ear bro come

1062
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,240
on how long you've been doing this

1063
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,919
i feel like i can tune the plants by ear

1064
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,480
i can just look at them and i can say oh

1065
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,799
this

1066
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,599
because i haven't been relying on all

1067
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,240
this

1068
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,079
amazing impressive technology i do use

1069
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,480
the technology to my advantage don't get

1070
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,038
me wrong i love the gear i love the toys

1071
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:15,038
they are great i use them second i find

1072
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:16,879
too many growers using the equipment the

1073
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,000
technology the toys the meters the

1074
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,278
gadgets first

1075
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,640
and they're always on their phone

1076
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:21,200
checking to see what's wrong with their

1077
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,720
grow

1078
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,558
when i go put your phone away bro let's

1079
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,720
go in the grow room and look at the

1080
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,398
plants and see what is wrong with those

1081
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,798
plants i use the plants first

1082
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:31,439
as my first guide my judgment my

1083
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:32,720
indicator

1084
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,640
they're going to tell me what's wrong

1085
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,720
before the meter

1086
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,000
like maybe one day your meter will beep

1087
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
and something will go bro it's too hot

1088
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,240
in here

1089
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,679
that's cool but most of the time i can

1090
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,319
look at the plants and they go it's too

1091
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,080
hot in here

1092
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,000
it's too cold in here also have you ever

1093
00:31:44,079 --> 00:31:48,158
thought about just reaching

1094
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,599
out and touching the plants if you think

1095
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,960
it might be cold in the grow room it's a

1096
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:53,038
cold season right now

1097
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,240
if you think maybe the plants are cold

1098
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:54,879
touch them just reach out and put your

1099
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,558
hand on them

1100
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,480
just touch them just like your mama used

1101
00:31:56,558 --> 00:31:59,759
to do and be like oh you need a sweater

1102
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,200
you could do that to the plants just

1103
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:01,599
touch the plants see if their cheeks are

1104
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,038
cold

1105
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,319
put your hands right around them they're

1106
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,079
yours you could touch them you could

1107
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,558
squeeze them violate them all you want

1108
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,918
anyway i do love all the technology i

1109
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:11,519
love seeing you guys advance all the

1110
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,399
technology and the toys and stuff in the

1111
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,159
grow environment

1112
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,439
but let's not forget that we've been

1113
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,840
growing these plants

1114
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,640
way way way before we had all this

1115
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,240
technology

1116
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,559
some of the most amazing cannabis i've

1117
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,798
seen grown came from just a very basic

1118
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,558
archaic almost basement grow with lights

1119
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,240
and fans and an air conditioner

1120
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:30,000
and the dude that grew it at the time

1121
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,200
had no idea that there was a way to set

1122
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,960
all this [ __ ] up with the internet and

1123
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,600
use all these monitors so

1124
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,600
um i do appreciate your desire to uh be

1125
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,639
in the agricultural technology side of

1126
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,599
cannabis

1127
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,120
i don't think i gave you uh the details

1128
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,959
you want because you are in

1129
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:46,479
the software engineering and you want to

1130
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,759
do software and control and i

1131
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,599
recommended testing

1132
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,839
but honestly that is what i see is

1133
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,079
needed the most right now at this time

1134
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,519
a lot of the other stuff is well covered

1135
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:59,038
there are so many companies

1136
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,038
making uh vpd monitors and co2 monitors

1137
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:04,079
and notification systems

1138
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:06,079
uh tracking systems weight systems data

1139
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:06,960
entry and data logging systems a lot of

1140
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:09,599
that stuff

1141
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,159
is taken up but we do need more labs in

1142
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,079
my

1143
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,519
