00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,280

couple of greenhouses doing some things

104
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,759
we can't talk too much about that

105
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,799

been out here for a long time it's

107

really hot i'm covered in sweat

108
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
getting kind of funky some wind came by

109
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,839
and i thought oh that breeze is going to

110
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:15,840
be

111
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,439
beautiful but i was wrong that breeze

112
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,200
came by and it just grabbed all the

113
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,598
moisture in my body and just left with

114
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,598
it

115
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:23,679
uh that breeze was not refreshing at all

116
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:25,839
so even the wind is hot out there

117
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,840

118

dehumidifier and i hope you added

126
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,039

were part of the show if you've been

145
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,000
listening and watching for a long time

146
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,560

147
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,878
newsletter on the website at

148

153
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,120

00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:30,800
and there was not a lot to share

157
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,040

this month

160
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,720
except there are no coupon codes i did

161
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,639
not make coupon codes this month

162
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320

168
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:50,000
to report and i was overwhelmed

169
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,000
with life i was having a good time i had

170
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,240
uh my daughter has graduated she turned

171
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,879
18 spent some time with her

172
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,639
we got a cool couple of events in denver

173
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,199
i've got this new secret project

174
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,038
going on and it is summertime so i have

175
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,600
been overloaded and it has been super

176
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,399
hot

177
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
i've put over 2500 miles on my car we're

178
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,399
around the 12th or 13th of this month

179
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,000
it has been good nothing seems to be

180
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,198
slowing down i'm not complaining i'm

181
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,439
just letting you know why

182
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,120
the mailchimp letter did not happen all

183
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,560
right um where are we gonna go from

184
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,840
there i think i've been rambling long

185
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,439
enough let's talk about

186
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,038
phenotypes i've got an email here in

187
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:23,519
front of me about phenotypes this is a

188
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,240
great

189
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,560
uh great question i actually was talking

190
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,400
on

191
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,319
instagram live about this just a couple

192
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,918
of days ago randomly

193
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,159
and then this email popped up so it

194
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,758
worked out perfectly uh let's jump right

195
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,360
into it this one says can you do a

196
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,479
short-ish video

197
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,680
on what a pheno is and how to find

198
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,199
a pheno that is a really good question i

199
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,759
talk about phenos a lot

200
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
i think a great way to start this is by

201
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,280
defining

202
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,800
the word phenotype what is a phenotype i

203
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:54,000
simply went to google i typed in the

204
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,918
word phenotype

205
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,160
and it says the set of observable

206
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:01,120
characteristics

207
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,960
in of an individual resulting from the

208
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,160
interaction of its genotype with the

209
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,439
environment i'll read it one more time

210
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
because i did stutter in the middle of

211
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,560
that

212
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,160
it is the set of observable

213
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160
characteristics of an

214
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
individual resulting from the

215
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,439
interaction of its genotype with the

216
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,439
environment

217
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,199
so let's put that into terms that when

218
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,759
we actually talk about plants to explain

219
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,000
this

220
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,879
the set of observable characteristics

221
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,800
what are observed

222
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,159
observable characteristics within our

223
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
plants we have

224
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,919
leaf shape we have leaf color then we

225
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:32,239
have plant shape

226
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,959
plant structure branchiness are they

227
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,360
tall

228
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,198
are they short are they squatty are they

229
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,879
bushy are they really sparse are they

230
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,360
super stretchy these are

231
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,600
observable these are observable

232
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,120
characteristics of an individual the

233
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
individual being the plants we are

234
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,199
working with those are all

235
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,400
individual uh observable characteristics

236
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,919
there's a mouthful to talk about here i

237
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:53,758
apologize for a couple of stumbles but

238
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,198
we will get through this i promise

239
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,800
um observable characteristics uh odors

240
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,319
aromas those are observable

241
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,639
characteristics

242
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,919
the buzz is an observable characteristic

243
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,879
you have to finish the plants you have

244
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,959
to smoke it to

245
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,199
determine and discover that but the high

246
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,359
you get is a characteristic

247
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,199
the flavors and aromas those are all

248
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,360
characteristics also

249
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,199
reactions how does it respond to things

250
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,280
that is something we can observe

251
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
if i take two plants and i pop and twist

252
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,159
this one and pop and twist this one

253
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,840
they may react differently and that is

254
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,840
a character and observable

255
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,839
characteristic of that individual

256
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,879
resulting from the interaction of its

257
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,478
genotype

258
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,719
with the environment now let's talk more

259
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:36,318
about the interaction of its genotype

260
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,720
with the environment that's a big part

261
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,560
right there um

262
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,400
observable characteristics that result

263
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,598
from the interaction of its genotype

264
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:44,878
with the environment i think the next

265
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,878
move is to go

266
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,400
define the word genotype what does

267
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,599
genotype mean

268
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,839
genotype is the genetic constitution of

269
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,639
an

270
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:54,959
individual organism so we cannot that is

271
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,639
the

272
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,000
ingredients of the organism the plant

273
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
the ingredients of the plant if this

274
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,879
were going to be

275
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,800
a cake these would be the cake

276
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,360
ingredients now the phenotype

277
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,038
is what happens when we bake this cake

278
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,439
do we burn it or do we cook it just

279
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:11,839
right

280
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,918
or do we freeze it these are uh

281
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,598
interactions of the genotype with its

282
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,680
environment the environment is the

283
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,598
grow room in which we are putting it in

284
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,800
so we've got a genotype that's got

285
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,038
certain genes in it

286
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,879
they're going to express differently in

287
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:28,719
different environments

288
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,360
if i took the same plant if i took

289
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,519
10 clones of the same plant all healthy

290
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,519
clones i rooted them all the same

291
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,679
they were all the same size they were

292
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,200
all equal in all ways and i gave them to

293
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,718
10 different growers

294
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
we're going to see 10 not completely

295
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
different grows but we're going to see

296
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,399
10 different outcomes from these plants

297
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:50,000
some are going to be stickier some are

298
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,759
going to be sweeter some will be more

299
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,480
dense some will be more airy

300
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:55,360
we're just going to see very typical

301
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,200
differences

302
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,360
from different grow rooms and this is

303
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,600
the phenotypical expression

304
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,200
which is the characteristics of an

305
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,240
individual resulting from its

306
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
interaction

307
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,480
of its genotype with the environment so

308
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,639
we can kind of shorten that we can say

309
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,159
this is what the plant is expressing

310
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,958
because of its environment this

311
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:15,519
particular plant does these particular

312
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,838
things

313
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,799
in this type of environment that's how

314
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,959
we learn

315
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,639
that's how i know that some of my plants

316
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:26,079
really like it when it gets

317
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,199
super cool or super hot or super dry

318
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,800
that's when you start learning

319
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,759
characteristics because you start

320
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,919
observing

321
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,278
those characteristics of an individual

322
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,039
plant then you start learning

323
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,360
how to make it express certain things or

324
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,439
stop it from expressing certain things

325
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,278
we know that we want plants to turn or

326
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,959
we know that if we want plants to turn

327
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:43,679
purple toward the end we can make them

328
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,479
cold

329
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,439
that is a phenotypical expression uh

330
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,159
directly

331
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,880
uh related to it's an interaction it's a

332
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,120
response

333
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,720
from the environmental factor we put on

334
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,560
it we made it cold and it said

335
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,160
it's cold i'm gonna get purple that's

336
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,199
phenotypical expression

337
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,600
not all plants will do that so i could

338
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,640
take

339
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,560
a pack of seeds and grow 10 seeds

340
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,679
some females some of the plants from the

341
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,199
males and females

342
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,359
some of the plants out there may turn

343
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
purple some may not turn purple those

344
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,079
are specific

345
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,600
phenotypes so phenotype is the uh the

346
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,039
expression we're just going to say it's

347
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,079
the expression of

348
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:24,159
those jeans uh it is how the kit once

349
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:26,000
the cake goes into the oven it is how it

350
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,600
is baked did you put it in too hot of an

351
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,278
oven to burn it did you put an oven just

352
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,278
right where it baked perfectly

353
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,039
these phenotypes are going to show you

354
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:34,639
what they want from your room so you've

355
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:35,360
got your room dialed in most of the time

356
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:37,278
we've got

357
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,000
pretty good guidelines of temperature

358
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,000
humidity light cycles that we wanted at

359
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,240
but then your plants are going to tell

360
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
you based on phenotypical selection what

361
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,839
is perfect for that plant for that

362
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,759
room that is dialing it in for that

363
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,480
phenotype getting it perfect for that

364
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,200
room

365
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,039
so phenotype is the set of observable

366
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,800
characteristics of an individual

367
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,240
resulting from the interaction of its

368
00:10:56,799 --> 00:10:59,359
genotype with the environment the

369
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,519
genotype is

370
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,039
the genetic constitution of an

371
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,799
individual organism

372
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,639
so sometimes we can put a plant in a

373
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:09,679
room and it will show

374
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,278
uh taco shaped leaves and bright green

375
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,799
colors then you can put the same plant

376
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,799
in a different room and the leaves will

377
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,399
not taco at all and they won't get super

378
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,359
bright green this is a phenotypical

379
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,039
expression

380
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,639
if you're putting too much light on it

381
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,078
it may get a different green color if

382
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,600
you're making it too hot it may do

383
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:24,239
different [ __ ] if you make it cold it

384
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,399
may curl

385
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,159
downward instead of upward this is going

386
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,759
to be a phenotypical

387
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,679
expression i do have a bunch of notes

388
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,480
here let's kind of talk about some of

389
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,838
the notes

390
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,200
that i have got we're going to talk

391
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,839
about another word also we're going to

392
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,680
talk about

393
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,200
chemotype later but that's a whole other

394
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:42,639
conversation

395
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,959
um phenotype and how to find a pheno so

396
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,519
a phenotype let's talk about a pheno

397
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:48,958
hunt

398
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:52,159
when you've got a pack of seeds

399
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,599
there is a label and an idea of what's

400
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,278
expected from these seeds i'm just going

401
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,800
to pick a strain we're going to

402
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,958
strawberry starburst because that's

403
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,719
really easy to uh pick some phenotypes

404
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,239
and talk about flavors when i say

405
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,839
strawberry starburst you've read the

406
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,320
description it says

407
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,240
strawberry candy and funky gassy aromas

408
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,399
that's kind of the short version

409
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,039
you bought the pack because you want

410
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,519
strawberry candy and funky gas aromas

411
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,120
now since that plant came from a rise

412
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
and strawberry starburst we've got

413
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,480
potential

414
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,399
to see plants that look a little bit

415
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,079
like the arise and plants that look a

416
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,440
little bit like strawberry starburst

417
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,319
and then we're gonna see stuff in the

418
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,680
middle that is combinations of the two

419
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,200
we'll see some that lean a little bit

420
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:32,719
more one way some that lean a little bit

421
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,000
more one way and then some that are 50

422
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,440
percent and then some that are

423
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,799
kind of more dominant of the other

424
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,079
that's just how breeding works when you

425
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,639
make an f1

426
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,278
there will be probably four or five main

427
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,839
phenotypes you can identify from that

428
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,360
now which phenotype do you want is the

429
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,639
main question when they grow they're

430
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,600
going to show a little bit different

431
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,839
expression

432
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
you already know that you want this

433
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,800
strain because you've selected it you've

434
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,399
paid the money for it you read the

435
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:57,039
description it's got traits that you're

436
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,078
after

437
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:02,639
something was desirable in this plan now

438
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:03,278
we've just got to find the perfect one

439
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,519
for

440
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,120
you do you want the one that grows a

441
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,159
little bit taller and takes a little bit

442
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,480
longer but

443
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,838
puts out more potency and more buds or

444
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,759
do you want the one that stays

445
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,200
short and squatty and gives you a real

446
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,039
head buzz or a real

447
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,320
uh makes your ears ring if you're so

448
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:19,199
high when you smoke it or do you want

449
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,600
the one that

450
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,240
uh doesn't grow very tall but makes

451
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,959
super

452
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,519
strawberry candied buds like it's up to

453
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,159
you

454
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,679
at that point to see which phenotype

455
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:31,439
works best for you

456
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,278
for your garden i don't know if you're

457
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
growing for yourself to smoke medically

458
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,000
i don't know if you're growing for

459
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,039
yourself to smoke recreationally i don't

460
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,120
know if you're growing

461
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,559
for another consumer who is a medical

462
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,519
patient i don't know if you're growing

463
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,759
as a

464
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,879
a provider a free market provider i

465
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,120
don't know your goal

466
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:48,320
but if you do you can find the plant

467
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,919
that works best for you

468
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,278
are you growing soil are you growing

469
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,319
hydro you're growing indoors you're

470
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,480
growing outdoors

471
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,240
is it in a greenhouse is it going to be

472
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,759
a screen of green is it going to be a

473
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,680
sea of green is it going to be

474
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,519
just one big plant in a seven gallon pot

475
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,120
left to do whatever it wants to do

476
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,198
you will find different phenotypes

477
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
within that pack of seeds that work the

478
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,120
best for

479
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,720
you i like to explain it as

480
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,120
sometimes you might say i want dinner

481
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,639
and you decide i want italian food

482
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,000
we all agree we're going to go get

483
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,360
italian food right so you go to the

484
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,879
italian restaurant

485
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,480
once you get to that italian restaurant

486
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:21,519
you've got a few more options you got

487
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,079
fettucini

488
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,600
uh you got penne pasta you got all kinds

489
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,198
of other italian food i'm not even gonna

490
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
dig into it i'm gonna make myself hungry

491
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:30,159
i saw the italian food coming to the

492
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,079
table as i started doing that

493
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,759
oh man anyway you got all these

494
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:35,519
different italian options you got red

495
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,759
sauce you got white sauce you got no

496
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,959
sauce you got so many options when it

497
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,799
comes to italian food

498
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,399
those are your phenotypes so you gotta

499
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,078
pack a strawberry starburst

500
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,919
you're gonna grow them one is going to

501
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,838
be a little bit strawberry one is going

502
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,759
to be a little bit gassy and footy one's

503
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,120
going to be strawberry gas and foot

504
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,319
and then one of them is probably not

505
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,519
even going to get your attention you're

506
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,959
going to go that plant right there i'm

507
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,480
just going to finish that and never grow

508
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,239
that again you can just tell there's one

509
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,720
in the batch that is not for you

510
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,839
but there will be one that is for you a

511
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,560
lot of times

512
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,279
i find out of a 10 pack i usually find

513
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:06,638
two

514
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,879
that i can't decide which are my

515
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:11,039
favorites one is usually

516
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,958
uh the pain in the ass it takes a little

517
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,719
bit longer it gets taller it's got some

518
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,159
like it's just frustrating but it gets

519
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,440
you so high and smells good that you

520
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,879
cannot get rid of it

521
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,839
and then there's another one that is

522
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:23,919
almost as good but not as good

523
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,680
but grows easier so you're like ah the

524
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:26,078
struggle of the grow and the extra 10 or

525
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,399
12

526
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,399
days versus that free 10 or 12 days and

527
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,399
it's almost as good do i even notice 10

528
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,720
or 12 days on the struggle worth

529
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,078
like that's what i find in phenotypes a

530
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
lot of times i will share

531
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:39,198
the easier phenotype with all of my

532
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,559
friends so that they've got that cut for

533
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:42,639
me if i want it and then i keep the

534
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,078
harder one for myself because i know

535
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,000
i can handle that harder more

536
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,958
challenging growth so phenotypes you're

537
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,679
gonna find

538
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:51,838
different stuff in there i have kind of

539
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,679
um

540
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,160
for a while i was really giving

541
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:58,319
phenotype advice on my crosses and my

542
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,078
strains but i have kind of

543
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,839
slowed down and dialed back and pulled

544
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:02,559
back from doing that because i feel like

545
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,759
i could

546
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,439
be causing you i'm not doing you a

547
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,000
service i'm causing you a detriment by

548
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,920
doing that

549
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,839
for you i don't want to select the

550
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:13,919
phenotype for you you should select the

551
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,040
phenotype yourself i've narrowed it down

552
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,000
pretty far

553
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:18,639
i bred these plants with a solid male

554
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,198
that i know

555
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:23,680
is going to put out good structure good

556
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,919
potency good resistance to problems

557
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,359
um and he's gonna grow with vigor and

558
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,838
he's gonna work well he's gonna clone

559
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,839
well

560
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,759
then i use females that i know are

561
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,160
tested they grow well they put out good

562
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,839
structure potency flavors aromas

563
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,759
so i've done the work to know that what

564
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,079
i'm breeding is going to offer you

565
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,000
a pretty good category of phenotypes to

566
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,559
work with then it's just up to you

567
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,958
to select out of that batch to find the

568
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,159
phenotype that is for you

569
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,399
i said earlier we're going to go to

570
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,360
italian food all right we all agreed on

571
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,600
italian food

572
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,800
when we get to the italian restaurant i

573
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,079
like

574
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:59,278
real heavy rich garlicky white sauce

575
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,120
kind of stuff that's what we're going

576
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,318
for today maybe some capers in there

577
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,359
something like that you may want

578
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,119
red sauce with like uh sweetness to it

579
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,038
maybe a sweet red sauce i'm just making

580
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,479
[ __ ] up right now off the top of my head

581
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,400
but we can get both of those at the

582
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
italian restaurant so

583
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,559
if you buy a pack of italian restaurant

584
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,558
seeds there's gonna be that red sauce

585
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,038
and that white sauce phenotype

586
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:25,359
don't let me pick the phenotype for you

587
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:28,000
pick the one that works best for you

588
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,519
i'm going to pick this 77 day phenotype

589
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,160
that gets kind of tall and is hard to

590
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,200
grow

591
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,480
but gets covered in trichomes and uh

592
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,600
it's just super potent i'm gonna take a

593
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
drink so you don't hear my throat do

594
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,480
that

595
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,839
but that's what i'm gonna pick you might

596
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,279
not pick that you might not have been

597
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,199
growing for half of your life and you

598
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:46,079
may not be ready to deal with the plant

599
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,679
that takes 77 or 87 days to finish you

600
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,279
might not want that they may

601
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,880
just that description you may say get

602
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:52,480
rid of that plant now

603
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,400
so it's all about you choosing the

604
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,720
phenotype that works best for you

605
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,200
or your patients or your clients or

606
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,240
whatever your goal is

607
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,400
so i may talk about which phenotypes are

608
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,079
available from my crosses and i may kind

609
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,038
of highlight things that i've seen and

610
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,199
what's common

611
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,240
and like usually there are three to five

612
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,400
maybe seven

613
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
really common phenotypes in an f1 and i

614
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,080
observe them because i grow a lot of the

615
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,359
seeds i'll tell you what i see sometimes

616
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,279
i name some of them there's like the

617
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,119
mean girl phenotype and the chunky girl

618
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,798
phenotype of stuff

619
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,079
sometimes we just call it the arise

620
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,440
leaning phenotype if you've got a

621
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,678
blueberry cookies

622
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,880
or a blueberry butcher plant i know i

623
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,480
just really talked myself into a circle

624
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,160
if you got a blueberry butcher plant

625
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,079
sometimes i'll say that one is jack the

626
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,759
ripper leaning that's the jack phenotype

627
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,199
it just looks more like jack the ripper

628
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,319
or maybe it looks more like blueberry

629
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,000
cookies

630
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:42,000
we'll just call it the one name

631
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,319
phenotype there's a i've got a plant i

632
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,839
call the sour balls pheno it smells like

633
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,279
your balls need a bath

634
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,159
i've got a phenotype that i call the

635
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,160
arise fino there are phenotypes that i

636
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,679
name after the people who give me the

637
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,240
cut um i

638
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,559
maybe allegedly got a cut of my

639
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,400
afterglow back from a friend and it is

640
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,359
named after her so in the future you

641
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,400
will see

642
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,918
uh the afterglow painted lady cut it

643
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,840
will be made famous because she did a

644
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,480
really good job finding that phenotype

645
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,558
for me

646
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,000
uh the painted lady after glow or the

647
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:14,399
after glow cut

648
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,679
found by painted lady so the painted

649
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,880
lady phenotype

650
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,480
uh is a just a it's a seed of the

651
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,600
afterglow that came from a bag of

652
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,079
afterglow seeds

653
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,240
and she grew it and found a beautiful

654
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,319
beautiful phenotype and she kept it and

655
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,079
i acquired a clone of that somehow

656
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,240
and i've got it and i it's still called

657
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,159
afterglow but since it's that special

658
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,200
phenotype that painted lady found it is

659
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,120
the afterglow

660
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,720
painted lady phenotype she put i put her

661
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:39,119
name on it she will be known for finding

662
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,400
that

663
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,159
she's always going to get some love for

664
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,600
me for searching that out of a pack

665
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,519
uh you guys follow the painted lady on

666
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,480
cannabis paint the lady13 or the painted

667
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,319
lady you'll find her

668
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,759
ah she's a great grower a great person

669
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,200
ah she kicks ass she's out there in

670
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,359
michigan killing it

671
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,279
uh big shout out but she will always be

672
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,558
known for that uh painted lady cut and

673
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,399
that painted lady coat will always have

674
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,079
her name on it when i breed to it

675
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,600
people say well which which afterglow

676
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:03,279
did you use and i'll say that painted

677
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,759
lady bro and that'll be the one

678
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:07,519
so there is the painted lady phenotype

679
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:10,158
of after glow

680
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,079
um but i feel like when i was telling

681
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,799
you guys which phenotypes to select from

682
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:14,240
my plants

683
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:15,839
i was kind of messing you up because

684
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,839
then everybody was just picking the same

685
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,359
phenotypes and why do you want what i

686
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,439
like i gave you

687
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,558
like i gave you a cd with 10 tracks on

688
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,840
there you don't have to pick the same

689
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:25,440
track that i like you could pick a

690
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,000
different track and play it and jam it

691
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,480
and love it just as much

692
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,400
so uh what is a phenotype a phenotype

693
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,120
when we grow multiple seeds

694
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,559
we're going to see uh variation in those

695
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,319
seeds you're going to find boys

696
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,079
pull the boys now you're going to have

697
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,879
females to select from they're going to

698
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:42,798
show you

699
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
different traits some will be shorter

700
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:46,000
some will be taller some will be

701
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,360
stinkier some will taste better some

702
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,880
will get a better buzz

703
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,879
some will taste long take longer to

704
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,640
finish some will finish more quickly

705
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,159
some will be problematic some will just

706
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,000
give you some [ __ ] problems to deal

707
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:58,080
with those are all different phenotypes

708
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,640
and it's up to you to find the phenotype

709
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,319
that you really enjoy once a breeder has

710
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,919
been making seeds for a long time and

711
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,279
we've narrowed down our breeding process

712
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,840
to where things come out

713
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,119
um more uniform stables not the word i

714
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,639
want to use because they're not stable

715
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,000
at this point when we're making f1s they

716
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
are brand new

717
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
they're all over the place there's a lot

718
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,798
of variation that's why we're seeing

719
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,200
phenotypical expression

720
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:20,319
um you're going to see this difference

721
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,519
you're going to see i just talked to

722
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:22,639
myself in a circle don't remember what

723
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:23,918
the [ __ ] i was saying

724
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,759
uh when you make seeds you're going to

725
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,640
see this variation this phenotypical

726
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:28,798
variation

727
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,000
you get to pick the variation that works

728
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:31,918
best for you do you want the tall

729
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,519
one the short one that's what you get to

730
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,440
pick that is called the phenohine

731
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,200
run a package of seeds find the one that

732
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,120
works best for you your garden your

733
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,200
customers your clientele your future

734
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,158
select that one you can name it if you

735
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,679
want this is

736
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,760
uh arise the let's pick a grower the

737
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,280
arise tenaci gardens cut he may have

738
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,279
that i don't know it's possible

739
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,440
so tanasi may have found a beautiful cut

740
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,879
of a rise and he named it the tanasi cut

741
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,720
and if he wants to share it out he could

742
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
just say that's a rise i call it the

743
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
tanasi cut and then people know that's

744
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,599
the one that came from tanasi forever

745
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
shout out to my boy tenacio i just made

746
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,000
that up put you in the game um

747
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,038
where do we go from there how do i find

748
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,279
afino

749
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,640
i think i've done a full podcast on

750
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,359
final hunts and phenotypes

751
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,480
phenotype selection but grow them find

752
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:15,279
the one that you're in love with the

753
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,679
most

754
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:19,279
you'll know early a lot of us will find

755
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,480
out very early in the flower you go like

756
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,759
week three you're like that's the one

757
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,960
right there and then

758
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,640
you're already in love with it it's

759
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,240
gonna be your favorite all the way

760
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,360
through growing drying curing and

761
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,720
smoking and you're gonna say number

762
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:30,399
three is the champion

763
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,880
a lot of times i will narrow it down to

764
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,600
two or three out of a 10 or 25 pack of

765
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,520
testers

766
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,119
i'll find my favorite two or three and

767
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,240
then i'll run those two or three side by

768
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,158
side again

769
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,240
and then we'll do smoke test then we'll

770
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,240
do extraction tests see which smokes

771
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,038
better which extracts better which wash

772
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,558
is better

773
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,240
uh which takes better pictures we'll

774
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,839
just kind of narrow it down uh

775
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,279
blindly smoke it with all the homies

776
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:51,759
around and see who likes which one

777
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:53,599
better

778
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,240
but that is how we do a pheno hunt just

779
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,959
grow it smoke it and see what works best

780
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,759
are you one thing that is always

781
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,960
noticeable

782
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,879
the growers and the consumers often

783
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,038
argue over which is better because the

784
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,960
grower doesn't

785
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:11,038
the grower has to deal with the growth

786
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,400
the consumer doesn't have to think about

787
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,759
this plant was [ __ ] nitrogen

788
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,280
deficient the whole time and it gave me

789
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:16,558
a headache for nine weeks and i was

790
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:18,240
chasing it and fight at the entire

791
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,720
fighting it the entire time

792
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,720
the smoker doesn't think about um this

793
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,240
one needs extra water because it's super

794
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,679
thirsty or it doesn't think about man i

795
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,120
had to wash that one every day because

796
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,400
it doesn't drink much and if i over

797
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,279
watered it ever it would give me

798
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,960
problems

799
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,440
the smokers don't think about that so

800
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,200
the growers and the smokers are often

801
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,240
choosing different phenotypes the grower

802
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,880
wants the one that's going to grow

803
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,640
easier

804
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,000
i don't mind a challenge i like that at

805
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,440
this point it makes it more fun for me

806
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,759
it keeps me on my toes but

807
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,759
you'll find out that often times the one

808
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,278
that grows the best and smokes the best

809
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,960
are not the same phenotypes you're gonna

810
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,240
have to make some decisions there

811
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,159
i do have some more notes i want to make

812
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,159
sure i cover them all i got rambly

813
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,480
i love it when it works like that nice

814
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,480
and flowy i was going to say you chose

815
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,720
that seed pack for a reason

816
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,400
it's got what you're seeking should be

817
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,960
in there so you just have to find

818
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,880
the one that works the best for you then

819
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,880
somebody asked me if i prefer a large

820
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,960
pheno hunt or a small final hunt and

821
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,520
i've got a very good answer for that

822
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,319
in a commercial environment i would do

823
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,319
somewhere between 25 to 100 seeds

824
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,558
because as the breeder i want to see

825
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,639
what that seedline has got to offer

826
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,319
i'm going to find those three to seven

827
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,400
basic phenotypes i've been talking about

828
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,839
three five maybe seven basic phenotypes

829
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
but if i grow a hundred

830
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,000
maybe 200 seeds i'm going to find things

831
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,798
that most people will never see it's all

832
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,359
about numbers the more population i grow

833
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,200
the more

834
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,479
oddities the more outliers i've got the

835
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,240
opportunity to find

836
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
so that's when i see weird [ __ ] is when

837
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,919
i grow a hundred or 200 at a time

838
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,159
and just let them grow don't pull

839
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,000
anything too early just see what they

840
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,480
all look like and what they all do

841
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,079
that is a commercial grower approach

842
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,798
that is a breeders approach

843
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,439
in a homegrown environment i feel like

844
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,079
and this

845
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,960
this is just my opinion i feel like i

846
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,278
have done the work

847
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,519
on the seeds that you should find a

848
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,440
keeper and a 10 pack of seeds

849
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,278
if you're not in a five pack i sell five

850
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,798
packs you will find a keeper in a five

851
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,400
pack of seeds and if you don't let me

852
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:12,720
know will make you happy

853
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,240
i have done the work by having reliable

854
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,720
male plants i have done the work by

855
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,960
having

856
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,640
reliable female plants i've tested all

857
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,278
of these plants i know that my breeding

858
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
works

859
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,519
and i know that within a five pack you

860
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,798
will find at least one keeper and a ten

861
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,038
pack you should find one

862
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,879
amazing keeper i have done the work with

863
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,879
the selection of my breeding stock to

864
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,880
make that part easy for you

865
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,320
if you're not finding a keeper and a 10

866
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,159
pack of seeds you might want to

867
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:36,720
reconsider who you're buying your seeds

868
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,000
from

869
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,679
i'm not saying that they're a bad

870
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,359
breeder i'm not saying they're not doing

871
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,120
good work but if you're not finding what

872
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,119
you want in a 10 pack

873
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,558
are they being advertised and described

874
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,359
properly because it said

875
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:50,960
oranges and chocolate grows in 70 days

876
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,879
you bought it thinking oranges and

877
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,640
chocolate 70 days obviously

878
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,240
if it's not doing what you expected it

879
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,080
to do and not making you happy you may

880
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,919
need to find another seed breeder

881
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,839
somebody whose descriptions match their

882
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,000
outcomes i really try to do my best when

883
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,480
it comes to descriptions and outcomes

884
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,159
i take a lot of feedback from people i

885
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,278
do a lot of my own research i do a lot

886
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,880
of observation

887
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,880
i do a lot of editing and updating

888
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,360
because i want you people to get

889
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,039
accurate information and accurate advice

890
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,639
on a seed package all right

891
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,240

892
