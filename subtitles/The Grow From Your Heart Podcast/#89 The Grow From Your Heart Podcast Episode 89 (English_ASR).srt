30
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,989

we're gonna get on with the show here I

52
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,250
want to let you guys know that I'm

53
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,489
recording with a new device today I'm

54
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,859
using the new zoom h6 handy recorder I

55
00:01:57,489 --> 00:02:01,449
got the zoom h6 so that I will be able

56
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:03,340
to take this podcast on the road a

57
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,469
little bit it's a much smaller unit than

58
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,478
what I've been using this thing will fit

59
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:10,058
in my back pocket and I can carry it

60
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:11,859
around and I can do shows from events

61
00:02:10,058 --> 00:02:14,528
such as the secret cup the cannabis cup

62
00:02:11,859 --> 00:02:14,960
or wherever we may be so you guys look

63
00:02:14,528 --> 00:02:17,359
for

64
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:19,159
two episodes with special guests coming

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,720
up because now I can take the show to

66
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:22,699
them instead of trying to get people to

67
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,199
come to me I live in kind of a shitty

68
00:02:22,699 --> 00:02:27,799
part of Colorado where nobody wants to

69
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,719
go so it's hard to get like danzel and

70
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,189
hunt and people like that to come here

71
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,109
but if I go to them they're happy to be

72
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:35,240
on the show so it's been a few bucks I

73
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,400
got the zoom h6 we will take this show

74
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,659
on the road you guys I'm gonna ask you

75
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,710
to do me a favor since you're listening

76
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:41,299
to the show let me know what you think

77
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:43,400
of the sound quality let me know if this

78
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,260
quality is acceptable let me know if it

79
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,390
I've changed anything that you noticed

80
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:49,639
because if this isn't acceptable I'll go

81
00:02:47,389 --> 00:02:51,409
back to using the main studio setup

82
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,179
I just wanted to pull this out give it a

83
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,650
try see what it was like before I try to

84
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,260
take it on the road and record with

85
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,090
other people so yeah big shot to the

86
00:02:57,259 --> 00:03:01,370
zoom h6 well you know what you think of

87
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:04,759
it you guys alright so let's get into

88
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:07,370
the show I told you that I saw some

89
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,389
ducting issues I did a consultation for

90
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,500
a friend of mine I didn't even charge

91
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,849
him for it the other day but he's been

92
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,129
saying dude my room's getting way too

93
00:03:10,849 --> 00:03:14,120
hot this summer what can I do and I was

94
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:17,079
like you know what that's a good start

95
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,939
of a podcast so I walked in there and

96
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,710
then the first thing I see is messy ass

97
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,060
ducting the students got a decent girl

98
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:25,670
room he's got enough air conditioning

99
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,620
his plants look good but his ducting was

100
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:30,139
a complete mess you guys and I've seen a

101
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,390
lot of messy ducting lately on my visits

102
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:33,919
and consultations so one thing I wanna

103
00:03:32,389 --> 00:03:36,439
tell you is keep in mind that every

104
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,479
single twist and bend in your ducting

105
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,400
Razoo reduces your air flow and adds to

106
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,069
the workload of your blower whatever

107
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,289
kind of inline fan you're using every

108
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:47,449
Bend puts more strain and more pressure

109
00:03:45,289 --> 00:03:50,060
on that inline fan and slows down the

110
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,619
amount of air you're moving so ideally

111
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,229
ducting would be in a straight line with

112
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,310
zero curves or bends or twists or

113
00:03:54,229 --> 00:03:57,049
anything like that but I know that's not

114
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,400
that's not rational because of course

115
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:00,200
we're growing in houses and things like

116
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,510
that and you have to move the air around

117
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:04,280
and not a straight line sometimes but

118
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:05,539
try to get it as straight as you can

119
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,280
that'll save you a lot of money on

120
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:08,689
heating costs it'll save you money

121
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,340
because you don't have to run the blower

122
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:12,169
as hard it'll save you money because

123
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,810
you're more efficiently cooling so

124
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:16,339
Street now oh I just noticed something

125
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:17,509
when you put the cellphone too close to

126
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,159
the h6 you get a little bit of

127
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,180
interference so that's good to know

128
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,620
sorry about that guys I hope you didn't

129
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,970
hear that too much I'm reading notes off

130
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,329
of my cell phone here which is why I did

131
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,190
that

132
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:27,199
anyway try to keep producting in a

133
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:28,459
straight line another great way to save

134
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,168
some money on cooling you guys

135
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,168
would be to run your lights at night

136
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:37,490
kilowatts from the electric company are

137
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:39,080
actually cheaper at night so if you're

138
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,689
not running your electricity at peak

139
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,189
hours it'll save you a few bucks so what

140
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:44,509
I would recommend if you can do it and

141
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:46,519
this will only work for some people on

142
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,979
your lifestyle your schedule if you can

143
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,359
have your plants come on right around

144
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:52,490
here it gets a dark about nine o'clock

145
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,139
eight or nine o'clock hitch right now it

146
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,019
would be ideal to have your lights come

147
00:04:54,139 --> 00:05:00,139
on at 9:00 p.m. that way it's cool

148
00:04:57,019 --> 00:05:01,728
outside the Sun has gone down the lights

149
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,189
kick on and that way you're not fighting

150
00:05:01,728 --> 00:05:06,019
the Sun all day you're not adding Sun

151
00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:08,120
and grow lights to that grow room to try

152
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:11,168
to cool down so turn on your lights at

153
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,038
night if you can that'll help you out

154
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:14,359
all right so you guys straighten out

155
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,469
your ducting run your light cycle at

156
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,449
night and you'll save a few bucks on

157
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,919
cooling costs getting your plants too

158
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:20,389
hot is gonna cause them to become fluffy

159
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,219
and it's gonna decrease your harvest

160
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,500
weight so when you've got electricity

161
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,389
bills to cover every gram counts so you

162
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,098
got to do your best to pull every gram

163
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:29,930
you can out of the room since you've got

164
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:32,029
to pay for every kilowatt that you've

165
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:34,038
used so figure out how to get the

166
00:05:32,029 --> 00:05:35,719
ducting straight start running the

167
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:37,129
lights at night and that will help you

168
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,240
out quite a bit something else you guys

169
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,610
could keep in mind during these hot

170
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,168
summer months is humidity as the

171
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:44,419
temperatures rise the humidity outside

172
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:46,579
is rising also so be aware of how humid

173
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:48,198
your rooms are this is the first year

174
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:50,089
that I have personally needed to go buy

175
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,610
a dehumidifier from my main flowering

176
00:05:50,089 --> 00:05:53,989
room fans and air conditioning are not

177
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:55,639
enough sometimes you guys you need to

178
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,218
remove the stagnant humid air from your

179
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,408
rooms and replace it with fresh co2 rich

180
00:05:58,218 --> 00:06:02,089
air for your plants so you guys make

181
00:06:00,408 --> 00:06:05,209
sure you're pulling that air out that

182
00:06:02,089 --> 00:06:06,918
hot air needs to be sucked out all right

183
00:06:05,209 --> 00:06:08,418
one more thing I can think of to help

184
00:06:06,918 --> 00:06:09,859
you keep your rooms cool is to pay

185
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:12,109
attention to the filters and your air

186
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:13,848
conditioners guys those filters are

187
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,580
designed to last for a year without

188
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:18,589
being replaced but keep in mind you guys

189
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:20,689
are running them in a grow room or there

190
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:22,579
may be a lot of extra dirt a lot of

191
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,259
humidity and there's a lot of extra work

192
00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:26,180
on that unit they don't expect that unit

193
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:27,830
to be competing with four or five or six

194
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,689
whatever you got that many thousand watt

195
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:31,550
lights they don't expect that thing to

196
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,959
come on when you buy it and never shut

197
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,579
off like a lot of us do with an air

198
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,198
conditioner so if you've got an air

199
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:38,598
conditioner that has filters replace

200
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:40,610
those once they get clogged up

201
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,569
if air doesn't flow through you don't

202
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,879
get as much cooling

203
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:45,500
wasting electricity that electricity is

204
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,149
not turning into a gram of weed so

205
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,100
you're flushing money down the toilet

206
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:50,719
basically your air conditioner may

207
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,490
require a little extra maintenance since

208
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,840
we're working it so hard you guys and

209
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,000
also keep in mind where you're putting

210
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:57,319
your air conditioner it may suck up a

211
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,120
little bit more dirt and [ __ ] like that

212
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:02,060
just depending on where you have put it

213
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,139
all right so that was a good little rant

214
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,699
since we're talking about replacing

215
00:07:03,139 --> 00:07:05,959
things and things that you need to

216
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:07,849
upgrade in your grow room I figured I'd

217
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,199
make a little kind of a checklist of

218
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,720
things it would be a good idea to

219
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,180
replace and check on one thing that you

220
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,640
guys need to replace is your bulbs in

221
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:19,009
your grow rooms the HID bulbs don't last

222
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,599
forever if you're using good bulbs you

223
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:22,819
can switch those out about once every

224
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,220
six months or if you've got the budget

225
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:27,769
you can toss them every two crops which

226
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,030
would be about every four months if

227
00:07:27,769 --> 00:07:30,919
that's one if you're using moley as a

228
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:32,419
flowering cycle if you're buying those

229
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,980
cheap plant max bulbs you guys or

230
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,480
whatever generic brand you you're buying

231
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:37,580
at your grow shop I would recommend

232
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,650
replacing those every single flowering

233
00:07:37,579 --> 00:07:41,529
cycle those aren't high quality bulbs

234
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,339
and they burn out a little bit quickly

235
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:44,629
all right if you're using those cheap

236
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:46,519
bulbs guys what I would recommend is

237
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,350
harvest the room empty the room clean it

238
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,149
out and replace those bulbs before you

239
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:52,129
put new plants in there again if you're

240
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:54,829
using good bulbs you can go probably two

241
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:57,170
cycles maybe three I definitely wouldn't

242
00:07:54,829 --> 00:08:00,379
go past for flowering cycles but the

243
00:07:57,170 --> 00:08:02,240
same bulb I would replace that the bulb

244
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:03,709
will stop putting out as much light but

245
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,540
it will still be sucking up as much

246
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:07,489
electricity it will still be making as

247
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:10,250
much heat and again you're not turning

248
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:11,930
those kilowatts into grams of weed which

249
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,639
is your goal you don't want to pay for

250
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,500
electricity that is just causing heat

251
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,149
which is making your air conditioner run

252
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:20,120
stronger which is pulling more

253
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:21,620
electricity you see the cycle hair all

254
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,269
right so don't forget that your bulbs in

255
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,590
your veg area are just as important as

256
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:26,060
in your flowering room you guys you got

257
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:28,939
to swap those bulbs out occasionally

258
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,220
also I like those new 315 bulbs I'll

259
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:33,470
reason those at the shop they seem to

260
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,910
put out quite a bit of light and they're

261
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:36,889
affordable so if you guys can afford the

262
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,689
315 I would definitely recommend those

263
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:40,429
if you want to go with your metal halide

264
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:43,340
bulbs I would recommend those again

265
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:45,709
every every two months every four months

266
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,030
every six months at the very longest you

267
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,800
guys I wouldn't run longer than six

268
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,480
months on the same Bowl no matter what

269
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,309
you're doing with it if you've got those

270
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,019
t5 bulbs you're gonna need to replace

271
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:54,919
those quite frequently those things just

272
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:56,208
crap out

273
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:58,129
and what I have noticed about the T

274
00:08:56,208 --> 00:09:00,049
fives if you buy a fixture with like

275
00:08:58,129 --> 00:09:02,750
eighty fives in it just pretty much plan

276
00:09:00,049 --> 00:09:04,549
on replacing all eight t5 bulbs all at

277
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,110
the same time because they're all just

278
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:09,199
gonna start [ __ ] now when one goes out

279
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:10,850
just go buy the whole set alright guys

280
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,528
we've talked about replacing your bulbs

281
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,360
now what about the ballasts if you're

282
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:15,828
using modern modern digital ballot

283
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,720
digital ballasts they'll last a while

284
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:20,088
most of them come with a nice warranty

285
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,250
so you didn't hear this from me but

286
00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:23,870
anything that comes with a warranty that

287
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,269
will be replaced because of the warranty

288
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,980
I make sure to break that thing about a

289
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:29,299
month or two before the warranty is up

290
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,519
sometimes a few months before the

291
00:09:29,299 --> 00:09:32,899
warranty is up just break it just

292
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,129
[ __ ] break it and then go get another

293
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,269
one on the warranty because these

294
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:37,129
companies are charging you enough for

295
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:38,450
[ __ ] anyway it should last a while

296
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:39,799
break it and go get a new one they're

297
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:41,269
gonna refurbish the one that you've got

298
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:43,009
they're gonna resell it as a refurbished

299
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,419
unit don't worry about them they make

300
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:45,740
plenty of money just break the [ __ ]

301
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:48,319
thing right before the warranty is up

302
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,149
and get yourself a new one if you're

303
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,600
using those old magnetic ballasts those

304
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:55,820
things will go forever you won't see any

305
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,379
drop in light power from a ballast from

306
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,980
what I've noticed they'll just die one

307
00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:02,448
day it won't even warn you so when your

308
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,730
ballast warranty is about to be up go

309
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:06,588
get another one you guys that should be

310
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,690
enough ranting for now about fixing your

311
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:09,620
rooms one thing I should remind you of

312
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,000
that I have mentioned in a previous

313
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,370
episode since we're talking about

314
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,970
replacing things calibrate your pH

315
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,190
meters you guys your TDS pins your pH

316
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:21,170
pins whatever else you want to call it

317
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:22,970
your EC meter if you're in England or

318
00:10:21,169 --> 00:10:25,039
Britain you guys calibrate those things

319
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,839
quite frequently because when that

320
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,338
messes up you don't even notice and

321
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,540
you're just in there trying to adjust pH

322
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,829
and you're doing it wrong and you don't

323
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:33,049
know so you're gonna start causing

324
00:10:30,828 --> 00:10:34,729
problems all right guys I've been going

325
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:37,338
for just over 10 minutes here I need a

326
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:38,839
quick dab so uh you know let's do a dab

of shatter a nor does a totally

378
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:23,620
different flavor but let's review this

379
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:32,298
anyway here we go

380
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:32,298
[Music]

381
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,810
it's definitely smooth nice and smooth

382
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:42,778
no joke

383
00:12:36,809 --> 00:12:44,879
I like that um so let me back up a step

384
00:12:42,778 --> 00:12:46,710
here by looking at it it's nice and

385
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,929
glossy it's got a nice shine to it ah

386
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:50,850
it's nice and clear it's got a nice

387
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:54,659
clear amber yellow color so it looks

388
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,830
great on the inhale well let me talk

389
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:57,269
about the smell it just smelled like

390
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,160
hash let's smell it again let's put it

391
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:00,750
up to the nose

392
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:02,459
dad just smell like shadow mostly smells

393
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:04,259
the same it's got that shatter II like

394
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,170
almost a honey kind of a sweet smell to

395
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:09,299
it but anyway it looks good that smells

396
00:13:07,169 --> 00:13:11,849
good when I taste it on the inhale I

397
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:15,000
definitely tasted the blueberry on the

398
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:17,820
exhale it had a hint of um Cushie chemi

399
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,039
type of stuff I'm an earthy flavor on

400
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,360
the out so the N is blueberries and

401
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,849
there's a hint of blueberry on the

402
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,740
tongue still but you know what the

403
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:28,409
feeling is straight headband it feels

404
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:29,669
like I just put a headband on my head it

405
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,069
feels like I just slowed down to tell

406
00:13:29,669 --> 00:13:34,349
you the truth it was like feels like I

407
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,640
just slowed down a whole bunch so let's

408
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,019
get back into doing a podcast I

409
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,029
certainly approve of the blueberry

410
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:42,088
headband it tastes like blueberry it

411
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:43,289

413
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:47,669
guys excuse the cough alright now that I

414
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,200
buy a [ __ ] I want to answer some

415
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:50,729
questions that people have sent to me

416
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,650
these questions have come from periscope

417
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:54,210
they've come from Twitter I've gotten

418
00:13:52,649 --> 00:13:55,529
them in emails and I have gotten them on

419
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:57,629
Facebook you guys if you're not checking

420
00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:00,509
it out on periscope every occasionally I

421
00:13:57,629 --> 00:14:02,189
jump onto periscope and just I take a

422
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:04,019
couple of dabs and I rant and I hang out

423
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:05,370
with my friends I talk about a few

424
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,689
things that are on my mind and then I

425
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,779
just sign out and say goodbye and I

426
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:11,400
usually delete the videos pretty quickly

427
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:12,689
but if you ever check out the periscope

428
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,919
app make sure you follow me and you can

429
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,930
check out some of the videos in the

430
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,879
future I'll do a full podcast on

431
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,349
periscope and you'll be able to jump in

432
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:21,509
and ask me questions and I'll be able to

433
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,620
answer them live for you the only

434
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:24,240
problem with that right now is you guys

435
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,980
I'm taking over as the leaf grower at

436
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,899
the spot dispensary and there's been a

437
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,240
lot of work and some days we work until

438
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,278
noon other days we work until 6:00 it's

439
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,629
hard to guess so right now scheduling

440
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,009
things is a little bit of a pain in the

441
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:37,019
ass but I promise you I'm gonna do this

442
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,458
periscope episode I just promised you so

443
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:39,779
that means I've got to do it I've never

444
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,979
promised you something and not done it

445
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,439
on

446
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,210
show all right so let me get to the

447
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,370
point here questions and answers with

448
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:49,970
Rasta Jeff our first question is about a

449
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:51,759
product called OGT quite a while ago I

450
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:54,500
mentioned that I use a product called

451
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,149
OGT veganic secret sauce is what I think

452
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,990
it's called

453
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,250
somebody asked me to talk a little bit

454
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,159
about it

455
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,600
I like that product a whole bunch I'd

456
00:15:01,159 --> 00:15:03,860
like it it's what it is I don't have any

457
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,360
of the product with me I've used all of

458
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:07,580
what I have and I kind of haven't been

459
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,330
using it since I ran out I replaced it

460
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,259
with something else

461
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:14,420
but what it is is an organic tea that is

462
00:15:12,259 --> 00:15:15,919
able to be mixed almost instantly and

463
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:17,990
then fed to your plants a lot of teas

464
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,819
that we're using need to be mixed up and

465
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,740
they need to brew for 24 to 48 hours

466
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,780
this stuff you can pour the powder into

467
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,759
some water give it a nice stir and feed

468
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:27,519
it directly to your plants one thing

469
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,870
that I did notice that it promoted

470
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,120
ridiculously healthy roots my roots were

471
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,799
growing quickly my roots were growing

472
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,360
out of the holes and the bottoms of my

473
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,559
pots the drainage holes my roots were

474
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,690
coming out of there looking for

475
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,329
somewhere else to go hide I have a

476
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:42,980
friend who breaks down the soil from my

477
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,509
harvested plants he gets paid to help me

478
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:46,279
out a little bit and when Mike was

479
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:47,689
breaking down those root balls

480
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:49,279
he asked me dude what have you been

481
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:51,770
doing differently lately because these

482
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:55,459
things are amazing a lot of that I will

483
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:57,949
attribute to the secret sauce the og tea

484
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,200
I think it was doing a lot of it it was

485
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:02,600
really great for the early lifecycle of

486
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,610
the plants and for veg now when in when

487
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,529
I went into flour here's something that

488
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:08,419
I didn't realize was happening I noticed

489
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:11,299
there was something weird and somebody

490
00:16:08,419 --> 00:16:13,279
else pointed it out to me when I was in

491
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:15,620
flower and I was feeding OGT I would

492
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,329
feed it every other week and on those

493
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,940
weeks I would notice that my plants

494
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,250
would progress more into what looks like

495
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:24,260
a nutrient deficiency on some strains I

496
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:25,909
had strains that I'd I was feeding it

497
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:27,559
just like I have before and it looked

498
00:16:25,909 --> 00:16:29,120
like it was becoming nitrogen deficient

499
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,799
the plant couldn't keep up with itself

500
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,799
and it was just burning out really early

501
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,839
and I mentioned that to our friend Sean

502
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:37,849
and I mentioned that the only thing I

503
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:40,759
was using differently was the OGT and

504
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:44,240
Sean said that the rock phosphates that

505
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:47,000
they are using to produce the OGT speed

506
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,950
up the nutritive cycle of your plank so

507
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,019
if you're going to use this stuff I

508
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,290
would only use it during the veg cycle

509
00:16:51,019 --> 00:16:54,120
and use it very

510
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:55,980
sparingly during the flowering cycle

511
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,980
because when I used the recommended

512
00:16:55,980 --> 00:17:01,259
dosage it sped my plants up almost too

513
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:03,600
much and they weren't burned but they

514
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:05,910
were almost not able to they were

515
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,769
growing so quickly and using nutrients

516
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:09,298
so quickly that they were eating all of

517
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:11,009
their food for the week within the first

518
00:17:09,298 --> 00:17:12,269
couple of the days and then starving

519
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,609
themselves is what it looked like was

520
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:16,798
happening so that is my little rant on

521
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:18,509
OGT it's a good product but if you're

522
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,679
going to use it be prepared and you're

523
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:21,449
gonna have to adjust your feeding

524
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,769
they're gonna have to pay attention but

525
00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:24,150
I hope you're doing that every time you

526
00:17:22,769 --> 00:17:27,838
put a new product into your garden

527
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:30,960
anyway alright so our next question I

528
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,129
want to move on where did I put it here

529
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,870
we go our next question comes from

530
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,490
periscope and somebody asked me and this

531
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:38,389
is gonna take me a little bit today to

532
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:40,859
describe here but somebody said what is

533
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:42,600
solvent list because I was talking about

534
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:44,399
solvent list on periscope and they did

535
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:48,199
not have it in context so let me try to

536
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:51,929
describe to you what solvent list is

537
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:56,490
first off let me say that solvent list

538
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:59,130
is a marketing term solvent list is

539
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,390
owned by McAtee of the essential

540
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,059
extracts I don't know if it's owned by

541
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:05,780
him but it is the marketing term that he

542
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:10,200
has put on what he calls solvent lists

543
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:13,918
now that being said not all solvent list

544
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,380
hash has to come from nicotine anything

545
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,630
any hash that is made without solvent

546
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:22,049
can will be considered solvent less in

547
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,309
most cases in 99% of the cases in the

548
00:18:22,048 --> 00:18:24,929
cannabis industry you know I've never

549
00:18:23,308 --> 00:18:27,298
seen anything else called non solvent

550
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,110
maybe dry sipped but that's totally

551
00:18:27,298 --> 00:18:30,539
different

552
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:33,509
water hash or bubble hash is solvent

553
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:36,000
list it's made with ice and water it's

554
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:40,169
not the solvents that we are using is

555
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,579
BHO Pho there are a couple other gases

556
00:18:40,169 --> 00:18:43,830
that people are using to extract hash

557
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:46,259
with lately but the propane and the

558
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:47,699
butane are the solvents and I know a lot

559
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:50,730
of people are gonna say but water is a

560
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,830
solvent as well right in this case and

561
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:55,259
I'm going to paraphrase what nicotine

562
00:18:52,829 --> 00:18:56,789
says all of the time big shout out to DJ

563
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,069
nicotine when we're talking about

564
00:18:56,789 --> 00:19:00,658
solvent less hash water is not being

565
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:02,730
used as a solvent it's being used as a

566
00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:04,260
mechanical separator we're not trying to

567
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:05,640
dissolve the trichomes we're not trying

568
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,140
to dissolve the plant matter

569
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,350
we're just simply using it as a way to

570
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:13,140
wash the trichomes off of the leaves so

571
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:16,409
solvent less hash is basically hash made

572
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,620
by using ice or water solvent list made

573
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,690
by DJ naked tea is kept at a certain

574
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:23,879
temperature at all times and it never

575
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,580
gets warm it never gets dry and never

576
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,770
hardens up it's always got a nice greasy

577
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:30,750
texture to it it's always real tasty

578
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,099
that's solvent list alright so since

579
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,750
we're talking about solvent list let me

580
00:19:32,099 --> 00:19:35,219
describe a couple of other types of hash

581
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,589
just to kind of put that in perspective

582
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,089
a little bit other types of hash that

583
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:42,139
are super popular right now that

584
00:19:39,089 --> 00:19:45,209
everybody talks about our BHO which is

585
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:47,880
butane honey oil or butane hash or dabs

586
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,950
or shatter or wax that's pretty much the

587
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:53,520
most popular right now and then of

588
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:57,298
course there is live resin live resin is

589
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,950
basically it is BHO that is made from

590
00:19:57,298 --> 00:20:01,500
fresh frozen plants and then it is

591
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,120
blasted through an obidos machine by emo

592
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,970
tech the only way that you can make live

593
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,678
resin is through an emo tech machine and

594
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,019
I know that sounds crazy but like I said

595
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,509
earlier nicotine has made the marketing

596
00:20:10,019 --> 00:20:15,389
term solvent list the boys at emo Tech

597
00:20:12,509 --> 00:20:17,970
have come up with the term live resin so

598
00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:20,009
unless you're running it emo textile in

599
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:21,210
an emo tech machine you're not making

600
00:20:20,009 --> 00:20:23,700
libraries and a lot of people are gonna

601
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,440
hate on me for that but that is my

602
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,789
theory and I'm sticking to it

603
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,048
alright guys I've got time for one more

604
00:20:26,789 --> 00:20:29,700
question this question comes from

605
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:32,339
Facebook and it's from our friend Bobby

606
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:34,710
Bobby is starting his first grow and

607
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:38,459
he's asking if it is ok to use Miracle

608
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,529
Grow plant food or Miracle Grow soil for

609
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,090
his cannabis plants and you guys I

610
00:20:40,529 --> 00:20:44,819
definitely have to say I strongly

611
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:48,178
recommend not using any miracle girl

612
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:50,720
products in your garden The Miracle Grow

613
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:53,730
soil has time-released

614
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,589
fertilizers in it which will last for up

615
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,720
to six months and you don't want

616
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:59,819
nitrogen being released into your plants

617
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,759
for six months so I would recommend not

618
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:04,740
using that soil use something like a fox

619
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,450
farms product or a roots organics

620
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,740
product use something like that if

621
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,289
you're a new grower it gives you a solid

622
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:11,700
start there's not nutrients in it that

623
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:13,109
are gonna screw you up

624
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,450
it'll have things in it that will help

625
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:18,240
you out from the very beginning as for

626
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:19,080
the nutrients if you are trying to use

627
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,000
Miracle Grow nutria

628
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:22,379
I would throw those away right away get

629
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,940
rid of the plant food head your hydro

630
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:26,610
shop head to hydro indoor growing

631
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:28,409
supplies and get yourself a basic two or

632
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:30,719
three part nutrient solution there will

633
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:32,880
be a bottle a a bottle beef of a brand

634
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,288
that sounds good to you the guys at the

635
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,370
hydro shop can definitely talk you

636
00:21:34,288 --> 00:21:38,250
through what you need they'll help you

637
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:39,569
pick a brand they're mainly if you're

638
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,579
just starting out they're mainly the

639
00:21:39,569 --> 00:21:44,579
same thing I would say go with something

640
00:21:41,579 --> 00:21:46,189
like the tannic hair bio biz something

641
00:21:44,579 --> 00:21:49,019
simple just something with an A and a B

642
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:51,389
the general organics or general

643
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:52,859
hydroponics Florida Nova stuff that's

644
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:54,000
all fine any of that stuff you want to

645
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,589
go for it's pretty much all the same

646
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,298
thing if you're starting out get

647
00:21:55,589 --> 00:21:59,490
yourself an A and a B maybe a bloom

648
00:21:57,298 --> 00:22:01,558
booster and then maybe like some sugary

649
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,058
or something to sweeten it up but

650
00:22:01,558 --> 00:22:04,740
definitely get away from that Miracle

651
00:22:03,058 --> 00:22:07,200
Grow stuff go to the hydro shop get

652
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,230
something designed more toward cannabis

653
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,819
something that you can control for each

654
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,319
cycle of your plants cuz you're not

655
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:15,388
gonna want the same nutrients from

656
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:17,038
beginning to end you want a little bit

657
00:22:15,388 --> 00:22:18,719
of grow in the beginning you're gonna

658
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,220
taper the grow off as you get into

659
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,558
flower and you'll start using the bloom

660
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,569
solution so bill gets something that's

661
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,119
more designed for the plants that you

662
00:22:24,569 --> 00:22:28,109
are growing Bobby I hope that helps you

663
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,298
out you guys that are thinking about

664
00:22:28,109 --> 00:22:31,619
Miracle Grow soil I hope I got you away

665
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:34,740
from that also here's something to think

666
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:38,009
about you guys Miracle Grow products are

667
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,349
all from Scots and Scots is a Monsanto

668
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:42,480
brand and we do not want to support

669
00:22:40,349 --> 00:22:44,668
Monsanto because Monsanto does not

670
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,929
support the world so that's something to

671
00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:47,788
think about think about where the

672
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:49,740
products you're buying are made and who

673
00:22:47,788 --> 00:22:52,888
they affect and the impact that you will

674
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:54,000
have on the world all right you guys I

675
00:22:52,888 --> 00:22:55,408
think that was enough questions for one

676
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,359
episode I really want to thank everybody

699
