9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:26,278
I'm smoking on today I've been taking

10
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,129
dad's of banana OG ambrosia from

11
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:34,170
apothecary farms on the label it says it

12
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:36,390
is 83.2% THC and a total of 97 percent

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,760
total cannabinoids I've really enjoyed

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,579
the banana OG and it's kind of a change

15
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,320
from what I usually buy I usually like a

16
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,628
concentrate that makes my head spin

17
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,329
makes my eyes vibrate makes it hard to

18
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:49,769
think the banana OG is kind of more of a

19
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:51,689
mellow thing it's got me kind of chilled

20
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,710
out it's kind of slow motion it's got my

21
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,210
eyes nice and heavy

22
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,939
it's got my shoulders nice and chilled

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,609
out and I really dig the flavor of the

24
00:00:56,939 --> 00:01:01,108
banana og so that's what I'm dabbing on

25
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,879
today I hope you guys are taking dabs of

26
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,379
something delicious I'm not sure if you

27
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,000
can tell but I still have a little bit

28
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:07,799
of that head cold hanging around I'm

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,329
trying to get rid of that I'm not gonna

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,210
let it slow me down I am going to

31
00:01:09,329 --> 00:01:13,950
deliver a quality podcast and this

32
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,048
episode I plan to bring you another grow

33
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,519
lesson before we get to the grow lesson

34
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,460
I've got a couple of quick things to

35
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:22,228

38
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,978
comm we are currently doing some updates

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,329
during the process of updating the

40
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,299
website something went completely

41
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:35,879
freakin wrong and the podcast does not

42
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,380
work from the website anymore all of the

43
00:01:35,879 --> 00:01:39,539
episodes that were up before the update

44
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,339
are still accessible none of the new

45
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:44,159
things I add to the website are posting

46
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:46,140
to the RSS feed my web guy is working on

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,759
it it is the holiday weekend so he has

48
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,109
taken a few days off but I'm sure he

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,478
will get back on it as soon as the

50
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:53,849
weekend is over my point is I know the

51
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,950
website is messed up and I apologize for

52
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:58,319
not having the episodes out on iTunes

53
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,000

54
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,309
was just recently bragging about not

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,959
missing a Monday in five years and now

56
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,640
here I am I've missed the least one

57
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:08,189
Monday it looks like I may potentially

58
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,889
miss two mondays in a row I do apologize

59
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:12,900
however the episodes are recorded and

60
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,529

61
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,150
have not

62
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,729

63
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,620
shows I'm just unable to post them to

64
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,689

88
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:17,430
how to become a patron you can do so by

89
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:19,409
going to www.hp.com slash grow from your

90
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,879
heart all the information you need will

91
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,189
be right there on the screen and again

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,859
thank you for all of the patreon support

93
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:27,959
all right podcast world I said earlier

94
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,320
this was going to be another grow lesson

95
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,180
so far in my series of grow lessons we

96
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:36,329
should have plants that are probably 12

97
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:38,370
to 14 maybe 16 or 18 inches tall they

98
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:40,920
are probably in three or five or maybe

99
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,750
seven gallon pots hopefully they are

100
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:44,969
nice and healthy they have got a fat

101
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,009
root system hopefully they're pest free

102
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,349
at this time hopefully you have it over

103
00:03:47,009 --> 00:03:50,849
or under fertilize them we've talked a

104
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,560
lot about the proper environment and

105
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:54,299
conditions and feeding for these plants

106
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,370
so I think we know how to take care of

107
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:59,370
them by now let's talk about a few ways

108
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:03,150
to improve our productivity and the

109
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,129
vigor of our large veg plants now none

110
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,349
of this stuff is required none of this

111
00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:09,449
stuff is mandatory these are the little

112
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:12,750
tips and tricks and bonus things that I

113
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:15,119
do to boost productivity and boost vigor

114
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:18,238
to kind of turbocharged the overall

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,548
performance of my garden one really easy

116
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,918
thing I like to do to all of my plants

117
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:24,689
to increase performance is just clean

118
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,788
off the crap on the bottoms of the

119
00:04:24,689 --> 00:04:27,329
plants you've got a stalk coming out of

120
00:04:26,788 --> 00:04:28,560
the dirt

121
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:30,209
and then you've got a few crappy

122
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
branches coming off the bottom and then

123
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:33,359
the next couple of branches will be more

124
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,120
substantial and then you'll have some

125
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,218
solid branches if those very bottom

126
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,990
branches are crappy don't be afraid to

127
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:42,089
remove them if you feel like they are a

128
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:43,829
waste of growth on the plant feel free

129
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:46,348
to take them off we are going to

130
00:04:43,829 --> 00:04:48,779
lollipop heavily once we go into flower

131
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:51,000
so don't be afraid to move some of the

132
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:53,098
crappy bottom branches if it's a long

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,500
healthy branch that has the potential to

134
00:04:53,098 --> 00:04:57,870
reach the canopy level you can leave it

135
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,490
but if it's ugly if it's droopy if it's

136
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,959
sucking up energy and not going to

137
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,360
produce anything that would be

138
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,519
worthwhile feel free to take it off then

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,139
that plant can focus its energy moving

140
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,299
up toward the top of the plant where we

141
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:11,699
want to build that lush canopy so feel

142
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,259
free to take crap off of the bottom so

143
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:14,879
now we've removed the crappy bottom

144
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:16,830
branches there are kind of a waste of

145
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,990
energy here is another thing we can do

146
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:20,728
to the bottom section of our plant to

147
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,019
improve the performance and move the

148
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:24,269
energy up toward the top

149
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:25,829
we've still got bottom branches because

150
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:28,859
we left some of those bottom branches on

151
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:31,500
the plant the inside bottom branching is

152
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:34,080
not going to receive much light so what

153
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,300
I like to do is find that branch and

154
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,758
just follow it up and remove any shoots

155
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,590
that I feel like are a waste of space so

156
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,968
you'll having a thick arm coming off and

157
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:43,948
then off of that you'll have like a

158
00:05:41,968 --> 00:05:46,199
little tiny sub arm coming off those are

159
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:47,699
the shoots those are on the bottom of

160
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,129
the plant those are a waste of space

161
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:52,710
those are gonna turn into buds we do not

162
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:55,319
want to trim that is gonna be fluffy lar

163
00:05:52,709 --> 00:05:57,689
fee useless little crap it is a trimmers

164
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:59,669
nightmare by removing that crap from the

165
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,620
bottom we direct the energy up toward

166
00:05:59,668 --> 00:06:03,750
the top we can make bigger top chunky

167
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:05,250
buds those are better for trimmers those

168
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,240
are better for the market those are

169
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:08,668
better for the consumer

170
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,379
everybody wants those big fat buds so

171
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:12,240
let's clean off that crap off the bottom

172
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,830
so you've got the main stock coming out

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,930
then you've got your bottom to your

174
00:06:13,829 --> 00:06:17,699
bottom four branches follow those

175
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,709
branches up and where you don't see any

176
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:21,180
light touching those little shoots feel

177
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:23,038
free to just pinch them or cut them

178
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,168
right off while you're cutting or

179
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,538
pinching or cleaning stuff off of plants

180
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:30,060
always keep this in mind you can go back

181
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:32,848
later and take more off but you cannot

182
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,769
glue the leaves and the shoots back onto

183
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:36,899
the plant so pay attention to what

184
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:38,758
you're doing but on that bottom section

185
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:41,029
just pull that crap in the inside right

186
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,250
off of there I go fairly hard on the

187
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:45,619
parts of the plants I plan on lolly

188
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,870
popping heavily early in flower anyway

189
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:49,939
so why not pull off a lot of that crap

190
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,870
now and send the energy up toward the

191
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,639
top of the plant

192
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,379
now while you're cleaning the bottoms of

193
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,839
the plants keep in mind that it may be

194
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:59,060
wise to take some clones before we put

195
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:01,849
these plants into flower what are you

196
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,920
going to grow next are you growing from

197
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:05,510
seed that you spent a lot of money on if

198
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:08,060
you paid a lot of money for those seeds

199
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,399
I definitely recommend you take a clone

200
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,689
off of each seedling and market we're

201
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,879
gonna talk about this in depth in a

202
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:16,310
future episode but if you've got a plant

203
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:19,430
from seed I recommend you take a clone

204
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,519
from it mark that plant plant a mark

205
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:24,110
your clone clone a go on down the line

206
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:26,359
with every seedling plant that you've

207
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,009
got then grow them out either grow out

208
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,350
the clone or grow out the original plant

209
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:32,480
and if you've got something amazing now

210
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,040
you have got a keeper clone of that to

211
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,170
keep around we're gonna talk about Fino

212
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,160
hunting we'll talk about mother plants

213
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:38,960
we're gonna talk about that sort of

214
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,610
stuff in a future episode but this is

215
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,349
something to think about while we are

216
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,879
cleaning the bottoms of our plants do

217
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,580
you want to use those two bottom

218
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:47,959
branches may make excellent clones some

219
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:50,269
of those chutes may have grown big

220
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:51,739
enough to turn into a clone keep that in

221
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:53,899
mind while you're cleaning up the

222
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,639
bottoms of your plants now let's talk

223
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:57,560
about another way to improve the

224
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,500
productivity of our plant and also a

225
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:02,509
great way to score a great clone from a

226
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,360
healthy plant and of course I'm talking

227
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:07,759
about topping topping our plant can

228
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,069
greatly improve the performance of our

229
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,860
plant if it is done at the appropriate

230
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:13,399
time and at the appropriate place in the

231
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,770
plant

232
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:17,989
now when I say appropriate time we can

233
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:19,699
do this at just about any point in veg

234
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,810
once the plant is large enough the

235
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,189
plants we are talking about are

236
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:24,620
certainly large enough if we are in

237
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:28,040
large veg this is prime time for topping

238
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:31,100
we have to top approximately 10 to 14

239
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:35,060
days before we enter the flowering phase

240
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:38,540
when we top a cannabis plant our mission

241
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:40,099
is to remove that top node out of the

242
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,269
plant that giant one that's sticking out

243
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,190
of the top making it look like a

244
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:46,250
Christmas tree we want to remove that

245
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:49,400
and our goal is to make the next set of

246
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:51,679
branches become two tops and that will

247
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,509
create competition within the branches

248
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:55,219
of the plant that will make all of the

249
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:58,309
branches try to reach up

250
00:08:55,220 --> 00:09:00,410
become the next top basically somebody

251
00:08:58,309 --> 00:09:02,958
killed the king and now all of those

252
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:04,938
next soldiers are trying to be the next

253
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,919
king the hormones in the plant will

254
00:09:04,938 --> 00:09:10,009
indicate we're missing a top somebody

255
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:12,438
needs to take over cannabis has a trait

256
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:15,409
that is called apical dominance it

257
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:17,599
really wants one dominant top when you

258
00:09:15,409 --> 00:09:19,610
remove that dominant top the rest of the

259
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,159
tops know there's an opportunity for

260
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:24,860
them to become that main top so you can

261
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,958
top the plants at various ages and at

262
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,519
various stages let's talk about the

263
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,619
process of doing it let me back up and

264
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,379
talk about doing it find that top branch

265
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,120
where it's too tall trace it down the

266
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,560
way I like to do it I kind of find a

267
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,120
spot where I'm thinking about cutting it

268
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,588
and I bend it over and I look at the

269
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,870
plant I say what would the plant look

270
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:43,519
like without that section is that too

271
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,009
much to cut off is that going to be

272
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,889
beneficial what is my goal in topping

273
00:09:46,009 --> 00:09:51,019
right now mainly my goal instead of

274
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,480
having one giant top I want to create

275
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:55,759
sort of a bush so that I can grow space

276
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,649
and not have one giant bud hitting the

277
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,959
light but instead I can have a four by

278
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:02,120
four section of a bunch of buds growing

279
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:04,308
in the light instead of just one by

280
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:06,860
taking out that main top you create that

281
00:10:04,308 --> 00:10:09,049
whole section into a bush so see which

282
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:11,389
one is gonna cut out and make the others

283
00:10:09,049 --> 00:10:13,308
look like a nice even canopy you will

284
00:10:11,389 --> 00:10:14,959
see it you'll get good at it it'll take

285
00:10:13,308 --> 00:10:17,719
a little bit of trial and error it'll

286
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,808
take some confidence it is also very

287
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,160
strain specific topping an OG Kush or

288
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:23,899
something like that can be a real [ __ ]

289
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,458
because the nodes are so far apart that

290
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,318
you just make it look like a Charlie

291
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:29,539
Brown Christmas tree but once it grows

292
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:32,149
out of that it is going to be amazing

293
00:10:29,539 --> 00:10:34,879
the more sativa dominant stuff if you

294
00:10:32,149 --> 00:10:37,220
top scarlet begonias if you top storm

295
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,500
shadow it makes a beautiful bush and

296
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:41,839
they go crazy so kind of grab the top

297
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,458
and follow work your way down with your

298
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,110
hand and just kind of look and see what

299
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:47,179
it would it look like if I took this off

300
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,068
and you'll come to a point you'll take

301
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:50,989
off one and you'll see two branches that

302
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:52,789
stick up evenly toward the top and the

303
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,680
two branches and underneath that almost

304
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:56,929
come right up to that top section as

305
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,638
well you'll have four nice new tops and

306
00:10:56,929 --> 00:11:00,109
you'll say that's what Rasta Jeff is

307
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,360
talking about I want to make these four

308
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,399
tops the tops then just cut that one out

309
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,620
and you'll see exactly what I've got

310
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,049
you're probably gonna screw up a couple

311
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,850
of plants that's how you learn stuff

312
00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:13,309
musicians have to [ __ ] up songs to learn

313
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,899
BMX racers have to fall on their face to

314
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:17,179
learn skateboarders get stitches and

315
00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:19,309
break bones to learn luckily we mess up

316
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:21,559
plants we can grow more plants

317
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:23,149
it doesn't hurt us that bad when we cut

318
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:24,768
up a plant the wrong way hopefully

319
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,078
you've got a couple more and you're

320
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:28,759
gonna learn the cost of cutting that one

321
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,620
plant from what you learn from it is

322
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,389
invaluable so get in there and just play

323
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,578
around with the scissors top some of

324
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:36,769
them bottom some of them up see what

325
00:11:34,578 --> 00:11:39,679
they do finish them that way you have

326
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:42,589
some data now keep in mind that data is

327
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:44,539
very strain specific like I said earlier

328
00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:45,860
if you're topping an OG Kush plant

329
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:47,659
you're gonna have totally different

330
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:49,310
results than if you're topping something

331
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:51,708
like a haze or a more sativa dominant

332
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:53,328
like a golden goat kind of a thing the

333
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:55,909
growth structure is just naturally

334
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:58,099
different in those plants now when

335
00:11:55,909 --> 00:11:59,389
you're topping your plant do it at the

336
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,940
intersection where it's going to

337
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:04,639
encourage that plant the most expansive

338
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,899
growth so if you've got two branches cut

339
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,519
you've got the main stock coming up

340
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:09,078
you've got a branch coming out and then

341
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,419
maybe an inch up you've got a branch

342
00:12:09,078 --> 00:12:13,039
coming out cut right above that top

343
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:15,409
branch you don't need to leave anything

344
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:17,240
hanging off or anything extra cut it

345
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:19,730
right at the intersection where you want

346
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,889
to encourage the spread you basically

347
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,990
want to take an upside down peace sign

348
00:12:21,889 --> 00:12:26,509
and you want to turn it into a Wye and

349
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:28,549
those new tops of the Y are going to be

350
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:30,500
the new two tops of the plant and then

351
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:32,509
the next two branches hopefully they'll

352
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,028
catch up now that puts me back to why I

353
00:12:32,509 --> 00:12:37,879
said we want to do this at least 10 to

354
00:12:35,028 --> 00:12:39,828
14 days before we go into flower or much

355
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:42,439
sooner than that if it's an opportunity

356
00:12:39,828 --> 00:12:44,269
when we make that cut we've just cut out

357
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,190
the king like I said earlier we need

358
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,500
time for those hormones to move around

359
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,720
into the plant and that helps us when we

360
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:53,509
go into flower we get much larger bud

361
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,459
sets if you if you flower too soon after

362
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,139
topping your plants just create little

363
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:59,149
popcorn buds the hormones haven't moved

364
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:01,009
around they're not exactly sure what to

365
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,929
do they're not sure where the top should

366
00:13:01,009 --> 00:13:05,179
go so you just get a bunch of little

367
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:06,979
popcorns so give the plant plenty of

368
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:08,750
time to recover plenty of time to move

369
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,519
the hormones and plenty of time for it

370
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:13,339
to decide where the tops are going to be

371
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:15,769
after topping and before moving your

372
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,390
plants into flower earlier I mentioned

373
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:20,179
that this would be a good opportunity

374
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:22,699
for a clone that top you just cut off

375
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:25,250
should be the most robust Hardy

376
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:28,160
part of your plan that will make a great

377
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:30,740
candidate for a clone so why not snag

378
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,779
that up now you've got a big fat healthy

379
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,700
clone for the next crop while you're

380
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:37,069
increasing the productivity of the

381
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,590
current crop alright so we've covered

382
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:41,600
two great ways to increase the vigor and

383
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,730
productivity of our plants we've figured

384
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,620
out how to properly move the energy to

385
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,659
the part of the plant we want to grow

386
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:49,429
you can move it up to the top by taking

387
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:51,230
stuff off the bottom you can spread it

388
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:54,199
out by completely eliminating the top

389
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,050
and that process we've also created the

390
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,400
opportunity to create clones now let's

391
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:00,979
talk about another great technique that

392
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,779
I use in a personal garden I use this in

393
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,700
a breeding program I use this in a large

394
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:06,949
commercial grow this is something I

395
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,320
implement in almost any grow I get to

396
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,600
play in I call it the pop and twist

397
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,300
technique you may also know it as super

398
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,310
cropping it has got a lot of names it is

399
00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:18,919
the same thing no matter what we call it

400
00:14:16,309 --> 00:14:20,449
I like to pop the stems of the plant I

401
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,250
like to kind of pop their knuckles I

402
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,570
don't know if you could hear that on the

403
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:25,669
microphone I tried to get it in there

404
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:27,950
that's basically the sound I'm looking

405
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:30,169
for once the plants are a little bit

406
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:32,660
thicker than a pen or a pencil maybe a

407
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:34,250
sharpie I like to grab them right where

408
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:36,679
they come out of the dirt I grab the

409
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:38,120
stock kind of firmly with one hand then

410
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:40,849
I grab it with another hand right above

411
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,350
it and I twist my top hand I don't twist

412
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,940
that hand that's coming out of the dirt

413
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,550
I don't want to twist that dirt I twist

414
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,130
the top hand to her I break the

415
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:50,539
cellulose of the plant break that outer

416
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:52,519
structure toward you hear it pop a

417
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:54,559
little bit it'll go crunch just like my

418
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:56,240
knuckle did and it'll make a little pop

419
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,549
sound and you'll feel it and you'll be

420
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,470
freaked out the first time it's okay

421
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:02,990
don't freak out you're doing exactly

422
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:05,480
what I recommend this will increase

423
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:07,700
vigor and productivity in a couple of

424
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,649
ways this will be beneficial in a couple

425
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:11,060
of ways let's talk about that real quick

426
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:13,459
and we'll talk more about how to do this

427
00:15:11,059 --> 00:15:14,750
throughout the entire plant the first

428
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,340
thing you'll notice when you're popping

429
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,200
the knuckles on these plants is they

430
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:20,540
will start to make little knuckles on

431
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,020
the branches I feel like these make the

432
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:25,699
plants more stout more robust so that

433
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:28,699
when they start to grow buds those

434
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,470
branches can hold up bigger buds bigger

435
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,780
branches bigger buds right that makes

436
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,759
sense you want more support bigger legs

437
00:15:32,779 --> 00:15:37,110
you can lift more right you're stronger

438
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,850
if that mad sad I'm not kind of a

439
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,050
weightlifter guy but if you got more you

440
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,639
can lift more right so you want

441
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:44,399
something able to support bigger buds

442
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,860
also those bigger stems can probably

443
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,809
feed those bigger flowers better so

444
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,820
you've got more movement another way

445
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:53,459
this is beneficial is it will slow down

446
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:55,950
the vertical growth of the plants they

447
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:57,540
won't get so tall so quickly because

448
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:59,700
they will be spending a little bit of

449
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:02,459
their energy on getting fatter and more

450
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:05,070
robust they'll be short and stocky which

451
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:07,200
is way beneficial to almost any grower

452
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:09,750
where most of us are limited by height

453
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,820
in a home grow in a commercial grow in a

454
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:13,919
giant warehouse grow most of us are

455
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:15,870
still limited by height so having this

456
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,000
one tip to control the height of our

457
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,549
plants just a little bit can be very

458
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,470
advantageous later on we're gonna talk

459
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:24,120
about trellising if you can use cracking

460
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,950
and trellising together you can really

461
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,320
control the height of your plants and

462
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:30,270
you can really maximize productivity so

463
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,500
those are a few reasons why I like to

464
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,600
crack the stems now let's talk a little

465
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,460
bit more about actually doing it now

466
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,889
that I've given you a good reason why to

467
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:39,960
do this like I said I grab the stick

468
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:42,000
with one hand I grabbed the stick with

469
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:44,160
another and I just twist opposite

470
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,190
directions and you'll hear it it will go

471
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,259
pop and crunch then just move up I start

472
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:52,800
with the main stalk of the plant and I

473
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,600
work my way almost almost 90 percent up

474
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,549
the way of the plant as long as I can

475
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,990
feel it's still crunching as long as I'm

476
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:59,519
not feeling like I'm about to rip the

477
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,250
top off the plant when I give it a twist

478
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,078
I'll work my way right up then I go to

479
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,088
the bottom branch and work my way right

480
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,619
up the bottom branch then the next

481
00:17:06,088 --> 00:17:09,539
branch and give it a crack

482
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,889
I'll give it a crack I'm looking at the

483
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:12,420
microphone stand here trying to think

484
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,720
about the distance of cracks I go one

485
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:17,400
and then it's only four to six inches

486
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,350
apart depending on the size of the plant

487
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:21,030
I will crack it maybe if it's a tiny

488
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:22,439
plant if they're short and squat I would

489
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:24,359
go every three inches if I feel like

490
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,920
that plant could take it most of them

491
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:28,229
will take it about every four to six

492
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,970
inches without any problems give it a

493
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,890
little crack move up give it a little

494
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:34,049
crack move up give it a little crack

495
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:35,640
just do that to every plant in the

496
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:37,740
garden it will slow down their growth

497
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,350
it'll make them more robust they'll be

498
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,660
more vigorous and you can continue to do

499
00:17:40,349 --> 00:17:44,819
this all the way into about week three

500
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:47,279
of flower so if you start it early and

501
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:49,439
veg you can get a good cracking in there

502
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,148
give them about seven maybe ten days

503
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,519
you'll up go back give them another good

504
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:54,898
crack throw them into flour as they get

505
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,298
bigger they will recover more quickly

506
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:58,528
from being busted on so go in there and

507
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:00,058
give them a good crack on day one a

508
00:17:58,528 --> 00:18:02,009
flower right at the start of the

509
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:03,928
flowering cycle slow down that stretch a

510
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:06,778
little bit and then think about it this

511
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,320
way if you crack spot one and then spot

512
00:18:06,778 --> 00:18:09,359
two

513
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:11,220
there's a spot in the middle of that

514
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,019
that you can crack next time so you can

515
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,339
go back in a week and even if they

516
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:16,019
haven't healed up from all of their

517
00:18:14,339 --> 00:18:18,000
cracking you can crack those middle

518
00:18:16,019 --> 00:18:20,220
spots and make even another little

519
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,319
knuckle another little knurled spot on

520
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:23,970
your plants don't be afraid to get in

521
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,710
there and do some work on them and bust

522
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:28,679
them up a little bit they will recover

523
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,808
and they will really show progress from

524
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:32,220
this I know I probably sound like I'm

525
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:33,628
crazy because for the past ten minutes

526
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,579
I've been telling you to cut stuff off

527
00:18:33,628 --> 00:18:36,928
of your plants and break them and bend

528
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:39,509
them and that's going to increase

529
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:42,269
productivity but how do you get stronger

530
00:18:39,509 --> 00:18:43,620
through stress through proper training

531
00:18:42,269 --> 00:18:44,909
and that's what we're gonna do to these

532
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,500
plants we're gonna tell them what we

533
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:48,179
want from them and we're gonna show them

534
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,028
what we expect and they're gonna give it

535
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:52,409
to us with the proper guidance

536
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:55,048
speaking of guidance let's work our way

537
00:18:52,409 --> 00:18:57,210
into talking about canopy control

538
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:59,069
earlier I mentioned that our plants are

539
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,370
apical dominant meaning they want to

540
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:04,288
grow straight up unfortunately for us as

541
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:05,579
growers it does not benefit us for the

542
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:08,308
plants to grow straight up

543
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,199
we need to fill horizontal space we need

544
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:12,119
to spread them out a little bit we have

545
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,730
several options for encouraging our

546
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:16,859
plants to spread out our earlier work of

547
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,419
topping them was a great start but we

548
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:21,449
can go much further than that

549
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,850
a very easy affordable and effective way

550
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,190
to spread out our plants a little bit is

551
00:19:23,849 --> 00:19:28,288
by using sticks you can get bamboo

552
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,048
sticks at the local gross store for very

553
00:19:28,288 --> 00:19:33,450
cheap I like to put about four sticks

554
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:35,220
per pot and I like to put them toward

555
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,870
the outer edge of the pot don't go too

556
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,399
far in because you've got a lot of root

557
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:40,109
development there you don't want to go

558
00:19:38,398 --> 00:19:41,939
shoving a bamboo stick right through a

559
00:19:40,109 --> 00:19:44,038
bunch of roots so go out toward the edge

560
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,409
of the pot put the stick in there if

561
00:19:44,038 --> 00:19:48,480
your plants are gonna grow six feet tall

562
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:50,190
get a six-foot stick if your plants are

563
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,349
only gonna grow three feet tall get a

564
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,820
three-foot stick you don't want a stick

565
00:19:52,349 --> 00:19:56,128
too big to where you can't lower the

566
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,230
light close enough to the canopy so get

567
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,878
the appropriate size stick put three or

568
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,349
four five or six of them in the pot

569
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:03,179
depending on how many giant floppy

570
00:20:01,349 --> 00:20:05,189
branches branches you've got

571
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,900
then you can just pull those big

572
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:08,820
branches down just a little bit and

573
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,200
attach them to the sticks now instead of

574
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:11,759
just having them going straight up

575
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,799
you've kind of pulled them down a little

576
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,480
bit now they're probably one or two

577
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:17,279
maybe three inches shorter depending on

578
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,319
how far you pull them down pull them

579
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,639
down and a fix him to those sticks now

580
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:22,379
you're doing a couple of things you're

581
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,930
making the plant overall shorter and

582
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,550
you're also widening the plant up to let

583
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,570
some light get into that inner part of

584
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:29,099
the plant so where you don't have to

585
00:20:27,569 --> 00:20:30,659
clean off as much of that crap in the

586
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:31,949
inside more of the light can penetrate

587
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,290
in there and you will get more

588
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,740
production from the inside part of the

589
00:20:34,289 --> 00:20:36,539
plant

590
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,250
now these sticks will also work for

591
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:40,379
another purpose when those buds start to

592
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:42,450
develop and get fat and big those sticks

593
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,160
will support your buds you're going to

594
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:46,049
need something to hold up the big buds

595
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,150
so now is the time to think about it

596
00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:50,069
let's work that into our canopy control

597
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:52,650
and also our plan for supporting our

598
00:20:50,069 --> 00:20:54,419
buds so sticks is the easiest most

599
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:56,490
affordable option if you've got a small

600
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,470
grow if you've got a home grow sticks

601
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,019
are probably the most economical if

602
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:03,509
you've got several plants a bunch of

603
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,160
sticks can become a pain in the ass in a

604
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:07,079
commercial environment I wouldn't even

605
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,400
mess with sticks in a commercial

606
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,710
environment you may want to start

607
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,269
working with tomato cages you need to

608
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:15,269
get the tomato cages on the plants

609
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:17,369
before they get too big I usually like a

610
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:19,769
tomato cage with about a 16 inch top

611
00:21:17,369 --> 00:21:21,959
sometimes I will cut the very bottom

612
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:23,430
ring off of the tomato cage right flip

613
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,200
it upside down right where that bottom

614
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,640
ring is cut it off you've just made her

615
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,799
a little bit shorter but it's also a

616
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,980
little bit wider you can customize them

617
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,139
for your situation so slide the tomato

618
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:36,210
cage over the plant spread the plant out

619
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:38,580
nice and wide let it spread as wide as

620
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,200
it will go encourage it to spread out if

621
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,399
you need to pull some of the branches

622
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,470
out of the cage

623
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,390
pull it out of the cage and as it grows

624
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:47,430
it'll work itself up and when it gets

625
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,800
real tall put the branch back into the

626
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,870
cage or use those runners up the side

627
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:54,240
the side supports and you can always a

628
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:58,019
fix the branches to those side supports

629
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,880
by using a bread tie or a twisty tie or

630
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:01,379
some sort of garden supply twist tie

631
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,300
there are thousands of options for that

632
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:04,440
get creative I've used a bunch of

633
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,450
different things we don't need to be too

634
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,370
specific I use zip ties in most cases

635
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:10,140
but don't go too tight so if you got

636
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:11,789
your tomato cage on your plant the

637
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,530
branches are falling out and gaining

638
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:14,579
support from the outer perimeter of the

639
00:22:13,529 --> 00:22:16,079
tomato cage

640
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:16,678
maybe you've worked some of the branches

641
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:18,720
up the side

642
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,340
that tomato cage maybe you pulled some

643
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,220
of the branches down and spread them out

644
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:25,618
by using those outer rings of the tomato

645
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:27,659
cage the tomato cage gives us a lot of

646
00:22:25,618 --> 00:22:29,668
creative options for controlling the

647
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:32,879
canopy of our plant while at the same

648
00:22:29,669 --> 00:22:35,940
time providing support for our tall

649
00:22:32,878 --> 00:22:37,888
heavy buds now if you're using a tomato

650
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:39,419
cage and you did not top your plant

651
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:41,339
which is just fine that is always an

652
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,139
option you do not have to top the plants

653
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:45,058
a lot of people like that one big glory

654
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:46,949
but at the top if you're going for that

655
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:50,069
glory bud and you were using a tomato

656
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:52,769
cage you still may need a stick to

657
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:55,470
support that giant bud if you grow a big

658
00:22:52,769 --> 00:22:57,149
fat top so don't be afraid to make them

659
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:58,200
work together you can have a tomato cage

660
00:22:57,148 --> 00:22:59,969
with a stick

661
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,740
holding up that giant bud in the middle

662
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,899
again if you're gonna put a stick in a

663
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,429
giant pot I would kind of recommend

664
00:23:03,898 --> 00:23:07,048
putting it toward the outer edge and

665
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:08,820
then angling it toward the center if you

666
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:11,368
need support in the center I don't like

667
00:23:08,819 --> 00:23:13,109
to Ram a bamboo stake right into the

668
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:14,428
root zone that just feels rude to me if

669
00:23:13,109 --> 00:23:15,928
you want it to be right in the middle

670
00:23:14,429 --> 00:23:17,820
because you've got some kind of OCD or

671
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,830
that's where you need to do it you can

672
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:21,480
do it but just you'll feel it when you

673
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:24,418
go through those roots and it won't feel

674
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,639
right so those are two very effective

675
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,590
methods of controlling your canopy and

676
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:30,748
also supporting the large branches and

677
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:32,490
being prepared for having large buds I

678
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:34,230
know I kind of glazed over those two

679
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:36,569
methods those are things you're going to

680
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,009
have to perfect and work on it's going

681
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:39,808
to be things you have to put your hands

682
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:41,399
on to learn how to do it it's kind of an

683
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:42,480
art there will be things that you learn

684
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:44,729
when you're doing it it will work

685
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,038
perfectly for your situation it would

686
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,538
not work for the next guy the sticks are

687
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:50,490
really easy because you can just stick

688
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:51,868
as many sticks into a pot as you need I

689
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:54,329
mean I've seen people go completely

690
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:55,918
excessive try not to be too crazy but

691
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:57,538
you can stick as many sticks into a pot

692
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,909
of soil as you need to support as many

693
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:02,579
branches branches as you need and you

694
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:04,409
can use fuzzy sticks or bread ties or

695
00:24:02,579 --> 00:24:06,898
zip ties whatever you need to fix those

696
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:08,909
branches to those sticks however you

697
00:24:06,898 --> 00:24:10,528
need it's a little harder to lower the

698
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:12,269
canopy that way but you can get big

699
00:24:10,528 --> 00:24:15,148
branch support that way really easily

700
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:17,069
the tomato cages you can use the zip

701
00:24:15,148 --> 00:24:19,229
ties or the twisty ties and you have got

702
00:24:17,069 --> 00:24:21,210
round circles to work with you can use

703
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,069
those to keep the plants down you can

704
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:25,740
bend the branches underneath the rings

705
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:28,108
of the tomato cage or you can use those

706
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,819
to support the big buds you've got a lot

707
00:24:28,108 --> 00:24:30,299
of options there to work with but you're

708
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,829
gonna have to

709
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:33,690
play with it to figure it out I can walk

710
00:24:31,829 --> 00:24:35,970
you so far through it but it's going to

711
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,650
be strain dependent situational

712
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:39,180
dependent but those are very versatile

713
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:41,759
tools to work with and I'm sure you'll

714
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,320
find some use now let me quit rambling

715
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,990
and talk about one of my favorite

716
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:49,230
methods of canopy control which is using

717
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:52,740
trellis netting also known as scrog

718
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:54,420
netting and of course scrog SC ROG just

719
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,000
means screen of green we're using a

720
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:00,029
screen to create a nice green canopy

721
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:03,480
let's talk about creating a screen of

722
00:25:00,029 --> 00:25:05,639
green the number one most common mistake

723
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,009
I see people make when they are setting

724
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,320
up their screen or their trellis netting

725
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:12,720
for their screen of green or for their

726
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:16,439
canopy control as they put the netting

727
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,509
way too loose it needs to be tighter you

728
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:20,009
want that stuff really tight you want it

729
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:21,690
almost scary tight you want a lotta

730
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:23,759
tension on there you don't want those

731
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,529
squares you don't want the net to move

732
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:27,599
at all you want those squares to stay

733
00:25:25,529 --> 00:25:29,940
right in place because that is what is

734
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,859
going to control the shape of your plant

735
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,620
if those things move the plant moves I

736
00:25:31,859 --> 00:25:36,719
like them tight nice and firm like a

737
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:37,889
guitar string so let's talk more about

738
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,019
the netting now that I've already

739
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:42,270
pointed out the number one mistake let's

740
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:43,950
say we're setting up a net in a five by

741
00:25:42,269 --> 00:25:45,299
five 10 it's really easy to set them up

742
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:47,370
in a tent they've already got the poles

743
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:49,349
if you don't have poles or something to

744
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:51,299
fix it to you're going to need to design

745
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:53,279
some sort of system you can attach it to

746
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,440
the wall a lot of people will get a

747
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,660
five-gallon bucket from Lowe's or Home

748
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,549
Depot they will fill it up with quikrete

749
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,160
and then they will stick a six-foot tall

750
00:25:59,549 --> 00:26:04,980
PVC pole into their sticking straight up

751
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,540
now you've got a nice vertical pole that

752
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,309
you can work with to attach your net to

753
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:10,200
and that will hold a lot of weight you

754
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,669
can probably get it tight enough with

755
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,289
that five-gallon bucket filled with

756
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:15,120
cement that'll be enough weight to be

757
00:26:13,289 --> 00:26:17,579
able to pull those screens super tight

758
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,259
so get yourself four buckets fill them

759
00:26:17,579 --> 00:26:21,149
up with the quikrete put a six-foot pole

760
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:23,160
in each one now you make a little square

761
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,650
now you can make just about any type of

762
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:26,610
length or width of shape you need to put

763
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,530
your trellis netting

764
00:26:26,609 --> 00:26:31,109
I think they sell it in five by five

765
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:32,730
squares five by ten squares if you want

766
00:26:31,109 --> 00:26:36,119
to go commercial grade you can get it in

767
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,440
much larger segments sections whatever

768
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:39,209
the word you want to use right there

769
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,670
you can get it in a commercial

770
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:44,249
environment I recommend the six-foot

771
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:47,249
wide commercial greenhouse table

772
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:49,769
I have found a six-foot wide roll of

773
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:51,989
plastic trellis netting that works

774
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:54,839
beautifully for that application at a

775
00:26:51,989 --> 00:26:58,200
six feet wide and it is I think 75 or

776
00:26:54,839 --> 00:27:00,509
120 feet long and it is one roll so you

777
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,220
just put it up on top of the trellis you

778
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:04,019
got one guy on one side one guy on the

779
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,450
other and it's on a roll so you just

780
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:07,979
walk and it you zip tie one end of it

781
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,509
down one end of it down and you walk the

782
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:11,009
length you need to be the zip tie the

783
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:13,079
other end zip tie the other end and he

784
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:14,249
cut it off and now the trellis net is up

785
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,778
you of course you got to go back through

786
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:17,819
and tighten it by using more zip ties

787
00:27:15,778 --> 00:27:19,138
but that's almost kind of fun once

788
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,200
you've got it put up that easily

789
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:24,028
so the long rolls are amazing they get a

790
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,700
little bit heavy but if you've got two

791
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:29,038
big dudes I'm 6-5 my buddy Brian he was

792
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,139
6 foot something we just grabbed it lift

793
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:33,089
it just above plant height walk right

794
00:27:31,138 --> 00:27:35,098
down the rows stretch out a long enough

795
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:36,898
piece to cover that whole row zip tie it

796
00:27:35,098 --> 00:27:38,339
at the end and cut our section off we'd

797
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:39,658
have another guy following behind us and

798
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,249
he would put the zip ties in place to

799
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:43,049
keep it real tight and it would take us

800
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:45,028
just a few minutes to get each row done

801
00:27:43,048 --> 00:27:45,960
so you've got to start by spreading out

802
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:47,700
your trellis netting

803
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,739
that's always fun if it comes folded up

804
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:51,899
in that little baggie it is such a [ __ ]

805
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,369
to get that undone good luck you look

806
00:27:51,898 --> 00:27:54,839
like Spiderman attacked you in [ __ ]

807
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:56,728
one you're gonna be there for a few

808
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,738
minutes getting that unfolded the bigger

809
00:27:56,729 --> 00:28:00,598
the net the longer it takes don't get

810
00:27:58,739 --> 00:28:01,858
frustrated go smoke a dab and then oh

811
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:03,148
you know what don't smoke it dad because

812
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:05,220
when you get all stone and you're trying

813
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:07,018
to look at that netting that [ __ ]

00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,700
doesn't work for your face so just

815
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,528
unfold that and then once we get it put

816
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,848
up we'll go take some tabs so unfold the

817
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:13,558
trellis netting the best you can it's

818
00:28:11,848 --> 00:28:14,819
gonna take you a few minutes get it put

819
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,229
up on whatever poles you've got

820
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:19,229
available I said we're gonna work in a

821
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:21,989
5x5 ten hopefully you bought a 5x5

822
00:28:19,229 --> 00:28:24,210
section of netting it may be too big you

823
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:25,919
may need to go in a square you may not

824
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:28,229
need to use that outer square you may

825
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,659
need to go one or two squares into that

826
00:28:28,229 --> 00:28:32,489
grid to make it fit tight enough you

827
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:34,409
don't have to necessarily use every

828
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:36,389
square of that netting we want it tight

829
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:38,519
more than we want the amount of squares

830
00:28:36,388 --> 00:28:40,469
so get that net up there tight use a

831
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:41,940
bunch of zip ties go excessive if you

832
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,848
need it too we want that thing fairly

833
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:46,950
tight then lower it down onto the plant

834
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:49,019
canopy you'll watch the plants kind of

835
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:50,369
Bend you want to just keep going just

836
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:52,288
kind of bend them down just a little bit

837
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:53,908
not too far maybe like three or four

838
00:28:52,288 --> 00:28:55,230
inches they'll Bend they'll be okay if

839
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:57,119
you see something that's about to crack

840
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:57,960
of course grab it and give it a hand the

841
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:59,730
idea here is to

842
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,259
actually lower the height of all of the

843
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,210
plants and we were going to use that net

844
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:04,890
to control the height of the plants

845
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:07,380
don't worry because we're gonna go back

846
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:09,690
and manually adjust each branch by hand

847
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:11,070
and work it into this net correctly but

848
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,259
right now we just kind of want to lower

849
00:29:11,069 --> 00:29:15,990
it down and watch that canopy just

850
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:18,028
become even now you can see how this

851
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:20,940
works we have instead of one giant bud

852
00:29:18,028 --> 00:29:22,769
here one long branch here one giant but

853
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,720
on a long branch over here now we've got

854
00:29:22,769 --> 00:29:28,048
a nice even space to work with we want

855
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,298
to fill all that five by five net with a

856
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:32,460
bunch of small bud sites that will

857
00:29:30,298 --> 00:29:34,440
actually turn into more productivity

858
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,360
than one giant bud here

859
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,679
one giant bud here that are trying to

860
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,089
touch the light we're fighting those

861
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,620
from getting too hot getting burnt

862
00:29:39,089 --> 00:29:41,819
getting crispy and then we've got a

863
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:43,528
bunch of buds down here that aren't

864
00:29:41,819 --> 00:29:46,439
getting enough light instead we've got a

865
00:29:43,528 --> 00:29:48,750
nice five by five screen of green of

866
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,278
just beautiful even buds so let's talk

867
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,940
about how to work these branches into

868
00:29:50,278 --> 00:29:55,440
this net to create this desired canopy

869
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:58,500
working a section of plants into a

870
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,870
trellis net is a bit of an art and it

871
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:03,298
will take some experience to perfect it

872
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:04,918
think of it sort of like weaving we want

873
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:07,528
to weave these plants that want to go

874
00:30:04,919 --> 00:30:10,470
vertical we want to weave them into the

875
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:13,048
net to encourage them to go horizontally

876
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:14,640
now almost no matter what we do to these

877
00:30:13,048 --> 00:30:16,769
plants other than kill them they're

878
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,020
going to try to grow up because earlier

879
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:21,629
we spoke of that hormone that gives them

880
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:24,450
apical dominance so we are going to need

881
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:27,419
to stay on top of canopy control in this

882
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,149
trellis system the idea is to fill each

883
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:32,429
square of that trellis net with a branch

884
00:30:30,148 --> 00:30:34,979
that will develop into a substantial bud

885
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,840
site the way to start that process is to

886
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,329
train these plants to spread wide

887
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,970
instead of tall so we use this first

888
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:44,308
layer of netting to actually spread the

889
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:46,380
plants out now what we have to do as the

890
00:30:44,308 --> 00:30:48,148
plants grow is they will try to pop up

891
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:50,250
out of the net we need to go in there

892
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:52,259
everyday and grab those branches that

893
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,599
tried to get away I just push them back

894
00:30:52,259 --> 00:30:55,980
under that next piece of net so as soon

895
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:57,629
as they're long enough to go under net

896
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:59,278
underneath the next section just weave

897
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:00,960
them right underneath there and what

898
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,419
will happen is you will develop long

899
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,700
arms that fill up the entire space and

900
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:07,770
when we flip it to flower all of those

901
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,019
branches will develop bud sites that

902
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:11,970
will fill up each square of that trellis

903
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:13,889
netting now instead of having

904
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,329
plants that just grow big giant buds and

905
00:31:13,890 --> 00:31:16,920
grow up into the light and are really

906
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:19,470
good for pictures we are actually

907
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:23,130
producing a large crop by utilizing the

908
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:24,809
entire 5x5 canopy space now this will

909
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:25,770
take some practice to figure out exactly

910
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:27,839
what I'm saying

911
00:31:25,769 --> 00:31:30,299
some of you are going to try to force

912
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,369
those plants down too much somebody that

913
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,559
taught me a lot of tips on trellis work

914
00:31:32,369 --> 00:31:36,569
will tell you give it a [ __ ] chance

915
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:38,700
you've got to give it somewhere to grow

916
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:41,429
up and win the tips of the branches like

917
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,170
to go up give them a chance to win but

918
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:45,299
don't be scared to get in there and bend

919
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:48,330
them down now something that is hard to

920
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:50,549
convey through just audio without any

921
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:53,159
sort of visual is you may think that to

922
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:54,990
get this branch the tip of this branch

923
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:57,360
under this net that you may need to bend

924
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,460
it at wrist height I'm showing myself

925
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,259
I'm comparing the microphone stand to my

926
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,850
wrist the microphone stand is horizontal

927
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:05,279
my wrist is growing up like a plant

928
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:08,039
I want to tuck this my wrist underneath

929
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:09,990
this piece of trellising instead of

930
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,519
grabbing at my wrist and bending there

931
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:13,980
and tucking that part under I would

932
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,900
actually go down to elbow height to my

933
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,549
elbow joint and pop it down there

934
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,170
and bend it underneath the trellis at

935
00:32:17,549 --> 00:32:21,059
that height that gives me a lot more

936
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:22,620
room for when that plant starts growing

937
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,569
vertically it's gonna grow out

938
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:25,889
horizontally because of gravity for a

939
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:27,539
little while the tip will start growing

940
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,790
up and it's gonna take it a little bit

941
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:32,579
longer to grow up out of that net again

942
00:32:29,789 --> 00:32:34,710
don't be afraid to crack it lower than

943
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:36,179
you think you need to is what I'm trying

944
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,100
to say hopefully that gave you enough

945
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:39,810
different explanations to try to catch

946
00:32:38,099 --> 00:32:41,579
on to what I'm saying but if you think

947
00:32:39,809 --> 00:32:43,529
you need to crack it here to get it

948
00:32:41,579 --> 00:32:44,939
underneath the net that's right here go

949
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:47,279
a little lower so you've got more

950
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:50,190
bending room to work with and you've

951
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,619
also got more room for future growth you

952
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:54,660
guys trellising and canopy work is an

953
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:57,419
art but when you get good at it it will

954
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:59,430
drastically improve productivity and

955
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,230
will also make the garden much easier to

956
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:03,390
work in because it's much more organized

957
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,890
and you don't have that one giant bud

958
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,720
that's trying to grow into the light

959
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:08,670
which is so photogenic and it's so

960
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,350
beautiful to have but it's also such a

961
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:12,690
pain in the ass because that's the one

962
00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:14,939
bud you are working your whole garden

963
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,350
setup around so you will learn how to

964
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:18,299
weave your plants into the snap

965
00:33:16,349 --> 00:33:20,189
perfectly you will adapt your own style

966
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:21,509
yo I'm sure you're going to the internet

967
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:23,460
to look at pictures of how to do it

968
00:33:21,509 --> 00:33:25,259
already you'll see a lot of great stuff

969
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,829
on there you will also see a lot of

970
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:28,140
trellis

971
00:33:25,829 --> 00:33:29,639
nets that were not filled sufficiently

972
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:31,980
before the plants were flipped into

973
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,450
flour fill that [ __ ] out it takes a

974
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,808
little bit of time it takes more work

975
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:39,390
but it is much more rewarding than just

976
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:41,009
growing that one glory bud so if you're

977
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,870
going to use the screen to spread them

978
00:33:41,009 --> 00:33:46,349
out make sure you fill up that canopy

979
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:48,418
before you flip now I also recommend a

980
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:50,579
second layer of trellis netting I

981
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:52,200
probably would put that one depending on

982
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:54,298
the power of your light depending on

983
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:56,370
your genetics I would probably put my

984
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:59,278
second net somewhere between six and

985
00:33:56,369 --> 00:34:01,739
twelve inches above that first net now

986
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,569
the bottom net will fill up you'll leave

987
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,700
it all in and it will get full now you

988
00:34:03,569 --> 00:34:08,250
want to let those branches start growing

989
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,079
up into that second net you want to fill

990
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,148
it up to where you've got one branch

991
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,608
coming out of each of those bottom

992
00:34:12,148 --> 00:34:16,319
squares and those will grow up into the

993
00:34:14,608 --> 00:34:18,449
top squares as soon as they hit the top

994
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,000
squares you want a flower now you've got

995
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:24,329
a nice six to twelve inch section of

996
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,570
just rows of buds just rows of branches

997
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:30,239
sticking straight up I would almost

998
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:32,460
lollipop and bottom and D foliate almost

999
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,348
everything underneath that first net

1000
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:36,690
that all gets cleaned off all that lar

1001
00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:38,429
fees stuff the canopy is the lights not

1002
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:39,539
gonna penetrate the canopy far enough to

1003
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,878
make that worth anything

1004
00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:43,679
I generally clean all that off so that

1005
00:34:41,878 --> 00:34:45,569
bottom net is there to spread them out

1006
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,519
and give them control you want to spread

1007
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,649
the plant that would be growing five

1008
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,838
feet tall straight up we've got it three

1009
00:34:49,648 --> 00:34:53,909
feet tall but it's also spread five by

1010
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,619
five feet wide so we're trying to fill

1011
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:57,599
in all that net space then we're gonna

1012
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:59,519
let it grow a little bit vertically out

1013
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,740
of that until it kind of gets close to

1014
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:03,329
that next net then we're gonna flower

1015
00:35:01,739 --> 00:35:05,219
all those branches that are sticking

1016
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:07,409
straight up are going to turn into big

1017
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:09,509
fat buds that will grow into that second

1018
00:35:07,409 --> 00:35:11,848
net that second net at that point is

1019
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:13,980
going to work as a support it's only

1020
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:17,430
going to be there to hold up all of your

1021
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,139
giant buds quite often in a commercial

1022
00:35:17,429 --> 00:35:21,480
environment I've had to use a triple

1023
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:23,909
trellis and sometimes we have considered

1024
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,588
a fourth that's all going to pinned on

1025
00:35:23,909 --> 00:35:26,730
your genetics and what kind of lights

1026
00:35:25,588 --> 00:35:29,130
you're using of course we're using

1027
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:31,199
things like a rise underneath Gavita

1028
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:33,390
lighting in a commercial environment we

1029
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:34,049
were getting serious growth if you're in

1030
00:35:33,389 --> 00:35:35,549
a tent

1031
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:38,390
you're only going to need the spread net

1032
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:39,650
and then the one net up top for support

1033
00:35:38,389 --> 00:35:41,028
now if you want to use the trellis

1034
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,920
netting and you don't want to work it

1035
00:35:41,028 --> 00:35:45,018
into the net is far if you just want to

1036
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:47,000
use it more for a spread and not kind of

1037
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:49,548
create the scrog you can do that you

1038
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,380
don't have to work them as far you can

1039
00:35:49,548 --> 00:35:53,690
just put the net on and spread them out

1040
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,088
try to get one stick per branch if you

1041
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:58,068
can try not to overcrowd anything the

1042
00:35:56,088 --> 00:35:59,719
idea is just to spread it out you kind

1043
00:35:58,068 --> 00:36:01,788
of want to spread them make them shorter

1044
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:04,489
than they were tall you want to use more

1045
00:36:01,789 --> 00:36:06,049
of that vertical space somebody taught

1046
00:36:04,489 --> 00:36:08,058
us a long time ago if you've got a

1047
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:09,829
cooler do you just want to put one layer

1048
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:11,960
of beer in that cooler or do you want to

1049
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:13,339
fill that whole cooler up with beer

1050
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,838
that's kind of what we're trying to do

1051
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:16,250
with our canopy we don't just want a

1052
00:36:14,838 --> 00:36:18,170
couple of beers touching the Wyatt we

1053
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,548
don't want to make a beer tower we want

1054
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:21,470
to knock all those beers down and put

1055
00:36:19,548 --> 00:36:22,759
them in one nice a case just like they

1056
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:24,318
were sold in because that's how they

1057
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,700
stack the best that's how you can fill

1058
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:27,440
it the best I'm not even a beer drinker

1059
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:29,509
and I still want to fit as many beers as

1060
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,400
we can in a cooler also I should

1061
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:33,799
recommend an article I read a long time

1062
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,630
ago by an author named Eric vixa the

1063
00:36:33,798 --> 00:36:38,358
article was called growing on the grid

1064
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:40,278
and it was exactly on this subject it

1065
00:36:38,358 --> 00:36:42,798
talked about maximizing your growth

1066
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:44,929
potential by utilizing the horizontal

1067
00:36:42,798 --> 00:36:47,329
space not just the vertical space that

1068
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:48,768
our plants try to create so one thing I

1069
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:50,450
should mention is that you will not be

1070
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,848
able to move these plants once you put

1071
00:36:50,449 --> 00:36:54,768
the trellis net on so you've got to do

1072
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:57,200
this in whatever room these plants will

1073
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:59,479
be flowering in I started the example by

1074
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:01,338
using a five by five grow tent so in

1075
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,920
most cases we would veg in that five by

1076
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:05,750
five put up the scrog and then flowered

1077
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,818
in that five by five not a big deal if

1078
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,588
you are vegging and flowering in a

1079
00:37:07,818 --> 00:37:11,869
different environment you will have to

1080
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:14,119
veg them drag them to the flowering room

1081
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:16,338
try to put that trellis up on day one

1082
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,539
spread them out nice and wide you're not

1083
00:37:16,338 --> 00:37:19,338
going to be able to work them in too

1084
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:21,049
much but you can kind of bend and

1085
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:23,480
manipulate the plants a little bit

1086
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:24,798
without causing any problems use the

1087
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,199
cracking technique I talked about

1088
00:37:24,798 --> 00:37:28,969
earlier grab the branch give it a little

1089
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,739
bit of a twist and bend it over just a

1090
00:37:28,969 --> 00:37:32,538
little bit you'll be able to create a

1091
00:37:30,739 --> 00:37:34,788
little knuckle there also create a nice

1092
00:37:32,539 --> 00:37:36,710
smooth bed you can control the plant aim

1093
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:37,970
in any direction you want move it over

1094
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:40,519
to the section of the trellis you need

1095
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:42,318
it just be very gentle with them give

1096
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:44,568
them several days to recover before you

1097
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:46,068
go back in and crack them again this is

1098
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:47,389
pretty much how we're forced to do it in

1099
00:37:46,068 --> 00:37:49,788
a commercial environment because we

1100
00:37:47,389 --> 00:37:51,650
don't veg and flower in the same room we

1101
00:37:49,789 --> 00:37:52,130
usually have one large veg area and

1102
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:53,930
multiple

1103
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,119
flowering rooms so that we can keep our

1104
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:58,399
petrol cycles going in a commercial

1105
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:00,500
environment one of my major goals is to

1106
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,960
harvest and refill a room in the same

1107
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,809
day I know that doesn't sound like a big

1108
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,940
challenge but imagine if you've got 300

1109
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:10,070
plants in one room you've got a bunch of

1110
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,139
trellis netting it takes half of the day

1111
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:14,180
to get it cut down then you got to clean

1112
00:38:12,139 --> 00:38:15,440
the room spotless then try to refill it

1113
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:17,629
that's always fun

1114
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,400
then we throw the net on then we spend

1115
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,410
the rest of the day just spreading those

1116
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,050
plants out and adjusting that net tore

1117
00:38:21,409 --> 00:38:26,599
those plants aren't too angry with us so

1118
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:29,360
that is my long sidetrack rambley talk

1119
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,369
on sticks cages and trellis netting and

1120
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,050
canopy control I've got a couple more

1121
00:38:31,369 --> 00:38:35,690
quick things to cover on this list of

1122
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:38,200
ways to improve our productivity while

1123
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:41,119
in veg the next thing on my list is

1124
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:43,609
integrated pest management and scouting

1125
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,369
we should probably be applying a

1126
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:48,170
preventative pesticide regimen to our

1127
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:50,449
plants at this time if you're going to

1128
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,159
use a spray application now is the time

1129
00:38:50,449 --> 00:38:54,349
to get started if you're going to use

1130
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:56,089
predator bugs now is the time to order

1131
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:58,670
them and get them prepared so that we

1132
00:38:56,090 --> 00:39:01,309
have a nice colony before we go into

1133
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:03,320
flower one thing a lot of growers

1134
00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:06,590
overlook at this stage of the game is

1135
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:08,750
manually scouting for pests one of your

1136
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:11,420
best tools and finding bugs in your grow

1137
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:13,369
is your own eyes spend a little time

1138
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,000
walking through the garden and just

1139
00:39:13,369 --> 00:39:18,589
looking for pests or signs of pests

1140
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,539
nature really likes to give us hints

1141
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:23,450
that there are problems in our garden

1142
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:25,519
every pest that comes in gives us some

1143
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:27,409
kind of a warning if you were on top of

1144
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,090
your game you've got some yellow sticky

1145
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:31,670
traps hanging up and you were checking

1146
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:33,769
those on a daily basis they will give

1147
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:35,930
you a fair warning that you've got bugs

1148
00:39:33,769 --> 00:39:38,179
coming in you know how they'll tell you

1149
00:39:35,929 --> 00:39:40,669
there will be bugs stuck to the yellow

1150
00:39:38,179 --> 00:39:43,639
card how much more obvious can it get so

1151
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:47,000
check the yellow sticky traps then walk

1152
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:48,829
every row every few feet reach into the

1153
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,769
canopy and grab a leaf pull it right off

1154
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:53,630
flip it upside down look at it do you

1155
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:55,849
see any bugs on the underside of the

1156
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:57,860
leaf do you see any eggs on the

1157
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:59,659
underside of the leaf look at the top

1158
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,820
side of the leaf do you see any

1159
00:39:59,659 --> 00:40:03,549
stippling that is spider mite damaged do

1160
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:05,410
you see any honeydew that is three

1161
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:07,450
damage do you see anything that just

1162
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:09,639
doesn't look right that could be a sign

1163
00:40:07,449 --> 00:40:11,949
of overfeeding underfeeding or pH

1164
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:13,839
problems pay attention to the plants and

1165
00:40:11,949 --> 00:40:15,669
they will tell you when something is

1166
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,420
starting to go wrong and you won't need

1167
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:19,599
to panic

1168
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:22,030
so scout on a daily basis walk through

1169
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,579
the grow look at the plants look for

1170
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,620
might damage look for thrip damage go

1171
00:40:24,579 --> 00:40:27,519
smack the pots just give a couple pots

1172
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:29,859
of good smack

1173
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:31,989
does anything fly out if so you've got

1174
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:35,019
fungus gnats those are really easy to

1175
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:37,779
treat if you find them early scout for

1176
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:40,059
bugs teach all of your helpers to scout

1177
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:43,269
for bugs look for spider mite webbing

1178
00:40:40,059 --> 00:40:45,340
also look for powdery mildew look for

1179
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:48,460
anything that just doesn't look right if

1180
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:50,440
you are a crew leader teach people how

1181
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:52,389
to properly report the things that they

1182
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,010
see so they know when to come to you

1183
00:40:52,389 --> 00:40:56,500
some people say how doesn't look like a

1184
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:59,230
big deal teach them what is a big deal

1185
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,909
and what is not a big deal so always be

1186
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,289
on the lookout for bugs always be

1187
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:04,089
scouting and know what you're looking

1188
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:06,670
for you're looking for mites and mite

1189
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:08,230
damage which is webbing stippling now

1190
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:09,909
you're looking forthe rip [ __ ] you're

1191
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:11,650
looking forthe rip honeydew that glazy

1192
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:13,899
stuff on the lower leaves that's from

1193
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:15,519
your thrips when you tap the pots those

1194
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:17,440
little black things that fly up those

1195
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,030
are fungus gnats when you shake the

1196
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,400
leaves those little white bugs that fly

1197
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:23,200
out those are white flies be aware of

1198
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,720
what you're looking for and constantly

1199
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,549
be looking for them healthy plants will

1200
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:29,619
be much more vigorous and much more

1201
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:33,100
productive than plants that are fighting

1202
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:34,480
off insects also scouting is free it

1203
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:36,519
doesn't cost you anything to walk

1204
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,949
through your grow and look for bugs you

1205
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:40,389
should enjoy it put on a podcast put on

1206
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:42,669
the grill from your heart podcast there

1207
00:41:40,389 --> 00:41:44,440
on the dude grows put on some Joe Rogan

1208
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,630
and just stroll through the garden and

1209
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:48,280
go see what you can find add a go find

1210
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:50,200
the problem chances are there's

1211
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:52,210
something wrong you just need to go find

1212
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:53,919
it alright I'll quit ranting about IPM

1213
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:55,570
hopefully I have inspired you to go look

1214
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,670
for bugs in your garden you know what

1215
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:59,230
else is free it will really improve the

1216
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,900
quality of your garden overall is

1217
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,030
note-taking write down everything you do

1218
00:42:01,900 --> 00:42:05,559
that way when something goes wrong you

1219
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:07,450
know what to blame it on and you know

1220
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:09,309
what not to do next time I've done an

1221
00:42:07,449 --> 00:42:10,569
entire episode on journaling I'm not

1222
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:12,400
gonna rant too much on that right now

1223
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:13,720
I've got one more thing to talk about

1224
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,610
and then we're gonna wrap up this

1225
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:16,159
podcast because my throat is starting to

1226
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,170
burn

1227
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,659
another way we can increase productivity

1228
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,889
and vigor of our veg plants is to

1229
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:26,480
augment the co2 levels in our grow room

1230
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:28,129
the ambient co2 level in your

1231
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,190
environment is probably hovering

1232
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:32,690
somewhere between 300 and 400 particles

1233
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:34,730
per million that is just about the

1234
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:36,650
standard on earth and my last research

1235
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,750
depends on where you are your elevation

1236
00:42:36,650 --> 00:42:41,269
what kind of city you're in but it's

1237
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:44,690
somewhere between 300 and 400 particles

1238
00:42:41,269 --> 00:42:47,269
per million our plants would prefer

1239
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:50,210
somewhere around a thousand particles

1240
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:52,489
per million they can take up to 1200

1241
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:54,588
maybe 1500 I've even seen people push

1242
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:56,750
them closer to 2000 particles per

1243
00:42:54,588 --> 00:42:59,808
million of co2 and the plants just

1244
00:42:56,750 --> 00:43:01,460
explode with vigorous growth now there

1245
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:04,010
are several ways that you can increase

1246
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:06,230
the co2 in your room one thing I need to

1247
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,760
mention once you start increasing the

1248
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,699
amount of co2 in your grow room

1249
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,970
environment it is very unhealthy for the

1250
00:43:10,699 --> 00:43:16,250
plants to let the co2 levels decline

1251
00:43:13,969 --> 00:43:17,899
past what you have now increased it too

1252
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,969
so if you start boosting it to a

1253
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,940
thousand you either need to keep it at a

1254
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:25,250
thousand or increase through flower your

1255
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,858
plant is expecting this co2 as a new

1256
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:29,719
food source it is now feeding itself

1257
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:31,670
like it's got another food source you

1258
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:34,098
have now put your plant into another

1259
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,809
level of high performance it's expecting

1260
00:43:34,099 --> 00:43:38,390
to get that high performance fuel it's

1261
00:43:35,809 --> 00:43:42,079
adjusted its diet accordingly if you cut

1262
00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:43,848
off that co2 that extra co2 it will not

1263
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:46,609
be feeding itself properly you will

1264
00:43:43,849 --> 00:43:48,619
start seeing nutrient burn so make sure

1265
00:43:46,608 --> 00:43:50,778
you keep up on your co2 habit if you

1266
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:52,400
start that habit and also if you run out

1267
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:54,710
and the plants start acting a little

1268
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,180
funny that is probably what is causing

1269
00:43:54,710 --> 00:43:58,250
it as they're still craving that co2

1270
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:59,838
they're still trying to readjust their

1271
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:01,548
metabolism because they're still on that

1272
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,650
high performance mode and they're not

1273
00:44:01,548 --> 00:44:06,108
sure what to do yet so that was my last

1274
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,930
tip for increasing performance and

1275
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:11,358
productivity and vigor of our veg plants

1276
00:44:08,929 --> 00:44:12,858
I shared a lot of my dirty secrets a lot

1277
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:14,298
of the things that I use in my personal

1278
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:16,009
grows a lot of things that I use in the

1279
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:18,710
commercial grows I hope you learned

1280
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:20,119
