then we will move forward

57
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,359
unfortunately if you are a hip-hop fan

58
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,320
if you're a hip-hop listener a hip-hop

59
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,640
connoisseur

60
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:44,319
you lost a major influence a major

61
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,840
member of the hip-hop community big

62
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,398
shout out to mf doom

63
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,000
unfortunately mf doom has passed away uh

64
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,439
you may say rosta jeff why are you

65
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,879
talking about a hip-hop artist we know

66
00:01:51,438 --> 00:01:55,599
hip-hop's not your thing

67
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:58,078
i actually grew quite fond of mf doom i

68
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,679
ran a commercial cultivation facility

69
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,519
one of my favorite employees was a guy

70
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,479
named elijah shout out bro i hope you're

71
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,519
listening to this and i hope you're

72
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,039
doing well

73
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:06,879
when you work in my cultivation

74
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,080
facilities if you're the first one to

75
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,598
show up for work today

76
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,200
you get to pick the music we have a big

77
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,759
bluetooth speaker you get to link your

78
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:13,280
phone up

79
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,799
you choose the music we're listening to

80
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
for the first half of the day

81
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,560
so if you're there first that's kind of

82
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,920
your incentive a lot of times elijah

83
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,878
would show up for work first

84
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,679
and elijah would put on mf doom over

85
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:25,679
time i grew

86
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,000
quite fond of mf doom's sound that

87
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
smooth feel uh very creative lyrics it's

88
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,239
got a really nice flow to it

89
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,919
uh the lyrics are not always about the

90
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,599
same thing a lot of times in hip-hop i

91
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:36,318
hear too much of the same words the same

92
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,639
story

93
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:41,199
mf doom didn't do that to me so i grew

94
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,958
quite fond of mf doom's flow and style

95
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,518
and creativity the beats

96
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,598
uh his mindset i really enjoyed that so

97
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,840
i did notice that mf doom was gone

98
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,359
mf doom has left the building big shout

99
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,080
out rest in peace

100
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,160
mf doom all right let's move forward um

101
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
in the last episode i did talk about

102
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,719
cleaning up and preparing our grow room

103
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:02,878
to set ourselves up for success in 2021

104
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,759
our good friend mobius sent me a message

105
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,079
and he said

106
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,120
everybody should have a dry erase board

107
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
in their grow

108
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
that is something i highly overlooked

109
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:12,158
i've got a dry erase board in my grow

110
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,479
i've got a dry erase

111
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,000
wall in my cultivation facility i think

112
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,199
you should have some sort of dry erase

113
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,959
board and markers

114
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,878
and some alcohol and a little rag so you

115
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,158
can clean that up that is an essential

116
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,079
part of your grow

117
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,000
put that dry erase board right in

118
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,920
against the door on one side of the door

119
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,199
so you can access it easily

120
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,559
put it on the outside that way if you

121
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:31,359
get an idea and the lights are off you

122
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,799
can run up to it

123
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,000
scribble that idea on the dry erase

124
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,560
board and when you go to go in there the

125
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
next day

126
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,759
it's right there on the door you get the

127
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,239
idea you know what needs to be done

128
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,560
so add that dry erase board to your grow

129
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,319
room to help set yourself up for success

130
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,719
in 2021

131
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:48,158
big shout out to my friend mobius grows

132

137
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:56,799
camera

138

139
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,120

141
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,000
that feedback and thank you for

142
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
tolerating that episode

143
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,598
where i was a little bit blue and purple

144
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,040
i'm learning man i'm learning there's a

145
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:10,399
lot to learn you can watch me fiddle

146
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:11,919
with these knobs you can watch me reach

147
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,438
over and do camera corrections there's a

148
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,518
lot going on here also

149
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:17,519
the auto focus in the last episode was

150
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,959
going crazy i bumped something with my

151
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,720
finger on the screen when i was setting

152
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,120
up the autofocus wasn't what it should

153
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,639
be

154
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,319
so when i moved over here it would focus

155
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,560
on the background it was a little weird

156
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,319
i apologize like i said i'm learning

157
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,079
it's just me i don't have a team of six

158
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:31,279
people or anything helping me out i find

159
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,800

160
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:34,559

just like this it says hey ross to jeff

210
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,839
i've been hearing rumors of people being

211
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,560
able to tell

212
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,839
male plants apart from the females ah

213
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,478
yeah that's that's a thing

214
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,478
then it says they can tell well before

215
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,519
they even go into flower is there any

216
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,279
truth to this

217
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,519
or does it get filed under the same

218
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,239
category as unicorns orcs goblins

219
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:15,839
hoblets

220
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,439
hobbits and people saying they can tell

221
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:18,318
the difference between male and female

222
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,839
seeds

223
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,439
if there's any thought if there's any

224
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,399
truth there i've got five beautiful

225
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,319
arise babies

226
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,239
i'd like to try it out on thank you so

227
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,000
much for taking time out of your day

228
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,759
to set me straight i sincerely

229
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,240
appreciate this from

230
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,759
caribou heart organics all right there's

231
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,478
one part i want to touch on before we go

232
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,960
too far

233
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,719
he said uh or is it filed under uh the

234
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,959
category of unicorns orcs

235
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,080
uh basically fantasy [ __ ] like when

236
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:44,478
people claim they can tell the

237
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,000
difference between male and female seeds

238
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,918
i've seen people on the internet posting

239
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,038
this chart that says if the seed is

240
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:50,799
shaped this way

241
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,360
it's a male if the seed is shaped this

242
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,759
way it's a female if your seed has a

243
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,680
volcano shape on one side or a cone on

244
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,639
one side it's a female or a male

245
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,319
you guys that is complete [ __ ] don't

246
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,478
fall for that don't buy into that

247
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,560
that is not real uh anybody with the

248
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,478
amount of seeds that i've got can

249
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,839
greatly prove that that is [ __ ] very

250
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:11,439
quickly i'll let you pick

251
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:12,879
whichever seeds you want you can roll

252
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,478
them around on the table you can

253
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,680
label them male and female and we'll

254
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:16,639
plant them and we'll check in a few

255
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,079
weeks

256
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,680
they're not going to be what you think

257
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,758
they are you cannot identify

258
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,439
a male or female seed by looking at the

259
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,400
seed unless you you know it's a

260
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:26,399
feminized seed

261
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:27,918
but that is just cheating anyway and i

262
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,120
would still put feminized seeds in there

263
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:30,879
just to [ __ ] with the people

264
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,720
who tell me that they can identify the

265
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,560
sex of a seed by visually looking at the

266
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,080
seeds so that part is [ __ ]

267
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,079
don't ever believe that you guys now

268
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,120
let's move on to the part of this

269
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,680
question

270
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,160
can you tell the sex of a plant before

271
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,598
it goes

272
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,560
into flour there are some telltale signs

273
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,360
that i use

274
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:51,680
to kind of predict my males and females

275
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,960
but until you actually see pre-flower

276
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,120
there's no way to be

277
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,198
a hundred percent sure of what you've

278
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,759
got you can't send in a lab test

279
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
uh we're in the future it's 20 21 we're

280
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,479
able to get

281
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,918
a little card and you rub part of the

282
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,359
leaf material on a card you don't even

283
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,878
need to send plant matter

284
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,800
you just kind of smear one of the leaves

285
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,240
get the juices on this little card you

286
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
fold the card up you write the plant

287
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,280
number

288
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,360
you number that plant plant a card a you

289
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,839
mail it off to a lab they will tell you

290
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,598
uh if that plant is a male or female

291
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,439
that is science that is definitely an

292
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,079
option we can definitely get our plants

293
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,839
sex tested through science another great

294
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:27,199
way to kind of predict and anticipate

295
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,119
which plants are males

296
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
as a breeder somebody who has grown a

297
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,240
lot of seeds somebody who's looking for

298
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,639
male plants

299
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,799
a lot of times the male plants in the

300
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,639
population are the plants that take off

301
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,158
a little bit taller and stretchier than

302
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,158
the rest of the females

303
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,000
this is not always a hundred percent

304
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:44,639
accurate but ninety-nine percent of the

305
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,399
time

306
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,759
if you plant ten seeds and you've got

307
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,000
two or three that are just

308
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,480
towering above the rest chances are

309
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,480
those are going to be the male plants

310
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
people get so excited they say man this

311
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,519
one right here is growing super tall

312
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,320
super fast and i go yeah it's going to

313
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,000
be a boy

314
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,760
and they get so mad at me when i tell

315
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,039
them that then most of the time i am

316
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,360
correct it's a boy

317
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,079
that male plant wants to get above the

318
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,839
females

319
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,519
the pollen falls down from the male

320
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,120
plant so he wants to get up above the

321
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,440
girl so that when he pollinates

322
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
the pollen falls down and rains onto the

323
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,760
female flowers and they can receive the

324
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,159
pollen

325
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,600
that is in my theory why the males tend

326
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,278
to stretch a little bit more quickly

327
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,278
than the girls they also kind of go into

328
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:25,919
flower a little bit earlier as well

329
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,600
so the only way we can really tell male

330
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,159
and female plants apart from each other

331
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
truly

332
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,559
is by waiting to see what type of sex

333
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,560
they display do they put out the balls

334
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,239
do they put out you guys call them hairs

335
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,359
it's a really easy way to identify it do

336
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,080
you get little balls or do you get

337
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,159
little hairs

338
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
that's the quickest way we are going to

339
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,360
see

340
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,879
pre-flower if your plant i spit right

341
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
under the microphone i apologize if you

342
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,679
saw that

343
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,279
if your plant starts to uh get root

344
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,879
bound in that pot if it says hey i don't

345
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,879
have much more space to grow

346
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,480
i've got 60 more days to flower so i

347
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,879
better start flowering now

348
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,240
or if your plant has been under too

349
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,919
little light it's not getting enough

350
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,440
light it may decide hey i'm not getting

351
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:02,639
enough light it's time to flower now

352
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
that's when you're going to see

353
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:05,838
sex signs starting to show you're not

354
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,919
even in flower yet

355
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,480
you're getting pre-flower sometimes

356
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,399
about 45 days into the vegetative stage

357
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,839
you can start to get hints of what those

358
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,919
plants are they will give you

359
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,519
pre-flowers they're not in flower we're

360
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:18,719
not getting calaxes we're not getting

361
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,399
male parts at all

362
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,079
but we're starting to see the

363
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,679
development of those parts

364
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,120
they're kind of nearing the corner

365
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,679
they're going hey you could flower me if

366
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,200
you wanted

367
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,958
so they start showing you their sex

368
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,120
that's usually based on pot size

369
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:32,479
or an environmental stressor or maybe

370
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,679
they just need to get up potted maybe

371
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,800
they've been growing long enough

372
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,559
some plants will just show you

373
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:37,439
pre-flower just because that's what they

374
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,439
choose to do

375
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
a lot of times you need to up pot or put

376
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,360
more light on there

377
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,919
but the main answer to this question is

378
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,560
you can

379
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,479
identify pre-flower you can identify sex

380
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,518
through pre-flower if you're experienced

381
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
but

382
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,799
let those plants go make sure that they

383
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,399
are males or females let them get into

384
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,240
flower a few days before you call the

385
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,600
boys let them get into flower a few days

386
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,959
before you were committed to thinking

387
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,560
that that's a girl and you put it into a

388
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,479
trellis net or something

389
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,919
honestly it comes with experience it

390
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,039
comes with time and learning the plants

391
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,039
but overall

392
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,559
yes eventually you'll be able to tell

393
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:09,759
the difference between males and females

394
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,159
by pre-flower

395
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,679
but not in veg not at the start and

396
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,199
definitely not from seed

397
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,799
all right that was a lot of rambling i

398
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,720
hope i answered your question

399
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,240
big shout out to my friend caribou heart

400
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,680
organics i've seen you following me on

401
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
patreon for quite a while

402
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,599
and i'm honored to finally get one of

403
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,040
your questions here on the air

404
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
all right let's keep moving i do have a

405
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,759
couple of great questions lined up

406
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,720
this one actually came from the grow

407
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,480
question tab

408
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,720
on the website if you go to my website

409
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,480
iriegenetics.com

410
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,759
there is a tab that says grow help when

411
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,200
you click on that tab

412
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,240
you will have to fill out a short

413
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,079
questionnaire it looks like there are

414
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,680
about eight or nine questions on there

415
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,879
i'd ask what strain you're growing where

416
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:48,399
you're growing it what kind of whites

417
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:50,078
you're using are you in veg are you in

418
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,839
flower what week are you in

419
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,919
basic questions that will give me an

420
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,399
idea of what's wrong with your plants

421
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,319
because

422
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,078
a lot of times people say hey bro my

423
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
plants are yellow and then i've got

424
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,599
nine questions to ask you this is

425
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,039
skipping a step you have to answer these

426
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,680
questions before you can send me the

427
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:05,199
question

428
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,519
that's where this question comes from

429
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,920
this one comes from our friend

430
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,679
michael and michael is growing special

431
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,120
queen number one feminized seeds from

432
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,879
queen royal seeds they're growing at

433
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,959
indoors under leds

434
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,480
they are in flower they're in week eight

435
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,000
they're growing in soil see all this

436
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,759
wonderful information we've got we can

437
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,559
build a picture on this grow in our

438
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,838
minds

439
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,799
uh the last feed was uh medi120

440
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,600
milliliters

441
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:31,439
cal mag four milliliters fish [ __ ] four

442
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,278
mils per gallon what was the ph of your

443
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,880
last feeding it was 6.1 that's a little

444
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,039
bit low but that should work

445
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,600
uh what was the ppm or ec they didn't

446
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:42,240
have that info the daytime temps are 78

447
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,639
night time temps are 72 daytime humidity

448
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,639
is 53 and nighttime is 50.

449
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,759
the problem this is where we get to the

450
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,440
details i use dj shorts 11 13 light

451
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,519
schedule for flowering

452
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,200
do you think my last week my last 10

453
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,959
days i could do 18

454
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,278
6 and still be helpful i love the

455
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,719
podcast i can't afford patreon right now

456
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,559
but i do spread the word

457
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,759
thank you for all you do hey michael

458
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,518
thank you for the support

459
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,039
you do not have to support me on patreon

460
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,720
to be my friend to get help from me

461
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:10,319
i do appreciate the patreon support and

462
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,079
i put you at the top of the list but

463
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,360
i do appreciate helping people i like

464
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:14,799
good questions like this

465
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,399
this is a great question to answer on

466
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,519
the show so thank you for the great

467
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,200
question and thank you

468
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,799
for spreading the word now let's get you

469
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,959
some answers

470
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:25,439
uh michael is using what is known as an

471
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,679
11 13 light cycle that uh that idea came

472
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,680
from dj short is where i learned of that

473
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,439
dj short feels that by running the

474
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,078
lights on for 11 hours

475
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,160
and off by 13 hours we get better

476
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,679
phenotypical expression and i do tend to

477
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:38,159
agree with that if i'm running brand new

478
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,679
plants

479
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,198
i'm doing a pheno hunt i want to see

480
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,479
what the plants really do

481
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,838
you may see more variation from an 11 13

482
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,278
light cycle than you would at 12

483
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,880
12. so if you're really looking for the

484
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,879
details and phenotypes

485
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,000
that 11 13 may be helpful you'll see

486
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,480
more colors

487
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,720
uh just more phenotypical expression and

488
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,000
more variation amongst the population by

489
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,720
running the 11 13.

490
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,519
also if you're flowering for 60 days you

491
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,160
just saved

492
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,360
60 hours worth of electricity that's

493
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,719
going to be helpful there will be a

494
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,039
benefit to that that's

495
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,320
over two days worth of lights off time

496
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:10,719
that you just got that's going to help

497
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,240
your

498
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,920
gear last longer it's going to help your

499
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
electrical bill be lower

500
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,198
but anyway it's good for the plants is

501
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,560
the main reason that i would do it

502
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,719
the question here is i've been running

503
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:23,198
the 11 13 during flowering

504
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,360
should i do the 18 six at the end of

505
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,120
flowering will that still be helpful

506
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,039
now let's talk a little bit about the 18

507
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,799
6. a lot of people have heard me

508
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,639
recently start talking about putting my

509
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,240
plants on an 18-6

510
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,879
light cycle at the end of flower that is

511
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,320
18 hours on and six hours off a lot of

512
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,759
people are already saying what the [ __ ]

513
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,320
are you doing to my grow

514
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,000
think of this the number one thing that

515
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,959
gives our plants energy that makes our

516
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,278
plants grow is light light is the number

517
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,799
one

518
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,720
energy source for our plants that is

519
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,519
what creates photosynthesis

520
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,120
we are at the end of flower i recommend

521
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,679
putting the plants on 18

522
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,399
6 for the last 10-ish days you can go

523
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,638
shorter you can go longer this is very

524
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,879
strain-dependent

525
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,519
since you've been on an 11-13 i may wait

526
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,679
till the last 7-10 days to do this

527
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,278
what you can do put that light timer

528
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,519
back on 18-6

529
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,480
your plants are now going to get seven

530
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,759
more hours

531
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,278
uh they're going to get even more than

532
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:16,319
that because you didn't go from 12 12

533
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:17,838
you went to 11

534
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,760
uh you're gonna get 18 you're gonna get

535
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,480
seven more hours of light time

536
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,639
every day seven more hours of photons

537
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,079
seven more hours of that much energy

538
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,680
pounded into the plants they're going to

539
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,519
get that much more growth

540
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,838
now a lot of people will say won't that

541
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:34,240
make my plants go back into veg

542
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,279
eventually yes but we're doing this at

543
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,000
the last

544
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,360
7 to 10 maybe the last 14 days if you're

545
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,039
familiar with the cut

546
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,639
and you're running at 12 12. you can get

547
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,719
away with 14 days

548
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,799
of 18 six at the end but know your

549
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,000
plants before you try to do this

550
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,799
so turn that light timer to 18 6 at the

551
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,399
end of flower

552
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,240
the plants will get more light they'll

553
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
get more energy they'll beef up they'll

554
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,680
get chunkier they'll get beefier

555
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,279
the trichomes will ripen more quickly

556
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,799
and you may notice that you planned on

557
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:01,600
doing that for 10 days but at the end of

558
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,439
day 7

559
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,720
they may already be done this is going

560
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,680
to speed you up

561
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,000
so my answer is yes i do think you can

562
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,719
still

563
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,159
do the 18 6 at the end of flower even if

564
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,440
you did the 11 13

565
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:16,000
but only do it for seven to ten days

566
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,519
because

567
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,679
you're going to see a drastic difference

568
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,879
you're getting one more dark hour and

569
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,078
you're cutting that out the plants are

570
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,759
going to respond to it more

571
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,000
quickly because it's more of a drastic

572
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,680
change so i do think that it will be

573
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,078
beneficial i do think it will help you

574
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,679
out

575
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,278
i also think you need to pay close

576
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,719
attention to these plants anytime we're

577
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,240
doing a new experiment

578
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,920
no matter who recommended it if it was

579
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,959
me if it was jorge cervantes if it was

580
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,719
ed rosenthal

581
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,479
if it was your buddy down the block

582
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
always keep in mind that

583
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,440
it's an experiment you have to pay close

584
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,720
attention to the plants because the

585
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,399
plants are going to tell you

586
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,199
if they're starting to re-veg the plants

587
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,000
are going to tell you if they're

588
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:49,599
freaking out

589
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,958
i don't know what cultivar you've got i

590
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,480
don't know the rest of your setup i

591
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,719
don't know all the details

592
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,560
i know that in my environment in my

593
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,879
conditions with my experience

594
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,599
this works very well pay attention to

595
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,439
the plants

596
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
the plants are going to be the boss in

597
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,959
every situation

598
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,558
but i do think you will see benefits in

599
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,798
using the 18-6

600
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,798
at the end of flower even if you did use

601
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,838
the 11-13 schedule on

602
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,959
so yes overall my answer is do that [ __ ]

603
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,639
ladies and gentlemen again i do

604
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:16,959
encourage you to check out that grow

605
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,120
help

606
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,240
tab on iregenetics.com that's where that

607
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,318
question came from

608
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,000
made it really easy for me nice little

609
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,279
guideline of what's going on in the room

610
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,279
and then a simple question

611
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,960
makes it really easy for me to answer

612
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:29,839
big shout out to my buddy michael for

613
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,600
the great question

614
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,439
hope i answered you well i want to keep

615
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:35,839
moving because i have got a nice

616
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,720
flow going this one says hey ross to

617
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,639
jeff

618
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,480
i learned so much from your podcast

619
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,000
thank you so much hey you're very

620
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,519
welcome thank you for reaching out

621
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,200
it says i was searching on youtube for

622
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,000
your podcast about flushing during

623
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,759
flower

624
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,960
when high ec and with high ppm and high

625
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,038
ec runoff

626
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,038
i'm currently in week three of flour i'm

627
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,558
growing in a cocoa pot number 20

628
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,160
and i always feed until i have 10

629
00:17:56,558 --> 00:17:59,519
percent drain to waste so they're

630
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,480
getting plenty of runoff

631
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:05,119
i feed with 1200 ppms but i tested my

632
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,759
runoff at 2500 ppms

633
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,079
how what do you recommend straight ph

634
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,319
water until the ppm get very low and

635
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,079
then feed full strength at the same time

636
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:16,240
or flush with the quarter strength

637
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,399
nutrient until the ppm is lowered

638
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,359
or do you have another way of doing this

639
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
thank you

640
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,599
all right so our friend is feeding their

641
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,400
plants and they're getting a very high

642
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:27,199
uh ec and the runoff which could be

643
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
problematic

644
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,360
could be non-problematic my very first

645
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,240
question to our friend here was

646
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,879
are the plants upset the numbers don't

647
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,558
matter

648
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,559
if the plants aren't showing any signs

649
00:18:36,558 --> 00:18:40,319
of stress if the plants are green and

650
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:41,440
thriving and making big fat buds and

651
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,480
smell like dank

652
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,519
who cares what the numbers on your ec

653
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,679
chart says that is an arbitrary number

654
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,200
if the plants are happy don't change a

655
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,038
damn thing so i made a little bit of a

656
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,720
flow chart i made one of those charts it

657
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:55,359
says are the plants happy and if it says

658
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,600
yes

659
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,119
when it says yes or no i actually said

660
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:00,159
are the plants upset because that's the

661
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:01,759
way i worded this

662
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,759
so are the plants upset we're going to

663
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,679
go right over to the no chart

664
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,200
no don't change a damn thing if the

665
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,720
plants aren't upset if the plants aren't

666
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,759
showing any signs of stress if there's

667
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,640
no reason to change

668
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,480
anything don't change anything leave it

669
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,200
just like it is because if you do change

670
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,240
something

671
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,840
that's when you're going to cause a

672
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,679
problem so if it's coming out with a

673
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,079
high number but the plants are happy

674
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,080
who cares make the plants happy if we

675
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,960
see problems that is when we can use

676
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,599
those numbers

677
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
to adjust things so are the plants upset

678
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,959
if the plants are upset

679
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,960
it may be time to rinse them and get all

680
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,919
the excess salts out of that cocoa and

681
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,679
start fresh

682
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,360
so what i would do if the plants are

683
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,960
angry only do this if you're seeing

684
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,879
signs of stress in the plants

685
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
i keep repeating that but i don't want

686
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,840
to mess up a good thing these plants

687
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,440
could be totally healthy and you're just

688
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,199
stressed over numbers and numbers don't

689
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,279
matter if the plants are happy

690
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,720
we've got a lot of great gear we've got

691
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,319
monitors that tell us what's happening

692
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,200
in every inch of the room

693
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,839
we can measure ec and ppms and [ __ ]

694
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,120
temperature and all this magical [ __ ]

695
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,038
but are we paying attention to the

696
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,000
plants who cares what all the monitors

697
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,599
and numbers say

698
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
if the plants look good just make sure

699
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,439
those plants are happy we're not growing

700
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,120
monitors we're not growing runoff we're

701
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,000
growing cannabis plants so

702
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,359
if those plants do look upset that is

703
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,319
when i would flush

704
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,079
i would feed enzymes i would feed a

705
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:18,558
little bit of microbes and then i would

706
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,199
water

707
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,399
until i had at least 10 to 20 runoff i

708
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,240
would aim for 20

709
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,000
runoff at this point because we want to

710
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,759
push all that excess salt

711
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,200
all that extra nutrient buildup right

712
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,279
out of the bottom of the pot

713
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,960
i also wonder if you rinsed your cocoa

714
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,200
before you used it that could be

715
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,038
contributing to the high ec and high

716
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
ppms that could just be salt from salt

717
00:20:37,038 --> 00:20:38,960
water

718
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,558
in your plants you didn't rinse the

719
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,079
cocoa those plants are gonna start

720
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,200
looking like [ __ ] real soon you need to

721
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,399
get them rinsed

722
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,038
so um use some enzymes get a container

723
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,960
of water

724
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,558
fill it like you just normally would put

725
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,279
your enzymes in there at the recommended

726
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,240
dosage

727
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:54,879
adjust the ph to about six two six four

728
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,120
maybe six

729
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,520
five right in that range uh did you say

730
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:02,079
what your ph is you didn't tell me that

731
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,240
but adjust that ph get the ph corrected

732
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,918
then water those plants to about 10 to

733
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,558
20 percent runoff

734
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,240
then if you want to test that runoff and

735
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,038
see where you are is it still high is it

736
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,120
still low

737
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,158
if it's still too high for your liking

738
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:15,918
flush again

739
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,760
run that flush one more time get it down

740
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,200
until those numbers are kind of low

741
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,720
i don't know how low you want to go i

742
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,240
don't know what's wrong with your plants

743
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,960
but you can flush until you get those

744
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,240
numbers

745
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,600
fairly low then at that point

746
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,359
we need to feed the plants we just

747
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,719
cleaned out the the cocoa there's

748
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,079
nothing in there for those plants to eat

749
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,000
they're going to start starving they're

750
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,879
going to start cannibalizing themselves

751
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,599
so now is the time to mix up a solid

752
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,919
balanced

753
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,038
diet do you have a good npk ratio in

754
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,200
there do you have calmag

755
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,720
in there do you have all the micro and

756
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,840
macro nutrients that you were feeding

757
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,400
your plants are they all

758
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:48,879
in there did you mix up a nice mix and

759
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,960
ph

760
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,559
that put some microbes in there then

761
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
feed that to the plants now we're kind

762
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:55,279
of

763
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,479
reviving them and re-feeding them once

764
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,000
you fed that mix

765
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,919
check your runoff again and see what's

766
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,919
going on but

767
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,840
if you don't have any issues i wouldn't

768
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
mess with it i think the old phrase is

769
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:06,798
if it ain't broke don't fix it and

770
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,720
you didn't say that the plants are

771
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,918
having any problems you said that the

772
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,360
numbers are bad

773
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,120
and if the plants aren't showing any

774
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,918
problems those numbers don't make any

775
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:15,839
difference

776
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,360
so if you're not having any problems

777
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,558
don't change anything if you're seeing

778
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:20,959
problems in the plants

779
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,240
put some water with some enzymes in that

780
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,319
water flush it

781
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,440
maybe flush it twice then pay attention

782
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,119
to the plants pay attention to your

783
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,400
runoff then we need to start feeding

784
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,759
again

785
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,919
maybe reduce your feeding if you're

786
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:34,480
feeding 1200 and it's coming out at

787
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,400
2500 you may be feeding excessively

788
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,720
maybe increase the amount of runoff

789
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,000
but i know the plants are the boss no

790
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,759
matter what you do pay

791
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,038
attention to those plants i can't see

792
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,400
the plants i don't know

793
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,240
if they've got problems i don't know if

794
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,240
they're happy i don't know what else is

795
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,759
going on but the plants are the boss so

796
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,480
without seeing the plants without more

797
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,079
details

798
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,240
without that little chart that i do on

799
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,240
the grow help tab i think this is all of

800
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,558
the help that i'm able to give you

801
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,000
maybe uh lower the ppm of your normal

802
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,639
feed if you're getting a build up in

803
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,558
there

804
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,799
maybe increase the amount of runoff

805
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:07,599
water but honestly pay attention

806
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,400
to those plants and if it ain't broke do

807
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,399
not

808
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,759
fix it alright ladies and gentlemen boys

809
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
