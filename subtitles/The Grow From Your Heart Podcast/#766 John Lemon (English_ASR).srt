names with the word sour or sawa in

179
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,038
there shout out to my east coast friends

181
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,000
sour out there so i wanted to go with

182
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,719
the creative name we will talk about why

183
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,199
i got that name um the aroma makes my

184
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,960
eyes feel itchy i've always talked about

185
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
sour diesel

186
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:22,959
it has this weird effect on my eyes the

187
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,400
john lemon has that same like i don't

188
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,159
know it's almost like an allergy effect

189
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,839
but in a good way like my eyes get i

190
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,520
could tell when someone's got some sour

191
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,638
diesel or john lemon in the car in the

192
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,879
room it makes my eyes get this itch

193
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,038
the real deal east coast sour diesel

194
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,120
stinks so bad that i said in the car it

195
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,478
stinks so bad you can't hide it uh you

196
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,000
could double bag it you could put it in

197
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:44,079
a jar you could put it in a bag inside

198
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
of a jar you gotta vacuum seal it or

199
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:47,680
something or we are going to smell it

200
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,478
that east coast sour diesel the real

201
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,400
deal diesel is a super [ __ ] stinker

202
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,318
you cannot hide that one and then when

203
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,159
you do open the bag at a party or in the

204
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,598
car especially everybody knows what

205
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
you've got right away like bro he's got

206
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,279
the fire and they all come congregating

207
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,879
so you got to be careful if you got that

208
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:04,799
one keep it double bagged be careful or

209
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,639
you open it and you can't even open it

210
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,478
in the car you cannot open the real deal

211
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,560
sour diesel or the john lemon for that

212
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:12,639
matter in the car because it will stink

213
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,240
up the car so bad that it smells like

214
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,079
you smoked in there for the next week

215
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,918
even if you don't light it just open the

216
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,598
jar give it a smell let your friend

217
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,918
smell it close it up that car is now

218
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,680
stank it's broken it'll never smell the

219
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,680
same you got to burn some hippie incense

220
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,680
drop some ozium in there vacuum that

221
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,519
[ __ ] out smoke a cigarette in there it's

222
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,598
still going to stank it is not gonna

223
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,918
work so east coast sour diesel is a

224
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,240
super stinky plant a lot of those stink

225
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,318
traits definitely come through in this

226
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,439
cross um let's see where are we i do

227
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,360
have some notes but i try to stay on

228
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,839
track because i get quite rambly east

229
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,199
coast sour diesel grows tall with thick

230
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,239
dense buds

231
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,439
i'm talking about the parents of the

232
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,759
plants here kind of giving you an idea

233
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,000
of why i made this uh let's see the buzz

234
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,759
from sour d is super aggressive uh when

235
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,240
i smoke that one my eyes get super heavy

236
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,080
and i get this weird like tunnel vision

237
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,160
isolated sort of a feeling sometimes i

238
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,758
get of a sort of a heart racing sort of

239
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
a feeling but it's definitely in my own

240
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,360
head introspective introvert kind of

241
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,478
weed i don't want to talk to people i

242
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,919
just want to be left the [ __ ] alone

243
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,758
cause i'm trying to figure out the

244
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,439
meaning of life and a rubik's cube all

245
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,360
at the same time so that's what that one

246
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:16,560
does now let's talk about the lemon

247
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,240
skunk mail that i used in this cross um

248
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,360
first of all i should mention this is

249
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,160
not the lemon skunk that i used in lemon

250
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,520
jeffrey and firefly and all the other

251
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,560
lemon stuff that you've heard about in

252
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,478
the past

253
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,360
this is not the same lemon skunk that is

254
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,759
a lemon skunk female in this situation i

255
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,240
am using a male lemon skunk plant this

256
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,080
is a bc lemon skunk so this has been

257
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,200
around for a while from the bc seed

258
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,120
company

259
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,039
i've got my hands on a great lemon skunk

260
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
male that does great things

261
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:46,799
it adds great vigor it adds great shape

262
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,519
it adds great potency and most of all it

263
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,879
adds a really amazing lemon flavor to

264
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,759
things you guys know how i like that

265
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,439
lemon terp this one is packed up with

266
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,919
lemon it's got a beautiful structure the

267
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
node spacing is really nice on this one

268
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:02,240
my lemon skunk female the node spacing

269
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:04,879
is kind of far this one's more of a

270
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,519
compact structure compared to that lemon

271
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,600
skunk it's got a giant top flower it

272
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,278
makes really sturdy plants they can hold

273
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,120
themselves up that other lemon skunk is

274
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,838
kind of floppy and needs supports the

275
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,159
male is more sturdy more robust i can

276
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,080
hold itself up and it makes offspring

277
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,159
this lemon skunk makes offspring that

278
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,720
reek of lemons and they are stupid

279
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,879
potent so i got the idea why not take

280
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,959
the lemon skunk and the sour diesel the

281
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,399
east coast sour diesel and put those

282
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,079
together and see what we could come up

283
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,720
with and the results let's talk a little

284
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,399
bit about the results now first before

285
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,080
we get there let's talk about why did i

286
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,839
name it john lemon that's next year on

287
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,759
the notes why did i make it john lemon

288
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,399
honestly john lemon was recommended to

289
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,000
some by me uh to me by somebody on

290
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,600
social media i don't remember who did

291
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
that exactly there were so many names

292
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,120
given and so many things to keep track

293
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,480
of if you recommended it and you think

294
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,959
you were first let me know i'll give you

295
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,759
a prize shout out for the great name but

296
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:02,399
uh the name is awesome i am honestly not

297
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,559
a huge beatles or john lennon and

298
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,320
definitely not a yoko ono fan my buddy

299
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,559
chris in high school shout out to chris

300
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,120
i hope you're well brother he's a huge

301
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:12,399
beatles fan i had to listen we got to

302
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,560
listen to the beatles all the time in

303
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,720
the car with chris uh he chose the

304
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,479
beatles robbie chose pink floyd greg

305
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,680
chose the grateful dead and i chose fish

306
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,839
that's kind of like how we picked our

307
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,278
favorite bands uh everybody got their

308
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,480
own band but i wasn't the beatles guy

309
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:25,759
that was chris

310
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,039
uh but

311
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,159
the beatles are cool dude don't think

312
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:29,199
i'm saying that i hate the beatles

313
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:30,639
that's just not the one i would have

314
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,000
chose i would have chose the grateful

315
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:33,519
dead or fish over the beatles any day

316
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,639
and pink floyd's kind of boring to me to

317
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,799
be honest with you i know i'm going to

318
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,879
get hate mail send it have fun in the

319
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:41,120
comment section get it on down there uh

320
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,240
but when somebody said john lemon i

321
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
thought it was a great name because

322
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,919
we've all seen john lennon in front of

323
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,360
the statue of liberty in new york that

324
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,199
brought me to the new york vibes he's

325
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,759
not from new york but you know he made

326
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,759
it there and then uh we've got the uh

327
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,838
the lemon flavor brings in the lemon so

328
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,600
it's john lemon john lennon it's just a

329
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
beautiful play on words when i heard it

330
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,120
could not resist i tried to resist for a

331
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,040
long time but i kept coming back i have

332
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,399
a list of names and i kept going this

333
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:06,799
john lemon right here that's going to be

334
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,200
the one bro and it's my my decision

335
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:11,039
overall so i chose john lemon now let's

336
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
segue into talking about flavor and

337
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:15,199
aroma or terps if you will

338
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,560
this one's got a lot of great flavor to

339
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,519
it you're going to hear me say the word

340
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,000
sour a lot because this one is dominated

341
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,919
by sour flavors there's a backup of a

342
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,320
backup of lemon flavors there's a backup

343
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:28,559
of some skunk there's hints of maybe

344
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,399
some cat piss some ammonia in there but

345
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,399
let's talk about some of the aromas and

346
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,320
flavors that will come from this it's

347
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,720
going to be mostly sour the bc lemon

348
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
skunk i use makes everything taste like

349
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,278
strong sour lemons that the lemon skunk

350
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,759
on the other plants i use is kind of a

351
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:45,759
softer lemonade kind of a lemons this

352
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,159
one is more just straight up non-diluted

353
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,679
sour ripe lemons in your face lemons

354
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,360
like if you get that plastic lemon with

355
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,359
the juice and squeeze it on your tongue

356
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,720
you make that pucker that's this kind of

357
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,879
lemon

358
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,959
then the sour diesel adds a

359
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:01,439
definitely a diesel aroma to it there's

360
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:04,319
that diesel funk to it then it also adds

361
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,200
sort of a uh an astringent sort of a cat

362
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,680
piss sort of a really sharp aroma maybe

363
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,920
ammonia to it to the mix

364
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:13,278
most of the phenotypes are very sour

365
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,039
some of the other phenotypes are going

366
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,480
to have a little bit of lemon some are

367
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:18,480
going to have some diesel some plants

368
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,000
will even have a little bit of fuel and

369
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,240
skunk terps to them you'll get a little

370
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,799
bit of cat piss and ammonia in some but

371
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,278
you're mainly going to get sour straight

372
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:30,479
sour and lemons but you're mostly gonna

373
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:32,559
get sour sour fuel sour ammonia maybe

374
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,560
some sour cat piss it sounds disgusting

375
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,359
but if you're a cannabis smoker you know

376
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:39,359
that that sour diesel cat piss aroma

377
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,879
with lemons mixed into it is going to be

378
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,800
amazing and you know the buzz will be

379
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,159
high every time you smoke something like

380
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,639
that the buzz is just straight to the

381
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,078
brain my eyes go crazy i get kind of

382
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,159
anxious my heart starts racing the

383
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,838
armpits get sweaty that's what i love

384
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,078
when i smoke so now let's talk about the

385
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,399
buzz a lot of times i feel like this one

386
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,479
goes right to the face right to the head

387
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,159
it's like oh gosh when i smoke it my

388
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,879
eyes go oh there it was they get all

389
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,639
droopy my face gets warm ah i feel like

390
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,240
i'm hot i feel like i got my temperature

391
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,159
raises the pits get sweaty the heart

392
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,159
starts racing i can't remember where i

393
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,399
put my sunglasses but i'm probably

394
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,639
wearing them i can't figure out where i

395
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,720
put my phone but i'm probably playing

396
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:19,600
with my phone and can't find it that's

397
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,920
the kind of buzz that the john lemon

398
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,079
gives to me all right we've talked a lot

399
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:26,559
about the smoking effects most of you

400
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,078
here are here to grow this plant so

401
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,599
let's talk about the growing

402
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,679
characteristics of john lennon most of

403
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,360
the things i breed take a little bit to

404
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,000
flower i would recommend letting these

405
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,039
go for about 70 days maybe a little bit

406
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,958
longer i say 10 weeks is average and

407
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,559
standard for this plant there may be

408
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,879
some shorter there definitely may be

409
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,879
some longer most of the best phenotypes

410
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,799
finish around 10 weeks the plants to

411
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:52,399
take a little bit longer are definitely

412
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,799
the lemon skunk leaners and they

413
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,039
definitely get super potent and super

414
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:59,120
lemony but i don't want all that lemon i

415
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,639
want more of the sour in there i prefer

416
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,639
the 10 weakers if you want to play with

417
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,240
those longer finishers i encourage you

418
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,039
to do that

419
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,039
expect tall plants these plants will

420
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,039
triple in size before they are finished

421
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,958
that's right triple if your grow space

422
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,278
is only six feet tall start flowering

423
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:18,239
around two feet save some space for the

424
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,720
light also that may mess you up um

425
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,399
the lemon skunk phenotype will get tall

426
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,480
quickly and it gets taller and it's a

427
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,320
little bit thinner the sour diesel

428
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,720
phenotype will spread out a little bit

429
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,160
more and not get as tall as quickly

430
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,920
you'll notice it does more branching

431
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,679
more spreading out more lateral growth

432
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,639
instead of just straight going straight

433
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,638
up

434
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,879
all those long arms do fill in with fat

435
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,879
colas on both phenotypes if you don't

436
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,958
clean them up too much a lot of us

437
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:44,799
do too much lollipopping and pruning

438
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,879
this is one that i recommend pruning and

439
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,559
lollipopping a little bit less if you

440
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:50,078
let all those little balls grow they

441
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:52,159
will fill in and that will make one

442
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,239
giant nugget all the way up the branches

443
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,559
will be big fat colas if you don't take

444
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,799
too much off so leave a lot of that

445
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:01,838
that's my advice even the bottom buds on

446
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,439
these plants will get frosty and dense

447
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,360
if they're getting just a little bit of

448
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,920
light they'll fill in don't worry about

449
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,680
that i usually most of the time when i'm

450
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,399
talking about growing i recommend and

451
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:14,078
suggest a heavy defoliation

452
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,879
not with these plants if you were going

453
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:19,039
to defoliate your john lemon go medium

454
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,879
maybe just a little above medium but do

455
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,120
not go hard they don't reply well they

456
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,399
don't react well respond well to that

457
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,759
you'll get hate mail they'll tell you

458
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,480
they're pissed off for the next week or

459
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:31,198
so they won't recover so go light with

460
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,399
the defoliation go light to medium maybe

461
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:36,159
medium hard medium at the most popping

462
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,159
and twisting is okay with these plants

463
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,799
they will take it very well and it does

464
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,399
slow down that vertical growth so as

465
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,719
soon as you throw them into flower maybe

466
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,879
even a week before flower pop and twist

467
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,120
all those stems as soon as they recover

468
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:51,360
about 14 21 days guess what pop and

469
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,799
twist again or do it in more spaces

470
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,959
they're growing there's more space to

471
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,120
pop and twist keep popping they will

472
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,479
keep growing it'll slow them down from

473
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,839
going up they'll keep growing out

474
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,759
they'll get whiter they'll get stalkier

475
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,920
and they will recover from that before

476
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,440
they start flowering where are we i've

477
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,039
got more notes

478
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,639
they do react well to topping but i

479
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,198
wouldn't recommend topping them too many

480
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,959
times i think one top kind of low to

481
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,719
make all those lower branches meat

482
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,239
because these plants will make one giant

483
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,079
top cola if you don't take it out take

484
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,680
that out all the bottoms will meet

485
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,439
they'll meet right up to it i wouldn't

486
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,559
go more than one top

487
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,480
these plants do not like the screen of

488
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,239
green method very well they don't like

489
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,240
to be trellised and manipulated and

490
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,799
pulled around too much

491
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,399
i usually do a screen when they're low

492
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,639
to spread them out so these plants like

493
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,399
to go up i put a screen on them and pull

494
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,639
them down to make them go out and then i

495
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,639
can shape them the way i want after that

496
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,480
i don't do a lot of manipulation most of

497
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,560
the time i'll do some weaving and do the

498
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,000
weave the arms in where i want them now

499
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,758
with these plants i realize they

500
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,679
probably grow better if i don't weave

501
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,680
them into the net so i do minimal

502
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,359
trellising i do a spreader and i do a

503
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,039
supporter a lot of your plants are going

504
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,120
to get really tall really quickly so i

505
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,120
recommend at least that support net or

506
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,320
maybe some sticks or tomato cages or

507
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,078
something like that because they are

508
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,919
going to get tall a lot of the

509
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,918
phenotypes will be very robust and

510
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,280
turgid and be able to hold themselves up

511
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,880
some of them will need supports

512
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:14,480
especially when they start developing

513
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,319
big fat chunky frosty i'm just

514
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,480
exaggerating big beautiful buds you guys

515
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,480
are going to need some supports for

516
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,880
that one thing i have noticed is that

517
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,558
these plants do eat a lot of nitrogen

518
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,120
and they do benefit from continued

519
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:28,480
nitrogen into the flowering phase a lot

520
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,239
of times they'll run out of nitrogen

521
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,120
kind of early so a good way to prevent

522
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,440
that is to continue your veg feed a

523
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,279
couple of weeks into flower a lot of

524
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,440
times we just cut out that veg nutrient

525
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,038
right away we quit giving it nitrogen we

526
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,759
switch right to the bloom newts on day

527
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,759
one of flour these plants will run out

528
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,240
of nitrogen or have the opportunity or

529
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,839
are likely to run out of nitrogen if you

530
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,599
do things that way

531
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,279
i don't recommend giving them just a big

532
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,038
hit of nitrogen right before you flip

533
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,639
them they won't like that they will

534
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,879
benefit and they will appreciate it and

535
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,038
respond better if you give them lower

536
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,640
doses of nitrogen later into the

537
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,119
flowering phase maybe all the way up to

538
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,280
day 14 maybe even a little later

539
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:09,759
they will start burning out of nitrogen

540
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,759
and they do grow for 10 maybe more weeks

541
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,079
be prepared if you do run out of

542
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,919
nitrogen you can foliar feed them feed

543
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,079
them your base nutrient that will help

544
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,038
but once you start seeing it it will be

545
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,639
a chase and a race because they will eat

546
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,240
a lot of nitrogen that's going to start

547
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,960
throwing everything else out of whack

548
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,679
also so give them some nitrogen early in

549
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,279
flower don't cut that out now let's talk

550
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,200
a little bit about phenotypes that's

551
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,918
always everybody's favorite i'm going to

552
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,759
give my disclaimer everybody always asks

553
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,038
not everybody a lot of people ask what's

554
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,839
your favorite phenotype or what

555
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:44,480
phenotype would you pick

556
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,798
um that phenotype popped up in my garden

557
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,480
and it was perfect for me it may not

558
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,240
even pop up in your garden since you've

559
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,160
got different lights air water soil

560
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
microbes nutrients

561
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,919
different love different music

562
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,839
everything is different in there

563
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,360
you may not even see the same phenotypes

564
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,439
that i have because a phenotype is an

565
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,639
expression based on an environment if

566
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,120
you don't have the same environment you

567
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,400
may not even get the same expression so

568
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,159
that's step one of talking about

569
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,320
phenotypes the other part is

570
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,440
when i select a phenotype i am selecting

571
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:14,319
it for me that's who i want to smoke

572
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,600
grow

573
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,359
breed take pictures of smell it look at

574
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,119
it for the next year or two that's the

575
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,038
plan i'm working with

576
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,519
it's kind of like picking your date do

577
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:27,679
you want me to select your date

578
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,679
i like to describe phenotype selection

579
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,280
kind of like this i made a bunch of

580
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,160
seeds there are several lines to pick

581
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:37,038
from we have agreed you want lemons you

582
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,038
want sour you want diesel feel so you

583
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:41,200
pick john lemon that's what you've got

584
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,279
now in my mind we've got it narrowed

585
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,880
down pretty damn close to what we got

586
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,879
i'm going to compare this to we've all

587
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,799
decided that we want italian food we've

588
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,000
all now driven to the italian restaurant

589
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,918
that's what we're going to call john

590
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,839
lemon this just got weird and it became

591
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,840
italian food but follow along this will

592
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:57,038
all make sense in the end when we get to

593
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,199
the italian restaurant they're going to

594
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,960
pass us a menu on that menu is going to

595
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,558
be nine different kinds of pasta

596
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,840
there'll probably be an eggplant dish

597
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,158
there'll be a bunch of other great [ __ ]

598
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,158
in there um you might want the white

599
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,919
sauce you might want the garlic sauce

600
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,200
i'm going for the red sauce today that i

601
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,038
usually do the white sauce but i already

602
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,360
assigned it to somebody else we all want

603
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,640
different sauces right so that is kind

604
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,319
of what i think it's like when we're

605
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,919
selecting phenotypes we've all decided

606
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,759
we want italian food no it's up to you

607
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,280
to pick if you want the marinara or if

608
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,200
you want the garlic sauce or if you want

609
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:27,839
the white sauce i've driven you to the

610
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,519
italian restaurant i got you that far so

611
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:31,119
phenotype selection i don't want to

612
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,200
choose off the menu for you you've got

613
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,798
to open up the menu and see which one

614
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,960
gets your opinion

615
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,400
the phenotype i'm going to select is

616
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,759
great for me the meal i'm going to

617
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,159
select is perfect for me i'm a

618
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,359
vegetarian i like this i like this i'm

619
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,360
going to order the right [ __ ] for me you

620
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,599
may want to order totally different [ __ ]

621
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,119
and that's how your phenotype may be i

622
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:50,719
want the one that takes a long time to

623
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,879
finish not in this case i want that 10

624
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,440
weaker but generally i want a long

625
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,520
sativa dominant longer finishing longer

626
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,038
flowering plant with a lot of flavor

627
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,720
that gets me wrecked when i smoke it

628
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,400
that's got a certain shape

629
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,679
i don't really care too much about the

630
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,038
colors and the

631
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,960
certain things i'm not growing it for

632
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:09,919
instagram i want it to be potent i need

633
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:11,679
to be resistant to pathogen i wanted to

634
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,360
not be intersex i really needed to

635
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,798
handle problems and bugs well because

636
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,639
i'm going to breed to it make market

637
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,879
seeds out of it so i've got a different

638
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,960
criteria than you you may want one that

639
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,799
grows short and squat and tastes like

640
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,200
chocolate has an indica dominant buzz

641
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,519
and puts you on the couch so me telling

642
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,159
you which phenotype to select

643
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,918
doesn't do either one of us any good in

644
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,919
my opinion we've driven to the italian

645
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,840
restaurant you've got the menu grow them

646
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,600
out find the italian dish in there that

647
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,678
is the best for you now with that being

648
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:42,000
said let's talk about some of the

649
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,000
phenotypical expressions i have

650
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
experienced in my test growers and my

651
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,880
friends growing these strains have

652
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,279
experienced

653
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,760
there is the sour phenotype then there

654
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:54,158
is the more sour phenotype all of the

655
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,599
phenotypes are sour

656
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,039
the main difference

657
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,918
some is going to have more diesel than

658
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:01,200
others some is going to have um so the

659
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,400
main difference is the growth structure

660
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,519
we'll talk about the flavors and i've

661
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,559
already talked about that we'll touch on

662
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,400
that again in a second the main

663
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,558
difference is the growth structure the

664
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,080
sour d phenotype uh kind of creeps

665
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,158
outward it branches out it gets a little

666
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,839
bit whiter the lemon skunk phenotype

667
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,200
gets a little bit taller it doesn't grow

668
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:16,959
out as wide so you don't need as much

669
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,400
space between plants

670
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
but it's going to get taller so you need

671
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,640
more vertical space for that one other

672
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,720
differences like i mentioned before are

673
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,080
flavors and aromas those are things that

674
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,079
you'll notice as soon as you start

675
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,199
flowering you may notice some of these

676
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,798
differences

677
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,319
one thing i notice is some of my

678
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,158
favorite phenotypes if you give it a

679
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,720
little stem rub and smell your fingers

680
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,000
it is cat piss and ammonia and i love it

681
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,919
but let's stay on track here i've got

682
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,720
notes in front of me uh the background

683
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,480
aromas the so it's sour and lemons that

684
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,079
is obvious that is the main ingredient

685
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,240
the main aromas you're gonna smell here

686
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,798
sour is just overwhelmingly kind of

687
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,640
gross sour and then you've got lemons uh

688
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,158
just fresh ripe lemon so it's like oh

689
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,600
that's grossly good and lemons oh gross

690
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,000
you make a pucker face and you smell it

691
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,079
again then there are background and

692
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,919
backup aromas that come with that some

693
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,558
of those are like diesel feel or

694
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,200
gasoline uh then there's skunk in there

695
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,200
some of them smell like sour skunk ass

696
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,600
but then we've got things uh like i've

697
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,600
been talking about ammonia cat piss and

698
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,279
real astringent flavors like that

699
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,879
there's one of them that randomly throws

700
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,639
out a little bit of lavender terps and i

701
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,799
don't know where that comes from one

702
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,679
thing i've noticed though that i think

703
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,599
that medium and feed really play a huge

704
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,880
difference in the flavors and aromas of

705
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,119
this cross

706
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,960
when i grow it in soilless mix it tastes

707
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,199
pretty pretty similar pretty much the

708
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,798
same way when i put it in cocoa it

709
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,798
tastes different when my friends grow it

710
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,319
in living soil it really brings out that

711
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,918
lavender sort of thing it brought out

712
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:44,480
sort of a floral terp that i could not

713
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,840
quite describe still had that main sour

714
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,278
thing to it but there was something at

715
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,278
the end i've got a really sensitive

716
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,960
palette i can really identify things i

717
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:53,119
like to think i like to believe i seem

718
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,880
to have proven that theory but there was

719
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,439
a lavender sweetness at the end of it

720
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,278
and he runs organic living soil so

721
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,798
that seemed to bring that out all right

722
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,200
ladies and gentlemen boys and girls that

723
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,119
