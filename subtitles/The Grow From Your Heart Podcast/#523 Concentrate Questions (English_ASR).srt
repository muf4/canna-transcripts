00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,390
by talking about what i'm smoking today

23
00:00:55,109 --> 00:00:59,939
I've been taking dad's of orange

24
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,460
skittles live batter from apothecary

25
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:05,308
farms on the package it says the potency

26
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,769
is sixty six point seven percent THC and

27
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:10,670
seventy seven point two percent total

28
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:13,259
cannabinoids this concentrate smells

29
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:15,599
disgustingly delicious it is almost

30
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:17,490
overwhelmingly citrusy there's a

31
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,399
sweetness there's a funkiness to it

32
00:01:17,489 --> 00:01:22,438
orange skittles describes it perfectly I

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,570
really love the flavor it's got a really

34
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:26,279
nice buzz it lingers on the tongue for a

35
00:01:24,569 --> 00:01:28,500
really long time so if you take a nice

36
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,969
dab and if you don't take a drink it'll

37
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:32,609
just hang out on your mouth and you get

38
00:01:29,969 --> 00:01:34,590
that nice orange e citrusy lemon kind of

39
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,509
a flavor to it it really hangs out for a

40
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,310
while then the buzz is really like

41
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:40,109
straight to the face straight to the

42
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,700
brain it's got me a little bit goofy a

43
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:43,618
little bit forgetful but I'm kind of

44
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,540
like that anyway so I'm good at this I'm

45

00:06:13,689 --> 00:06:17,439
which is hard to find these days a lot

166
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,870
of people just forgot all about manners

167
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,629
and rules but I really respect humidor

168
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,478
and he asked a great question on my

169
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:27,939
youtube channel the question goes a lot

170
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:30,939
alike at this it says Rasta Jeff

171
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,899
Congrats on six years thank you bro I

172
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:34,089
appreciate that

173
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:36,189
it goes on to say now if you had to put

174
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:37,389
all of the dabs together and weigh them

175
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:39,879
how much would it be

176
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:40,870
and also how long would it take you to

177
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:44,199
dab

178
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:45,490
that pile in one go so if you listen to

179
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,319
the podcast you know that at the

180
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,240
beginning of every episode I take a

181
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:51,519
couple of dabs it is kind of a tradition

182
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,170
I sit down if the podcast gear lined up

183
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,000
I get my notes together and then a

184
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,439
couple of minutes before I record I like

185
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,899
to take a couple of dabs and get my

186
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,730
brain moving or sometimes stop it from

187
00:06:58,899 --> 00:07:02,799
moving depends on what I'm smoking and

188
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,180
where I start off and if you listen you

189
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,800
know it's become a tradition that I do

190
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:09,009
start the show by talking about what I'm

191
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,530
smoking so the question is in six years

192
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:14,259
of podcasting if you put all of the dabs

193
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:15,789
together how much would it weigh and

194
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,740
then the second question is how long

195
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,110
would it take to smoke it all in one go

196
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,509
I thought this was a funny and

197
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:25,150
interesting question so I decided to

198
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:26,769
tackle this with some stoner math when I

199
00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:29,139
read this there were five hundred and

200
00:07:26,769 --> 00:07:30,279
twenty episodes so my math goes a little

201
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:32,529
bit like this

202
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:35,139
there are approximately five hundred and

203
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:37,719
twenty episodes to date I take a quarter

204
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,389
to a half gram dab to start each episode

205
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,360
that makes approximately two hundred and

206
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:46,479
sixty grams if I take one or two dabs

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,850
before each show then I said that is

208
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:52,090
unlikely because I probably take closer

209
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:56,530
to two or four dabs so it's possibly up

210
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:59,349
to 520 grams of pre-show dabs so

211
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:03,279
approximately 520 grams have been dead

212
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:05,460
just before the show then I added on to

213
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,559
that there is more it says I've had

214
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:12,009
davon granny Maddie and Spence the

215
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,410
Tirpitz crew sloppy barefoot and a host

216
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:16,779
of other heavy dabbers on the show who

217
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,720
have all helped increase our consumption

218
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:22,269
they probably smoked another full pound

219
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,370
during the pre-show and on air smoke

220
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:25,870
sessions think about all of the people

221
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:30,100
who have joined me on the show

222
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:31,509
Mike Jessi Sean barefoot grower ah Chris

223
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:33,129
and Lindsay used to be on the show all

224
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:34,779
the time their friend Shannon came on

225
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:37,179
the show a couple of times

226
00:08:34,779 --> 00:08:39,459
sloppy has been here Joe has been here

227
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:41,439
we've had a garden of Weeden crew comes

228
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,060
and just smokes down we've had a gang of

229
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,920
people Clint is like the only one that

230
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:47,349
doesn't smoke dabs everybody that's been

231
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:50,259
on the show I think has come and taken

232
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,940
to dab on the show maybe Becca didn't

233
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:53,319
take a dab from elevate now that I think

234
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:54,670
about it she doesn't dab but there were

235
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,440
very few people

236
00:08:54,669 --> 00:09:00,219
did not take dabs while they were on the

237
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:03,010
show so I have probably smoked 520 grams

238
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,139
of pre-show dabs myself and I'm going to

239
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:08,439
guess that the crew the gang has smoked

240
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:10,629
at least another pound on their own so

241
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,050
my reply was my short answer is one

242
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:15,070
pound to myself and two pounds total

243
00:09:13,049 --> 00:09:17,199
that would make sense to me without

244
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:19,960
sounding like I'm exaggerating or trying

245
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,030
to overinflate it and that is just the

246
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:23,620
pre-show dabs that's when we all sit

247
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,759
down and say are you ready to do a show

248
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,620
and everybody gets here and we

249
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:28,120
congregated the table and then we start

250
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,009
pulling out the rig and the torch and we

251
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,269
all have a little smoke session and then

252
00:09:30,009 --> 00:09:33,580
we get a little bit silly and there's

253
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:35,559
always a moment of silence this oh [ __ ]

254
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,879
we all just got way high and then that's

255
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:38,409
when I've got to go you guys ready to

256
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,779
record and then everybody goes oh [ __ ]

257
00:09:38,409 --> 00:09:43,389
we got to do this so that is just our

258
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:45,490
pre-show and on air dabs I'm going to

259
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:47,529
say a pound for me and then another

260
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,870
pound for all of the crew because I've

261
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:52,120
been here for every episode if I had to

262
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:54,879
guess I've probably only had a guest on

263
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:57,129
probably a quarter to a third of every

264
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,399
episode and most of those were probably

265
00:09:57,129 --> 00:10:02,769
Mike and he doesn't take big enough dabs

266
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,899
or enough dabs to make too much of a

267
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:07,779
dent in the concentrate pile I'm sure

268
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,860
over 520 episodes if he was on a quarter

269
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,919
of them that's a little over a hundred

270
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,180
episodes probably take a point to dab

271
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,589
that would add up eventually he's

272
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,539
probably smoked a couple grams on the

273
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,090
show but not as significant as myself

274
00:10:16,539 --> 00:10:21,189
anyway I'm rambling I thought that was a

275
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,350
really fun and entertaining question big

276
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:26,050
shot it's my buddy humidor and the

277
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:28,990
flavors on the YouTube I think he's

278
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:30,849
fueling door Chiba door on Instagram and

279
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,789
be sure to give him a follow and check

280
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:36,190
us out on the embracing organics podcast

281
00:10:33,789 --> 00:10:38,919
live every Thursday on the YouTube

282
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,300
channel um there was a follow up to this

283
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:42,909
question and said how long would it take

284
00:10:40,299 --> 00:10:46,389
to smoke all of this over again in one

285
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:48,159
go that is a ridiculous question imagine

286
00:10:46,389 --> 00:10:50,799
smoking one to two pounds of

287
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,230
concentrates in one go what is

288
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,599
considered one go so I did reply to that

289
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:57,399
I said how many naps do I get to take in

290
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,710
this one go because that is a lot of

291
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,720
dabs and then I said honestly I think my

292
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:04,000
throat would burn out before I get too

293
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,830
high to function I don't think my lungs

294
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,110
and my throat would be interested in

295
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:08,620
dabbing about a quarter pound into that

296
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,060
we would all

297
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,980
be looking at each other like let's just

298
00:11:10,059 --> 00:11:13,629
give up and go eat something I think

299
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,370
after that many concentrates and that

300
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:17,559
many dabs everybody would just want like

301
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,820
a mango smoothie or something nice on

302
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:20,379
the throat that Maitre throat feel

303
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:23,140
better your throats gonna hurt after

304
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:25,120
that many dabs so I would probably burn

305
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:27,490
out my lungs in my body before my brain

306
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,110
got too high to function but I'm down to

307
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:31,360
give it a try if you want to bring me

308
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,279
two pounds of concentrates and set them

309
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,409
here on the table you can smoke one and

310
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,449
all smoke one and we can see how far

311
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:39,279
into these pounds of concentrates we can

312
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,650
get before we just decide to give up and

313
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:44,289
go get food it sounds like a good time I

314
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,569
do continue my comment I think I said if

315
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:49,120
I smoke my one pound portion by myself I

316
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,520
could comfortably smoke one to two grams

317
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,519
per day if it was a challenge I could

318
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,439
smoke three to seven grams a day without

319
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,210
overmedicating if I had to conserve one

320
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,250
gram per day is sufficient so right now

321
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:03,040
when we're quarantined I'm trying to

322
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,110
stay on one gram per day my standard

323
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,639
normal comfortable level is about a gram

324
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,680
and a half to two and a half grams a day

325
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,879
that's just because it's available to me

326
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,539
it's right there I could just smoke it

327
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:16,779
if I was going in if it's like 4:20 or

328
00:12:13,539 --> 00:12:18,969
Friday I could smoke like three grams no

329
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:21,279
problem if I was really trying I could

330
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,230
do three to seven grams in a day if we

331
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,759
were going in like if you're like how

332
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,769
much do you think you could smoke bro I

333
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,470
could probably take down ten of these

334
00:12:26,769 --> 00:12:32,559
apothecary one gram jars or ten of these

335
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,940
uh Green Dot labs one gram jars and then

336
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:36,729
I could take down ten of them in a day

337
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:39,100
by myself if I have friends over those

338
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:40,960
numbers change drastically of course

339
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,790
depending on who the friends are if it's

340
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,769
Clint the dabs don't move if it's Matt

341
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:46,839
he takes little dabs if it's Mike he

342
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,610
takes little dabs but some of my friends

343
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,110
they'll come over and they'll get globby

344
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,730
and they're welcome to do it that's what

345
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,110
I invite them over for I want to make

346
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,389
them cough out or watch them change

347
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:56,950
colors that's always a good time so that

348
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,449
was a great question once again big

concentrates are working or they're not

388
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:18,190
we may take a break and rip a dab here

00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:27,459
you for the great email it goes on to

393
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:29,139
say I have a couple of questions and

394
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,740
I'll try to keep them short and to the

395
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:31,360
point

396
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:33,639
thank you that is a really good way to

397
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,860
get your question on the show and goes

398
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,269
on to say first what is the best way to

399
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:42,310
store both BHO and hash for long term

400
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:44,350
preservations of terpenes and THC and

401
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:46,029
other cannabinoids and volatile

402
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,710
compounds I may have added a couple of

403
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:50,049
words to that sentence but we're close

404
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:52,509
enough it also says I like to keep a

405
00:14:50,049 --> 00:14:55,089
wide variety of flavors at one time and

406
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:57,129
I like to periodically dab on each one

407
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:59,350
so each gram lasts me about two months

408
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,870
because it's not being dabbed on every

409
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,639
day I have a wine cooler that I'm able

410
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,879
to control the humidity on so I'm

411
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,730
wondering what the best option is um men

412
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:12,429
you remind me a lot of myself and a lot

413
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:14,710
of Mike my concentrates do not last me

414
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:16,449
nearly as long as yours but when I go to

415
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,040
the store I do try to get one of that

416
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,720
one one of that one one of that one one

417
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:21,819
of that one and the next time I do the

418
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,820
same thing I go before I run out so I do

419
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,620
have a nice buffet of concentrates on my

420
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:28,750
table I've got some Mambo Kush I got a

421
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:29,919
cowboy cush I got soul cleaner I got GG

422
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:33,250
for there's Bruce Banner

423
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,659
I got orange skittles there's five on it

424
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:35,669
I got a whole bunch of there's more

425
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:38,279
shit's in here there's so

426
00:15:35,669 --> 00:15:39,779
Diezel I got a bunch of stuff I like

427
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:42,209
having the buffet in the variety just

428
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:43,829
like yourself but I kind of I put two or

429
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:45,810
three of them on the table and I mix and

430
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:47,910
smoke those is I feel like it and when

431
00:15:45,809 --> 00:15:49,349
run one runs out I grab more we'll talk

432
00:15:47,909 --> 00:15:51,389
about where I get them from in just a

433
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,700
moment but also Mike will go to the

434
00:15:51,389 --> 00:15:54,929
store and buy a couple of grams of

435
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,230
concentrates and I've talked about

436
00:15:54,929 --> 00:16:01,139
Mike's dad habits before he takes dabs

437
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:02,759
for ants I think GI Joe may be happy

438
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,860
with the size of a dab that Mike takes

439
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:07,409
GI Joe would still be like bro can I get

440
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:09,090
a dad and GI Joe is three and a quarter

441
00:16:07,409 --> 00:16:11,370
inches tall that's what I'm saying guys

442
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:13,080
Mike likes a little tiny dab so Michael

443
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,029
go buy a couple of grams of concentrates

444
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,290
and he won't smoke them it'll take him a

445
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:18,029
month he'll bring them here and tried to

446
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:19,589
get me to help him smoke it I feel bad

447
00:16:18,029 --> 00:16:21,000
digging into his concentrate like that

448
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,920
I'm like I don't want to smoke 1/2 gram

449
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,419
dab out of your jar and he's like do it

450
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:26,549
buddy cuz I'm not gonna smoke it and

451
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:28,469
then he'll go to the dispensary again to

452
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:30,149
buy flour and he'll get more concentrate

453
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,040
just cuz he's there and so he ends up

454
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:33,299
with several jars of concentrates and

455
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,669
he's got the collection a lot like

456
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:38,189
yourself now you say that you have got a

457
00:16:35,669 --> 00:16:40,259
wine cooler available to yourself to

458
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,240
keep the concentrates in you'll notice

459
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,009
that when you go to I don't know where

460
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,769
you're from so maybe you won't notice I

461
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:48,899
notice that when I go to a dispensary a

462
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:51,360
quality dispensary will keep their

463
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:54,269
quality concentrates in a refrigerator

464
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,250
many of them have purchased the it looks

465
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:59,490
like a cooler where you would keep sodas

466
00:16:56,250 --> 00:17:02,070
or food type products on display in a a

467
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:03,539
smaller store and I like the big grocery

468
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,860
store but like a convenience store maybe

469
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:06,839
where you get some ice creams or

470
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:08,459
something out of the gas station cooler

471
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,869
they're nice-looking coolers they don't

472
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,309
look trashy but they're smaller than the

473
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:12,959
big industrial but they're nice-looking

474
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:14,369
and they open the door and they pull out

475
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,720
they slide the door to the side they

476
00:17:14,369 --> 00:17:17,729
pull off the concentrates out of there

477
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,990
some of them have the glass front is

478
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:21,089
nice and painted I'm thinking of

479
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,170
apothecary they got that cooler door

480
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:24,419
that's nicely painted with the

481
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,130
apothecary logo on there and then inside

482
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:28,140
that cooler they pop it open and all of

483
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:29,940
the jars are inside of smaller

484
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,990
containers and nicely labeled so they

485
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,880
could just pull out what they need

486
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:35,700
really quickly so you'll notice that

487
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,530
they do keep them in a cooler most of

488
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,720
the compounds in our concentrates do

489
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:41,220
volatize at higher temperatures so it is

490
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,710
better to keep them at a lower

491
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,120
temperature one thing I will mention if

492
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,039
you're going to keep them in the cooler

493
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,859
is make sure they are sealed we don't

494
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,720
want to get any moisture to them

495
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,699
if you've got the crisper drawer that is

496
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,410
an ideal spot I put most of my

497
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,150
concentrates in the little spot where

498
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:57,620
you can put cheese or eggs because I

499
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:59,750
don't fill my fridge with a lot of dairy

500
00:17:57,619 --> 00:18:01,009
products so I've got all that space when

501
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,990
you swing the fridge open there's a

502
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:04,250
little drawer thing that the top slides

503
00:18:02,990 --> 00:18:06,170
up and it's just filled with

504
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,690
high-quality concentrates it is

505
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:10,759
basically my version of the apocalypse

506
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,590
Reserve that is my order stash as long

507
00:18:10,759 --> 00:18:15,019
as I've got concentrates and seeds

508
00:18:12,589 --> 00:18:17,178
everything else will be okay so the

509
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:19,160
crisper drawer or that little the dairy

510
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,509
drawer if you've got one that slides up

511
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,429
and down that is a great spot for the

512
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,259
concentrates but make sure they stay dry

513
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:26,059
don't let them get moist make sure the

514
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:27,980
jar is tightly sealed if they're gonna

515
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:29,690
be in there for a while maybe put it

516
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,429
inside of another container put it in a

517
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,860
Tupperware then throw that in the

518
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:35,990
crisper drawer also I've said this about

519
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:37,939
seeds before if you were going to get

520
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,529
something really cool in the

521
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:40,850
refrigerator and then take it out and

522
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:42,289
open it and let it get to room

523
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:44,240
temperature and then put it back and

524
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:46,428
open it you do get the option of

525
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,169
condensation and moisture happening

526
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:50,179
because of the temperature change from

527
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:53,210
moving it in and out of the cool to the

528
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:56,150
warm I recommend if you're gonna move it

529
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:57,679
in and out just keep it out or leave it

530
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:59,059
in just get out what you need for the

531
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,769
next two or three days have those

532
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:02,000
sitting on the table for you to dab and

533
00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:03,619
put the rest in the cooler

534
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,019
don't keep taking it out putting it away

535
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:07,308
especially if it's getting like nice and

536
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:09,619
really cool to wear you can cause

537
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:11,240
moisture or condensation you'll know

538
00:19:09,619 --> 00:19:12,949
that moisture level you'll see it on a

539
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:15,259
lot of the jars when you take it out

540
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:16,850
it'll get like frosty and foggy that is

541
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,039
when you've got the opportunity to get

542
00:19:16,849 --> 00:19:21,019
concentrate no to get condensation in

543
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,460
your concentration that's a lot of words

544
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:24,950
to think about you guys with very

545
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,419
minimal notes there is more to this let

546
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:28,130
me get myself back on track as I'm

547
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:31,040
[ __ ] high and rambly from the orange

548
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:32,419
skittles dabs all right I found my place

549
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,879
thank you for being patient with me it

550
00:19:32,419 --> 00:19:36,799
says in this same question as far as

551
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,230
hash and rosin do you recommend the

552
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,099
freezer or the fridge for long-term

553
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,929
storage

554
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:44,779
I recommend the fridge I know some kids

555
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:47,900
put the rosin in the freezer I am NOT an

556
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:50,389
expert or a connoisseur or much of a

557
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:52,280
consumer when it comes to rosin I don't

558
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,890
buy rosin if somebody gives it to me I

559
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:56,298
will gladly enjoy it appreciate it and

560
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:00,230
dab the [ __ ] out of it it's not

561
00:19:56,298 --> 00:20:02,710
something I go shopping for I prefer BHO

562
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,808
I like batter I like sauce I like dime

563
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:07,899
I liked a different consistency than the

564
00:20:04,808 --> 00:20:09,460
rosin if it's Pedro rosin I may reach

565
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:11,469
into my pocket and pull out some money

566
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:13,390
for Pedro rosin I may trade him for some

567
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:15,700
seeds but other than that I'm not really

568
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:18,009
interested in rosin so I don't have much

569
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,960
advice when it comes to rosin if it's

570
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:22,240
bubble rosin if it's flour rosin I

571
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,419
really I just have to say I don't know

572
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,609
that is not my wheelhouse at all I don't

573
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:29,380
recommend the freezer for most of the

574
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:31,389
concentrates again because you're going

575
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,159
to get condensation in there so I would

576
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,259
just say the fridge and try to keep it

577
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,700
dry I'm trying to find my place on the

578
00:20:35,259 --> 00:20:39,129
rest of this email there's a lot going

579
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:41,558
on and it's a really small font there we

580
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:44,500
go next piece next question so I've been

581
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:46,058
smoking for about the last seven years I

582
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,859
feel I've gotten to the point where I

583
00:20:46,058 --> 00:20:49,750
don't feel the different effects from

584
00:20:47,859 --> 00:20:52,479
different strains and it's somewhat

585
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:54,308
upsets me I really only dab now and

586
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,110
every other time no matter if I'm

587
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:58,538
dabbing something new that's a heavy

588
00:20:56,109 --> 00:21:01,418
sativa or a heavy indica I kind of just

589
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:03,429
get stoned really the only effects I

590
00:21:01,419 --> 00:21:06,309
feel are in my eyes and how slow and

591
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:08,259
lethargic I feel I don't remember the

592
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:10,148
last time I had an energetic high or

593
00:21:08,259 --> 00:21:12,579
felt any sort of effect other than just

594
00:21:10,148 --> 00:21:14,619
that stone to feeling I appreciate your

595
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:16,538
time and everything you do feel free to

596
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:18,969
say my name if either question happens

597
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:20,919
to make it to the show from your friend

598
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:23,679
Matt hey Matt big shout out because your

599
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:25,259
whole email made it to the show I'm not

600
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,490
sure what to say about your

601
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:29,829
disappointment in your tolerance level

602
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:31,839
other than to say maybe take a break for

603
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:34,470
a few days bro that is we call that a

604
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,970
tolerance break we call it a reset your

605
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,069
cannabinoid receptors your terpene

606
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:40,390
receptors they're [ __ ] fool dude you

607
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,889
gotta let them dry out for a little

608
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:43,299
while you gotta let it kind of get

609
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:44,950
sensitive again you've been playing with

610
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:46,298
it too much bro give it a rest you're

611
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,890
gonna go blind if you keep playing with

612
00:21:46,298 --> 00:21:49,658
it you know what I'm saying so you've

613
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,700
either got to take a break or you've got

614
00:21:49,659 --> 00:21:53,528
to step up the quality of your product

615
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,960
you're saying that you're not getting

616
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:57,609
the desired buzz maybe there's something

617
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,038
in your body that your body's just going

618
00:21:57,609 --> 00:22:02,019
I'm tired of smoking there are occasions

619
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:03,730
occasional periods in my life where my

620
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:05,408
body goes you don't need to smoke so

621
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,000
much this week dude [ __ ] settle down

622
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:08,528
what are you trying to do like you're

623
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,148
not gonna enjoy the high I'm gonna make

624
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:11,528
your body not enjoy this high you're

625
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:13,089
gonna feel something uncomfortable

626
00:22:11,528 --> 00:22:14,710
because there are other things you need

627
00:22:13,089 --> 00:22:16,148
to worry about you need to hydrate you

628
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,690
need to get some vitamins in you think

629
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:18,729
about something

630
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,140
transits of minerals been in a couple of

631
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,579
days when you fix all this dumb [ __ ]

632
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:25,420
going on with your body then we can take

633
00:22:21,579 --> 00:22:27,369
some dabs or maybe maybe this is worst

634
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,050
case scenario maybe you've got a medical

635
00:22:27,369 --> 00:22:30,609
condition that your body hasn't told you

636
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:32,980
about yet maybe you haven't identified

637
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:34,599
something maybe smoking is aiming at

638
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,829
that medical condition I've always said

639
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:36,639
that if something hurts or if you've got

640
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:38,409
a problem

641
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,960
and you smoke cannabis or you consume

642
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:42,820
cannabis that your body and the cannabis

643
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,110
have a talk and it goes oh your shoulder

644
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,609
hurts I'm gonna go over here to the

645
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:47,109
shoulder rub rub rub rub rub and it

646
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:49,449
makes your shoulder feel better but it

647
00:22:47,109 --> 00:22:51,069
forgets to get you stoned a lot like how

648
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,930
I feel if you take pharmaceuticals if

649
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:54,519
you've got real pain and you take some

650
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:56,200
pharmaceuticals those pharmaceuticals

651
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:57,339
make your knee not hurt that you had

652
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,200
surgery on but if you don't have a

653
00:22:57,339 --> 00:23:00,459
painful knee you're gonna get all [ __ ]

654
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,470
up because you don't have any pain for

655
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,690
that to work on I think cannabis kind of

656
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:06,279
does that as well maybe you got to go to

657
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,230
the doctor and get your check your

658
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:09,789
health checked out are you okay see

659
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,170
what's going on it's always a good idea

660
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,970
to go get your health check no matter

661
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:14,440
how old how young how hell do you feel

662
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:16,480
go see what's going on

663
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:19,029
so tolerance break may be the first

664
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,009
issue step up your dabs step up your

665
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:22,899
quality may be the second move third

666
00:23:21,009 --> 00:23:24,579
make sure nothing else is wrong there's

667
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,530
all your blood work looking good are you

668
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:28,779
healthy are you happy maybe it's just

669
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:30,309
time to take a weed break you're saying

670
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:32,019
that you're getting red eyed and too

671
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:33,579
lethargic I'm wondering if that's a

672
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,990
strain that you're smoking if you're

673
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,819
getting your product from the same place

674
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:38,829
all the time or if your body has just

675
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:41,470
burned out on smoking cannabis because

676
00:23:38,829 --> 00:23:42,759
those are like the two least desirable

677
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:44,350
effects when it comes to smoking

678
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:46,000
cannabis you don't need bright red eyes

679
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,379
and then who wants to be lazy and

680
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,200
lethargic you're right I do like that

681
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:52,210
nice energetic buzz so maybe if you

682
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,170
smoked something a little more quality

683
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:54,400
and I don't know where you're getting

684
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,900
your product I don't know what you're

685
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,390
smoking I don't mean to sound like a

686
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,500
snob or disrespectful or anything you

687
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:00,430
sound like you know what you're talking

688
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,859
about because you're talking about

689
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,539
different kinds of concentrates but also

690
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:06,009
maybe your drawing all of it maybe

691
00:24:04,539 --> 00:24:07,779
you're letting it go long enough to

692
00:24:06,009 --> 00:24:09,549
where it kind of starts to degrade and

693
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,619
you're getting that more down of a buzz

694
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:13,509
I'm not sure I don't have those details

695
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:15,819
I'm just guessing and trying to offer

696
00:24:13,509 --> 00:24:18,250
opinions I don't know where you are but

697
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:20,409
come take a dab of this orange skittles

698
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,849
batter and see if this one [ __ ] you up

699
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,769
and gets you talkative it makes you

700
00:24:21,849 --> 00:24:25,419
energetic like it does me and that is a

701
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:27,009
good spot to start we'll pay attention

702
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:28,930
to you we can make you like our own

703
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,129
stoned a little science experiment I'll

704
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,509
let you borrow my woops tray

705
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:33,520
we'll see how your heart rate goes we'll

706
00:24:31,509 --> 00:24:34,329
see how you sleep we'll feed you to take

707
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,849
good care of you

708
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:37,980
for science bro for science all right

709
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:41,230
Matt I hope I answered your question

710
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:43,058
sufficiently I feel like I got the first

711
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,558
part of it down pretty good the storage

712
00:24:43,058 --> 00:24:46,119
of the concentrates don't let them get

713
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:48,190
condensation but do keep them in the

714
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:49,989
fridge and then as far as your tolerance

715
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:52,029
you may have to take a little break my

716
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,130
dude clean out your body flush out the

717
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:55,869
system reset get your brain and your

718
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:57,640
body all started fresh clean out the

719
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,409
filters then let's dirty them all up all

720
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,940
over again and it will feel good to

721
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,440
clean out your body it'll feel really

722
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,840
good for your mental and physical health

723
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,308
then if that's not what you want to do

724
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:08,529
maybe step up the quality your

725
00:25:06,308 --> 00:25:10,000
concentrates and then also go the doctor

726
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:12,308
and see if something else is [ __ ] you

727
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,890
up also here's another idea are you

728
00:25:12,308 --> 00:25:16,960
eating too much or drinking too much

729
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,429
caffeine is there too much sugar too

730
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,558
much caffeine in your diet that's kind

731
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,990
of overriding the buzz I caught myself

732
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,730
playing the the juggle game I would wake

733
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,589
up and I would take two or three dabs

734
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,329
and then about an hour later when the

735
00:25:26,589 --> 00:25:30,038
buzz wore off I'd be like [ __ ] I'm done

736
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:31,808
I just want to go take a nap so my

737
00:25:30,038 --> 00:25:34,089
response was to go to Starbucks and get

738
00:25:31,808 --> 00:25:35,710
a giant [ __ ] coffee and then after I

739
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:37,000
drank about half of that coffee I can

740
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:38,679
feel my heart trying to beat out of my

741
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,329
chest and my hands would get shaky and

742
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:41,798
I'd get a little bit anxious and I'd be

743
00:25:40,329 --> 00:25:44,500
like [ __ ] I need a dad I'm Way too

744
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:46,418
jittery so I'd go take two dabs and then

745
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,700
about an hour later I'd say [ __ ] those

746
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:50,380
dabs warmia I'm crashing from the coffee

747
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,179
so I chug the second half of the coffee

748
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:54,190
and then 30 minutes later you're going

749
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:55,960
holy [ __ ] I can hear my heartbeat I

750
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,100
gotta go take two more dabs and then you

751
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,870
go take two dad's you know you're

752
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:00,969
crashing from that caffeine buzz and

753
00:25:58,869 --> 00:26:02,529
you're [ __ ] stoned as [ __ ] and I

754
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,538
caught myself like just doing this weird

755
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:06,730
constant battle and then I was giving

756
00:26:04,538 --> 00:26:08,619
myself like my body was hurting and I

757
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:10,750
was getting anxiety and I felt like [ __ ]

758
00:26:08,619 --> 00:26:12,699
and sometimes I would lay down to go to

759
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,679
bed at night and I could feel my

760
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:16,750
heartbeat in my toes and I could heal my

761
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:18,519
hear my heartbeat in my ears and I knew

762
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:20,890
that [ __ ] wasn't right and it was from

763
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:22,960
the constant battle all day of Starbucks

764
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,759
versus dabs which is gonna win and

765
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,460
neither one of them were gonna win but I

766
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:29,109
was gonna lose so I cut out the [ __ ]

767
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,120
Starbucks I'm not cutting out the dabs

768
00:26:29,109 --> 00:26:33,038
that that's that's cool no you're crazy

769
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,288
but I cut out the Starbucks I cut out

770
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:36,819
all of the dr. pepper I've cut out most

771
00:26:35,288 --> 00:26:39,069
of the sugar I've cut out most of the

772
00:26:36,819 --> 00:26:41,710
crap in my diet and when I did that I

773
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:43,099
noticed I started getting ridiculously

774
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,679
higher like now

775
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:47,779
not battling my dabs with constant

776
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,570
caffeine and constant sugar I'm able to

777
00:26:47,779 --> 00:26:52,910
get a real serious buzz going on and it

778
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:54,439
lasts longer and it feels better so that

779
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:56,480
could be something that is [ __ ] up

780

your buzz all right Matt thanks again

827
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:46,669
looking for me so it was clear from

828

birth and was prepared for the earth to

00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:51,169
