71
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:30,169
talked about dosage on the podcast of

72
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,319
edibles and apparently I recommended too

73
00:02:30,169 --> 00:02:35,269
much because this guy said that his

74
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:37,339
girlfriend was nearly tripping from the

75
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,130

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,409
remember what you recommend oh no no I

77
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:44,120
don't but I think we're supposed to

78
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:48,109
recommend five or ten milligrams I think

79
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,689
I said 25 I think I said 25 um yeah I

80
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,270

81
00:02:50,689 --> 00:02:56,000
tell people oh you've been smoking flour

82
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:59,060

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,629

84
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:02,150

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,769
dosage if you're gonna consume edibles

106
00:03:46,449 --> 00:03:49,689
and it's your first time in you're a

107
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:51,969
noob you should probably stick with 10

108
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:53,139
milligrams to start wait about an hour

109
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:55,239
if you don't feel anything

110
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:56,139
wait another hour and eat ten more her

111
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,349
do you think we should tell him to eat

112
00:03:56,139 --> 00:04:02,559
Oh an hour to eat one ten wait two hours

113
00:03:59,348 --> 00:04:03,848
two hours alright after two hours that

114
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,439
will have had time for your stomach to

115
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:08,109
break it down process it through your

116
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,419
liver and get it into your blood don't

117
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,069
eat more before that first windows up if

118
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,789
that window hits and you never felt

119
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:17,858
anything go ahead and step your dose up

120
00:04:14,789 --> 00:04:19,629
but something shoulda cake or ate cake

121
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:21,209
day and you just might not have never

122
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:23,709
gonna say something I want to mention is

123
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:25,180
often times I'll eat some edibles as I'm

124
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:26,529
getting ready to go somewhere to be like

125

127
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,459
wherever you're going and you're like oh

128
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,598

remember that you can't hurt yourself

167
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:54,629
with weed you can scare yourself because

168

180
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,250
little bit there you go you know and get

181
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,709
some food in yet I had a bad apples

182
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:25,920
experience about my third edible that I

183
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:28,529
consumed was a Dixie elixirs 75

184
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:31,439
milligrams soda the drinks a drink and

185
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:33,179
it was come on strong and it was really

186
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,699
way too heavy and I had like about a

187
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:37,590
four-hour panic attack Wow and now this

188
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,769
is you know being a daily smoker for

189
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:43,379
over 15 years yeah and at that point I'd

190
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:46,139
been dabbing daily for about three or

191
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:48,269
four months so I was not a novice in any

192
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,949
way plenty of THC honey vyx perience

193
00:06:48,269 --> 00:06:52,169
holy Christ oh yeah edibles are really

194
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:55,500
strange and like when I first started

195
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:58,680
doing edibles sometimes and those like

196
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,750
so the first five attempts it would take

197
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,480
like six to eight hours to kick in oh

198
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,939
wow yeah well you're a bigger dude yeah

199
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,980
well slow metabolism yeah so it really

200
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:11,430
varies depending on the person they hit

201
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:13,230
me oh I can swallow a damn edible and

202
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,850
feel it coming on now oh [ __ ] here if

203
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,379
it's more than 30 minutes it's it's

204
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:18,379
[ __ ] and I'm taking it back

205
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,689
because I mean they come on right away

206
00:07:20,129 --> 00:07:23,279
now and I'm about at a hundred

207
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:24,779
milligrams it's where I need to be for a

208
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,579
dose okay and

209
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:30,839
that's that's very effective for me but

210
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:33,629
now I take that to go to bed Nobles I

211
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,549
have a you know an edible at night to go

212
00:07:33,629 --> 00:07:37,079
to bed helps with my pain about how how

213
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,030
long before bedtime

214
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:40,379
Duke inside an hour okay that's what I

215
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:42,839
would recommend also all right we're on

216
00:07:40,379 --> 00:07:46,230
the same page here there's a recent news

217
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:48,779
story up out of Denver that the people

218
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:50,610
going to the ER for marijuana related

219
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,879
reasons are predominantly from out of

220
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:55,020
state yeah and this is why well they go

221
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,639
to the store they don't listen to the

222
00:07:55,019 --> 00:08:01,139
budtender they eat the whole incredible

223
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:03,240
bar and they end up fried and they don't

224
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,810

229
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,079

231

you just don't know what to do anymore

233
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:27,299
also you know when I lived in Texas

234
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,450
because of price constraints I was about

235
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:35,330
a gram a day smoker right and flowers

236
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:35,330
are happy flowers okay holy flowers okay

237
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:43,918
that's my cord you just a little bit

238
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,379

239
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,210
yeah really touching that can plug ya

240
00:08:46,379 --> 00:08:50,039
know anyway um it was just more of a

241
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,879
cost thing you know cuz it's [ __ ]

242
00:08:50,039 --> 00:08:52,829
expensive oh yeah

243
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:54,870
and it amazed I better so you have to

244
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,430
you know you have to budget so I was you

245
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,889
know I've smoked about a gram of flowers

246
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:00,838
a day and when I could get concentrates

247
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:03,299
I would get him but there were few and

248
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,920
far between never very expensive I might

249
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,509
smell like sixty bucks and he isn't

250
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:09,750
isn't it like a grandma concentrate a

251
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:11,279
felony in Texas yes yeah okay yeah so

252
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,860
this table right here we could all go to

253
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,059
prison oh we would be dude I could just

254
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,889
shoot us they don't play with

255
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:21,989
concentrates maybe the might we'll look

256
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:27,179
look at what they had you got it come on

257
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:30,089
we were afraid for our lives yeah yeah I

258
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:31,829
mean but you know yeah you know the

259
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:33,990
quality also varied a lot with that

260
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:37,470
yeah you know it was the illegal state

261
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:39,060
so my you know the levels of THC I had

262
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,440
my body then were not what they are now

263
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,449
and if you're coming from out of state

264
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,070
here especially from a state where it's

265
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:46,470
still illegal right you're not a medical

266
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,528
user yeah edibles are a whole different

267
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:51,240
world they sell a 350 milligram aníbal

268
00:09:49,528 --> 00:09:52,528
and it's a tiny little thing and I think

269
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,209
that's a little dangerous

270
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:55,980
hey that could be dangerous for me I

271
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:59,039
hate that on a podcast and if I didn't

272
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,539
have this chair away like this chair and

273
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,039
computer and table or all that kept me

274
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:03,929
on this planet that's hilarious

275
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:06,838
it's just people got to realize that

276
00:10:03,929 --> 00:10:08,429
it's edibles are a different kind of

277
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,380
high it's not like smoking like it's

278
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,000
it's real easy to notice you've had

279
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,980
enough and stop hitting the joint as it

280
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,019
goes around the circle

281
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:19,470
you can't honey drugs I say that won't

282
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,700
work once once you decide that you're

283
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:22,200
gonna eat it you're on that roller

284
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,240
coaster and so it comes to a complete

285
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,440
snap

286
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,259
there's no eject button in the middle

287
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,519
and you just have to ride it out like

288
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,259
unfortunately you really can't like

289
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,990
you're gonna wake up tomorrow yeah

290
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:37,799

most you've ever eaten was gonna be my

341
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:47,338
big question on 250 or 300 and that's

342
00:12:44,688 --> 00:12:50,188
just what I know from the rec market

343
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:52,110
like god only knows what used to go into

344
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:58,230
these mom remember back in the day when

345
00:12:52,110 --> 00:13:01,230
Karen oh dude oh my god yeah

346
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,629
so we have a friend who was a grown-ass

347
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,278
man who ate one of those and fell down

348
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:06,959
some stairs and knocked me down the

349
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,698
bottom portion of those stairs because

350
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,500
he was too high to function and I was

351
00:13:08,698 --> 00:13:12,508
too high to save myself once he hit me

352
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,188
he fell down and I took me got bowling

353
00:13:12,509 --> 00:13:15,329
pin yeah yeah just went down the style

354
00:13:14,188 --> 00:13:18,750
and there's only a couple stairs it was

355
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:20,878
fun but this grown man just boo and

356
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:22,379
giggled like a child because this banana

357
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,269
bread was just killing us it was

358
00:13:22,379 --> 00:13:26,100
wrecking us those days were amazing

359
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:27,839
there aren't edibles like that available

360
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,909
in dispensaries I don't think god only

361
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,309
knows how strong though because nothing

362
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:34,078
was figured out as well as it is now you

363
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:36,509
know I do that I make my own sometimes

364
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:40,019
and I made some butter today actually

365
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:47,120
out of well made what I did was I had

366
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:50,039
about ounces of wax okay over time and

367
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,870
so I had all these papers there's still

368
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:53,349
a lot of residual on them oh yeah so I

369
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,629
put them in a slow cooker with

370
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,649
coconut oil I just soaked all that off

371
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:58,809
of them yeah

372
00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:01,600
and then I put you know a big pop up

373
00:13:58,809 --> 00:14:03,699
there you go - and just letting you know

374
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,820
simmer a while now that's in the freezer

375
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:10,030
and you know I'll use that for making

376
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:15,310
some edibles yeah yeah yeah but there's

377
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:19,959
no way to tell how much see what

378
00:14:15,309 --> 00:14:21,669
happened make them small all right so

379
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,990
you Gary was saying now you like to take

380
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:24,849
a hundred milligrams about an hour

381
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:26,649
before bedtime to help you sleep do you

382
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,389
do do you increase that if you want to

383
00:14:26,649 --> 00:14:30,639
get recreational actually I decrease it

384
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:32,319
to get records okay so about a 50

385
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,529
milligram dose because the hundred makes

386
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,330
you sleep you're gonna have to take 200

387
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:39,279
to sleep everything exactly well it's

388
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:41,530
it's a little too much you know right it

389
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,899
puts me out yeah so half of that about

390
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,360
50 sometimes about a 75 makes you a

391
00:14:43,899 --> 00:14:48,250
little if I get those uh peanut butter

392
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,200

394
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:56,259
I like the monkey bar guys if you can

395
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,930
ask and those 35 milligram sections okay

396
00:14:56,259 --> 00:15:00,610
so two of those is seventy that's a good

397
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,679
dose for me all right for a Reno to

398
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,149
function and have a good time okay I

399
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:08,259

405

419
00:15:53,289 --> 00:15:58,149
gave me a good sized portion for my

420
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:00,460
birthday and I ate it and I tried to

421
00:15:58,149 --> 00:16:02,230
drive to work and it kicked in about

422
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,360
three quarters of the way to work and I

423
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:06,120
was like what just happened like I was

424
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,370

milligrams were in that edible - ahh -

431
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,060
Matty I think was [ __ ] tremendous

432
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,820
right it was a hard day at work

433
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,709
everything got done at half speed this

434
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:28,710
is some of the strongest wax I've ever

435
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:33,089
had this the guy who made it had a

436
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:34,470
outdoor groom and he let it cure and it

437
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,680
was beautiful weed and had this great

438
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:40,860
smell it slams breath okay and so it's

439
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:43,739
it was the trim was all cured when he

440
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,210
blew it nice and it tastes good it

441
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,250
smells good I'm kicking myself for not

442
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,509
bringing some for you to try it's so

443
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:51,419
really good and that's what I made

444
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:53,250
though coconut oil with it'll be amazing

445
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:55,289
yeah so it's some of the strongest I've

446
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,549

447

00:18:19,049 --> 00:18:21,779
got a great selection

488
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,700
of affordable rigs they've got brand

489
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:25,079
name rigs they've got hitman rigs in

490
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,000
there they've got D nails in there

491
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,919
they've got highly educated titanium

492
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,089
products dude they've got a product in

493
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,100
there I can't believe I didn't buy while

494
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:34,319
I was there they've got the highly

495
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,909
educated nail with the ceramic bit or

496
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:37,889
not ceramic with the quartz dish on top

497
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,750
so you got the titanium base with the

498
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:41,660
quartz dish on top pretty much

499
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,130
indestructible if you take care of it

500
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,660
go get that that's a badass piece but

501
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:47,700
anyway shots through those places I

502
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:50,040
support them I recommend them if you're

503
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,170
in Colorado Springs also one more big

504
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,629
important message I've been advertising

506
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:57,600

508
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,289
of some logistics in the city of Denver

509
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,029
and things that go on when you're trying

510
00:19:01,289 --> 00:19:05,430
to plan a cannabis event and people try

511
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:08,250
to be [ __ ] but secrets ash on 4/20

512

514
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,640
it's secret sex Colorado on Instagram

515
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:16,379
check that out I think that's all of the

516
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,640
advertising and butt-kissing I've got to

517
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,830
do for the start of the show and now we

518
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:22,920
can get into the topics that I've

519
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:24,269
invited these young men here for it's

520
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,410
like a steel cage match we just looked

521
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:35,400
at both these guys like I was about to

522
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:37,470
ask him if they're ready to fight so the

523
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,060
reason that these guys wanted to get to

524
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:40,769
get they actually both messaged me

525
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,119
wanting to do a podcast on this topic so

526
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:47,190
I love the initiative thank you guys

527
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:48,569
yeah our local anti cannabis groups is

528
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,690
it one group over there multiple groups

529
00:19:48,569 --> 00:19:53,819
involved in this [ __ ] there might be

530
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:56,430
a second group now it could just be the

531
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:58,439
first group using a new name okay well

532
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,330
then let's name either one of the one or

533
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,769
more they don't get any more support

534
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:02,970
unless most other people want to go

535
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:04,950
troll them do you want to mention them

536
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:07,440
so that maybe perhaps people and I I

537
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:09,600
couldn't ask our listeners to go and

538
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,160
troll these people and say creation on

539
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,519
their page but if they did I couldn't

540
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:18,090
stop them or better yet just go correct

541
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,769
their nonsense lately and watch them

542
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:21,299
stew and freak out on you because it

543
00:20:19,769 --> 00:20:22,680
makes them look even worse and they

544
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,450
can't figure out what to say it's really

545
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,730
funny they don't have research at all

546
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:29,009
but I think we'll just give them an easy

547
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:30,870
way to find them just go to your page

548

564
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:03,569
let's talk about uh this local group

565
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:05,579
here is trying to close all of the

566
00:21:03,569 --> 00:21:07,200
recreational cannabis and they doing

567
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:11,009
just record they want to do much well

568
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,269
they want it all gone and if you head

569
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:16,079
over to their page at all and look

570
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:19,739
through their post history medical is a

571
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:22,348
sham it's all a joke and a scam and a

572
00:21:19,739 --> 00:21:25,858
con to make money on the backs of our

573
00:21:22,348 --> 00:21:28,798
children and they want it all gone but

574
00:21:25,858 --> 00:21:31,249
right now they're just focused on

575
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:33,179
getting rid of the rec industry so

576
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:36,690
recreational stores production

577
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:39,298
facilities manufacturers grows testing

578
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:44,609
labs all of it they want it gone yep

579
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:46,190
because because it's bad yeah that's the

580
00:21:44,608 --> 00:21:49,798
only reason I could find on there

581
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:52,679
because drugs are bad I'm okay the one

582
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:55,888
article that kind of got into a little

583
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,349
bit of their reasons they don't like

584
00:21:55,888 --> 00:22:00,928
that there are more homeless people in

585
00:21:58,348 --> 00:22:02,668
the city than there were before they

586
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:06,538
seem to think the crime problem in the

587
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:11,580
city is new and somehow cannabis shops

588
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:15,058
in the county related and they there's

589
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:17,519
another one the tax that the tax

590
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:21,749
proceeds that come in are really really

591
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:23,669
really well reported and they they're

592
00:22:21,749 --> 00:22:26,519
pretty sure that if they get rid of the

593
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:28,409
taxes then no one in government will

594
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:29,729
have a reason to continue to support the

595
00:22:28,409 --> 00:22:32,549
marijuana industry and they'll be able

596
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:35,548
to get rid of the rest of it like it

597
00:22:32,548 --> 00:22:39,479
doesn't make a lot of sense and most of

598
00:22:35,548 --> 00:22:41,338
their issues are with home grows and

599
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:42,989
they're not gonna get rid of any home

600
00:22:41,338 --> 00:22:45,480
groceries clothes get rid of the stores

601
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:48,058
they're gonna produce right

602
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,829
more of them yeah absolutely and it'll

603
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:52,529
cater to the black market all over again

604
00:22:49,829 --> 00:22:54,329
right go ahead Gary well we should talk

605
00:22:52,529 --> 00:22:57,539
about home girls because there's been a

606
00:22:54,329 --> 00:23:01,259
big push on home grows lately everywhere

607
00:22:57,539 --> 00:23:02,308
multiple raids in Denver down here Park

608
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:06,690
County

609
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:09,210
Montrose seventeen raids since March

610
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:12,360
first than I'm aware of they're in the

611
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:15,090
in the state and the major major grows

612
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:16,709
the bigger prayer if you're trying to do

613
00:23:15,089 --> 00:23:18,329
major production out of your house and

614
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,529
you're not an incredibly well known

615
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:24,990
medical patient and caregiver that's

616
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:28,289
registered and active in their local

617
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:30,089
politics and stuff I'd have your

618
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:32,460
paperwork in order and have your plant

619
00:23:30,089 --> 00:23:34,379
count in order check your local and

620
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,298
county ordinances because a lot of the

621
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,650
cities and counties are passing limiting

622
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:39,329
planting limiting plant counts while

623
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:41,309
you're asleep they're doing it in

624
00:23:39,329 --> 00:23:43,710
private sessions while you're sleeping

625
00:23:41,308 --> 00:23:44,519
up to a know a new plant count and

626
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:45,960
they're just out in your backyard

627
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,079
cutting down your plants because you're

628
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:50,850
out of compliance overnight yep they uh

629
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:53,609
most of it around Colorado's complaint

630
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:55,230
driven there were a couple of

631
00:23:53,609 --> 00:23:58,589
well-publicized busts down here in

632
00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,660
Pueblo one of them was because the

633
00:23:58,589 --> 00:24:02,009
neighbor complained about some [ __ ] that

634
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,860
most neighbors would have complained

635
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:07,500
about and then the other one they got

636
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:09,808
busted in Florida with a carful weed

637
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:15,690
Texas or Texas or wherever and they

638
00:24:09,808 --> 00:24:17,519
attract back here and [ __ ] but the

639
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,470
interesting part about both of those is

640
00:24:17,519 --> 00:24:20,609
that was people from far away trying to

641
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:23,308
grow weed here and take you somewhere

642
00:24:20,609 --> 00:24:25,619
else well and also they were like like

643
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:28,639
they got the the biggest bus with five

644
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:31,649
grow houses right in Puebla West and

645
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,570
everybody involved twelve people had all

646
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:36,720
been in Colorado less than sixty days

647
00:24:33,569 --> 00:24:38,428
right there people there they that's a

648
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,819
problem they don't know any part of the

649
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:40,710
rules

650
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:42,178
exactly and they think they can do

651
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,259
whatever they want they don't even know

652
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,530
what to hide there

653
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,589
even well-informed in a keynote I write

654
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:51,359
it's just really sloppy and stupid

655
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:52,139
absolutely but it makes the rest of us

656
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,819
look bad

657
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:56,430
you know it's my point there and you

658
00:24:53,819 --> 00:25:00,779
know there is there is an effort right

659
00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:03,150
now from the regulatory bodies great and

660
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:04,980
we're seeing it you know like Mike was

661
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:08,940
pointing out earlier the regulations

662
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:12,089
change abruptly frequently and you know

663
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:15,509
you have to really stay on top and it's

664
00:25:12,089 --> 00:25:17,759
it's almost like they are attempting to

665
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:20,309
trip people licence holders up so that

666
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,720
they can find them or pull their license

667
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:23,970
now if they have their funds you know

668
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,400
what I mean the license yeah I don't

669
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,470
know you can't really say that but a lot

670
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,140
of the rules aren't passed with how

671
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,670
they'll be implemented in exactly at all

672
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:34,259
and so when they're writing the law

673
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:36,480
they've taken our okay it's gonna pass

674
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:38,879
today let's give them six months from

675
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,620
them today to get it to get any

676
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,780
compliance and sometimes they're talking

677
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:44,279
about like major construction issues are

678
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:47,519
you guys dealing with the new packaging

679
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,589
rules at the spot yeah everybody is it's

680
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,019
so stupid isn't it so sorry - go ahead

681
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,639
is just one of those [ __ ] that just

682
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:55,889
recently happened in a media tracking

683
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,330
system every time I lose flour I've got

684
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,009
to give you a small pamphlet full of

685
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:01,109
information basically it's so many

686
00:25:59,009 --> 00:26:03,029
printed labels that also my prey and

687
00:26:01,109 --> 00:26:04,500
then the package how everything's a

688
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:05,849
separate package and a batch number at

689
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,839
the end of the day yeah never mind -

690
00:26:05,849 --> 00:26:11,490
it's uh the tracking is nuts like if you

691
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,849
think you can move here from from

692
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:16,230
another state grow weed here easily and

693
00:26:14,849 --> 00:26:18,449
then ship it back you're [ __ ] nuts

694
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:21,390
yeah they're looking for that yes don't

695
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:24,690
they're looking for that and be the

696
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:28,320
neighbors are like we your local paper

697
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:30,809
hasn't reported on the hundreds of hours

698
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:33,389
in City Council meetings that people

699
00:26:30,809 --> 00:26:35,099
have spent arguing zoning rules you

700
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:37,110
haven't seen the hundreds of news

701
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:40,259
articles about them every day in your

702
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:42,929
local paper you just get the major news

703
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:45,059
bulletins and so the rest of us know

704
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:46,980
okay you can't have 600 plants in your

705
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,389
backyard that guys are probably breaking

706
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,910
the law somebody's gonna call the cops

707
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:53,730
on him don't go over there for a while

708
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,820
well I understand that this movement to

709
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:59,528
make Pueblo is too

710
00:26:54,819 --> 00:27:01,450
city is related somehow to the anti

711
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:03,278
cannabis stuff that if they can get

712
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:03,880
incorporated as a city they can get rid

713
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:05,558
of it too

714
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,269
they then put you in a reducible rule

715
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:08,859
you're not under the county rule anymore

716
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:11,470
there's some they think that's their

717
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:14,199
plan B what I understand there's a

718
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:16,630
couple of possible Plan B's how many

719
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:18,490
people if if the cannabis business were

720
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,139
shut down if I said right now no more

721
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:22,659
cannabis business in Pueblo ass no more

722
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:23,969
recreational cannabis how many jobs

723
00:27:22,659 --> 00:27:25,990
would be lost

724
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:27,669
immediately it would be somewhere

725
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,888
between seven hundred and thousand

726
00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:32,769
people that's badged employees working

727
00:27:29,888 --> 00:27:34,599
it stores grows production facilities

728
00:27:32,769 --> 00:27:36,849
edible companies and then there's gonna

729
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,319
be employers accountants

730
00:27:36,849 --> 00:27:40,980
yes there's everybody else the

731
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:44,048
accountants the lawyers consultants

732
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:47,319
carry over here the security companies

733
00:27:44,048 --> 00:27:49,418
this contractors the grow store is gonna

734
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:51,189
start losing money for sure well grow

735
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:53,350
they might do better because of more

736
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,450
home growers are gonna spring it I mean

737
00:27:53,349 --> 00:27:57,490
that's obvious it's gonna take a lot of

738
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:59,319
hard growth is gonna say yeah the volume

739
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:02,109
that those gonna be yeah that's what's

740
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:03,960
gonna be it's gonna throw a lot of stuff

741
00:28:02,109 --> 00:28:06,729
in disarray so I can be good for anybody

742
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,710
it takes more than two vehicles to load

743
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,610
up our soil order when we go buy soil at

744
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,710
the shop

745
00:28:09,609 --> 00:28:14,888
I mean Pueblo can't take a hit like that

746
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:18,759
right now for a thousand people to be

747
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:20,678
out of work overnight simply can't

748
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:25,089
handle the demographic that is employed

749
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,798
in most of these facilities are 25 to 35

750
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:28,209
to 40 year old folks right now and

751
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,308
there's no junk owner

752
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,899
yeah yeah yeah they're used to living

753
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:37,359
off those bud tender tips and [ __ ] like

754
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:38,859
that Bank actually we had somebody

755
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,258
trying to do that recently a friend of

756
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:42,699
ours who lost his job decided to not be

757
00:28:41,259 --> 00:28:44,079
involved in the cannabis industry tried

758
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,639
to go get a job at a bank and he has to

759
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,240
try to figure out how to make that

760
00:28:45,638 --> 00:28:51,069
adjustment make it look good and such no

761
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,259
they hit that pueblo would take just

762
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:56,288
with those jobs is bad but when you

763
00:28:53,259 --> 00:28:58,000
consider that secondary supporting ring

764
00:28:56,288 --> 00:29:00,250
I mean there's a hundred other

765
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,000
industries that you need to run a

766
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:04,200
dispensary in the tax I don't have

767
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,710
article on my computer screen but I

768
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,440
should mention the part about the

769
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:12,569
scholarships five million dollars out of

770
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,860
the county budget next year if the like

771
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:17,250
that's what they're projected to make

772
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:22,429
this year so if in November elections if

773
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:26,250
this passes next year we might collect

774
00:29:22,430 --> 00:29:28,529
three and a half million before October

775
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,380
when this rule would kick in but then

776
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:32,849
that's it and so there's five million

777
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,470
dollars for the stuff in the county

778
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,919
budget we've slated to do with this

779
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,930
money

780
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:41,180
like 1.3 million of its going to the

781
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:45,810
state fair to fix up the AG building

782
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:47,910
there's another 700,000 going for

783
00:29:45,809 --> 00:29:51,029
college scholarships here in Pueblo the

784
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:52,590
local called high school kids that are

785
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:53,759
getting ready to graduate right now if

786
00:29:52,589 --> 00:29:56,159
they want to go to one of the two

787
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,859
colleges down here in Pueblo they can

788
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,180
apply for a marijuana scholarship and

789
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:02,009
all of that money's coming from

790
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,150
marijuana taxes so we're sending kids to

791
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:05,460
college with this money

792
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,440
hashtag marijuana scholarship that's all

793
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,240
I've got to say about that yeah there's

794
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,779
some middle school out in Pueblo West

795
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,509
where it's just like the road there's no

796
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:17,309
sidewalk or gutter or anything that the

797
00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:18,720
kids walk on from their neighborhood to

798
00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:22,049
the school every day and it's like crazy

799
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,700
unsafe um because the bus is that kids

800
00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:25,740
from a little further out or riding on

801
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,090
or traveling on this street - they're

802
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:29,069
putting sidewalks in there with this

803
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:31,349
money like we're doing [ __ ] that should

804
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:33,359
have been done forever ago that we

805
00:30:31,349 --> 00:30:35,339
couldn't afford to do and we're gonna

806
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:39,419
stop five million dollars worth of that

807
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:42,059
um just overnight add maybe after this

808
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:44,519
November's election it's crazy to think

809
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:46,399
about so there's a lot of people fired

810
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,410
up in Pablo right now over this

811
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:52,230
that's it would be ridiculous to put

812
00:30:49,410 --> 00:30:53,460
that many tax dollars in the in the

813
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,230
toilet and flush it down and put that

814
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,509
many people out of employment it would

815
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,740
be stupid I think well for something

816
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:00,629
that's not causing any problems

817
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:02,250
particularly when you think about you

818
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:03,990
know marijuana was here before it was

819
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,390
legal and it's gonna be here after it's

820
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,589
you know even if they passed this it's

821
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,080
not going anywhere

822
00:31:07,589 --> 00:31:12,389
no right and just all the benefits are

823
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,069
going away yeah the problems are gonna

824
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:15,929
compound the growers that lose their

825
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:16,470
jobs if the dispensaries are gonna go

826
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:18,090
growth

827
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:20,250
blackmarket you're the [ __ ] out of it

828
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:21,629
not pay taxes on it have people come in

829
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,339
and go into their residents create more

830
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:25,230
traffic in your residents have an

831
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,849
illegal growing next door to your house

832
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:28,799
have people coming to buy herb next door

833
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:31,829
to your house well that's what Kamiya is

834
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,470
really bizarre about this this effort to

835
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:36,179
shut down the rec industry is that's

836
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:39,079
where the benefits come from exactly

837
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:42,690
they they're almost problem-free

838
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:46,589
in the entire run that pueblo is done

839
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:48,330
with marijuana shops period old one

840
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:51,179
license was rescinded kind of

841
00:31:48,329 --> 00:31:53,699
automatically and then another license

842
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:57,029
was the first dispensary in Colorado

843
00:31:53,700 --> 00:32:00,120
period to get shut down for regulatory

844
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:02,309
infractions not law violations or major

845
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:03,539
rule breaking they just the regulations

846
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:07,259
change they couldn't meet them fast

847
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:10,200
enough they got in trouble but that's

848
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:12,150
been it like we don't cause crime we

849
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:15,269
don't have stuff going out the backdoor

850
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:16,650
to some other place or state we don't

851
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:17,940
have teenagers shopping there like

852
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:19,530
everybody down here in the legal

853
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,049
industry follows the rules because we

854
00:32:19,529 --> 00:32:23,730
all want to be open next month I mean

855
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:25,049
any small violation of the rules can

856
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:27,059
cost you your license it's just that

857
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:29,069
simple that's why you don't see big

858
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:31,559
dispensaries screwing up in any major

859
00:32:29,069 --> 00:32:34,319
ways it's because it's too expensive to

860
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:36,029
risk screwing up yeah and so you end up

861
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:37,589
hiring three or four people to just run

862
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:42,299
around all day and make sure everybody's

863
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:44,129
complying with the rules most of the

864
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:48,539
problems these people have with legal

865
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:51,240
marijuana have to do with every other

866
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:54,269
part of marijuana being legal home grows

867
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:58,019
where people can consume how people can

868
00:32:54,269 --> 00:33:00,000
consume the variety of edible products

869
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:02,099
access to teenagers like none of that

870
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,960
[ __ ] it changes if you get rid of rec it

871
00:33:02,099 --> 00:33:06,089
all gets worse every bit of it gets work

872
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:08,700
yes the the county shops are doing like

873
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:10,919
1.7 to 2.5 million in sales every year

874
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:13,140
you figure half that's tourists so you

875
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:16,170
still got a mill and a half going back

876
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:19,350
into the ghetto like that's not a good

877
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,240
thing like you don't want all of that

878
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:22,889
business taking place in the house of

879
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,870
the street because those are the ones

880
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,179
that

881
00:33:23,869 --> 00:33:28,069
bad people with shotguns show up and try

882
00:33:26,179 --> 00:33:29,538
to rob hotels are gonna lose money

883
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:31,038
restaurants are gonna lose money the

884
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:32,538
movie theater will lose money well yeah

885
00:33:31,038 --> 00:33:34,369
that's the other half of that money is

886
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:36,169
all the people coming here for vacation

887
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:40,250
now we were a spring break destination

888
00:33:36,169 --> 00:33:41,840
yeah no one up here has ever had like a

889
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:44,450
bunch of people in town for spring break

890
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,788
and a lot of people came to town for

891
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,610
spring break this year right yeah it was

892
00:33:46,788 --> 00:33:51,558
really you know and the thing is if they

893
00:33:49,609 --> 00:33:54,528
would turn a little different and

894
00:33:51,558 --> 00:33:56,599
promote that and cultivate that then

895
00:33:54,528 --> 00:33:58,159
that could be huge next year you know

896
00:33:56,599 --> 00:34:00,230
what I mean and massive amount of tax

897
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,520
dollars right massive amount Tom yeah

898
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:05,360
what do they make a year out there in

899
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,819
Pueblo West in cannabis taxes last year

900
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,679
it was like 1.7 million this next year

901
00:34:07,819 --> 00:34:12,889
it's gonna be five mainly because

902
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,200
there's a new 3.5% tax on the production

903
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:17,240
so an excise taxes five sales million

904
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,949
dollars well and they put in massive

905
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:22,219
growth facilities do you know yeah

906
00:34:18,949 --> 00:34:24,019
there's a huge expansion and then the we

907
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:25,969
didn't have a special excise tax just a

908
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:28,519
special sales tax do you know by any

909
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:31,250
random chance what Pueblo West's other

910
00:34:28,519 --> 00:34:34,280
tax income is like what are they bring

911
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:36,108
in other than a lot what's the number do

912
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:38,480
you know their number - cannabis taxes

913
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:44,409
will know the marijuana taxes represent

914
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,409
like 2% almost all right of the county

915
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:52,010
okay already when you put it as an

916
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,599
overall percentage it seems small but

917
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:55,940
when you look at the list of stuff that

918
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,490
like we can't pay cops right now like

919
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:00,320
there isn't an extra 1% right when you

920
00:34:58,489 --> 00:35:03,229
got five million eggs girl you can maybe

921
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,030
and it's not so much extra at this point

922
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,710
because lights in fellow West it's the

923
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,869
darkest [ __ ] city I've ever driven

924
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:12,099
through they budgeted for it because

925
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:15,829
it's gonna come in this year and so

926
00:35:12,099 --> 00:35:17,750
funding got moved around and when the

927
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:20,598
five million from marijuana like if that

928
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:22,730
doesn't come in because of this vote all

929
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:24,530
kinds of stuff isn't gonna happen the

930
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:26,240
year after that because of those cuts

931
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:29,210
it'll start to look like Detroit in a

932
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:31,098
few years I like you really can't a

933
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,230
webelo definitely can't afford to lose

934
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:35,300
that kind of jobs like you see major

935
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:38,269
articles in the chieftain when the steel

936
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,220
mill lays off 200 people temporarily

937
00:35:38,268 --> 00:35:42,199
because the impact that the city feels

938
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:44,988
when that happens is major that's to

939
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:47,389
honor paychecks well if a thousand

940
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:49,278
people say it's only 700 if 700 people

941
00:35:47,389 --> 00:35:49,909
stop bringing home paychecks because of

942
00:35:49,278 --> 00:35:53,028
his vote

943
00:35:49,909 --> 00:35:56,028
like that's 700 fewer people that can

944
00:35:53,028 --> 00:35:57,949
order dinner I have pizza delivered go

945
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:59,358
to the movies go get another pair of

946
00:35:57,949 --> 00:36:01,518
sneakers go get their kids school

947
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,170
supplies if their car all of that stuff

948
00:36:01,518 --> 00:36:05,748
it's 700 people that are gonna be

949
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:07,568
applying for food stamps yep it's 700

950
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:11,480
people that are gonna be going to food

951
00:36:07,568 --> 00:36:14,150
unemployment food pantries it's 700 more

952
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,429
stresses on an already overtaxed system

953
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,960
of support yep in this community in a

954
00:36:16,429 --> 00:36:20,748
small community 'less

955
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:22,789
yeah it's is literally like 1 percent of

956
00:36:20,748 --> 00:36:24,409
the people in Pueblo County like there's

957
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:25,819
a hundred and thirty-some thousand

958
00:36:24,409 --> 00:36:27,649
people down here so it's like the worst

959
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:30,528
type of self-sabotage yeah we

960
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:34,759
immediately can't take it like that it

961
00:36:30,528 --> 00:36:36,650
really is no it's it's you know the

962
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,998
reason I wanted to have this podcast the

963
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,358
reason I wanted to talk about this issue

964
00:36:37,998 --> 00:36:46,209
is I want everybody who supports

965
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:49,460
cannabis to take it seriously because

966
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:51,528
from my perspective on social media and

967
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:53,778
out in the community nobody's really

968
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:55,969
taking it seriously and that's that

969
00:36:53,778 --> 00:36:57,829
frightens me to be honest I don't think

970
00:36:55,969 --> 00:37:00,169
anybody took the idea that they could

971
00:36:57,829 --> 00:37:01,999
shut down cannabis and Pueblo West

972
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:03,980
seriously it doesn't seem like something

973
00:37:01,998 --> 00:37:06,139
feasible oh they can't do that we voted

974
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:08,239
it voted it in is what a lot of people

975
00:37:06,139 --> 00:37:10,038
say and they just get it on the ballot

976
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:13,159
nobody shows up they can vote it right

977
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:15,470
they can vote it right out yeah it's

978
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:18,588
it's a weird election to run this in

979
00:37:15,469 --> 00:37:21,558
it's the anti-putin to be more

980
00:37:18,588 --> 00:37:26,088
conservative we just had a Democratic

981
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:27,980
president for eight years no no no

982
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:29,929
stretch in American history have we had

983
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,210
a two-term president from one party or

984
00:37:29,929 --> 00:37:35,989
another followed by a president from

985
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:38,179
that same party so history tells us that

986
00:37:35,989 --> 00:37:41,179
more conservatives are going to turnout

987
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:43,669
in this election than liberals to vote

988
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:47,598
for president which means they're going

989
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:50,239
to be at the polls which means that if

990
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,079
the youthful and the pro cannabis vote

991
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,108
don't come out

992
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,298
for us this November it's the legal wool

993
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:59,328
here locally we could see the rec

994
00:37:56,298 --> 00:38:00,380
industry shut down and a lot of us would

995
00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:02,660
be out of work and that would really

996
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:05,479
suck but there's four or five states

997
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:07,909
that at least that are legalizing that

998
00:38:05,478 --> 00:38:09,379
whole big list we did not all of those

999
00:38:07,909 --> 00:38:11,298
efforts are gonna make the ballot but

1000
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:14,479
five to eight to ten of them are going

1001
00:38:11,298 --> 00:38:16,518
to and if people don't show up and vote

1002
00:38:14,478 --> 00:38:20,239
in those areas those efforts are gonna

1003
00:38:16,518 --> 00:38:21,679
lose and all of the people that say or

1004
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,739
have been saying legalization is

1005
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:27,708
inevitable are gonna watch that tide

1006
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:29,150
turn and the pendulum is gonna swing

1007
00:38:27,708 --> 00:38:32,058
back the other way just like it

1008
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,430
typically does in politics and we're

1009
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:36,859
gonna see states that have liberalized

1010
00:38:34,429 --> 00:38:39,018
their marijuana lies start to go the

1011
00:38:36,858 --> 00:38:41,630
other way again and we don't want to see

1012
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:43,968
that so everybody needs to figure out if

1013
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,739
you're registered to vote figure out how

1014
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:48,048
to vote in your area where to vote in

1015
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:49,969
your area and get on top of that and

1016
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:54,889
stay on top of that all the way through

1017
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:57,048
the election in November BAM I like just

1018
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:59,538
Pablo West everywhere everywhere it's

1019
00:38:57,048 --> 00:39:00,858
it's important to me locally cuz I could

1020
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:02,660
get fired in November and that would

1021
00:39:00,858 --> 00:39:03,889
really suck he's got a beautiful little

1022
00:39:02,659 --> 00:39:05,808

1023
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:07,818

1035
00:39:30,289 --> 00:39:34,910
this is an election again when even

1036
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:36,769
fewer liberals turn out and because they

1037
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:39,018
manage to kill rec and Pueblo where it

1038

was so big last year you're just gonna

1039
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:46,008
be an easier target Wow proof and it's

1040
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:49,039

1041

so we just got all hi you guys and Gary

1106
00:42:10,608 --> 00:42:17,088
decided that somebody needs to create an

1107
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:19,279
animated series based on my likeness and

1108
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:20,509
there is a copyright on my likeness so

1109
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,790
you guys can't [ __ ] with this I actually

1110
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:23,869
do have a trademark on my likeness I'm

1111
00:42:22,789 --> 00:42:25,130
not gonna tell you the name of the

1112
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:26,269
company and everything but that is

1113
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:28,608
banded so don't try to [ __ ] with my

1114
00:42:26,269 --> 00:42:30,019
likeness for my name but he just told me

1115
00:42:28,608 --> 00:42:33,170
that I need to have the cartoon of

1116
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:34,429
myself and I would have the Lion of

1117
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,070
Judah as my sidekick

1118
00:42:34,429 --> 00:42:38,569
so it'd be Rasta Jeff and the Lion Judah

1119
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:41,510
and we'd be walking around solving

1120
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:43,400
cannabis-related mysteries and/or crimes

1121
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:44,839
it would be awesome but it wouldn't be

1122
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,700
like cannabis crimes it would be like

1123
00:42:44,838 --> 00:42:48,699
you know crimes against cannabis I guess

1124
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:54,949

mini male it's a girl from your heart at

1135
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:24,769
hotmail.com or if you want to produce a

1136
00:43:22,909 --> 00:43:27,588
[ __ ] Rasta Jeff themed cartoon I am

1137
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:30,039
down as [ __ ] let's get it on I want to

1138
00:43:27,588 --> 00:43:30,039
see this happen

1139
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:49,099
episode number one what are we doing in

1140
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:50,719
episode number one what's our mystery if

1141
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:58,750
we're kinda I've seen it I'm envisioning

1142
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:58,750
us like is the ganja more obviously I

1143
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:04,759
was thinking more like our plants got

1144
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:09,310
stolen help us find out who took Toby

1145
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:12,290
then you track you back fully

1146
00:44:09,309 --> 00:44:14,880
educational and do like each episode is

1147
00:44:12,289 --> 00:44:22,550
like a grow lesson just like

1148
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:22,550
you've got you've got mice do cloning

1149
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:26,460
funny

1150
00:44:24,570 --> 00:44:29,880
I like the mystery-solving thing but you

1151
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:33,329
could go first cause you both this was

1152
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,990
much more scooby-doo than it is it's got

1153
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:36,659
an education

1154
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:38,369
Rosenthal but I think it could be both I

1155
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:40,019
could definitely could you should go

1156
00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:43,319
watch the Mike Tyson mystery team you

1157
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:45,449
see no Larry you that's what I've a kid

1158
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:48,150
when I see this okay just replacing yeah

1159
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:49,739
it's it's great you'll like it so if

1160
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:52,019
anybody wants to kind of replace the

1161
00:44:49,739 --> 00:44:54,419
Mike Tyson mysteries with me and my lion

1162
00:44:52,019 --> 00:44:55,980
Judah I'm game I want to see it happen I

1163
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,480
wanna I want to see me and I would like

1164
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,199
to see it fighting crime can I be a

1165
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,510
superhero

1166
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:02,849
can we give me do I have a superpower

1167
00:44:59,510 --> 00:45:04,380
I'm just I think you can have power I

1168
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:06,119
could talk to play that's the thing

1169
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,059
about cartoons they'll plan to whisper

1170
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,559
because you can have powers because they

1171
00:45:09,059 --> 00:45:13,529
don't have to be Judah can certainly

1172
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:16,409
have powers okay yeah yeah I like that

1173
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:18,030
version better well you can be super

1174
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:20,519
high in the line could be a superhero

1175
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,410
right I don't want to be Talia let's say

1176
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:23,639
that the whole thing is it's easy to be

1177
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:24,960
challenged I think there'd be like a

1178
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:27,659
whole question of whether the line is

1179
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,820
real or not you know what I mean so it's

1180
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:32,279
kind of Wilfred like now so just about

1181
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:35,490
to say don't go Wilfred no not that far

1182
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:37,980
but you know he's your sidekick but you

1183
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:38,609
know suddenly he's only there when I'm

1184
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:42,269
blazed

1185
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:44,309
that's we don't ever show me smoking or

1186
00:45:42,269 --> 00:45:46,349
talk about me smoking but only when I'm

1187
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:47,130
obviously hide Judah shows up you know

1188
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:53,670
we need your help

1189
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:55,019
yeah question that I don't know the

1190
00:45:53,670 --> 00:45:57,059
answer should like I don't know let me

1191
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:58,820
go find Judah and then I come back with

1192
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:01,619
Judah and I've got the answer but those

1193
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:03,870
elements like the 70s show element the

1194
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:06,029
Mike Tyson mysteries element and the

1195
00:46:03,869 --> 00:46:07,799
Scooby Doo elements if you could you

1196
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:12,560
know work those in well make it even

1197
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,560
funnier hash tag they like it

1198
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:21,539
beautiful this is podcasting at its

1199
00:46:19,739 --> 00:46:23,039
finest welcome to the table you guys

1200
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:28,469
this is what three dudes that have had

1201
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:29,519
too many dabs I could probably go for

1202
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:32,029
one more but I don't want to blow out

1203
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:34,170
the throat try to record but the voice

1204
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:37,710
once you guys get talking I might take a

1205
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:40,680
DAB so recently the DEA has announced

1206
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:42,990
that they are going to investigate

1207
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:46,108
cannabis a little further and within 90

1208
00:46:42,989 --> 00:46:48,779
days they will release their opinion on

1209
00:46:46,108 --> 00:46:51,659
it rather they decide to reschedule

1210
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,890
cannabis as a schedule I have an article

1211
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:54,449
on the fingers I'm no good with the

1212
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:56,569
scheduling I get the numbers mixed up

1213
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:59,219
they're going to reschedule cannabis

1214
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:01,470
right now as it is currently listed as a

1215
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:03,389
schedule 1 drug meaning that for the

1216
00:47:01,469 --> 00:47:05,279
purposes of federal law the drug has no

1217
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:07,199
medical value and a high potential for

1218
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:09,210
abuse and is one of the most dangerous

1219
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:11,699
drugs of all drug schedules with

1220
00:47:09,210 --> 00:47:14,579
potentially severe psychological or

1221
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:17,368
physical dependence okay that right

1222
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:20,190
there poses a really big problem for the

1223
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:22,320
government yes because a different

1224
00:47:20,190 --> 00:47:25,710
branch of the government owns a patent

1225
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:28,200
for medical uses of cannabis so how can

1226
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:29,699
it have no medical uses and you own the

1227
00:47:28,199 --> 00:47:31,799
patent if they've been comfortable with

1228
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:35,039
that bitter Apocrypha for a really long

1229
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:37,230
time but there's a case working its way

1230
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:39,960
through the courts that is challenging

1231
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:42,000
that very issue if that one of them has

1232
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,030
basically been waiting for a decade to

1233
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:49,320
see this commission so there this move

1234
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:52,590
is ahead of it and my initial thought on

1235
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,050
this move was this is an establishment

1236
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:58,680
Democrat move to take some wind out of

1237
00:47:55,050 --> 00:48:02,730
Bernie Sanders if if they reschedule

1238
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:05,639
before the election that kind of removes

1239
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,909
a key issue for Sanders the reason we

1240
00:48:05,639 --> 00:48:12,299
highlighted Sanders on this podcast you

1241
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:16,159
see what I mean as an establishment

1242
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:19,320
Democrat move it's kind of brilliant I

1243
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:21,299
see I was just expecting the DEA to SWAT

1244
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,519
this down like they have every time but

1245
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,400
because they've that we've gotten to

1246
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,699
this point

1247
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,500
the DEA trying to reschedule it before

1248
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:32,179
trauma and honestly I haven't kept up as

1249
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:34,400
much as I should have with this current

1250
00:48:32,179 --> 00:48:37,819
incarnation of it but I would be

1251
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,650
surprised if that but it could be I

1252
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:43,360
don't know so you think they're giving

1253
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:46,010
up the Queen to save the king well look

1254
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:48,950
socially the tide has turned everybody

1255
00:48:46,010 --> 00:48:50,350
knows that yes it's just a matter what's

1256
00:48:48,949 --> 00:48:52,609
the number of states that have legalized

1257
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:55,519
all of the things that are changing it

1258
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:57,519
is definitely obvious we've seen the DNC

1259
00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:01,099
the Democratic establishment do all

1260
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:03,650
kinds of [ __ ] to Sanders you know what I

1261
00:49:01,099 --> 00:49:05,150
mean it kind of fits the profile I'm not

1262
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:09,740
trying to be a conspiracy theorist I

1263
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:12,710
just see a massive political value for

1264
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:15,109
Hillary Clinton if it happens before the

1265
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:16,699
election there's a huge political value

1266
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:19,070
for her if it happens before the

1267
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:19,429
election and that's undeniable I can see

1268
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:21,380
that

1269
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:24,109
all right so whether it's intentional or

1270
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:28,490
unintentional now I agree with Mike I

1271
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:30,950
think that in under normal circumstances

1272
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:33,289
this is just the DA's gonna you know

1273
00:49:30,949 --> 00:49:35,809
shuffle some papers around and [ __ ] you

1274
00:49:33,289 --> 00:49:38,920
this is [ __ ] they've literally been

1275
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:43,849
taken to federal court and lost and

1276
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:47,420
still not still write their own da law

1277
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:51,380
judge like when the the original federal

1278
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:55,369
medical program was created to citizens

1279
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:56,630
who the feds won and then the DA law

1280
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:58,639
judge that overheard the case

1281
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:00,289
recommended that the DA reschedule

1282
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:02,449
marijuana and their response was to

1283
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:05,119
basically shame them into retirement

1284
00:50:02,449 --> 00:50:06,529
well but and what what you have to

1285
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:10,339
understand and what we all have to

1286
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:11,750
acknowledge here is that they are fully

1287
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,140
under the control of the executive

1288
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,539
branch

1289
00:50:12,139 --> 00:50:16,940
so the president ordered them to do that

1290
00:50:14,539 --> 00:50:19,400
or they wouldn't have done it period

1291
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,740
like if the president ordered them not

1292
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,900
to do it they wouldn't have done more

1293
00:50:21,739 --> 00:50:27,189
than likely more than likely and and and

1294
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:30,380
you know all probabilities okay so

1295
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:33,170
that's the difference right now so the

1296
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:35,809
the implications are really weird right

1297
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,769
so they have several options they could

1298
00:50:35,809 --> 00:50:40,449
do nothing and

1299
00:50:37,769 --> 00:50:42,699
very possibly they they could do nothing

1300
00:50:40,449 --> 00:50:44,409
that's basically what I expected to see

1301
00:50:42,699 --> 00:50:47,139
happen was this to come up again and

1302
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:48,369
then to say yeah no and that and that

1303
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:50,289
could happen that could be the answer

1304
00:50:48,369 --> 00:50:51,639
right and that's that tends to be the

1305
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:54,309
federal response when it comes to

1306
00:50:51,639 --> 00:50:56,230
marijuana is right under normal state

1307
00:50:54,309 --> 00:50:58,119
their head and say no and things go on

1308
00:50:56,230 --> 00:51:00,400
the way that under normal circumstances

1309
00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:02,079
that's what we would all expect would

1310
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,970
they have even bothered to announce it

1311
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,889
if they weren't gonna do something they

1312
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:09,159
didn't have to tell us it's true that

1313
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:11,739
that's the thing I mean the pressure the

1314
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:13,899
the story that I did glanced at I don't

1315
00:51:11,739 --> 00:51:15,759
think they announced it quite as

1316
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,360
intention like they didn't mean for this

1317
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,070
to happen

1318
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:20,230
um because a number of different news

1319
00:51:18,070 --> 00:51:23,710
agencies are talking about it somebody

1320
00:51:20,230 --> 00:51:27,039
had like it I forwarded the wrong email

1321
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:29,170
to the wrong person and we're gonna be

1322
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:34,840
looking at this between now and what is

1323
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:36,250
it August yeah memo was leaked to I want

1324
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:39,910
to say it was Matt Fournier but I'm not

1325
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:42,219
positive and so yeah I'm not sure that

1326
00:51:39,909 --> 00:51:44,529
this was a intended to be this public

1327
00:51:42,219 --> 00:51:46,449
okay publicizes it has been but who

1328
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:48,340
knows they shake it's leaked on purpose

1329
00:51:46,449 --> 00:51:51,789
- yes exactly

1330
00:51:48,340 --> 00:51:53,590
well thanks to you they could have

1331
00:51:51,789 --> 00:51:55,599
leaked it to you know kind of test

1332
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:58,180
public sentiment on it you know right

1333
00:51:55,599 --> 00:51:59,670
how it's gonna fly yeah like a comedian

1334
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:02,019
tweets a joke that's what they do

1335
00:51:59,670 --> 00:52:03,730
tweeted this okay if they do nothing

1336
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:07,119
then you know where we are

1337
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:09,690
nothing changes except that whoever the

1338
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:12,130
next president is then has the authority

1339
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:16,900
to come and shut all this [ __ ] down if

1340
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:19,059
they want to under federal law and don't

1341
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,369
kid yourself Trump will do that his

1342
00:52:19,059 --> 00:52:23,799
whole campaign sparks a bad man and you

1343
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:26,409
know it's it's this whole campaign is

1344
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,670
insane it doesn't surprise me that

1345
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:34,269
you're having Trump nightmares that's

1346
00:52:27,670 --> 00:52:36,670
right a lot of people are alright so the

1347
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:38,590
DEA could possibly come out and say hey

1348
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:41,619
this does have medicinal value we could

1349
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:44,320
have yeah all right so we have so option

1350
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:46,179
one do nothing and that that's probably

1351
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,940
what the consensus whatever buddy

1352
00:52:46,179 --> 00:52:49,299
expects right but option two is they

1353
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,940
Reese

1354
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:54,789
schedule which means it goes somewhere

1355
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:59,139
between two and five on the on the

1356
00:52:54,789 --> 00:53:03,460
scheduled right list okay and that puts

1357
00:52:59,139 --> 00:53:06,900
it under the jurisdiction of the FDA so

1358
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:10,449
now if it's scheduled anywhere below one

1359
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:13,300
it's under FDA so what does that mean

1360
00:53:10,449 --> 00:53:16,119
well even if it drops the - a lot of

1361
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:19,060
good things happy a lot of good things a

1362
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:21,429
lot of strange things happen because I

1363
00:53:19,059 --> 00:53:23,650
mean we've spent an amazingly long time

1364
00:53:21,429 --> 00:53:26,589
trying to figure out how to make it too

1365
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:29,110
punitive for people the risk smoking or

1366
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:30,789
having weed and all of those rules are

1367
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:34,059
still in place even in places like

1368
00:53:30,789 --> 00:53:35,769
Colorado so rescheduling it anywhere on

1369
00:53:34,059 --> 00:53:37,630
the sched will still leave some really

1370
00:53:35,769 --> 00:53:39,070
interesting questions it really really

1371
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:41,349
does well like I said in putting it

1372
00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:44,140
anywhere on the schedule makes it under

1373
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:47,619
the authority of the FDA so that leaves

1374
00:53:44,139 --> 00:53:50,289
a whole bunch of questions of how and

1375
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:51,549
you know how would that even begin to

1376
00:53:50,289 --> 00:53:53,889
work right it's not a typical

1377
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:54,970
pharmaceutical what I predicted me I

1378
00:53:53,889 --> 00:53:56,219
don't know if I've said this on an

1379
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:58,989
episode before what I predict

1380
00:53:56,219 --> 00:54:01,359
unfortunately maybe if we do go to a

1381
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:02,829
national I thought it would be medical

1382
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:05,230
first but it looks like we may have a

1383
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:09,069
national recreational pretty done

1384
00:54:05,230 --> 00:54:10,360
they'll find to somebody right okay holy

1385
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:12,220
[ __ ] you're correct we have they're

1386
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,720
gonna find somebody to grow it and then

1387
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:15,219
it's not gonna be something friendly

1388
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:16,719
it's gonna be a mass-produced product

1389
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:18,039
that is gonna be and they're gonna wipe

1390
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:19,869
out all the small growers like what

1391
00:54:18,039 --> 00:54:21,929
we've got going now see it's it's it's

1392
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:24,159
just not happening that it's not

1393
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:28,059
happening that way you know what I mean

1394
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:30,639
that's a top-down kind of affectation a

1395
00:54:28,059 --> 00:54:31,929
political change right and it's not

1396
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:33,460
happening it's happening from the bottom

1397
00:54:31,929 --> 00:54:35,559
up on the state level

1398
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:37,990
a third often they have rather than

1399
00:54:35,559 --> 00:54:40,690
rescheduling they could delist it they

1400
00:54:37,989 --> 00:54:42,939
could D schedule completely and and they

1401
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:45,429
could even go so far as to recommend

1402
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:48,818
that you know

1403
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:51,818
although it's delisted and not a

1404
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:55,269
scheduled drug that it needs special

1405
00:54:51,818 --> 00:55:01,210
care so the ATF could be come the ATF

1406
00:54:55,269 --> 00:55:02,679
see I mean marijuana instead of cannabis

1407
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:05,920
in their acronym I wish they wouldn't

1408
00:55:02,679 --> 00:55:09,489
but that's totally on the list of

1409
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,829
possibilities well and and some of the

1410
00:55:09,489 --> 00:55:14,919
analysis that I read the policy analysis

1411
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:19,390
that if you look at you know kind of the

1412
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:21,789
recent history of structuring government

1413
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:25,420
this would probably be the way they

1414
00:55:21,789 --> 00:55:29,679
would do it because of integration with

1415
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:32,829
like homeland security ATF is already

1416
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:35,949
fully integrated and so in this

1417
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:38,769
transition period where we're going from

1418
00:55:35,949 --> 00:55:41,858
illegal to legal the ATF would be able

1419
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:44,679
to monitor the legal grows and keep out

1420
00:55:41,858 --> 00:55:46,449
cartels and stuff like that and then

1421
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:49,618
their role would diminish as it has with

1422
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:52,058
alcohol you know the ATF was heavy in

1423
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:54,519
regulation when alcohol first became

1424
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:57,490
legal and then they've you know eased

1425
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:59,289
off on alcohol right and it was at this

1426
00:55:57,489 --> 00:55:59,709
point it's just regulated like anything

1427
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,989
else

1428
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:04,059
yes state regulatory agency has

1429
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:06,129
inspectors the inspectors come by and

1430
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:09,010
check stuff with something like this

1431
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:11,200
that's a retail distributed intoxicant

1432
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:13,599
like there'd be the occasional ID sting

1433
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,858
but it's really not that complicated to

1434
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,750
turn it into a product just like

1435
00:56:14,858 --> 00:56:18,969
anything else exactly and and that's

1436
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:20,798
what DS scheduling it and putting it

1437
00:56:18,969 --> 00:56:22,389
under the atf jurisdiction would do and

1438
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:24,280
it would solve the government's problem

1439
00:56:22,389 --> 00:56:26,139
worried about cartels getting in and

1440
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,900
stuff like that because then they could

1441
00:56:26,139 --> 00:56:31,239
go to every state and inspect them well

1442
00:56:28,900 --> 00:56:33,190
see what i mean yeah and without even

1443
00:56:31,239 --> 00:56:34,808
having to put any regulations on it you

1444
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,298
know just just looking for money

1445
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:39,099
laundering and tax evasion and stuff

1446
00:56:37,298 --> 00:56:41,170
like that you know what i mean like they

1447
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:44,140
do with the atf does with alcohol they

1448
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:46,000
only do the top-level do you think

1449
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:47,230
anybody else has thought this idea

1450
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,269
through or do you think this is

1451
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:50,650
something i didn't just make this [ __ ]

1452
00:56:49,269 --> 00:56:52,780
up you know how i went out and read

1453
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,568
smarter people than me and this is what

1454
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:57,730
they think i think the odds of them d

1455
00:56:55,568 --> 00:56:58,570
scheduling cannabis in the next couple

1456
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:02,369
months is a

1457
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:06,010
like one or two or three percent at most

1458
00:57:02,369 --> 00:57:09,909
if the DEA does anything it will likely

1459
00:57:06,010 --> 00:57:12,700
be lower the schedule a point or two so

1460
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:14,949
down to schedule two or three which and

1461
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:17,679
we can debate for a really long time if

1462
00:57:14,949 --> 00:57:21,609
it belongs on the schedule at all or and

1463
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:23,399
if so where but I really don't think the

1464
00:57:21,610 --> 00:57:25,510
DEA is gonna do anything because that's

1465
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:28,119
historically what they've always done is

1466
00:57:25,510 --> 00:57:31,530
just nothing well and the marijuana is

1467
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:34,179
too big a piece of the the drug war pie

1468
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:35,950
where eighty percent of all drug consol

1469
00:57:34,179 --> 00:57:38,379
illicit drug consumers only consume

1470
00:57:35,949 --> 00:57:40,329
cannabis you take cannabis out of that

1471
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,039
equation and they've got a real hard

1472
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:44,829
time justifying a lot of their budgets

1473
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:46,659
true and that's why they spend so many

1474
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:48,159
times flying around there's so much time

1475
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:52,389
flying around chopping down cannabis

1476
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:54,009
plants in the woods like it's because

1477
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:58,210
they if they don't they don't get paid

1478
00:57:54,010 --> 00:58:00,460
and like so if they do federally

1479
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:01,720
regulate it to another schedule is my

1480
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:03,550
gonna have to become a pharmacist

1481
00:58:01,719 --> 00:58:06,369
basically now to be a budtender am I

1482
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:08,620
gonna have to wear a lab coat and go a

1483
00:58:06,369 --> 00:58:10,449
little bit more extreme and get major

1484
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:14,469
some sort of pharmaceutical it wouldn't

1485
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:16,329
change any laws accreditation I think it

1486
00:58:14,469 --> 00:58:25,659
wouldn't change state laws but it would

1487
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:27,849
give the FDA depending on where it falls

1488
00:58:25,659 --> 00:58:34,569
on the schedule bud tending would still

1489
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:37,119
be a federal offense and but even if it

1490
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:40,420
moved to just schedule to the ability

1491
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:42,969
for doctors to research it would

1492
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,099
increase greatly like one of the main

1493
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:47,230
hurdles right now is like if you get

1494
00:58:45,099 --> 00:58:48,909
your whole study approve there's only

1495
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:51,730
one small place where you can get the

1496
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:53,710
cannabis from if you watch Sanjay

1497
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:55,329
Gupta's marijuana specials you can check

1498
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:56,019
out where that place is and what it's

1499
00:58:55,329 --> 00:58:58,449
all about

1500
00:58:56,019 --> 00:59:00,400
but the supply is still drastically

1501
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:03,069
limited and with the number of different

1502
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,380
compounds in the cannabis plant the

1503
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:07,180
number of different medical applications

1504
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:08,619
that people in our industry have seen

1505
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:11,429
hinted at but would like further

1506
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:14,098
research on all of those studies get a

1507
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:19,799
not easier to do oh yeah even if it only

1508
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:22,859
moves moves to to it opens up everything

1509
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:24,960
okay yeah everything as far as research

1510
00:59:22,858 --> 00:59:26,900
goes yeah that door really opens would

1511
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,769
we be able to study cannabis at

1512
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:30,720
University of Southern Colorado and

1513
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:34,019
Colorado State University yes

1514
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:36,689
okay salute all right yep

1515
00:59:34,019 --> 00:59:40,139
and I mean I really don't think the D is

1516
00:59:36,690 --> 00:59:41,880
gonna move on this if the federal

1517
00:59:40,139 --> 00:59:45,480
government moves in my opinion it will

1518
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:48,480
because it acting president rallies

1519
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:51,780
Congress just like they do on countless

1520
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,849
other issues using the bully pulpit and

1521
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:56,819
it will be a long drawn-out process is

1522
00:59:53,849 --> 00:59:58,470
my opinion but who knows the DA could

1523
00:59:56,818 --> 01:00:02,130
jump for all kinds of reasons

1524
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:06,199
well the analysis that I read and this

1525
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:11,039
was policy analysis from Q research just

1526
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:14,068
you know their their take on it is right

1527
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:16,739
now nobody knows what's gonna we in this

1528
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:18,358
election cycle that you know basically

1529
01:00:16,739 --> 01:00:21,750
everybody's pulling out all the stops

1530
01:00:18,358 --> 01:00:23,848
dude in all bets are off right and that

1531
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:26,699
you know the benefit here you know in

1532
01:00:23,849 --> 01:00:28,500
this in this situation for Clinton could

1533
01:00:26,699 --> 01:00:30,239
could be the tipping point could be the

1534
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:32,760
thing that does after all these [ __ ]

1535
01:00:30,239 --> 01:00:36,118
years you know what I mean and and you

1536
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:39,270
know sadly he gave about five examples

1537
01:00:36,119 --> 01:00:40,769
that's how it works in this country you

1538
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:43,349
know what I mean fortunately you know

1539
01:00:40,769 --> 01:00:46,349
there's there's enough support out there

1540
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:50,910
that it could get done without too much

1541
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:53,068
turmoil now you know ya could fly you

1542
01:00:50,909 --> 01:00:54,629
could do it and we've Salam as a lame

1543
01:00:53,068 --> 01:00:57,389
duck he's had nothing to lose

1544
01:00:54,630 --> 01:01:00,390
true he's on his way out he is doors

1545
01:00:57,389 --> 01:01:02,338
about to close on his ass they've never

1546
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:05,338
said a nice word about him before what

1547
01:01:02,338 --> 01:01:08,369
he doesn't give a [ __ ] what the true so

1548
01:01:05,338 --> 01:01:13,679
you know we were talking about to

1549
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:15,599
election vote situations where about a

1550
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:17,429
hundred people voice their concern on

1551
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:18,660
one way and two or three people stood up

1552
01:01:17,429 --> 01:01:20,429
and voiced their concern on the

1553
01:01:18,659 --> 01:01:22,409
opposition and for some reason the

1554
01:01:20,429 --> 01:01:24,469
council members went with the lower

1555
01:01:22,409 --> 01:01:27,108
votes in both cases

1556
01:01:24,469 --> 01:01:28,730
in Colorado Springs recently on two very

1557
01:01:27,108 --> 01:01:30,289
different issues very different issues

1558
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,030
but it with the same damn way well we're

1559
01:01:30,289 --> 01:01:34,550
seeing we're seeing here in southern

1560
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:36,800
Colorado we're seeing a culture war like

1561
01:01:34,550 --> 01:01:38,710
really starting to bubble up you know

1562
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:40,430
we're seeing this movement this

1563
01:01:38,710 --> 01:01:43,670
whatever-it-is movement against

1564
01:01:40,429 --> 01:01:45,829
marijuana we're seeing the City Council

1565
01:01:43,670 --> 01:01:49,519
and Colorado Springs taking all kinds of

1566
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:52,880
actions that are just really opposed to

1567
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:54,590
public outcry and like one of those is

1568
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:56,329
on marijuana but there were other issues

1569
01:01:54,590 --> 01:01:59,300
like completely unrelated to marijuana

1570
01:01:56,329 --> 01:02:01,069
where the public was you know really

1571
01:01:59,300 --> 01:02:02,450
vocal on it and they still moved like

1572
01:02:01,070 --> 01:02:06,530
directly against them right away and

1573
01:02:02,449 --> 01:02:09,980
with the other way and it's you know

1574
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:11,900
it's it's getting thick around here man

1575
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:15,469
and and you know it's kind of getting

1576
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:18,769
thick nationally too right and you know

1577
01:02:15,469 --> 01:02:21,079
was I mean politics goes in cycles

1578
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:23,780
I mean pull out a history book or just

1579
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:25,699
if you're older think back it goes

1580
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:27,380
liberal conservative liberal

1581
01:02:25,699 --> 01:02:34,879
conservative and it has for the last

1582
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:38,630
hundred years and we Reagan true but

1583
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,700
it's getting more and more conservative

1584
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,900
right now because it got more and more

1585
01:02:40,699 --> 01:02:44,569
liberal for a minute

1586
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:47,030
we made some nice progress and some nice

1587
01:02:44,570 --> 01:02:49,000
issues but at the same time the

1588
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:51,310
conservative folks the anti pot groups

1589
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:54,530
they've been getting clobbered in

1590
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:55,909
election after election and council

1591
01:02:54,530 --> 01:02:57,560
meeting after council meeting and

1592
01:02:55,909 --> 01:03:02,059
license hearing after license hearing

1593
01:02:57,559 --> 01:03:04,789
and they're pissed so down here they're

1594
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:08,119
going with the nuclear option it kind of

1595
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:09,980
seems like they are nationally - given

1596
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:14,450
Trump's popularity yeah

1597
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:16,789
but if if more people don't get active

1598
01:03:14,449 --> 01:03:18,079
and I mean that takes paying attention

1599
01:03:16,789 --> 01:03:21,619
it takes some dedication it takes

1600
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:24,769
reading the news occasionally it takes

1601
01:03:21,619 --> 01:03:27,858
staying informed it's not something that

1602
01:03:24,769 --> 01:03:30,380
you can just do overnight but if more

1603
01:03:27,858 --> 01:03:32,059
people are aged and more people that

1604
01:03:30,380 --> 01:03:34,220
aren't into cannabis don't start getting

1605
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:36,380
involved like it could get real ugly for

1606
01:03:34,219 --> 01:03:38,179
the next couple of years eight years at

1607
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,829
least yeah

1608
01:03:38,179 --> 01:03:42,719
register and vote register and vote the

1609
01:03:40,829 --> 01:03:44,069
I was gonna I was gonna say the ball is

1610
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:46,259
in your hands but that just sounds gross

1611
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:48,660
hey vote your conscience on the

1612
01:03:46,260 --> 01:03:50,850
presidential candidate but support the

1613
01:03:48,659 --> 01:03:52,920
cannabis industry yes please do

1614
01:03:50,849 --> 01:03:54,329
absolutely everyone at this table I

1615
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:56,610
realize have in the cannabis industry

1616
01:03:54,329 --> 01:03:58,799
the legal cannabis industry that's

1617
01:03:56,610 --> 01:04:00,870
something I want to add I come from the

1618
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,720
black market I come from the dark side

1619
01:04:00,869 --> 01:04:05,099
of this industry if there weren't a

1620
01:04:03,719 --> 01:04:07,589
legal cannabis market you know where I

1621
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:09,509
would be you probably still be part of

1622
01:04:07,590 --> 01:04:11,880
the boy I'd be crushing the black market

1623
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:14,730
just like I used to do yeah yep now that

1624
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:17,880
I've got a legitimate job I pay a lot of

1625
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:20,159
damn taxes I have a time clock now I'm

1626
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:22,590
doing everything legit I've got I've got

1627
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:25,980
manifests and invoices for every gram of

1628
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:28,440
product I produce now it's I watched it

1629
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:30,570
happen I I spent a lot of time kind of

1630
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,869
in the gray world working for caregivers

1631
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:36,180
and how one by one did

1632
01:04:33,869 --> 01:04:38,339
dried up because it was too much of a

1633
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:40,259
hassle now there's not enough profit in

1634
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:42,150
in Colorado because most of that's going

1635
01:04:40,260 --> 01:04:46,250
to legal market now Mike and I got to

1636

01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:59,250
on the floor that [ __ ] we probably

1669
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:02,039
tried in the learning days the learning

1670
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:04,349
days were fun yeah a lot of a lot of

1671
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:06,509
years of experience a lot of battles

1672
01:06:04,349 --> 01:06:08,819
that were fought I mean years before the

1673
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:12,270
show started going to making it in

1674
01:06:08,820 --> 01:06:15,630
giving you guys I mean la decade's worth

1675
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:17,250
of lessons if you're still listening

1676
01:06:15,630 --> 01:06:18,630
like you had to fail

1677
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:20,760
I had to fail a thousand times to learn

1678
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:22,200
the hundred things that I learned I fail

1679
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,210
so many times I had to sit through

1680
01:06:22,199 --> 01:06:26,069
hundreds ounces hours of council

1681
01:06:24,210 --> 01:06:31,500
meetings 100 ounces hundred a hundred

1682
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:33,710
ounce council meetings watching the

1683
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:37,820
process happen yeah

1684
01:06:33,710 --> 01:06:41,130
watching we went to happen yep a whole

1685
01:06:37,820 --> 01:06:43,800
fiction on cultivation of a large farm

1686
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:45,900
when supportive that learned a lot yep I

1687
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:49,230
mean just going through and watching it

1688
01:06:45,900 --> 01:06:52,170
took up I mean hundreds of hours it just

1689
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:54,059
so that now that all of this is going

1690
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:56,940
down we can be active in it like it

1691
01:06:54,059 --> 01:06:58,440
takes work but come from the dark side

1692
01:06:56,940 --> 01:07:00,599
you guys come into the the legal

1693
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:03,358
regulated market pay some taxes much

1694
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:04,858

1696

stub and I work at a legitimate place

1698
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:10,710
and I'm like oh we'll give me a fat

1699
01:07:09,239 --> 01:07:12,599

1700

I'm gonna pay cash can I just buy a car

1701
01:07:12,599 --> 01:07:16,319

1702
01:07:15,030 --> 01:07:18,330
better just walk in there and be like

1703
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,609
look I have like a real line of work

1704
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:22,199
it felt really nice so just come from

1705
01:07:20,608 --> 01:07:24,869
the dark side join the regulated market

1706
01:07:22,199 --> 01:07:26,159
get legit don't hide don't have to look

1707
01:07:24,869 --> 01:07:28,500
over your shoulder all the time don't be

1708
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:31,529
a eyesore on the movement well I see

1709
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,539
people there'll be a legalization effort

1710
01:07:31,530 --> 01:07:36,060
running in their area and they'll be

1711
01:07:33,539 --> 01:07:39,269
fighting it because it's not enough in

1712
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:41,489
their eyes and if you look at Colorado's

1713
01:07:39,269 --> 01:07:44,099
rules and how it all hatched out like

1714
01:07:41,489 --> 01:07:47,069
it's not enough in our eyes we didn't

1715
01:07:44,099 --> 01:07:48,569
get clubs clubs are a big issue but

1716
01:07:47,070 --> 01:07:50,730
they're not even close to the only issue

1717
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:52,859
we I mean it's it's not enough yet it's

1718
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:54,900
just not but the reality of the

1719
01:07:52,858 --> 01:07:58,739
situation is it's the best scenario

1720
01:07:54,900 --> 01:08:01,090
anyone's got on the planet by

1721
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:03,069
there are a couple of states coming up

1722
01:08:01,090 --> 01:08:05,800
behind us that might end up in similar

1723
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:09,100
positions cannabis wise but is a

1724
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:11,100
consumer is a patient as a member of the

1725
01:08:09,099 --> 01:08:16,298
community like I can't see it getting

1726
01:08:11,099 --> 01:08:16,809
much better than this right now not for

1727
01:08:16,298 --> 01:08:18,130
us

1728
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:21,250
the only thing they can really improve

1729
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:23,079
for us is pricing and that comes in time

1730
01:08:21,250 --> 01:08:26,798
we watch that happen with the medical

1731
01:08:23,079 --> 01:08:28,960
market just takes time as more states

1732
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:31,539
legalize as the tourism industry dips

1733
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,909
down a little bit is more shops open

1734
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:36,819
this competition gets better is talent

1735
01:08:33,909 --> 01:08:38,500
people become more talented there's a

1736
01:08:36,819 --> 01:08:41,319
lot of brother-in-law's that got hired

1737
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:43,079
to grow a lot of warehouse wheat and it

1738
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:45,670
didn't come out so hot for some of them

1739
01:08:43,079 --> 01:08:47,380
still tend to be a problem for

1740
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:50,649
dispensaries I want to predict a

1741
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:53,170
cannabis shortage this summer it's a

1742
01:08:50,649 --> 01:08:56,798
it's been happening this state estimates

1743
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:58,329
were a ton or more under consumption for

1744
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:00,369
our production right now so we're not

1745
01:08:58,329 --> 01:09:03,850
even close to meeting demand can I bust

1746
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:06,579
out a humble brag I run an 80 we have 85

1747
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:10,029
oh I heard these no 85 lights in the

1748
01:09:06,579 --> 01:09:13,000
flowering room and I pulled 200 and I

1749
01:09:10,029 --> 01:09:14,350
think 217 pounds is what I think I

1750
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,939
remember reading Wow

1751
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:24,100
yeah two hundred and seventeen and a

1752
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:26,079
half pounds or something yeah I remember

1753
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:28,150
thinking 237 wood that might just be a

1754
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:31,028
number I made up my head sounds close so

1755
01:09:28,149 --> 01:09:33,429
somewhere around there yeah yeah I could

1756
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:34,779
go look but um it's I'm high as [ __ ] so

1757
01:09:33,430 --> 01:09:37,750
that numbers gone in my head but yet

1758
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:41,319
between 215 and 230 something pounds of

1759
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:44,289
usable cannabis underneath 85 lights we

1760
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:46,060
pulled about 2.2 pounds per light is

1761
01:09:44,289 --> 01:09:47,859
what I think we math that out maybe 2.5

1762
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:50,620
or something like that that's what I did

1763
01:09:47,859 --> 01:09:52,329
the math on so yeah

1764
01:09:50,619 --> 01:09:54,220
I'll do what I can to produce those

1765
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:55,750
tonnage --is of cannabis that we need

1766
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:57,070
for the summer you guys but I can't

1767
01:09:55,750 --> 01:10:00,279
promise you that it'll all be out there

1768
01:09:57,069 --> 01:10:02,649
see everybody got to do their part push

1769
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:04,960
out to something pounds from 85 lights

1770
01:10:02,649 --> 01:10:06,879
that should be inspiring like just look

1771
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,529
at the table for a second and then think

1772
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:09,619
back to ten years ago because that's

1773
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:12,840
where they are

1774
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:15,090
Texas New York I mean countless other

1775
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,079
states so there were we are ten or

1776
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,250
fifteen years ago

1777
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,140
I'm gonna give them five or six years

1778
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,699
about ten a lot of the dab thing is

1779
01:10:19,140 --> 01:10:22,680
catching on the internet moves us more

1780
01:10:20,699 --> 01:10:25,139
quickly and people travel a lot more and

1781
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:28,920
I'm going to blame a lot of things on

1782
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:31,200
the traveling of jam bands and the music

1783
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:32,460
scene when widespread goes on tour

1784
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:34,470
they're gonna stop I think they're in

1785
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:36,659
Austin this week people that traveled

1786
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:38,190
from Colorado to Austin are introduced

1787
01:10:36,659 --> 01:10:40,139
and I'm sure Austin's already got dads

1788
01:10:38,189 --> 01:10:42,719
and [ __ ] but they're introducing more

1789
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:44,520
people to shatter right now after the

1790
01:10:42,720 --> 01:10:47,190
widespread show right now some of that's

1791
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:49,860
made it out but like law wise what

1792
01:10:47,189 --> 01:10:52,679
happens if you get caught with it like

1793
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:54,949
in Ohio or a number of those middle

1794
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:58,950
states that nobody thinks about a lot

1795
01:10:54,949 --> 01:11:02,489
sorry Ohio but there's there's a lot of

1796
01:10:58,949 --> 01:11:04,800
states we're having cannabis is a major

1797
01:11:02,489 --> 01:11:06,659
offense it doesn't matter if you're sick

1798
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,190
it doesn't matter if you have cancer it

1799
01:11:06,659 --> 01:11:10,649
doesn't matter if you've got Crohn's

1800
01:11:08,189 --> 01:11:12,210
disease they'll take your kids they'll

1801
01:11:10,649 --> 01:11:14,460
take your house shout-out to my crew

1802
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:16,079
from Ohio veterans you'll listen but I

1803
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:18,079
got a crew that's on from Ohio that

1804
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:21,090
listen so shout out to all them kids

1805
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:23,010
Magoo what up brother look when I was in

1806
01:11:21,090 --> 01:11:24,569
Louisiana a year ago I watched somebody

1807
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:25,829
get like grabbed and thrown to the

1808
01:11:24,569 --> 01:11:27,599
ground for smoking a joint

1809
01:11:25,829 --> 01:11:31,159
yeah handcuffed and thrown the back of a

1810
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:34,260
squad car like in Party City

1811
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:36,599
it's no joke a lot of places in the laws

1812
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:39,270
move slow Louisiana just changed their

1813
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:40,789
laws though and it's interesting they

1814
01:11:39,270 --> 01:11:42,900
seem to be on the road to legalization

1815
01:11:40,789 --> 01:11:47,250
very very slowly

1816
01:11:42,899 --> 01:11:49,649
well they the current rigs are up to two

1817
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:52,170
and a half pounds is a misdemeanor hold

1818
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:53,489
your possession and a transfer of up to

1819
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:56,130
an ounce to another adult is a

1820
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:57,869
misdemeanor um they've got one of the

1821
01:11:56,130 --> 01:12:00,720
worst three strikes laws in the country

1822
01:11:57,869 --> 01:12:02,250
though but you could pretty much walk

1823
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:05,100
out of their Jail from what I've seen on

1824
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:08,609
YouTube pretty much get up and leave if

1825
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:10,260
you feel like yeah it's it's not

1826
01:12:08,609 --> 01:12:13,789
something you want to play with in a lot

1827
01:12:10,260 --> 01:12:15,750
of places in the laws slow to change

1828
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:17,340
sorry the coffin to the microphone you

1829

01:12:20,789 --> 01:12:23,739

1833
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:25,989

1834
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:28,300
don't take it personally I never do a

1835
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:29,889
hashtag we like it when they like it

1836
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:36,730
when we I forgot is I like it when you

1837
01:12:29,890 --> 01:12:38,230
ramble kind of a crazy show we've got

1838
01:12:36,729 --> 01:12:39,519
some weird places we're almost an hour

1839
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:41,649
and we're over an hour and ten minutes

1840
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,910
in so I'm sure this is anybody have

1841
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:47,079
anything important they want to wrap up

1842
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:49,809
a podcast with how about everybody make

1843
01:12:47,079 --> 01:12:50,500
their prediction for the election who'll

1844
01:12:49,810 --> 01:12:52,450
be the nominee

1845
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:54,579
oh dude it's too early for that [ __ ]

1846
01:12:52,449 --> 01:13:00,399
we're on preseason you can't make me

1847
01:12:54,579 --> 01:13:06,640
call the super wolf that's still too

1848
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:09,819
early to call I don't think I'm waiting

1849
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,410
to see the country flip out when the guy

1850
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:13,809
who gets the most votes doesn't get the

1851
01:13:11,409 --> 01:13:16,329
nomination because dude you can't put

1852
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:22,120
the crazy person in the room with the

1853
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:32,050
button there's no way the RNC lets that

1854
01:13:22,119 --> 01:13:34,029
happen but at the same point they

1855
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:36,909
haven't put to put forward a contender

1856
01:13:34,029 --> 01:13:40,269
Trump a trump presidency creates so much

1857
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:43,109
uncertainty our economy this is the

1858
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:46,000
David's happened to step into the right

1859
01:13:43,109 --> 01:13:47,500
big step by big step for the last 20

1860
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,060
years and this is what happens when you

1861
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:52,600
step off the cliff at the end of the red

1862
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:54,820
side that paired with the systemic

1863
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:56,980
defunding of public education yeah it's

1864
01:13:54,819 --> 01:14:01,989
a problem yeah I usually keep my mouth

1865
01:13:56,979 --> 01:14:03,729

1866
01:14:01,989 --> 01:14:09,729
