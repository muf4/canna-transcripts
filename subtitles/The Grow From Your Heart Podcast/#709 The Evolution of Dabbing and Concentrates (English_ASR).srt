rosin ryan will be on the next episode i

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,118

52
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:10,079
710 show this should be kind of the

53
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,680
warm-up for the 7-10 episode i focused

54
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,319
mainly on making concentrates on the

55
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,400
next show this one will be about how we

56
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,719
got to this point in the concentrate

57
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,080
world i'm in colorado here i guess i'm

58
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,400
going to evolve right into it i'm in

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
colorado here and i feel like i was kind

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,760
of uh

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,239
on the forefront excuse me i was on the

62
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,159
forefront uh in the scene if you will of

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,480
the evolution of concentrates i was

64
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:34,560
there um when some of the very first

65
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:35,919
concentrates were put out first first

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,239
things were made i got to try some of

67
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,878
the very first new products uh that

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,480
people had never seen before um some of

69
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,560
my friends were making live resin they

70
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,359
were the the innovators of the official

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,878
uh inception of live resin and from

72
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,760
there they were pulling the live resin

73
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:53,759
out of the uh the obi dose machine uh

74
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:55,359
and smoking it before it was even purged

75
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,878
or completely processed and they had a

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
special name for that i was smoking that

77
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,439
stuff but i started by smoking uh some

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,439
funky brown goop so i feel like i've

79
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:05,759
been around since the and a part of the

80
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,439
evolution of concentrates here in

81
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,598
colorado this new dab evolution of

82
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,680
course there is that old uh the old

83
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,518
bubble hash the old stuff that the older

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,120
uh the pressed hash the funky hash the

85
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,039
older guys like the old clientele that

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
come to the dispensary always ask for

87
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,759
old bubble hash

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,519
there's always been bubble hash around

89
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,199
but since the evolution since

90
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,360
legalization and medical cannabis

91
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,518
concentrates and dabs have really

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,360
evolved now let me uh step in and

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,080
correct myself i

94
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,159
need to talk about proper terminology

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,480
here before we get too far i keep saying

96
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:41,199
dabs um a dab is actually a verb dabbing

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,679
is a verb a dab is kind of a unit of

98
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:46,079
measurement the the phrase dab came from

99
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,480
uh i would get my dabber the little tool

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,120
on which i would scoop up my concentrate

101
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,438
onto my dabber so i could put it onto my

102
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,360
nail to consume it the amount of

103
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:58,318
concentrate that it would take to get me

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,640
properly medicated was a dab so when the

105
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,280
phrase dab came into this whole game it

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,679
was basically a unit of measurement now

107
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,519
the term the word has been used very

108
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,200
broadly it's like it's like a coke any

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,039
kind of a soda a carbonated beverage in

110
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:12,238
a can is now called a coke

111
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,639
that's kind of how dab has been

112
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,160
bastardized into the community into the

113
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,918
industry it's okay but i just want to

114
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,600
clear up some things here so that we're

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,639
all on the same page we all know what

116
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,040
i'm talking about what is a dab a dab is

117
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,439
basically a unit of measurement or an

118
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,000
amount of concentrate to be smoked i

119
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:31,918
want to take a dab hey do you have any

120
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,680
dabs i haven't taken any dabs today

121
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,799
that's how we would say that i could use

122
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,959
a dab

123
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
i like to take dabs that is kind of the

124
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,198
way it should be said

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,040
people say can i buy any dab from you uh

126
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,639
that's not really the way that would go

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,319
uh do you have any dab that's not the

128
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,560
way that would work a dab is kind of a

129
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,000
unit of measurement multiple doses would

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,918
be some dabs i think you get what i'm

131
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,680
saying uh what we should really be

132
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:57,680
saying is dabs are concentrates or

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,439
basically hash a lot of the older

134
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,160
audience will be more familiar with the

135
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,918
word hash that is hash is a cannabis

136
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,080
concentrate we have taken the valuable

137
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,680
the useful the medicinal part of that

138
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,599
plant we have stripped it from the green

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,079
leafy vegetable the green part the

140
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,560
flower part ah that is a carrier that is

141
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:16,240
what grew the trichomes the trichomes is

142
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,600
where the uh the potency is hidden the

143
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,879
trichomes are where the potency is

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,879
hidden maybe i should have said it that

145
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,719
way the trichomes are what we want we

146
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,719
have discovered methods and ways to

147
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,880
remove those trichomes from the plant

148
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,960
and now we are concentrating those

149
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,279
trichomes that potency that uh the

150
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,560
terpenes uh the other things are esters

151
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,159
palettes a lot of other things happening

152
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,160
but mainly we're going for the the

153
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,520
potency the trichomes uh the

154
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,880
cannabinoids and the terpenes are what

155
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,719
we're mainly after in there we're

156
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,879
concentrating that into a smaller form

157
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,800
and removing the leafy material that we

158
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,399
do not need to consume we're not horses

159
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,400
we're not rabbits we don't need the

160
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:51,198
green leafy matter like that we want to

161
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,279
smoke trichomes resin glands uh

162
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,960
cannabinoids terpenes that is what we're

163
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,799
after so we've discovered how to remove

164
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,799
that there are many ways to do it a lot

165
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,680
of people do it through uh you can do it

166
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,520
through uh just uh what is it agitation

167
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,120
you can not when the crystals those

168
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,359
crystals the trichomes when the crystals

169
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,918
fall off the weed and your grinder you

170
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,759
are making dry sift hash basically not

171
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,879
really but kind of that is trichomes

172
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,240
those are trichomes that is a

173
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,399
concentrate that is concentrated

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,400
trichomes if you press that into a puck

175
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,318
or roll it into a ball or simply scoop

176
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:21,519
it on top of your bowl that'll get you

177
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,360
extra buzz because that is a little

178
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,439
concentrated trichome a little

179
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,199
concentrated thc on those trichomes it's

180
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,279
going to get you extra buzzed there are

181
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,600
also fancier ways of making dry sift

182
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,119
hash i've seen people use bags you put a

183
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,800
bunch of trim or a bunch of weed and a

184
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,879
sieve bag with a certain size micron

185
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,120
screen beat the [ __ ] out of it for hours

186
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,199
all the trichomes fall off the the green

187
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,280
leafy matter is left in the bag also

188
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,680
another very popular method to do this

189
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,519
is by using water we've all been uh

190
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,000
educated we will be educated in the next

191
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,240
episode on using ice and water to remove

192
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,079
trichomes from the green leafy matter in

193
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,400
that case water is not being used as a

194
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:58,639
solvent is being used as an agitator as

195
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,239
a mechanical separator uh not as a

196
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,759
solvent so that's a different when they

197
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
say solventless yes that is still

198
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,919
solventless concentrate a lot of people

199
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,160
have discovered how to do it simply by

200
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,598
squishing a bud you can squish a bud and

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
you can make concentrates out of that a

202
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,279
lot of people will make bubble hash out

203
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,439
of the bubble bags take that and then

204
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,959
squish that and that makes really nice

205
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:19,279
rosin we'll talk about that in the next

206
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,519
episode then another very popular way

207
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,679
another thing that has evolved rapidly

208
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,359
oh let me touch on co2 oil also we can

209
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,598
make concentrates with

210
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,280
hexane propane co2 all kinds of other uh

211
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,598
gases i don't know the technical term

212
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,439
for what i'm trying to say here but it's

213
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:37,839
possible to make concentrates with many

214
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,839
other gases the one i am most familiar

215
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,758
with what i think is most commonly used

216
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,918
is butane i will not teach you how to

217
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,439
make butane concentrates we will not

218
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,758
talk too much about that because it is

219
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:49,598
dangerous and probably illegal where you

220
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,000
are i do not need to lead you down that

221
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,598
rabbit hole there are plenty of avenues

222
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,519
for you to learn how to do that if that

223
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,759
is your preferred method of making

224
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,198
concentrate so let's talk about i'm way

225
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,560
off of my notes i don't know where i am

226
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,919
but we're going to talk about oh i was

227
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,038
talking about the actual terms here

228
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,959
wasn't i

229
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,759
[ __ ] uh the most popular is butane

230
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:09,519
concentrates uh now in my in my opinion

231
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,598
uh the most popular here in colorado is

232
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,839
probably the butane extracted

233
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:15,839
concentrates if you get shatter uh if

234
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:17,519
you get batter if you get diamonds if

235
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,000
you get sauce most of the time those

236
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,799
were extracted with butane the other

237
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,279
most popular is the uh the fresh frozen

238
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,199
the live rosin people really love that

239
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:28,959
the price differences in butane hash and

240
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,439
rosin are astronomical we'll talk about

241
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:34,240
that in the next episode uh i was trying

242
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:38,080
to cover the uh the terminology here so

243
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,519
a dab is a dose a a hit of a concentrate

244
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
of some hash

245
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,918
um when we take those trichomes and we

246
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,639
pull it off of the plant and we use

247
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,958
either water agitation butane heat

248
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,439
however we achieve that process we have

249
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:52,639
now made hash or a concentrate is

250
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,320
basically what we've made we've

251
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,639
concentrated that potency into one

252
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,278
smaller uh amount and now you need less

253
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,838
of that to achieve the recreational or

254
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,600
medical dose which you now desire so

255
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
that is basically

256
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
a dab and what a dab is and what a

257
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,920
concentrate is now the act of taking a

258
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,320
dab is known as dabbing if you called

259
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:15,120
and i had a dab on the dabber and i was

260
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
putting that on the nail uh into the rig

261
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
i know that's a lot of terms we'll talk

262
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,759
about that if you called me right now

263
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,920
and he said what are you doing i'd say i

264
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,600
am dabbing or if i had some people over

265
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,278
and were just sitting on the couch

266
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,200
watching videos and taking dabs in a

267
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,278
group and just called me or texted me

268
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,640
and said what are you guys doing we are

269
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,320
dabbing so i think we've got the

270
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,319
terminology down pedro will touch on

271
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
that also in the next episode but i

272
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,800
wanted to make sure to cover that so we

273
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,560
know where we are we're all on this

274
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,838
podcast together we're going to talk

275
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,239
about concentrates dabbing dabs and the

276
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,240
evolution of such so here we go let's

277
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,759
talk more about that

278
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,639
i think i should start off kind of by

279
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,519
talking about how i got into

280
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:56,080
real concentrates real uh bho

281
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,839
concentrates my first dab maybe i'm

282
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,080
going to talk about my first pre-dab and

283
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,720
my first real dab and then i'll talk

284
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,079
about my first uh group dab i got to

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,519
change my notes because i just got an

286
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,679
idea not even gonna edit that i will

287
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,360
edit the change give me one second all

288
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,879
right my notes have been annotated i

289
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,639
will not forget one of the stories i

290
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,958
wanted to tell one detail i wanted to

291
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,399
put in this show one more avenue of

292
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,399
rambles i needed to add to the notes

293
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,639
here we go let's talk about uh one of

294
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,559
the first times i got real dabs of

295
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,199
course i was smoking concentrates with

296
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:27,119
friends uh before then we all would get

297
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
random [ __ ] that we thought was hash or

298
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,278
bubble hash or whatever people would

299
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,399
sell us or give us when we were younger

300
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:39,039
until this time period i had never been

301
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,200
stoned or high or ah dtfo that stands

302
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:44,719
for dabbed the [ __ ] out i have never

303
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,720
been dtfo like i was on this occasion so

304
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,639
let's talk about my first experience

305
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,800
acquiring some bho some butane honey oil

306
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,000
some butane extracted concentrate and my

307
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,359
experience

308
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,519
right around the time that medical

309
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,120
marijuana was becoming super popular in

310
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,200
my area this had to be uh 2007 2008

311
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,720
maybe 2006 i've got a brain injury

312
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
timelines are weird i'm getting old

313
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,480
shit's all blurry now anyway around that

314
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,039
time frame

315
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,480
i was doing um

316
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,000
business well this happened a long time

317
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,639
ago i was doing business with a friend

318
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,159
he had uh the most amazing sour diesel

319
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,759
that money could buy that [ __ ] was so

320
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,439
good you'd get in the car with it and

321
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,720
everyone would be like boom

322
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,720
and you light it up and your eyes would

323
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,240
itch and [ __ ] this dude

324
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,839
i was getting some sour diesel from him

325
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,278
this is like a weekly visit i'd go get

326
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,640
an ounce of sour d from this guy and try

327
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,720
to make it last a week it would never

328
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,799
[ __ ] work so one day i get some sour

329
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,879
d from my buddy and he passes me just a

330
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,240
little folded piece of parchment paper

331
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,039
it looks like a half a dollar sized

332
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,959
piece of parchment paper folded in half

333
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,439
inside of that parchment paper

334
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,719
was some goopy golden stuff and he gave

335
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
it to me he goes hit that when you get

336
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,000
home and let me know what you think so i

337
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,399
got home and i had time to look at what

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,240
i got i unfolded it and i realized this

339
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
is that bho stuff i've been hearing

340
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,759
about this is that butane honey oil that

341
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,278
i've been hearing about like in

342
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,559
magazines and hearing other people in

343
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:01,759
denver and [ __ ] talk about i heard

344
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,278
somebody talk about this recently and

345
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,639
they said they got so high they couldn't

346
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,639
handle themselves i was like i'm really

347
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,320
curious about this and it was just a

348
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
little teeny tiny bit it wasn't very

349
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,120
much now it would have been

350
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,199
maybe maybe a fat dab back then it was

351
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,039
several dabs but now that would have

352
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,959
been maybe one fat dab for me i take

353
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,199
pretty monstrous dabs that wouldn't have

354
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,119
been much now but back in the day

355
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,879
that was a lot so i took i got a little

356
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,720
scraper tool like a pipe cleaner tool

357
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,399
just something to scrape it up with and

358
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,000
i gathered some of it off the parchment

359
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,759
and i didn't have a proper way to smoke

360
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,879
it i didn't really have there were no i

361
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:34,000
didn't have a dab tool i didn't even

362
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,240
know i was going to be dabbing so there

363
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,839
was no dab equipment so i got a little

364
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
tiny pipe that was brand new it was a

365
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,720
gift from a dispensary i spent some

366
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,800
money at a dispensary they were nice

367
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,639
they threw me a glass pipe as a gift i

368
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,078
put a little tiny chunk of weed in the

369
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,519
bottom of the bowl just to cover the

370
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:48,879
hole like a screen

371
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,560
if you ever get any pipe that new hole

372
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,958
is too fresh in there i just took a

373
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:55,599
chunk of weed uh maybe one calyx maybe

374
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:58,000
it was one bract uh i stuffed that in

375
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,680
the hole to work as a screen then i took

376
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,839
half of that little glob of it wasn't

377
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,319
even glob it was half of a a big dab of

378
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,079
the bho concentrate and just smeared it

379
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
on top of there and then i sat at my

380
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:09,759
desk and i was supposed to go somewhere

381
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,199
i had that new sour diesel in my pocket

382
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,559
i was gonna go smoke with friends and go

383
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,160
do some [ __ ]

384
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:17,278
but instead

385
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,799
i took a lighter and i hit that bho just

386
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,399
a little bit just

387
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:22,479
i just took one good hit to where i got

388
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,879
like a nice lungful and as soon as it

389
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,920
hit my lungs my brain went oh

390
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,240
oh

391
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,360
oh oh we're gonna get high high i

392
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,399
thought we're getting high but we're

393
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,759
gonna get high high so my lungs went

394
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,200
on i blew it out and a cloud came out

395
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,278
and i changed colors

396
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,199
and i went from my desk chair

397
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:43,679
zombie mode to my bed face down just

398
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,078
and my body turned off i remember having

399
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:48,239
the most vivid dreams i was super high i

400
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,638
woke up my eyes were still bloody red

401
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,399
and i was hungry as [ __ ] i had to text

402
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,639
my buddy and i was like bro

403
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,639

404
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,600
and he's like bro that's bho and i made

405
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,879
that

406
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,360
i was like

407
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,039
how much more do you have

408
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,159
i i was so high i had to share that with

409
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,240
some friends i had to share that

410
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,480
experience so for a little while there

411
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,959
we were smoking bho on bowls we were

412
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,759
doing it all wrong it was working i got

413
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,679
i got high as [ __ ] but we were not doing

414
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,319
it right we needed to find the proper

415
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:19,838
equipment so that leads me to my second

416

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,040
been corrected hopefully through the

419
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,639
magic of editing you don't even notice

420
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,278

490
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,240
little dab so she takes a little tiny

491
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,719
dab deheats up what is known as a

492
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,519
swingarm skillet at this time he's got a

493
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,278
little piece of titanium that swings up

494
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,240
and you heat that and then it swings

495
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,160
down and it attaches to a piece of glass

496
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,919
that looks like it goes into the bong

497
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
and comes out like a bong stem would but

498
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,120
then it comes down it curves downward

499
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,199
and has a bell that would flare out uh

500
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,279
it's shaped like an umbrella or a bell

501
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,038
and a swing arm swings underneath the

502
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,399
opening of the belt to absorb the smoke

503
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,240
so that you could inhale through the

504
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,240
smoke uh the smoke through the bong

505
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,160
which this piece is attached to that

506
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,798
makes sense he had a little like a 10

507
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,079
inch tiny bong with not a big thick uh

508
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,359
stem on it so you didn't get too much

509
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,159
smoke in there at once it just went

510
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:34,079
straight to your head so he heats it up

511
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,798
ah way too hot back in the day we didn't

512
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,399
know yet heated it up way too hot uh put

513
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,038
the dab on there the girl that was with

514
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,320
me hit it and she went wobbly numb for a

515
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,079
couple of seconds i had to reach

516
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,439
underneath her arms and support her kind

517
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,279
of reach underneath her and hold her up

518
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,720
for a minute because she went wobbly uh

519
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,160
she went kind of frog leg kind of

520
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,160
fishing a little bit she blew out this

521
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,840
cloud she looked back at me she goes i

522
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,759
need to go sit down and i was like well

523
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:57,359
let me let me get she's like yeah yeah

524
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,440
you get one of those but i'm going over

525
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,798
there so she kind of bust out of the

526
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,080
crowd she had to go sit down get her

527
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,839
[ __ ] together take a drink catch her

528
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,079
breath and i'm like wow this looks like

529
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,759
a good [ __ ] time so i line up it's my

530
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:09,519
turn i got the rig right in front of me

531
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,720
big d drops a fat dab on there cause i'm

532
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:12,879
a white guy with dreads i look like i

533
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,279
know what i'm doing and i got

534
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,120
skyrocket high from that dab when i blew

535
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:19,359
out that smoke

536
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,038
my brain it felt like fireworks went out

537
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,479
one side a rocket ship flew out the

538
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,640
other but then it also felt like i [ __ ]

539
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,319
my pants at the same time a lot of

540
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,759
things were happening i was in it was

541
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,480
heaven and hell at the same time because

542
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:33,038
i was so high that i was like am i am i

543
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,960
having a stroke am i coming am i dying

544
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,480
is this living like i wasn't sure what

545
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,360
the [ __ ] was really happening from that

546
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,120
dab

547
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:41,199
but i know that i loved it because

548
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:44,399
before we left that event i went back

549
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,160
and bought one of the exact rigs that i

550
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
hit and i bought one of the exact

551
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,919
torches he used to heat that [ __ ] up

552
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,519
and i bought a bunch of concentrates

553
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,720
from everywhere i could find at that

554
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,200
event so from then we started dabbing

555
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,880
heavy now that will lead me into another

556
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
great story part of my evolution of

557
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,600
dabbing this is how it all began you

558
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,839
guys this is one of my favorite stories

559
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:04,959
to tell uh this may be a short podcast

560
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,079
actually because this camera is telling

561
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,960
me that the battery's low and it was at

562

dabs for everybody we all took a dab we

588
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,440

589
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:03,440
10 minutes

590
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,319

599
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,520
about a six hour nap uh when i woke up

600
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,200

601
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:29,599
time like bro did you fall asleep bro

up so we wrecked everybody that day and

604
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,678
that was the first time we got the whole

605
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,679

606

611
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,159
but that was when i killed the entire

612
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,319
crew

613
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,159
all right so that gets us into my first

614
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,519
second third dab story three good

615
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,679
stories is enough for this one let's

616
00:20:55,519 --> 00:21:00,879
talk a little bit more about the actual

617
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,519
evolution of dabbing uh when we started

618
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,320
this uh the bho concentrates we were

619
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,480
open blasting in enclosed places with

620
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,319
pvc tubes if you're a concentrate maker

621
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,159
or a concentrated consumer

622
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,038
all of those things are completely

623
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,480
absurd you should not be open blasting

624
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,240
which is if you don't know what that is

625
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,720
that's fine if you do you're going oh

626
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,120
man i remember those days uh that's just

627
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,240
blasting cans of butane haphazardly

628
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:27,759
through a pvc tube stuffed with

629
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,200
concentrates to make or stuffed with

630
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:30,720
weed to make concentrates out of it

631
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,080
don't do that

632
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,919
don't do that that is terrible the pvc

633
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,079
leeches you get gasses and [ __ ] from the

634
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,919
pvc in your concentrate you shouldn't be

635
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,119
open blasting and i said in enclosed

636
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,440
spaces

637
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,519
that's how [ __ ] blows up i know several

638
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,960
people that are scarred from head to toe

639
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,639
uh don't have any hair on their body

640
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,640
don't have any eyebrows and eyelashes

641
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,280
because they were making butane

642
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,280
concentrates incorrectly so we've gone a

643
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,359
long way we went from doing that in the

644
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:00,639
backyard with shitty equipment into

645
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,240
having professional amazing labs

646
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,320
but let's not overlook a bunch of the

647
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,558
steps that it took to get there we went

648
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,558
from like i said open blasting inside we

649
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,839
finally went outdoors we learned how to

650
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,960
get better equipment safer more sterile

651
00:22:10,839 --> 00:22:14,959
equipment people started learning about

652
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,480
science and reading science and

653
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,240
chemistry papers

654
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,759
we started getting vac ovens when we

655
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,839
started getting vacuum ovens and

656
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,480
learning how to properly purge the bho

657
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,480
concentrates the game changed forever

658
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,038
people can make better concentrates more

659
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,200
quickly batches could be larger

660
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,319
production stepped up quality stepped up

661
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,798
quite a bit

662
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,119
then it became an art the term extract

663
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,599
artist became super popular everybody in

664
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,439
colorado everybody in california you

665
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:43,279
were either a grower a breeder or an

666
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,759
extract artist some people were all of

667
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,759
the [ __ ] above um

668
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,119
making extracts and concentrates was

669
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,279
huge for a little while there when those

670
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:54,319
vacuum ovens became popular

671
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,240
uh then uh does anybody remember mystery

672
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,678
oils i've got mystery oils written down

673
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,159
i have to go fast here because that

674
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,440
camera is losing battery rapidly uh we

675
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,360
need to get another camera and figure

676
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,880
out some [ __ ] here um

677
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,879
remember mystery oil you guys if you're

678
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,200
around for mystery oil we started making

679
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,360
butane and we started purging properly

680
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,120
we started discovering a weird layer of

681
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,798
oils on top of our concentrates we

682
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,199
didn't know if it was coming from the

683
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:19,519
plants itself pesticides or something

684
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,919
applied to the plant or the big question

685
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,359
was is it coming from the butane cans

686
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,440
which we are buying and then later we

687
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,279
discovered guess what it was coming from

688
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,720
the cans of butane which we were buying

689
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,960
nobody knew what it was it was never

690
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,640
identified uh people were curious about

691
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,240
it a lot of us probably smoked a lot of

692
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,320
that [ __ ] didn't know it didn't realize

693
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,919
it still have no idea what it was maybe

694
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,678
that's why i twitch when i wake up in

695
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,440
the mornings you never know

696
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
um so we got much better we learned to

697
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,440
purge we got vac ovens

698
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,360
we discovered mystery oils mystery oil

699
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,679
was a good time our concentrates went

700
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:52,639
from black poop soup i used to call

701
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,400
things poop soup and tane soup uh butane

702
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,840
soup you'd get dabs you'd get

703
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,440
concentrate you'd take a dab of it and

704
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:59,278
you'd put it on somebody's nail or your

705
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,000
nail and it would sparkle and it would

706
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,519
make a stain now concentrates they burn

707
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,558
smooth and does they vaporize and they

708
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:08,480
disappear cleanly here's a quick trick

709
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,399
random side notes from ross to jeff if

710
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,400
anybody ever offers you a dab a puff of

711
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,240
a concentrate or even some flowers that

712
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,240
you don't want to smoke my way of

713
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,558
diverting that conversation and politely

714
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,759
avoiding that is i go oh man that looks

715
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,319
pretty good you want to try some of what

716
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,919
i got and then i bust out mine and it

717
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:25,519
always diverts the conversation you

718
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,440
don't have to smoke their dabs or their

719
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,200
flowers if it looks questionable i

720
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,080
understand sometimes i don't want to

721
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,759
smoke

722
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:33,439
certain concentrates that i see that

723
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,278
certain people bring around no offense

724
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,720
to anybody but some of your concentrate

725
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,079
looks like complete [ __ ] and i'm not

726
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:42,400
gonna smoke it i'm not gonna put my

727
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:44,960
lungs my health my body at risk um also

728
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,960
ew i just don't wanna smoke it so ah you

729
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,679
can avoid smoking other people's nasty

730
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,600
poop soup their tang crap uh their their

731
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:53,038
butane batter just by saying ah check

732
00:24:51,599 --> 00:24:54,158
this out bro and show it to them and you

733
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,759
both take a dab of that and then you

734
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,278
still have a friend and then if they're

735
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,200
really insisting you'd be like oh man

736
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,640
i'm high after the dab i took and you

737
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,159
could just keep making excuses all day

738
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,159
but you could politely tactfully dodge

739
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,919
it got a couple of excuses for you let

740
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,320
me get my high rambly ass back on track

741
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,360
now we went from poop soup to the stuff

742
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,038
that we have now you guys we had um

743
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,558
stuff would come out liquidy and goopy

744
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,319
on the wrong color and then it started

745
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,079
to shatter we had concentrates called

746
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,839
shatter they used to say if it don't

747
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,240
shatter it don't matter and then we

748
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,759
realized a lot of the shatter was lipids

749
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,120
and things that we don't really want to

750
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,640
smoke and then we started learning that

751
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,798
you could whip it and turn it into a

752
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,600
batter i really like a nice batter

753
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,278
especially a live batter that's when you

754
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,038
fresh freeze it then extract it then

755
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:36,960
make a batter out of it but i like a

756
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,759
batter i feel like it's very terpe uh

757
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,519
has a lot of terpenes a lot of flavor

758
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:45,278
and i really think that the feeling in

759
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:46,879
the lungs is great uh so we had uh goop

760
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:49,038
and then we had shatter then we had

761
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,880
batter uh then we had wax people learned

762
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,400
how to make it into a waxy texture

763
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
sometimes i really liked the wax you'd

764
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,080
get a big old glob of wax and heat up

765
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,519
the dab nail and just press the wax

766
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,199
right into the dab nail and smoke as

767
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,720
much as you want all in one big rip that

768
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,720
was pretty fun to do

769
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,319
um we had crumble stuff that would just

770
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,000
fall apart and crumble there are so many

771
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:08,639
different textures of concentrates and

772
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,159
so many different names i got regionally

773
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,320
a guy known as a lot of different [ __ ]

774
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,840
also you could go from pueblo to denver

775
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,038
up to boulder and the same [ __ ] would be

776
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:16,639
called something different you'd find

777
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:18,798
earwax in different places it'd be

778
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,720
called crumble in a different place uh

779
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,558
you can tell why it's called earwax pull

780
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
out a chunk of goopy earwax and look at

781
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:25,678
it there was a concentrate that looked

782
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,120
like that whatever color that [ __ ] is

783
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,480
that came out of your ear there was a

784
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,678
concentrate that looked like that

785
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,960
somewhere

786
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,960
so now

787
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,360
we've gotten better and cleaner

788
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,000
concentrates now we've got diamonds and

789
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,839
sauce and live rosins and live batter

790
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,919
now we can basically i'm not a

791
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,000
scientologist i'm not a concentrate

792
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,480
maker i'm not an extraction nearest in

793
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,679
any way but now i understand that we can

794
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,759
basically extract and divide uh any of

795
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:54,000
the components of the plant which we so

796
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,839
desire we can pull out the terpenes in

797
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,839
one container uh we can pull off the

798
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,359
cannabinoids in another container we can

799
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:01,038
pull out the pesticides in another

800
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,119
container and isolate all of those

801
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:04,960
components of the cannabis plant is

802
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,759
where this evolution has gotten now we

803
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:12,000
are making uh big diamonds out of

804
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:13,759
straight thc a it's 99.9 percent thc and

805
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,359
that one percent is just atmospheric

806
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,359
allowances there's got to be oxygen and

807
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:18,879
some moisture and [ __ ] in there

808
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,959
now we can also make the same thing with

809
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,919
cbd crystals and isolates it's amazing

810
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,840
to me

811
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,840
you can buy 99

812
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,278
cannabis derived terpenes and you can

813
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,199
mix your own crystals and your own

814
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,599
terpenes together and make your own

815
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,278
ratios to the amount that you like i

816
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,278
don't i used to really love the diamonds

817
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,558
but i feel like they're uh i don't i

818
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,000
like the buzz but i feel like when i

819
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:40,079
smoke those diamonds without enough

820
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,558
terps the thc just makes me go real high

821
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:45,038
for a minute and there's no fun to the

822
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,480
buzz it's like i'm really high but nah

823
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:48,558
no i'm not it's just weird i feel like

824
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,519
the terps really give a color to the

825
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,119
buzz if my buzz was a firework the thc

826
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,519
makes me fly up in the air and then the

827
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,439
terpenes are the color of my buzz and

828
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,879
those crystals don't have any color to

829
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,798
them in the buzz bro they get you real

830
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,320
high make your chest feel weird get your

831
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,240
heart racing make your blood sugar do

832
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,639
weird [ __ ] but i'm not a big fan of the

833
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,599
high without some sort of backup into

834
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,480
there

835
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:10,798
um

836
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,919
i feel like i feel like this is my

837
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:13,519
prediction i don't know if i've ever

838
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,679
said this on a podcast i know i've said

839
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:17,278
this in previous uh instagram live

840
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,360
videos and other weird rambles where i

841
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:22,079
have appeared but here is a prediction

842
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,839
that i do see coming uh in the future if

843
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,439
it doesn't already exist and there uh

844
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,959
babylon's just keeping it from us it's a

845
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,240
big conspiracy but really this is what i

846
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,798
do see coming

847
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:33,120
in the future ideally i think that each

848
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:35,278
uh patient consumer uh either

849
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:38,239
recreational or medically will be able

850
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,319
to walk into uh maybe a dispensary it

851
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,839
might just be your normal store who

852
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:44,079
knows you may be able to do this at

853
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:47,439
starbucks but i would like to be able to

854
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:51,038
walk into a place um and i can hand them

855
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,558
my card and my card has my preferred mix

856
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:53,679
now hear me out this sounds crazy but

857
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,599
when we get there together you're going

858
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,360
to go i want this card

859
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,678
imagine when you go when we were a kid

860
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,678
and we would go to um

861
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,440
round table pizza is where i went bro i

862
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,960
just had a crazy flashback did you see

863
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,558
it happen in my face

864
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,720
round table pizza was the pizza place

865
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,798
near me and they had all of the soda

866
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,000
machines in a row you could get coke

867
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:15,759
diet coke cherry coke um [ __ ] vanilla

868
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,038
coke pepsi tea

869
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:21,919
uh sun kiss um what's the [ __ ] other

870
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:25,038
one maybe some fanta some dr pepper uh

871
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,320
maybe even some lemonade um who knows

872
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:30,240
what the [ __ ] else they had on that row

873
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:31,599
of [ __ ] sugary diabetes drinks but um

874
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,679
you could go make your we call it a

875
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,278
suicide right you could put um if you

876
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,480
put sprite in the suicide you're [ __ ]

877
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,319
it all up why would you do that you want

878
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,159
to put all the darkest colors the cherry

879
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,839
the dr pepper i'd make the most

880
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,679
disgusting concoctions of sugar and

881
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,480
syrup you could out of that thing

882
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:49,759
what if you could walk into a dispensary

883
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,519
a terp box a dab box whatever you want

884
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,839
to call this place and you could hand

885
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:56,000
them your card and that card said my

886
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:57,278
preferred slurry is this and you drop

887
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,038
that card maybe you just swipe it in

888
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,278
there's no people you put it into a

889
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,519
machine and the machine says oh rosted

890
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:06,079
jeff is here he wants a concentrate that

891
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,679
is this let's say

892
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:12,240
50 thc a because i like to get real high

893
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,919
then let's put uh and i'm just making up

894
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,079
numbers i don't know the numbers here

895
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,120
this is i'm creating this as we go this

896
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:22,639
is my dream come live it with me my card

897
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:24,798
says that i want 50 thc a in my slurry

898
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,440
zero cbd because i don't [ __ ] with cbd

899
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:29,679
that ruins my buzz i want some limonene

900
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
i want some linalool uh i want a little

901
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,720
bit of pinene in there and let's put

902
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:34,319
some mercing in there just to kick it

903
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,319
off and then i don't know what other

904
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,480
cannabinoids paleocene esters we can add

905
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,398
to that yet but in the future science

906
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,759
will know what things we can add to that

907
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:43,839
maybe we're just going to put some

908
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,440
caropholine in there uh maybe we'll just

909
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,439
add weird components of other [ __ ] in

910
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,360
there that are organic compounds it will

911
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,480
help that buzz affect me the way that i

912
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:53,839
need to for my medical or recreational

913
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,399
desire

914
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:58,879
maybe i've got uh two or three recipes

915
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,798
on a card that i can just swipe this

916
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,840
card maybe i can set my settings on my

917
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:05,599
phone and say i want to get high as [ __ ]

918
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:07,278
torah when i smoke this concentrate

919
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,119
fireworks go off in my brain and i can

920
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,558
levitate and then maybe i've got another

921
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:12,639
one that i can go to my phone and say i

922
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,639
need to take a [ __ ] nap knock me out

923
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,559
put me down i can make two different

924
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,399
concentrates swipe my card it spits both

925
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:21,038
of them out puts a label on them this

926
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,558
one is 50 thc a bunch of limonene some

927
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,240
linalool you're going to get high as

928
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,440
[ __ ] this one over here is all sleepy

929
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,519
time components i don't know what that

930
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,519
would be for my body but that's in this

931
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,599
one it spits them out charges my card

932
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,278
sends me home i get to go take dabs of

933
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:37,119
rosted jeff's custom slurry concentrate

934
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,278
just imagine walking around with your

935
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,119
own vape pen with your custom slurry or

936
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,119
your own dab rig and hitting your own

937
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,879
custom slurry and then your friends got

938
00:31:43,119 --> 00:31:46,319
their own uh it's like mixing jelly

939
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,480
bellies and finding your flavors or

940
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:49,599
mixing up [ __ ] sodas all day i really

941
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,319
think that's the way of the future

942
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,319
that's what i want to see in cannabis in

943
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:57,278
concentrate development improvement

944
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:59,678
because right now i love the textures

945
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,359
the batters the butters the sauces all

946
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,600
of that i love it

947
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,158
the terpenes cannot be beat

948
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,918
cannabis concentrates the flavors are at

949
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,919
an all-time peak

950
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,600
i've got some gmo concentrates and some

951
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,480
garlic banger concentrates that when you

952
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,119
open the jar it is almost disgusting

953
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,640
it's almost vile it almost makes you go

954
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,918
and then you wanna you take a dab of it

955
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,880
and you blow it out and your mouth has

956
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,679
this like

957
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,679
burnt rubber rotten eggs gas and skunk

958
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,080
thing on it and you go

959
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,320
that's disgustingly delicious can i have

960
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,599
another dab of that terpenes have never

961
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,599
been stronger we're learning how to

962
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:35,678
preserve the terps in the grow and the

963
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,759
dry and cure or the harvest process even

964
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,679
if there's no drying cure and then also

965
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,960
in the concentrate production and then

966
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,360
in the preservation of those

967
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:45,600
concentrates the transport those jars

968
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,278
have to get from uh one facility to

969
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:49,038
another and stay fresh and then you have

970
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,798
to buy it and get it home like we're

971
00:32:49,038 --> 00:32:53,440
learning a lot about preservation of

972
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:54,798
terpenes and these concentrates

973
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,480
all right we got enough battery to keep

974
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,558
talking we can make a podcast out of

975
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,880
this uh the evolution of the gear and

976
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:02,879
the actual dab i mentioned before that

977
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,960
we had this swing arm skillet before we

978
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,240
were just stuffing concentrates on top

979
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,840
of weed and smoking it like that i

980
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,159
didn't have a real dab pen or a real

981
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,398
concentrate device then we got the swing

982
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,159
arm skillet that was pretty cool

983
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,759
except sometimes the dabs would roll off

984
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,840
the skillet onto your [ __ ] leg or

985
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,359
onto the table or you got hot oil and

986
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:20,959
you're like that [ __ ] sucked that time

987
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,240
period everything was sticky and [ __ ]

988
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,759
sucked torches have come a long way you

989
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,000
got to torch the nail you got to torch

990
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,599
the skillet torch companies and torches

991
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,759
have come a long way big up to all the

992
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:33,839
torch companies that tortured us and

993
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:36,319
helped improve us along the way

994
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,879
nails dab nails have come a long way

995
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,558
back in the day we used a big-ass

996
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,399
metal nail some crap metal then it was

997
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,240
titanium they got big shout out to our

998
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:47,119
friends taskrock and highly educated

999
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,038
titanium tasks changed the game then we

1000
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,038
went from titanium everybody switched

1001
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,038
over to quartz bangers then from the

1002
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,960
banger everybody switched over to the

1003
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:57,038
new terp slurper things have really

1004
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,600
changed quickly there

1005
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:01,278
also there are e-nails oh let's talk

1006
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,439
about the torch and the temperature you

1007
00:34:01,278 --> 00:34:04,720
guys uh do i have that written down

1008
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,440
that's coming up yeah we'll talk about

1009
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,119
that next uh then we got e-nails instead

1010
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,480
of heating up the nail all the time we

1011
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,320
found an e-nail we could set it the

1012
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,760
right temperature and hit that [ __ ] all

1013
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,519
day long

1014
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,159
uh then we got a puffco we started

1015
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,639
getting electronic devices the puffcos

1016
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,240
uh dab pins then things went crazy from

1017
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:24,559
there now the options for smoking are

1018
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,239
[ __ ] endless

1019
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:29,440
one thing i forget to talk about is the

1020
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:32,158
atmos raw vape uh there was this little

1021
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,599
device that i watched ruin people's

1022
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,119
lives you would put concentrates in a

1023
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,639
one dram or a half dram glass vial it

1024
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,559
sounds like drugs already it looked like

1025
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,320
[ __ ] drugs you'd screw it into this

1026
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,480
little metal pipe it was an aluminum

1027
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,639
apparatus that basically was big enough

1028
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,639
for your hand to hold and then you would

1029
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,240
slowly heat that glass vial that had the

1030
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,838
concentrates in there with a small torch

1031
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,439
and you would inhale

1032
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,838
it looked and felt a lot like you were

1033
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,880
doing drugs you really don't want to get

1034
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,480
caught doing but the dabs or the dry

1035
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,358
dabs it wasn't a dab because it was just

1036
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,119
a straight dry vapor rip from hot hot

1037
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,440
concentrates through a metal pipe and a

1038
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,000
glass vial the rips you would get from

1039
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,400
that could ruin your weekend you would

1040
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,719
cough so hard your lung would come out

1041
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,160
of one side your esophagus would pop out

1042
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:20,078
snot would come out of your eye and

1043
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,239
tears would come out of your nose it was

1044
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,920
a [ __ ] up delicious experience i watch

1045
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,319
people throw up from that thing i watch

1046
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,079
people pass out from it i got so high it

1047
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,480
was beautifully uncomfortable that thing

1048
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,839
would ruin people so the atmos i think

1049
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,920
it was called the admin no that was a

1050
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,519
different device that was this was not

1051
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,960
the atmos raw you guys i was wrong when

1052
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:39,280
i said that what was that [ __ ] thing

1053
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,039
called it was metal i've got one

1054
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,400
somewhere um i don't know what it's

1055
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:44,960
called that thing would just [ __ ]

1056
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,358
ruin people's days it was metal

1057
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,440
uh might have been the cloud v it wasn't

1058
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,440
that either there were so many apparatus

1059
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,880
and devices we went there i did say

1060
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,800
devices is on purpose i was trying to be

1061
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,240
bobby lee um

1062
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,079
if you think what that metal [ __ ]

1063
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:59,519
thing is called it a vial screwed into

1064
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:01,440
and you heat up the vial and smoke

1065
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,440
concentrates through that i'll try to

1066
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,760
find mine it's in a box somewhere i'll

1067
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,519
post a picture of it if i can find it um

1068
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,880
that thing used to [ __ ] me up how are we

1069
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,599
doing on battery all right we're doing

1070
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,240
good uh we are well um

1071
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,119
eventually we learned not to heat the

1072
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:19,118
dab nail uh into oblivion like we were

1073
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,960
trying to reshape the [ __ ] thing for

1074
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,519
a long time there we thought the hotter

1075
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,000
the dab nail the better the dab

1076
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,480
then we learned uh the term was you

1077
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,639
gotta waste it to taste it we developed

1078
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,960
a thing called a carb cap we did not

1079
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:35,039
shout out to my buddy taskrock

1080
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,119
taskrock is who i know for pioneering

1081
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:39,519
the carb cab it was a device that would

1082
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,838
go over your dab nail that would trap

1083
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,920
the heat and oxygen inside the dab nail

1084
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,279
and limit oh man we used to have domes

1085
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,960
too we didn't even talk about domes on

1086
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,079
the dab rig we skipped that how old

1087
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,760
school are you

1088
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,079
if she doesn't know what a dome on a dab

1089
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,680
nail is she's not old enough for you bro

1090
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,039
anyway we're going to skip right over

1091
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:56,399
the domes you guys know what those were

1092
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:57,838
it was a dome to go over the dab nails

1093
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,599
so that the air didn't get old the smoke

1094
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,519
didn't get away or trapped the air uh

1095
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,760
eventually we went to a domeless nail

1096
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,679
then we went to a carb cab when we

1097
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,520
started putting the carb cap on it would

1098
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:09,199
trap the heat inside the nail and it

1099
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,960
would trap it would minimize the flow of

1100
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,879
oxygen which would create a vacuum on

1101
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,920
the surface of the nail and give you a

1102
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,320
much larger smoother burning dab a

1103
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,720
better concentrate a better vaporization

1104
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,559
if you will without as much heat which

1105
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,159
gave you a bigger better dab without

1106
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:28,719
roasting your lungs which got me higher

1107
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:31,759
it got me less lung pain and it tasted

1108
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,319
so much better so we learned the term

1109
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,880
was taste it to waste it because the

1110
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,000
cooler dabs low temp dabs tend to taste

1111
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,559
a little bit better because you're not

1112
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,000
burning off those terps so over time we

1113
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,920
learn to adjust and control our

1114
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,519
temperatures a little bit better

1115
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,440
i still go a little hot i kind of like a

1116
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:50,320
little bit hot but we have learned quite

1117
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,880
a bit the word used to be glowies uh we

1118
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,280
used to do red hot dabs and call them

1119
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,119
glowies it'd be glowies for harambe uh

1120
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,800
glowy's for jesus whoever it was for

1121
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,838
that day but we would do globbies back

1122
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,519
in the day

1123
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,880
and they would [ __ ] hurt my lungs are

1124
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,440
probably still burned up from a couple

1125
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,519
of hot hot glowys then i forgot about

1126
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,720
ninja dabs bro ninja dabs are not on the

1127
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:12,320
notes but a ninja dab um if i'm taking a

1128
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,239
dab right nice and peacefully right

1129
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,599
we're gonna act like this is my dab tool

1130
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:17,039
i'm gonna take a dab on the microphone

1131
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,519
here i'll look into this camera as i do

1132
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,639
it right got my dab i'm nice and ready

1133
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:22,639
right

1134
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,639
as soon as i get my dab to the device

1135
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,039
one of my [ __ ] friends reaches in

1136
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:29,598
with guess what another dad and doubles

1137
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,519
up my [ __ ] dab now i'm doing two dabs

1138
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,880
didn't expect to do two dabs that's

1139
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,320
called the ninja dab now i'm gonna be

1140
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,358
double high i'm gonna cough twice as

1141
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,440
hard

1142
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:39,279
it's kind of a dick move but also thanks

1143
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,400
for the dab bro another thing that i

1144
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,079
used to do

1145
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,160
i used to set time bombs what the [ __ ]

1146
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,079
is a time bomb i would put another dab

1147
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:47,679
underneath the carb cap so that i

1148
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,160
wouldn't even have to ninja dab you you

1149
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:52,078
would ninja dab yourself you would take

1150
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,519
a dab and then you'd grab the carb cap

1151
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,960
and you'd set the carb cap on the nail

1152
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,199
this is my nail right here for now for

1153
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,559
this the sake of movie magic here you'd

1154
00:38:57,199 --> 00:38:59,759
be doing your dab

1155
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:00,559
and then you'd set your carb cap on

1156
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,240
there

1157
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,400
and you'd get more dabs and you'd be

1158
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,919
like what why is it smokier than ever

1159
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,440
and now you got to do two dabs and you

1160
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,358
only expected one

1161
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,519
you just got time bombed or booby

1162
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,920
trapped what's wrong with the dab booby

1163
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:15,440
trap who doesn't want an extra dab maybe

1164
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,960
sometimes you don't want an extra dab

1165
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,079
but sorry dude you were at ross to

1166
