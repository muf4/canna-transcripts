the course right so it says tougher

112
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,599
rules on Colorado marijuana edibles for

113
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,918
serving size and child safety this

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,320
article is by Eric Gorski from The

115
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:18,680
Denver Post it says Colorado's

116
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,599
recreational marijuana edible

117
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,560
manufacturers face tougher rules on

118
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,759
potency serving size and packaging of

119
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,439
their products under stop Gap rules

120
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,720
adopted by state Regulators Thursday the

121
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,120
new guidelines in response crafted in

122
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,080
response to concerns about overc

123
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,280
consumption by inexperienced consumers

124
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:37,879
will do away with bite-sized products

125
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:40,519
that pack in 100 Mig of the psychoactive

126
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:43,560
chemical THC the maximum allowed by

127
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:45,279
state law products may contain up to 100

128
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,120
milligrams of THC but they must be

129
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:49,959
easily broken off into pieces that have

130
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,399
10 milligrams or fewer the standardized

131
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:54,038
edible serving size under state law so

132
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,038
now they uh We've standardized

133
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:59,199
apparently 10 Mig is a serving of edible

134
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:02,000
cannabis so if you buy a 100 milligram

135
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,439
bar they want it easily divisible in 10

136
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,038
pieces uh I shouldn't say names of

137
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:08,199
products but you know have a kit kat is

138
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:09,399
already kind of separated into servings

139
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,079
that's kind of how I see they could do

140
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:12,638
it and uh sorry Kit Kat that I Ed you

141
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,560
but your serving [ __ ] is perfect for my

142
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,478
example or Hershey's bar has got they're

143
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
already divided perfectly so that's what

144
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,439
they're going to require of all of these

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,918
pieces and I got to say that uh that

146
00:06:20,439 --> 00:06:25,560
edible that I ate on the show was 350

147
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,399
milligram it was small uh I'm trying to

148
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,519
measure it in my head to give to have

149
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,719
something to compare it to uh but it was

150
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:35,279
quite tiny uh man I don't have anything

151
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,240
in my range that is about the same size

152
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,439
it was about the size of the top of a

153
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,918
pill bottle cap like that cap on your

154
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:44,360
pill bottle was about that big uh like

155
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,000
an inch and a half by an inch and a half

156
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,720
and it was slightly thick uh but the

157
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,478
thing was there was no way to judge uh

158
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,599
you could break it in half I guess and

159
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:55,800
kind of eyeball it but there was no way

160
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,199
to really judge the size of that sort of

161
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,598
an edible so they're going to make it to

162
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,960
where they have to be easily broken up

163
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:04,918
and then that way you eat 10 Mig instead

164
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:06,719
of trying to guess instead of getting

165
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,439
wrecked but anyway and another change

166
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,960
manufacturers will be required to put

167
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:11,598
single serving Edibles in child

168
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,560
resistant packaging before shipping them

169
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,959
to stores instead of relying on stores

170
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,120
to provide the packaging as customers

171
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:19,878
leave with their purchases so I think

172
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,120
that means more costs also that's going

173
00:07:19,879 --> 00:07:24,319
to go up because the manufacturer now

174
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,000
has to pay for that and then that's just

175
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,039
going to get moved right on down the

176
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,959
line to the dispensary and that's going

177
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:31,560
to get pushed right on Down the Line you

178
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,959
because now you're able to bring in they

179
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,199
give you this uh big white it looks like

180
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,519
a money envelope kind of like a bank bag

181
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,199
but it's got a child resistant zipper

182
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:41,719
thing on it that's got like a clasp on

183
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,319
the zipper that you have to know how to

184
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,879
open uh and if you bring that you can

185
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,479
put all of your Edibles and stuff in

186
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:49,360
there and they let that count as your

187
00:07:47,478 --> 00:07:50,878
childproof container and you actually

188
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,080
you can buy those or they charge you for

189
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,520
them a at a lot of the dispensaries so

190
00:07:53,079 --> 00:07:55,839
there's going to go put that right on

191
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,918
the product already you're going to pay

192
00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,560
a little more but I guess uh a couple of

193
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,158
bucks to Keep Kids Safe is what we got

194
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,079
to do and then you get into the argument

195
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:05,800
of what about parenting it's not uh it's

196
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,439
not all about the products it's about

197
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,280
the parenting but that's another

198
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,199
argument probably a whole another

199
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,638
podcast that talks about that so the

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,319
rules this one says the rules which uh

201
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:17,120
still must be made permanent in a

202
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:19,360
process that will include public comment

203
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,519
will go into effect November 1st they

204
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,919
grew out of meetings with health

205
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:24,318
officials Regulators industry

206
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,399

207
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,520
sides the marijuana enforcement

208
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,399
division's primary concern is to ensure

Revenue wrote in an email marijuana

212
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,080
enforcement division feels that clear

213
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:40,360
serving size requirements within the

214
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,800
industry is a vital part of responsible

215
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:44,879
regulation Rachel O'Brien a founding

216
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,599
member of smart Colorado which supports

217
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,919
tighter restrictions on marijuana said

218
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,759
the rules are a step in the right

219
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,559
direction but time will tell whether

220
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,120
they go far enough Edibles manufacturers

221
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,919
responding to public demand already

222
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,360
shifted to lower potency edible since

223
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:01,159
recreational sales began January 1st

224
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,240
said Mike Elliot executive director of

225
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:05,278
the marijuana Industry Group the free

226
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:08,240
market has largely addressed this

227
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,838
problem he said well I kind of agree uh

228
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,480
that 350 milligram edible that I ate it

229
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:16,320
[ __ ] me up and I'm a professional pot

230
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:18,480
smoker I take dabs all day uh I wake and

231
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,720
bake on a regular basis you know I'm not

232
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,399
bragging about how much I smoke or

233
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,800
anything but I I get down uh I'm smoking

234
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,000
live resin right now uh I probably took

235
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,399
a couple of half gr dabs

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,078
today uh and that edible wrecked me so

237
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,159
if somebody if a normal civilian got a

238
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:34,879
hold of that thing and ate the whole

239
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:37,199
thing they'd be destroyed and they would

240
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:39,838
have a miserable experience so I think

241
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,759
clearly marking it is a key that's a

242
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,360
great idea we all remember the story of

243
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,720
the lady uh from New York Marino Dow

244
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,399
that ate too much Edibles and thought

245
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,839
she was [ __ ] turning herself inside

246
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,559
out and dying in her hotel room nobody

247
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:55,000
wants to be that guy well guys I think

248
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:56,078
that's enough news for the day I just

249
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,159
kind of wanted to read you that one

250
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,559

consume that at this time because I'm

261
00:10:17,799 --> 00:10:22,199

better I'll turn me down and him up

336
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:43,480
that'll make this happen uh So speaking

337
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,719
of hyro a couple of people that have

338
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,159
been listening to the podcast kind of

339
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,519
called us out they said 550 bucks for a

340
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:53,719
tote of soil if I go online that's only

341
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,759
$299 they're correct I did some research

342
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:59,560
uh the caveat is if you pay

343
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,879
$299 shipping is $249

344
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,399
because it's got to be shipped on a

345
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:07,159
FedEx truck we were just talking about

346
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:08,839
how big a tote of soil is it's about the

347
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:11,799
size of a

348
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,120
Volkswagen uh it's probably 3 and 1/2 4T

349
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:16,399
wide by 3 and 1/2 to 4T tall depending

350
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,839
on how much uh it's been compressed cuz

351
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,320
it is going to be kind of squished down

352
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,160
by uh gravity and being moved around and

353
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,199
they're they're heavy as [ __ ] yeah how

354
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,159
are they get that off the truck when

355
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,719
they bring it to your house uh with a

356
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:29,679
pallet jack so yeah you know right to

357
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,320
your front yard so figure out it you

358
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,359
know figure it out from there yeah know

359
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,920
where it's going to go when they get

360
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,800
there maybe you can sweet talk the guy

361
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:38,039
into into getting it there so uh uh this

362
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,198
show is brought to you by Hy gr indor

363
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:40,439
growing supplies make sure you check out

364
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:41,719
hyro I'm pretty sure I already said that

365
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,360
once in the show but I like giving them

366
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,199
love because they give us a lot of love

367
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,600
uh Jesse's back he's going to give us a

368
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,919
grow lesson uh we should review a little

369
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,959
bit of what we've done uh by now we

370
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:55,679
should have some big ass bushes that are

371
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,278
in the veg stage right oh yeah yeah uh

372
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,958
we've talked a little bit about feeding

373
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,399
we've talked about top dressing a little

374
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:03,638
tiny bit we're going to talk more about

375
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,000
that uh we should have them kind of uh

376
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:07,320
let's see we're about to start the bloom

377
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,120
phase and the stretch phase so if we

378
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,720
want to top them and do some training

379
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,519
now is kind of our last chance we should

380
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,800
stop topping by now right unless we've

381
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,120
got plants that are going to clear the

382
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,919
fence yeah unless you know um unless

383
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,440
Height's a concern and that's your

384
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:24,599
motivation for topping um uh but you

385
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,120
know in that case by all means you know

386
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,759
do what you need to do to get your crop

387
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,240
in so yeah yeah you don't want the

388
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:30,560
neighbors seeing that you don't want the

389
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,680
people walking down the street to see

390
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:36,119
that [ __ ] so uh if you need and if you

391
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:38,120
don't have to do it uh we can pull the

392
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,278
plants down a little bit if you uh have

393
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,078
been taken care of it you should be able

394
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,198
to grab some branches the tall ones and

395
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:47,318
just pull them down and then maybe uh

396
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,758
tie them to a steak or maybe tie them to

397
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:50,919
Something in the garden that's already

398
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,639
there like a rock or something uh you

399
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:54,759
can use a steak in the ground I use Big

400
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,360
Bamboo poles just spread that plant out

401
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:57,600
to where instead of growing straight up

402
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,240
you kind of got it growing a little

403
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,040
horizontally now as your time to get it

404
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,680
going cuz uh I think within the next uh

405
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,120
10 days here we're going to everyone's

406
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:10,120
going to go into flower real heavily

407
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,879
yeah I believe so I've got some uh I've

408
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,198
got a strain that's a Tom Hills deep

409
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:16,480
chunk crossed with a a G13 sorry I fixed

410
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:18,399
that noise guys I couldn't find it I

411
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,120
fixed all that noise I just noticed it

412
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,278
so much better my

413
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,318
headphones um you know I've got a a

414
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:27,519
strain that's got you know some kind of

415
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:30,639
land R stuff in it um and it has started

416
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,560
flowering okay actually snuck up on me

417
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,879
and I had to take clones that are kind

418
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:36,198
of pre-flowering so so guys that's one

419
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,439
thing we're going to talk about get

420
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:41,078
clones uh if you've got some outdoor

421
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,399
plants and you're waiting for them to go

422
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:44,278
and flower and you need some clones from

423
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,679
them so you can grow next year get

424
00:16:44,278 --> 00:16:47,879
clones now uh I always say and this is

425
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,239
I'm going to go off on a little side R

426
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:51,198
here I warned Jesse there'd be a rant

427
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,000
about this uh if you're growing from

428
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,318
seed or a clone that is brand new to you

429
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,240
take some clones before you go into

430
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,719
flower uh it's really frustrating when

431
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:01,480
you grow a plant and it's done and you

432
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,839
smoke it with some of your friends and

433
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,400
they're like what the hell is this and

434
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,038
you're like it's the best and you all

435
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,959
agree and they go I can't wait till you

436
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,798
grow it even better next time and you go

437
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,318
oh yeah I don't have a clone of that so

438
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:13,798
we're never going to get to taste this

439
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:15,399
ever again except this one round that's

440
00:17:13,798 --> 00:17:17,519
the most frustrating heartbreaking

441
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,079
feeling so take clones you guys

442
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:21,199
definitely take clones from everything

443
00:17:19,078 --> 00:17:23,759
that you grow if you've got the option

444
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,199
that's some uh that's a some killer

445
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,558
advice from a seed company owner well

446
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:28,960
yeah I'd want you to buy more seeds

447
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:30,918
right but what if you find that keeper

448
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,160
what if you get that or how about when

449
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:37,038
you do get that black Cher

450
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,400
keeper Harvest heavy it tastes dank it

451
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,000
[ __ ] gets you high as hell you're

452
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,960
going to wish you had a clone of that

453
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,480
yep yeah I I wish you had a clone of it

454
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,919
too cuz I want to cut when I find you at

455
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,120
the Canabis C or something I need a

456
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,080
clone of that one so get some clones all

457
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,119
the time I'm glad you mentioned the seed

458
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,759
company thing even that's that's Sound

459
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,359
Advice right there if I'm a seed guy

460
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:57,038
yeah for sure so uh yeah we were talking

461
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,240
about getting those plants below the

462
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,279
fence line you can kind of you can do

463
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,480
the low stress technique uh you can do a

464
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,798
little bit of super cropping like s does

465
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,960
uh kind of crack them and bend them a

466
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,720
little bit uh now's your last chance

467
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,400
really cuz you're going into flower in

468
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,400
about 10 days and I really don't like to

469
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,960
mess with plants uh there are hormones

470
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,200
in your plants oxin and cyto Canin that

471
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,798
move around with they find the tops of

472
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,759
the plants and affect the gra the top of

473
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,119
the plant and the way that stuff grows

474
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,640
uh you don't want to disrupt that right

475
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:26,639
now that's going to that'll freak your

476
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:29,159
plants out a little bit Yeah mess up bud

477
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,640
sizes yeah but you can still uh you can

478
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:32,960
still kind of pull them down and low

479
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,679
stress training them but you don't want

480
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,519
to go and kick their ass real bad or

481
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,120
anything I've uh had uh one of my first

482
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:43,519
Seasons growing outdoors I didn't top

483
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,319
and all the plants were from seed so the

484
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:48,639
the merry stem you know was just or the

485
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:51,279
main stock was uh you know just as

486
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,038
straight as could be and uh I tied a

487
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:56,798
rope around the top of

seeding um tied the Rope uh around the

496
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,639
top of the plant and just pulled the

497
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,599
whole freaking thing down almost made

498
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,360
like a bow and arrow looking thing

499
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:23,879
exctly yeah yeah and uh the result was

500
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:25,798
just like this whole hro of buds it was

501
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:28,919
super cool all the side branches took

502
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,519
over and started they all went up yeah

503
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,559
talking about the hormones and stuff

504
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,759
Canabis wants cannabis wants one

505
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,798
dominant top on the plant something I

506
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,200
know what it is but I'm not going to

507
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:38,558
we'll go I'm trying to go slowly with

508
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,440
the listeners and get everybody up to

509
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:42,279
speed and not try to Ed Rosenthal people

510
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,798
when you talk to Ed he forgets that

511
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,480
we're not all doctors and scientist yeah

512
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:47,599
a weed scientist and he'll just blow

513
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,200
your mind so I'm trying to go slow for

514
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,839
you guys we'll talk about the oxin and

515
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,038
cyto Canin and the other hormones and

516
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,158
plants that make them want to grow a top

517
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,759
bud but when you cut out that top Bud

518
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,039
all the other bottom buds go hey I've

519
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:59,720
got the opportunity it's like when you

520
00:19:58,038 --> 00:20:02,119
kill kill the you kill the leader all

521
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,519
the all the little tribes men think that

522
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,158
they could be the leader now that's kind

523
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,480
of what the top the bottom buds do so if

524
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,000
you grab that plant pull it over like a

525
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:11,360
fishing pole would bend when you got a

526
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,919
fish uh all those little branches that

527
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:14,719
you've got those little sucker buds that

528
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:16,440
often times we cut off those will create

529
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
nice little bud sides cuz now they're

530
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,120
they've got the chance to become a top

531
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,960
and they're also exposed to more light

532
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,519
yeah oh yeah yeah cool it's a real neat

533
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,079
effect so we should be in the stretch

534
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:29,119
phase or starting to pre-flow right yeah

535
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:35,279
oh totally yeah are you doing anything

536
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:38,519
for bugs now um I I spray with neem oil

537
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:42,359
um and I just did it the last time

538
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:45,319
um as soon as I notice flour uh I I

539
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,678
really don't especially Outdoors um I

540
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:50,918
really don't like spraying the plant

541
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:54,320
with anything me too um so uh I stop uh

542
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:55,679
the kelp Mills compost tea sprays um and

543
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,639
the ne oil

544
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,200
sprays um I do that individually ually I

545
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,240
don't you know just stop the whole

546
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,640
garden as each strain starts flowering

547
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,558
it's like oh can't spray that plant

548
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,480
anymore so you know um

549
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:12,879
so um in Southern Colorado we're getting

550
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,759
a lot of rain right now and there's some

551
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,679
weird bugs popping up um yeah little

552
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,679
flying CRS I've never seen yeah stuff's

553
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:23,360
going to be out of balance um I

554
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,880
personally haven't noticed um any uh you

555
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:30,599
know them being uh Predator plant

556
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,720
Predators but um it could be so but

557
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:32,959
those things are going to look for homes

558
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,519
and they're going to lay eggs because

559
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,159
their normal homes for laying eggs are

560
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:38,278
going to be disrupted and you're going

561
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,679
to have to go look under your leaves and

562
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:41,079
if you find some [ __ ] put on some gloves

563
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,960
and just clean them out of there just

564
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:44,079
clean that stuff out yeah if you want to

565
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,720
give if you're a hippie you want to give

566
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,439
those bugs a new home feel free to re

567
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,120
relocate them [ __ ] those bugs [ __ ] yeah

568
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,038
I'd throw them in the [ __ ] burn if

569
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,959
compost pile feed them to the

570
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:55,720
chickens oh I bet your chickens would

571
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:57,278
love you for that how are you dealing

572
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,558
with all the rain because it has been

573
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,798
raining every every day from about 6:00

574
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:03,678
to 9:00 for the past week until today

575
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:05,839
when it was [ __ ] sweltering hot at

576
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,400
once again um I keep my plants hollowed

577
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:14,599
out so you know the the foliage on the

578
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:17,640
inside um uh there isn't really any um e

579
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:21,038
even in veg I I do that um especially as

580
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,080
it gets later in veg um but uh and you

581

plants a little bit that that helps I

583
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,600
think a lot um the biggest thing the

584
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,400
rain has been doing to me is uh saving

585
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,759
me from having to water my

586
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,759

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,559
I still haven't gotten to read it with

634
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,440
the Washington Post or the New York

635
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:33,440
Times had an article about uh marijuana

636
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:35,798
being a welcome guest at uh Colorado and

637
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,840

damn wow you're right they're absolutely

639
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:42,519
correct you know there were usually at

640
00:24:40,398 --> 00:24:44,398
weddings uh and this is just a cliche

641
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:46,679
thing there's usually one fight and it's

642
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:48,678
usually like a sisterly thing or some

643
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:50,240
[ __ ] some oh my God I can't believe you

645
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:54,558

688
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,839
the you want the dandelion looking ones

689
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,480
that's the easiest way to describe it

690
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,519
honestly we got to do we you guys got to

691
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,880
read some books if you aren't familiar

692
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:26,079
with males and females you got to catch

693
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,360
up a little bit do a little bit of

694
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:28,839
reading that's kind of what a grower

695
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:31,398
needs to know that [ __ ] you should be

696
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:34,359
doing so identify the males pull the

697
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:37,798
males and even femin seeds keep an eye

698
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:42,319
on them yeah it's feminizing is not a

699
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:44,278
100% not 100% we say 99% which uh still

700
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,119
there's problems happen when you're

701
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,919
making if you use certain methods you're

702
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:50,199
less likely to get fem but if you use

703
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,440
certain methods then fem occur often

704
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,679
I've seen it at a a big dispens for grow

705
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,240
grew out of like 250 femin seeds they

706
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:01,759
had like four males and they didn't pay

707
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,038
attention no no it all got wrecked and

708
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,640
uh the owner was quite pissed and you

709
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:10,759
know it was explained to him you know

710
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,559
99% do the math 250 plants yep and now

711
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:14,599
he's got a problem with femin seeds

712
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,678

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,240
want to make sure that people hear you

715
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,639
dispensary owners uh in general don't

716
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,159
like growing from seed so yeah I agree

717
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,038
ones that do uh mad props to you guys

718

yes uh man you get such great [ __ ] when

719
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:29,558
you grow from seed you don't know what

720
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,599
you're proprietary genetics and you

721
00:27:29,558 --> 00:27:33,119
don't have the Clone that everybody in

722
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:34,639
your neighborhood's growing everybody

725
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,679
that I give out flow to new Growers if

726

729
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:47,519
that cut we have is flow I've always

730
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:48,719
thought that exact same thing so I've

731
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,919
heard that story there's somebody in

732
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,558
Colorado that posted on Facebook that

733
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:56,038
they know that that's floa and that they

734
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:57,678
actually got that cut from Ed Rosenthal

735
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:59,879
so if you're listening to this show

736
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,159
please tweet me or Facebook me uh you

737
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:04,480
can go to I genetics or IG gr culture on

738
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,080
Facebook or Twitter uh please cuz I want

739
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,720
to know more about the cut of flow that

740
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,558
goes around Colorado uh there's a cut

741
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,120
called Tangerine that is not Tangi it's

742
00:28:11,558 --> 00:28:15,960
it's the Tang which I think is so

743
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:19,918
confusing I think that is flow and

744
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,000
Durban Poison okay oh okay okay okay

745
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,480
yeah yeah yeah gotta yeah if anybody in

746
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,278
Colorado knows what I'm talking about

747
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,759
it's not Tangi everyone calls it tang

748
00:28:26,278 --> 00:28:29,839
and they called it the tang tang the

749
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,119
tang tang for a little while around here

750
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,959
oh okay okay yeah Prett sure that's flow

751
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,678
and Durban Poison cross T Tang I

752
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,840
remember a big full full spread uh um

753
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,559
dispensary had about that

754
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:44,839
strain way back in the day uh near the

755
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,839
Fort Collins area made that one really

756
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,038
is from what I know there's a lot of

757
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:50,240
that's the problem with the weed world

758
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:51,960
because by the time I give you a clone

759
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,759
the story has changed and then you give

760
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,480
it to somebody else and the story has

761
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:57,839
totally changed and then they pass it on

762
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,440
and now it's not even the same strain

763
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,480
and it's being hoarded or it's being

764
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,558
hoard out for way too much

765
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,120
money it's not being grown to its

766
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:07,398
potential because it's not being called

767
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:10,639
what it is yeah patients are getting

768
00:29:07,398 --> 00:29:12,319
jacked yeah yeah so we're in the stretch

769
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,799
phase we're blooming we're getting off

770
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:16,678
track here uh it's cool well yeah it's

771
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,359
cool they seem to like the listeners

772
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:20,519
have responded man they like it when I

773
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:21,678
get all high and just talk nice yeah

774
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,599
they like it when I kind of go off

775
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,080
course cuz I ate a big ass edible oh

776
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,639
guys I'm I survived that edible I ate I

777
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,278
got to tell you I felt like [ __ ] for the

778
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,720
whole next day though uh eating that

779
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:34,000
whole edible really uh took a toll on my

780
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,159
body uh I'm getting old as part of what

781
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,960
I'm trying to say I'm 35 now and I think

782
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:39,640
when I was 25 I probably could have done

783
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:41,558
it and not felt like [ __ ] the next day

784
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,559
but I had to go get some kombucha and

785
00:29:41,558 --> 00:29:46,440
[ __ ] eat a big fat meal I try had to

786
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,000
try to put myself back on track but no

787
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:50,600
disrespect to that edible company I was

788
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,519
not supposed to eat all of it at once no

789
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,319
I listened to that episode so I was high

790
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,120
you weren't yeah not at all you weren't

791
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,918
even supposed to eat half of that once

792
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,759
no

793
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:03,278
yeah so why do they make the stuff so

794
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:05,319
good though oh it was delicious too if

795
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,359
that was just a like a restaurant dinner

796
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,119
or a restaurant dessert I'd order that I

797
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:10,839
need that peanut butter thing you serve

798
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,719
put some ice cream with it it'd be

799
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:14,359
delicious so since we're going into

800
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,038
flour we're starting to stretch a little

801
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,879
bit we're looking for the males we're

802
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:20,000
looking for hermaphrodites also if it's

803
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:22,200
questionable if it's weird keep a really

804
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,319
good eye on it lower inner

805
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,919
branches uh that's a good spot to look

806
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:29,319
for Hermes where you don't get as much

807
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:32,278

That's a classic one that's the only one

854
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:07,759
I got for you all right uh vegetarian

855
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:10,079
let's feed our ganja plants uh we're

856
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,319
going into bloom so we can slowly

857
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:13,480
decrease the nitrogen and increase the

858
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,960
phosphorus and

859
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,000
potassium uh if you're top dressing you

860
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,200
can switch your te's to the more

861
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,319
phosphorus and potassium based te's for

862
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,759
sure uh if you're using the like

863
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,798
granulated products that they sell in

864
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,480
the store you can go ahead and switch to

865
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:28,879
the bloom version of those products now

866
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,440
you don't have to keep using that veg

867
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,559
stuff yeah uh slowly switch that stuff

868
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,200
though

869
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:38,798
um still well I don't yeah um assuming

870
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,360
you've only applied it one or two times

871
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:44,398
something like that um mix a little just

872
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:47,319
make sure you have nitrogen cuz a lot of

873
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,918
time those uh products are pretty low on

874
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,480
nitrogen okay on the bloom side so maybe

875
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,919
well actually when I feed my indoor

876
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,679
plants I don't switch the day that I put

877
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,600
them into flow I don't just say they're

878
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,480
in flow let's cut out all the veg NES

879
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,079
and go to just my bloom schedule I kind

880
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,278
of phase it out there's like a twoe

881
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,839
period And I also keep my metal Hy

882
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,679
lights in for about 14 to 21 days to

883
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,278
keep them short and stocky and then when

884
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,798
you switch them you really see them they

885
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:14,200
stay low and the butts fatten up so

886
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:16,519
that's yeah so just slowly I like to

887
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,200
phase out my veg into my Bloom feed is

888
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:22,558
what I think I'm trying to

889
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:27,278
say um but uh yeah start that Mexican B

890

896
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:45,919
have blended guanas with uh different

897
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:48,240
NPK values so just you want a high PK so

898
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,278

00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:14,838
always fear that liquids are going to

933
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,240
wreak havoc on the rest of my stuff yeah

934

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,359
out of all that you can uh I can see a

942
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:35,440
difference when I feed my plants that

943
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:36,880
within 24 hours uh the next light cycle

944
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,960
two light cycles later I guess when they

945
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,599
come on they are praying they're up the

946
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,720
leaves are pointing straight up like yes

947
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,519
make them pre yeah they they love that

948
00:35:43,719 --> 00:35:48,199
[ __ ] that should be their slogan yeah no

use it I've never put it in a tea um um

1126
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,318
but top dressing yeah I do have an issue

1127
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,838
with slaughterhouse products but I also

1128
00:42:01,318 --> 00:42:06,119
have a uh a [ __ ] ton of slaughterhouse

1129
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:08,838
products so you're a farmer and you

1130
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,079
understand you uh you balance it out

1131
00:42:08,838 --> 00:42:13,599
yeah I mean there's nothing wrong with

1132
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,560
blood Mills just like where well I mean

1133
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:17,359
I guess the argument could be made that

1134
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:18,719
there is something wrong with it but the

1135
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,558
biggest thing with commercial blood

1136
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,480
Mills we don't know where it came from

1137
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,359
um you know those or at least that's my

1138
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,880
big issue with it and those cows were

1139
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:29,558
fed [ __ ] that I probably highly

1140
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,318
disapprove of so yeah um and don't want

1141
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:32,720
to put into my body part of why I'm a

1142
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:34,358
vegetarian is cuz the way they treat

1143
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:36,000
cows you know yeah for sure there's no

1144
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:38,318
need to contribute to that in my opinion

1145
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,838
in general I don't really like eating

1146
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:42,719
beef um I can't stand ground beef it's

1147
00:42:40,838 --> 00:42:44,960
one of the most disgusting things I can

1148
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:47,519
that's the most questionable meat like

1149
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,800
what ground up what I hate when I'm

1150
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:53,519
working and in a hurry and yeah as a

1151
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,240
farmer and a grower are you bothered by

1152
00:42:53,519 --> 00:42:58,639
like fast food joints by seeing what

1153
00:42:55,239 --> 00:43:00,598
people are eating yeah um process any

1154
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:04,239
kind of processed meat um and I'm just

1155
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:06,480
as guilty of it um I I try hard when I

1156
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:08,318
get busy in life um you know it's just

1157
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,800
it's hard to cook and it's easy to drive

1158
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,039
through a drive-thru and uh but yeah

1159
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,920
that's that's why this country is so fat

1160
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:18,480
that's why we have cancer that's

1161
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,838
everything it's just yeah I agree with I

1162
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,599
have huge issue with all that stuff yeah

1163
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:24,199
we paid people will pay top dollar for

1164
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,680
their booze pay top dollar for their

1165
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:29,000
herb but then spend 99 cent a [ __ ]

1166
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:31,480
cheeseburg yeah yeah yeah spend those

1167
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,639
bucks on yourself guys yeah uh cancer is

1168
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:35,800

1187
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:16,439
top of your plant so take that bottom

1188

Alfalfa um some old hay that we had

leaves if you haven't been spraying [ __ ]

1221

taught us a lot of stuff everyone's

1227
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,558
going to move to the country and abandon

1228
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,240
the city and all move out to the middle

1229
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,839
of nowhere and just start these organic

1230
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,118
small not even large scale just small

1231
00:45:46,838 --> 00:45:51,719
scale organic ganja Farms yeah you don't

1232

to eat eggs if you like it's just not

1237
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,480

1238
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,440
but grocery store eggs if yeah if I it's

1239
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,760
kind of where I'm headed if I had

1240
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,240
chickens bro we'd eat eggs every day I'd

1241
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,839
go out and get two or three eggs from

1242
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:13,919
the chickens and we'd do it like the uh

1243
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,239
your shirts you're wearing their uh you

1244

1245
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,719
store yellow and their orange is like

1246
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,280
what my eggs look like so you know

1247
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,480
that's probably 10 times the nutrients

1248
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,240
in there yeah also flavor they they have

1249
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:28,559
a flavor yeah um you you just think eggs

1250
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,879
have flavor till till you have good ones

1251
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,079
so you have a good Farm Fresh Egg and I

1252
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,640
I have my chickens in the city too so we

1253
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,599
have them at the farm too but I also

1254
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,199
have chickens in my backyard so you can

1255
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,800
have chickens over there yeah that's

1256
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,279

1257
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,119
do that can have a in PUO you can have

1258
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,839
don't quote me on this but I think it's

1259
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,280
six or seven um no encroachment um which

1260
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:52,880
means you know you can't build it right

1261
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:55,519
next to your your chicken pin right next

1262
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,960
to your fence um it's got to be 5 ft

1263
00:46:55,519 --> 00:47:02,159
from a property line um no roosters so

1264
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,559
yeah and and they can't be a nuisance

1265
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:07,759
which you know takes a while to develop

1266
