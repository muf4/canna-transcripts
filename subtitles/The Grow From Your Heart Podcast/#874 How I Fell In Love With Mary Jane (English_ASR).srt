00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,920
waste too much time with advertising. I

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,799
have got a great question here in front

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,600
of me. I have a website. My website is

23
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:06,000
iiegenetics.com. On the top of that

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
website, there is a row of tabs. One of

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,239
those tabs does say grow or grow

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,159
questions. If you click on that tab,

27
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,319
guess what? You can send me a grow

28
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,240
question. If I read your grow question

29
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:19,478
here on the podcast, I will send you a

30
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:21,599
coupon code for a free pack of seeds at

31
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:23,039
iredirect.com. This question is a great

32
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:24,719
question. This may be the only question

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,799
for today's podcast. We'll see how long

34
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,039
this one does take. This one came from

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,200
our friend known as Lucky Bullpacker.

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,118

code for a free pack of seeds from

39
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,478
iredirect.com. The question from Lucky

40
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:42,719
Bullpacker. It's a short question, but

41
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,118
it's a good one. It goes just like this.

42
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:48,399
It says, "Hey Ros, how's it going? I

43
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,118
only had one question. What caused your

44
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,320
love for the plant?" That's a very good

45
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,159
question. A lot of people have been

46
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,919
listening to this show for a long time.

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,159
Uh maybe people are brand new listening

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,560
to this show. Many people may not know

49
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,880
why or how I fell in love with uh

50
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,040
growing ganja, cultivating ganja,

51
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,280
consuming, breeding, being an being an

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,879
advocate for ganja. How did I fall in

53
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,399
love with this plant? This is a very

54
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,000
good question. I think I'm going to

55
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,239
dedicate this whole episode, no matter

56
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,039
how short or quick this reply is, just

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,360
to talking about how and why I fell in

58
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,799
love with the ganja plant. what I wrote

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,480
down in my outline. Now that I'm

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,480
rambling a little bit more, I realize

61
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,679
how much more there is to this plant in

62
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,759
my life than I even wrote down. I've got

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,760
a few short notes here, but this plant

64
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,598
has done a lot for me. My love, my

65
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,759
passion for this plant has taken me very

66
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:37,518
far. I have built a business. I've built

67
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,159
a podcast. I've built a career. I've

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,239
built a life uh off of this plant, off

69
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,000
of my love and passion and understanding

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,000
for this plant. I feel like this

71
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,080
relationship with myself and the plant

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,400
uh it is very reciprocal. I give a lot

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,319
to this plant. I give you guys a lot for

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,159
this plant. And in turn, you guys give

75
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,799
me a lot in return. And the plant is

76
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:58,799
giving me a lot in return. Uh I do live

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
a very blessed and maybe a privileged

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,040
life. And that is because of my love and

79
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:04,639
my passion for this plant. Uh added with

80
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,799
a few other skills, but without this

81
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,399
plant, uh my skills and passions might

82
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,719
not have lined up the way that they were

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,400
supposed to. I feel like um I'm right

84
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,318
where I'm supposed to be because of this

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,800
plant. Uh it's given me a good life, a

86
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,359
good future, a good career. Um, I might

87
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,159
not be as mentally, physically,

88
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,000
spiritually, financially, uh, socially

89
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,759
stable as I am without this plant. I

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,318
would be a different person. Uh, I've

91
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,798
been consuming cannabis for my mid early

92
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,878
teenage years. Uh, I'm now in my mid to

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,519
late 40s. I'm still consuming strongly,

94
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,039
heavily. Uh, so I started as a smoker.

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,120
That was my first love, right? We all

96
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,798
fall in love with smoking the plant.

97
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,599
Then after I was smoking, I began

98
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,599
growing. Um, now I don't know if you

99
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,359
made me decide between smoking, growing,

100
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,518
and breeding. I don't know which one I

101
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,879
would choose. Uh, growing, and breeding,

102
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
have a good chance of winning. If you

103
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:54,719
made me quit one, smoking might be the

104
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,318
one that I eliminated, which sounds wild

105
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,080
because for a lot of people, that's the

106
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,000
most important aspect of the plant. As I

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
get older, I understand what I'm able to

108
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,959
do with the plant. I can grow it and

109
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,959
breed it in a special way. A lot of

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,479
people in the past 10 years have really

111
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,719
caught up. There are some amazing

112
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,199
growers out there. When this uh cannabis

113
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,878
revolution was new, a lot of us growers

114
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:15,598
that were growing and learning quickly

115
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:17,759
and being advanced uh at our skills, we

116
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,159
were kind of a uh a very special niche

117
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,919
group of people. But now my skills are

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
not rare. There are a lot of people that

119
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,039
can grow. There are a lot of people out

120
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,198
there that have surpassed me. A lot of

121
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
my apprentices uh they now grow in

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,639
larger facilities than me. They're

123
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,478
growing better product than me. And I am

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,720
not ashamed or embarrassed to admit that

125
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:36,639
in any way. I love that the next

126
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,080
generation, the younger guys behind me,

127
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,000
the younger gals behind me. That's

128
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,159
another beautiful [ __ ] thing to see

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,079
some ladies in this industry. When I

130
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,759
first jumped in, it was a sausage fest.

131
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,279
Uh it was Maddie and a couple other

132
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,439
ladies. And now there's a lot of women,

133
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:51,519
a lot of ladies in this industry, and I

134
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,040
love that. But, uh, a lot of those

135
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,799
ladies and gentlemen and everything in

136
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,879
between, they have surpassed me in grow

137
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
skills. They even surpass me in breeding

138
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,040
skills. I don't feel like I'm some weed

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
wizard or some uh some sort of guy at

140
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,560
the top of the mountain. But for a while

141
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,000
there, I was one of the advanced guys,

142
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,519
the advanced people in the grow

143
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,279
knowledge. And now a lot of people are

144
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,120
catching up and they're right on this

145
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,038
level. And I have no problem uh

146
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,120
admitting it or acknowledging it. I

147
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:17,038
think it's beautiful. I love that the

148
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
evolution of the cannabis legalization,

149
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,279
the industry, the community, podcasting,

150
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,919
the internet, it has made everybody a

151
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,839
much better grower. It has uh con uh

152
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,120
informed and educated consumers. All

153
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:28,560
right, I'm off on a good ramble here.

154
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,600
You guys could tell I love this freaking

155
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,000
plant. But not only am I a smoker, I'm a

156
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,600
grower. I love to grow the plant. Um, I

157
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,680
love being in the room with the plants,

158
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,439
smelling the plants, smelling the air

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
that comes off of the plants, walking

160
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:43,199
into the room and just that smell in the

161
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,038
grow room. Everybody's grow has a

162
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,560
different smell. Each uh I go to

163
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,399
different commercial facilities, they

164
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
all smell differently. Some of them

165
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:51,519
smell like the pesticides they use. Some

166
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,600
of them smell like the flowers they're

167
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,439
growing. Some of them smell like the

168
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,759
facility. Some buildings just have a

169
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,240
smell. I love that smell. I love the

170
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,919
feeling of being in the room. And then I

171
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,160
love working with the plants, touching

172
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:05,599
them, seeing them, feeling them, looking

173
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,960
across the room and going, "Ah, that

174
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,479
plant over there, all these other plants

175
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,918
are bright green. They look beautiful.

176
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:11,839
That one right there, she's got a little

177
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,439
problem. Let's go find out with her. Uh

178
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,279
go find out what's up with her. Go walk

179
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,600
over to that plant, touch it, feel it,

180
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,198
smell it, see what's wrong with it. Uh

181
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,439
identify its problem, correct it, and

182
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,680
then watch that plant grow even better

183
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:25,759
uh in the next couple of weeks. Then

184
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,519
after I grow that, I get to give it to

185
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
people and they do the same thing. I get

186
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,680
to So, let me get back to my notes

187
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,879
because that's going to get me, this is

188
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,478
getting into my notes that I've got

189
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:37,240
written down. Um, why do I love ganja?

190
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,079
How did I fall in love with this plant?

191
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,079
Um, before I even smoked ganja, I had

192
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,639
uncles, family members, cousins, people

193
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,560
around me who were smoking, loved the

194
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,639
smell, and they always seemed the adults

195
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,478
were cooler after they smoked. That's

196
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,160
something I noticed. I grew up around uh

197
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:53,599
I had three rowdy uncles. Two of them

198
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,319
are gone. Rest in peace, boys. I love

199
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,720
you and miss you every [ __ ] day. But

200
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,479
those three dudes taught me a lot. A lot

201
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,039
of what to do and what not to do in

202
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:05,038
life. Uh they were my rowdy uncles. They

203
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,478
were uh some of them were smokers, some

204
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:08,240
of them were drinkers, some of them did

205
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,399
other things. I learned not to do those

206
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,360
other things by watching my uncles do

207
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:14,799
it. I saw when some of them drank, they

208
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,319
would get rowdy. I saw that when people

209
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,478
drank, they would get rowdy. There would

210
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,560
be fights when people drank. But I saw

211
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,478
when people smoked ganja, we all

212
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,478
laughed. People went to Taco Bell.

213
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,318
People ate a bunch of cookies. It wasn't

214
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,159
problematic. People were cooler. The

215
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,879
adults were better when they smoked weed

216
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,919
is what I noticed as a child. So I, as I

217
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:33,199
got older, I was like, "Well, I need to

218
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,478
try that. You know, it makes the adults

219
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,319
[ __ ] better. Let's see what it does."

220
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,359
And the minute I smoked, you know, I was

221
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,560
getting stoned before that. I was

222
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,840
hanging out with my uncles and just

223
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
being around them, I was catching a

224
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:44,959
buzz. But the minute I smoked, I was

225
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,479
like, I get it. I understand this. So,

226
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,318
uh, the first time I smoked, I'm trying

227
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,000
to catch myself up on my notes here. I

228
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,080
grew up around some savages and I saw

229
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,839
that them drinking [ __ ] them up, made

230
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,279
them [ __ ] Actually, it kind of kind

231
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:56,719
of actually killed the two two of my

232
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:58,878
uncles. They should still be here if

233
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,720
they did not drink the way they did. Uh

234
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,400
if they just smoked, uh they would still

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,319
be alive cuz the uncle that quit

236
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,959
drinking, he's still with us. But that's

237
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
the poisons of alcohol. Uh all my ganja

238
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:10,000
smoker friends, they're still healthy,

239
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,160
looking good, looking young, having a

240
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,478
good time. So I saw from an early age

241
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,199
that some drugs were bad, alcohol was

242
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,878
bad, and smoking weed made everybody

243
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,879
cooler. It made the adults easier to

244
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,199
hang out with. They they liked the kids

245
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,280
better. Um I'm a I'm a parent now and I

246
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,199
noticed that when I would smoke as my my

247
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,359
daughter's 21 now. I smoke with my adult

248
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,280
daughter now. Uh when she was a kid, I

249
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,639
would I'd be like, I got to spend time

250
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,399
with the kid and I just might not be

251
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,519
into it as much. We might be playing and

252
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
I might want to We didn't have cell

253
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,278
phones as much then, but I might want to

254
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,959
be distracted by something else just

255
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,439
because life was distracting. I would

256
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,199
notice I'd go smoke and then go sit at

257
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,880
her little playhouse or her play

258
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,800
kitchen. And now I'm making uh whatever

259
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,879
fake Starbucks Frappuccinos on her

260
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,479
little kid playset thing and enjoying it

261
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,480
and having a little tea party with her.

262
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,399
I would just get more into it. I would

263
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,879
play more. And so I saw that happening

264
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:03,039
with me as well. Uh the the adults in my

265
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:05,278
life were more fun and it worked on me

266
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,559
as I became a parent. So I do have

267
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,360
notes. I keep saying I'm going to get to

268
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:11,838
them. Um it makes things better. Why do

269
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
I love Ganja? Because it makes things

270
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,120
better. What does it make better? Life.

271
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,278
Um, it just makes life better. It feels

272
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
better. Life feels good. Um, I've been

273
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:22,799
going to therapy for a couple of years.

274
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,320
Nothing's wrong. I just Everybody's got

275
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:26,479
some [ __ ] to work out. Go to go to

276
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,640
therapy. It feels good. Uh, I've been

277
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,560
going to therapy. I'm mentally well. Uh,

278
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,879
I'm physically well. I'm spiritually

279
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,838
sound. I feel good. But when I smoke

280
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,838
ganja, feel even better. It just feels

281
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,360
better. It's like putting uh, it's like

282
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,920
putting little chocolate sprinkles on

283
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,080
life or rainbow sprinkles even on life.

284
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:46,240
It's like putting glitter on boobs. It

285
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,600
just makes it a little bit better. Um,

286
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:52,560
it makes music better. Um, I did not

287
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,480
understand reggae music until I got

288
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,399
super blazed one day and got in the

289
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,039
shower and I was grooving and I was

290
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,559
like, I [ __ ] understand reggae music

291
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,480
right now. It's different, Ray. If

292
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:05,518
you're a musician, reae is different.

293
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,680
Uh, music makes reae way better for me.

294
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,240
It makes it I understood it completely.

295
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,639
Uh, I just like music when I'm smoking.

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,320
It sounds a lot better. Also, different

297
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,159
enhancements make music better, too. But

298
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,079
that's not the point today. Uh, what

299
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,319
else is better? Food. Food is better

300
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,239
after you smoke, bro. Um, if you're

301
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
going to go out to dinner and you go get

302
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,519
your favorite meal, it's going to taste

303
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,039
good. But if you smoke a fat joint

304
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,278
before you go, that food's going to

305
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,838
taste even better. I don't know why. It

306
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,439
just makes it taste even better. Uh,

307
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,720
what else did I put on my list? Sex is

308
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,640
even better. Sometimes you get a little

309
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,000
distracted and it takes a minute, which

310
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:39,759
the [ __ ] is wrong with sex taking

311
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,559
longer, right? Sex is better when you're

312
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,078
stoned, too. I wrote down comedy. Comedy

313
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,239
is one of my favorite things. They say

314
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,919
laughter is medicine. Comedy makes me

315
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,320
laugh. Sometimes when I smoke a joint, I

316
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,639
just laugh anyway. So, comedy and a fat

317
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,640
joint. Comedy is better after you smoke.

318
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,000
Cartoons. Imagine. So, this is the

319
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,919
scenario. You're sitting in front of the

320
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,519
ta in front of the TV watching cartoons

321
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,759
eating a bowl of cereal. That's a cool

322
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,679
story, right? Smoke a joint. Do the same

323
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,519
thing. Bro, those cartoons are way

324
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,278
better and that cereal just tastes way

325
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,879
better. I don't know. Something about

326
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:10,799
smoking that joint, taking a dab,

327
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,159
hitting the bong just makes everything

328
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,240
better. It's like, like I said a minute

329
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,360
ago, it's like boobs but with sprinkles.

330
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,639
Just a little bit better. Then, um, I

331
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,879
like to meditate. I've been talking

332
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:22,799
about my spirituality and my mental

333
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,399
clarity. That comes from a little bit of

334
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,240
meditation. You got to you got to be

335
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,919
able to to close out the outside world

336
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,560
and go inside and really see what's

337
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,319
inside yourself or myself. And that's

338
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:34,399
how I'm able to deal with me the best.

339
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,160
Just close my eyes, shut out everything.

340
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,559
What's in here? because this is what I

341
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,639
can do. I can control. I can manage. I

342
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,958
can correct. I can adjust. I can adapt

343
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,319
by what's going on in here. What little

344
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,239
things do I need to work on? What

345
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,839
bothered me today? What made me glitch

346
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,680
today? What did I get hung up on? What

347
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,480
do I need to get over? I can deal with

348
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:54,159
that. Right? Sometimes can't get into

349
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,920
it. Sometimes I want to open my eyes and

350
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,078
check my phone or look and see what's

351
00:11:55,919 --> 00:12:00,958
going on. Take a little bit of a puff of

352
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,039
a nice joint, close my eyes. H that I

353
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,559
meditation comes on so strong. I can get

354
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,559
there so quickly. I'm already seeing the

355
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,559
little bubble zone that I get into. Uh,

356
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,559
but a little meditation, smoke a little

357
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,638
ganja, get in that iie meditation. That

358
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,359
is as I as you could feel right there.

359
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,519
So, it just makes things feel better.

360
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,919
Uh, it's like sprinkles. It's like

361
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:23,120
glitter on boobs. It just makes it a

362
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:25,039
little bit better. Um, and then it I've

363
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,839
got a brain injury. Um, I think it was

364
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,360
2015. I hit my head. Uh, I'm not going

365
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
to tell you the whole story. I hit my

366
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,839
head. Uh, almost died. Uh, deleted a lot

367
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,799
of the files on my hard drive. I [ __ ]

368
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,680
up my memory pretty good from that brain

369
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,199
injury. I've got some glitches. Um,

370
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,039
they're fixing up. It's been a long

371
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,879
time. It's been nearly 10 years, which

372
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,838
is amazing. Wow. It'll it'll be 10 years

373
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,360
here in a month. Um, but I still have

374
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,519
some glitches and issues from that.

375
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,839
They're clearing up. But when I would

376
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,120
smoke ganja, specific strains,

377
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,959
especially Lemon Jeffrey, it would quit

378
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,519
the little skips in my brain from

379
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:03,359
happening. I kind of described it as uh

380
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,278
there was a scratch on my CD. If you

381
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,759
guys are from the CD era, how old are

382
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,759
you? Um if you had a scratch on your CD,

383
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:11,360
sometimes your CD would just have a

384
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,039
little skip, a little skip, a little

385
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,720
skip. Or maybe it's a record player if

386
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,319
you're even older. That record would

387
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
skip, the record would skip, and then

388
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,120
you got to clean the record or clean the

389
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:24,399
CD. I feel like smoking ganja cleans my

390
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:28,320
CD sometimes or cleans my record. Now,

391
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,639
don't get me wrong. The first two dabs

392
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,800
are medical marijuana. If I take two

393
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,720
dabs, those are medical. The first one

394
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,278
that gets me right, that gets my [ __ ]

395
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
my brain to not skip. The second one

396
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,480
makes sure that I won't skip for a few

397
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,799
hours, fixes me, balance me out,

398
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,759
balances me out, gets me going. My third

399
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,000
dab, no [ __ ] That is a recreational

400
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,919
marijuana dab. That third one is

401
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
different. That third one is because I

402
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,519
like to get high and consume. So, don't

403
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,078
don't get me wrong here by saying that

404
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,759
I'm smoking to fix my glitches. Uh, that

405
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,519
is what the key is here. It makes me

406
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,838
feel better. It stops the glitches. But

407
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,519
that third, fourth, fifth dab, uh, those

408
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,639
are for enjoyment. I'm not going to lie.

409
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,879
I'm not trying to hide it. That's

410
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,440
because I like the effects and the

411
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,919
feelings of consuming five dabs. It just

412
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
feels good. Um, and I'm not going to get

413
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,958
sick. I'm not going to die because it's

414
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,240
not any of the crazy drugs that are out

415
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,638
there. It's not going to damage my

416
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,919
liver. I might drink an extra Horritos,

417
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,198
which is going to put me at risk for

418
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:25,439
that type two diabetes, but uh some

419
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,639
water and a good meal. I will be okay.

420
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,160
The most damage I'm going to do is I'm

421
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,879
going to eat like [ __ ] for that day if I

422
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:34,319
take five dabs. Where are we? It fixes

423
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:38,240
my glitches. Uh medical benefits, not

424
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,839
just me, but I've seen cannabis improve

425
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,360
the quality of many people's lives. I

426
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,800
can't tell you that it has healed

427
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,240
people. I know people that have used

428
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,479
cannabis to uh overcome problems and

429
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,919
symptoms and ailments and diseases, but

430
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,360
I can't tell you too much about that cuz

431
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,719
that's kind of making medical claims and

432
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
I can't say that. But I've seen things

433
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,360
like that happen. Uh but I've seen it

434
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,880
improve the quality of people's lives is

435
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,120
what I can technically legally say

436
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,958
without any sort of ramifications. It

437
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,519
makes people's lives better. I had a

438
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:09,518
dispensary in 2008. Some friends of mine

439
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,959
and I, shout out to the whole crew, uh

440
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,440
you all know who you are. We had a

441
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:16,239
dispensary in downtown PBLO. People

442
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,680
would come in and I had a large

443
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,240
demographic of people um 21-year-old

444
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,679
dudes that would run into the dispensary

445
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,680
and run out and people would say,

446
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,278
"What's wrong with that guy?" And I

447
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,039
would say, "He's got a heart condition

448
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,198
that if he doesn't consume cannabis, his

449
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,120
heart rate starts going all wonky. The

450
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:34,879
cannabis helps his heart rate stay in

451
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,839
line. You can't see what people's

452
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,159
conditions are." So, he's 21. He runs

453
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,160
in, he runs out. He still buys cannabis

454
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,838
to improve the quality of his life. I

455
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,919
had a little tiny old lady. We'll just

456
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,760
call her Carol. Uh she was all hunched

457
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,879
over. She had a plethora of medical

458
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,159
problems. She was on a mountain of

459
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,159
medications. She came to my dispensary

460
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,958
looking for some type of relief. She had

461
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,159
never smoked cannabis

462
00:15:55,958 --> 00:16:00,078
before. This was before a lot of the

463
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,919
rules. Uh there were no rules at this

464
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,919
time. We were kind of developing the

465
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,360
rules at this as this was happening.

466
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,639
Since we didn't have any rules, I

467
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,079
grabbed her a chair. Her husband was

468
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,680
with her, so she was safe. Let me put

469
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:11,439
this in in line. Give her a disclaimer

470
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,599
here. Carol had her husband with her.

471
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,519
she was safe and he approved of what we

472
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,278
were doing. I grabbed a chair and I

473
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,679
said, "I really think from your

474
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:21,120
description smoking this product and I

475
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:23,120
grabbed I think it was chocolate chunk

476
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,639
if my brain serves me correctly." I

477
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
said, "I think you want to smoke some of

478
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,000
this chocolate chunk. Would you like to

479
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,000
try it?" And she said, "Sweetheart, I've

480
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,240
never smoked." And I said, "Let's

481
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,919
smoke." And we sat down and I packed a

482
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,600
bowl. I showed her how to pack a bowl of

483
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,360
chocolate chunk. I showed her how to

484
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,120
light it from the top and not the bottom

485
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,199
like we saw that one dude do on that TV

486
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,879
show that made him look like a head. uh

487
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:44,719
showed her how to take one good smoke

488
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,159
out of that bowl, tap it out with our

489
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,680
put it out with her lighter and set it

490
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,759
down. I showed her how to inhale it,

491
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,359
exhale it smoothly. And then her husband

492
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,519
and I sat there with her for a few

493
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,639
minutes and I watched the symptoms of

494
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:58,480
her pain and her anxiety. She was bent

495
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,159
over. She was hunched over. She was sad

496
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,160
and she was scared. And she took an

497
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:06,000
inhale and she blew it out. And you

498
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
could watch her shoulders just drop from

499
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,400
the stress. The stress blew out when she

500
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,120
exhaled. her neck went up a little bit

501
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,759
and her curiosity of life went back up.

502
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,879
I watched that lady enjoy life just with

503
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,879
one puff of cannabis. She said, "This is

504
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,679
working. This is doing something for

505
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:25,360
me." And so I gave her multiple grams of

506
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,839
different kinds of flowers to take home

507
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,839
with her. I had that uh permission from

508
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,200
the from the dispensary. It was I could

509
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,038
give those products away because this

510
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,400
was going to help this lady. Uh, I gave

511
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,400
her like probably seven or eight

512
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,480
different grams and I told her, "Go home

513
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,640
and try these all at different times and

514
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,240
just take one puff and see which one

515
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
does your mind, your body, your spirit

516
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,160
the best that we could do for you and

517
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,440
then we'll start providing that for you

518
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,200
on a very regular and cost-effective

519
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,600
basis." So, I got to see this lady over

520
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,840
time. Uh, I keep saying she was hunched

521
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,279
and she was folded over. She was a foot

522
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,000
shorter than she should have been

523
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:02,079
because her confidence in life, her

524
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,558
confidence in herself had vanished

525
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,960
because of her illness. Uh the pain was

526
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,200
taking over. She was becoming afraid of

527
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,558
life. She was becoming depressed. She

528
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,160
couldn't go out and function. So, she

529
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,240
was becoming a hermit, which was

530
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,080
compounding all of these things. And

531
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,440
then the the results of that I just

532
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,599
stuttered so bad. I don't usually

533
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,679
stutter. That was wild. The results of

534
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,759
this were she was hunched over like the

535
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,840
freaking hunchback of Notre Dame. And

536
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,200
when she started smoking, it gave her

537
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,319
back her confidence, her enjoyment, her

538
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,840
self-esteem, her physical pain went

539
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,000
away, which made her smile, which made

540
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,199
her and her husband get along better.

541
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,558
This is one person out of probably a

542
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,558
thousand people that came to my

543
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,240
dispensary. I'm just guessing a thousand

544
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,839
people that came to my dispensary that I

545
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
got to interact with and help and

546
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,439
improve the quality of their life. So if

547
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,240
you don't fall in love with something

548
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,080
and then I was growing that product. I

549
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,000
was working with the plants and feeling

550
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,079
the vibration, the love, the energy from

551
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,839
the plants. I got to grow them and then

552
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,359
we got to trim them, dry them and cure

553
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,038
them and then take them downstairs and

554
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,279
give them to Carol and watch her life

555
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,759
get better. Like how couldn't you fall

556
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,759
in love and enjoy that? That is uh from

557
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,079
start to finish that is a fulfill

558
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,839
fulfilling feeling. There's nothing but

559
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,678
love and care and compassion and

560
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,439
positivity in that. There's no darkness.

561
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,759
There's no downside. There's no

562
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,558
negativity. The negativity and downside

563
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,960
was all Babylon legal ramifications. We

564
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,639
were closed because we were illegally

565
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,000
zoned and then they tried to find us and

566
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,679
do all kinds of dumb [ __ ] but we got

567
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,440
out of that. But um so I got to see

568
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,519
young people, old people, and everything

569
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,759
in between improve the quality of their

570
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,038
life by consuming a product that my

571
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,119
friends and I cultivated in a facility

572
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:43,599
upstairs. So that was how can you not

573
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,279
love seeing people feel better? like

574
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,959
they were sick, they were sad, they were

575
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:49,918
scared and now they enjoy life and they

576
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,519
pop in every week to remind me. Um, we

577
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,000
had a burn victim that came to the

578
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,679
dispensary and he was um toasted from

579
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,038
head to toe. He looked like you were

580
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,240
thinking yes. And many people um they

581
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,000
were afraid of him because of his

582
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,319
appearance. And I had to overcome a

583
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,679
little bit of um it might have been

584
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,439
fear. I don't know what it was, but I

585
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,759
had to shake this man's I didn't have

586
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,759
to. I got to I got to shake this burned

587
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,759
victim's hand and look him in the eye

588
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,599
and make friends with him. And then he

589
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,200
was a firefighter that got burned up

590
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,199
really badly and we got to help him and

591
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,720
develop a relationship with this guy.

592
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,319
People were afraid of him when he first

593
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,240
came in and he was afraid of us when he

594
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:26,079
first came in. But after a few visits,

595
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
that guy was our friend and we respected

596
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:29,359
each other and took good care of each

597
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,960
other. So I remember a lot of those

598
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:33,119
people that came to the dispensary. They

599
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,519
all have a spot within me still. I feel

600
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,798
like I still carry that energy uh as I'm

601
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,960
breeding, as I'm growing, as I'm

602
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,319
smoking. that is still in me uh and that

603
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,640
is still out there in the community.

604
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,240
Those people still remember me as the

605
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,880
guy that showed them how to use cannabis

606
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,038
and medical marijuana properly. So ah

607
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,320
that's a huge role to play on both sides

608
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:54,000
of that relationship. Um my next note is

609
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,399
unity. Have you ever seen a bunch of

610
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,480
people smoke and get mad at each other?

611
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Like I've never taken a dab and been

612
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,679
like a you know what [ __ ] you. That's

613
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,880
never happened. I've taken a shot of

614
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,720
tequila and I don't know what they put

615
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,799
in tequila. a Jagermeister. They both

616
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,558
have it, but there's a surprise in the

617
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,558
bottle. It could be in the first shot or

618
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:13,759
the 17th shot. They just it's in there

619
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,678
somewhere and you never know who's going

620
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,200
to get it either. But you could take a

621
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,038
shot of Jäger Memeister and by the time

622
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,480
you sh set that shot glass down on the

623
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,679
table, you just pick somebody and you

624
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:26,319
have decided, "Fuck you. [ __ ] you, your

625
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,480
mom, your mom's dog, [ __ ] your uncle."

626
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,558
And I don't even know why, but we have

627
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,720
to fight now. And that's in Tequila,

628
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,798
that's in Jaggermeister. Uh whiskey

629
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
doesn't do that. Whiskey has a coyote

630
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,240
arm. Coyote arm is when you take a shot

631
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,679
and your arm flies up in the air and you

632
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,279
go, "Woo, that's coyote arm." Uh, but

633
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,960
you never get that out of cannabis.

634
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,279
Cannabis doesn't have coyote arm.

635
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,279
Cannabis doesn't have fist fights. Uh,

636
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,599
cannabis doesn't have shitalking in it.

637
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:53,599
Uh, cannabis has unity in there. You

638
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,199
smoke some dabs, you smoke a joint, and

639
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:57,359
everybody you just smoked with is now

640
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,880
some of your best friends forever. Even

641
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,479
when that buzz wears off, you're still

642
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,720
going to be friends forever. I don't

643
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,558
know what the the magical effect is, but

644
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,159
I've never smoked a joint or smoked a

645
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,720
dab and been like, "Let's go beat

646
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,559
somebody up." I've been like, "Man, I've

647
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,159
been being a dick. I needed to smoke a

648
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,158
joint for like an hour now. I got to go

649
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,799
apologize to some people and get some

650
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,200
snacks." So, the unity, the unity in

651
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:22,000
cannabis. I've smoked with people of

652
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,640
every color. Um, white people, black

653
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,558
people, brown people, yellow people, uh,

654
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,000
what other ever brown people, whatever

655
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,759
other color there are. or I've smoked

656
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,119
with those people and we all enjoy it.

657
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,359
We all have a good time. There's no

658
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:35,279
racism in cannabis. Every color of

659
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,359
people loves to smoke. There are some

660
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,879
people whose uh just their brain

661
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:40,558
chemistry and their mentality, they

662
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,880
shouldn't smoke, but they'll learn that

663
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,079
and they won't and they'll just have a

664
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:47,200
bad experience on their own and they

665
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:48,678
won't enjoy it. But um every race, every

666
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,440
religion,

667
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:52,798
um everybody on the planet can enjoy

668
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,320
cannabis with me. I'm not going to

669
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,720
discriminate. Come smoke whatever

670
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,079
religion you are. Maybe we could smoke a

671
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,519
joint and we could solve some problems

672
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,599
together. If your religion and your

673
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,279
religion don't get along, smoke that

674
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:07,639
joint. Let's talk it out. Maybe it'll be

675
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:10,319
peaceful. Um, I wrote uh age, sex,

676
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,679
location. Nobody cares. Smoke. I don't

677
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:12,960
Well, I do care if you're old enough.

678
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,320
Like, you got to be an adult to smoke

679
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,600
with me. I'm not smoking with no babies

680
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,439
or nothing, but if you're old enough to

681
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,519
smoke and if you can, if you show up

682
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,840
with some weed, I'll smoke with you. Um,

683
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,079
I don't care if you're male, female. Um,

684
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,839
I'm adjusting to being uh more

685
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,639
comfortable smoking with people that are

686
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:30,558
in between. Yes, it's 2025. Uh, I'm

687
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,080
learning about trans people and becoming

688
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,599
more comfortable with that. It's what we

689
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,599
got to do. I'll smoke with you if you're

690
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,519
trans. I don't care where you are. We'll

691
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,158
smoke. It's more fun to smoke in weird

692
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,000
[ __ ] places. Um, stoners know the

693
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,679
coolest places to smoke. Okay, here we

694
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,159
go. Random. This is out of the top of my

695
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,400
head. In the comment section, please let

696
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,080
me know your favorite place to smoke.

697
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,400
Where's like a creative place to smoke?

698
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,558
a weird place. Where's a notable place

699
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,080
that you have or like to smoke and

700
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,599
consume cannabis? Leave that in the

701
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,720
comment section. I look forward to

702
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,279
reading your comments. That's going to

703
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,279
be a good time. Um, and then I wrote,

704
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,279
"Everyone loves to smoke. The thugs, the

705
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,759
goths, the hippies, the rostas, the

706
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:09,759
moms, the doctors, the lawyers.

707
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,640
Everybody likes to smoke weed, dude.

708
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,960
Everybody but Babylon. Everybody but law

709
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,200
enforcement. And you know what? So many

710
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,200
of them smoke, too. Trust me, I know it.

711
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,480
So, everybody loves to smoke ganja. How

712
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,600
could you not?" So the question was how

713
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,440
did I fall in love with cannabis? Um

714
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,119
first of all by smoking it and feeling

715
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,720
better. And then second I got to grow

716
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:31,519
cannabis and then being around the

717
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,839
plants and watching them grow. I can

718
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,918
grow from a seed all the way to a

719
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,678
smokable product by myself. I don't need

720
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,200
any intervention. I don't need a hand. I

721
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,080
can do that. Um me smoking that product

722
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,159
I grew as such a fulfilling experience.

723
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:49,759
Growing it was a ritual and a meditation

724
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:51,760
in its own. Smoking it is a ritual and a

725
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:55,200
meditation and its own. Sharing that

726
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:57,119
with you, watching you enjoy it is a

727
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,720
whole another meditation and ritual in

728
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,319
its own. And I love every step of it. A

729
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,798
lot of people find growing cannabis to

730
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,038
be daunting and to be a task and to be

731
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:09,359
work. I could grow weed all day and not

732
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:11,519
do any work. I love producing and

733
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,359
cultivating cannabis. So, I get to grow

734
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,599
it. I get to smoke it. And then I get to

735
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,079
breed it. Now, my role in the community

736
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,079
is making new strains. I'm creating new

737
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:22,240
cultivars and new genetics for

738
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,639
recreational and medical consumers to

739
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,038
enjoy. Uh, and mostly what I'm doing is

740
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,960
creating [ __ ] that I enjoy. And then it

741
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,480
just so happens that you guys like what

742
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,319
I'm making. It's like a musician. It's

743
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,000
like I'm making an album and I'm like,

744
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:35,759
"This is how my heart felt. This is the

745
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,119
music that I heard. I'm going to put it

746
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:39,200
out. And if you love it, you love it.

747
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,239
And if you don't, you don't. Luckily,

748
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,319
I've got a good uh eye or ear or nose

749
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,120
for growing because you guys really seem

750
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:50,720
to love it. So, I think my love for the

751
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,719
plant uh shows in how I grow and how I

752
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,640
breed. Uh how I come on here every week

753
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,640
and give you 30 minutes of my time just

754
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,240
talking about ganja for free. I don't I

755
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,159
do have a Patreon channel, but without

756
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,919
the Patreon, I would still do this. So,

757
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,960
I think my love reflects for that and it

758
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,559
developed by uh smoking and enjoying it.

759
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,640
I can remember smoking with my high

760
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,960
school bros, Chris and Shannon and Randy

761
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,200
and Andy and Greg and Todd didn't smoke

762
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,038
much, but he hung out. Um, I'm sure I

763
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,080
missed Dave and Brandon, and there's a

764
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:17,278
bunch of them. I'm trying not to miss

765
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,439
anybody, but that was my high school

766
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:22,000
crew. Some of my favorite memories are

767
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,720
just in the car smoking with those boys

768
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,558
or driving around trying to find weed to

769
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,960
smoke with those boys. That was part of

770
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:31,038
the adventure back then. You guys are

771
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,480
spoiled now. All you new smokers are

772
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,480
spoiled. Back then, we had to drive

773
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,038
around and just hope that one of the

774
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,880
buddies would page us back. Yeah. Pager,

775
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,720
dude. That's how it was. You'd go to the

776
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,080
Burger King and Burger King had a pay

777
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,759
phone and you'd page them and put in

778
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:44,798
your pager number or your cell phone. We

779
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,200
didn't even have cell phones. It's a

780
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,639
pager. Or you put in the Burger King pay

781
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,720
phone number and hang out by the phone

782
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,640
and hope your buddy calls you on time.

783
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,400
Like, or just drive around and hopefully

784
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,240
we'd see one of our weed dealer friends

785
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,480
driving around town or maybe he's at the

786
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,919
park or who knows. Things were so

787
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,599
different. Now you run out of weed, you

788
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,759
just go to the [ __ ] store down the

789
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,519
street. There are 20 stores within 5

790
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,599
minutes of me. I could go buy weed and

791
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,038
concentrates or whatever. It's wild now.

792
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,719
I don't even remember where I was in

793
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:12,319
this part of the chat. But but part of

794
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,240
my love for this plant developed just

795
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,079
around finding cannabis. It used to be

796
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,440
fun. And I know it sounds like a pain in

797
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:18,879
the ass, driving around looking for

798
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,960
weed, but that was part of the mission.

799
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,799
Just driving around trying to find it

800
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,319
and then finding somewhere safe to smoke

801
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:25,679
it and then figuring out what you're

802
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,839
going to do after you smoke it. What

803
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,679
kind of shenanigans do we get into? And

804
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,199
then after that shenanigans happened,

805
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,880
you and your friends never forgot about

806
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,798
that. You there was some blank [ __ ] you

807
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
didn't remember, but you always laughed

808
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,879
about. Remember that time that Chris did

809
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,799
this and then fell off of this into the

810
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,320
pool and whatever. Just some random

811
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:44,558
[ __ ] You'll always remember that. So

812
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,720
cannabis is always a good time if

813
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:48,319
respected. You could disrespect it and

814
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,759
uh you could try to get too high and you

815
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,200
will. You'll get the spins, you might

816
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:53,038
get the throwups or whatever. And you

817
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,399
could definitely uh if you try to do

818
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,720
something silly, this is where we make

819
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,239
that adult disclaimer. Don't drive if

820
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,919
you're all [ __ ] up and don't operate

821
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,759
heavy machinery and don't do dumb [ __ ]

822
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,759
because cannabis will make you respect

823
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:06,000
it. But if you respect this plant and

824
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,240
love the plant, it will love you back.

825
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,679
Whether you're a recreational consumer,

826
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,200
whether you're a medical consumer,

827
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,960
whether you're a spiritual cannabis

828
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,798
consumer, that's new. I'm just I'm

829
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,159
making that one my own term now. There's

830
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,798
medical, there's recreational, and now

831
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,000
there is spiritual cannabis consumption.

832
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:21,038
Whichever one you're doing it for, if

833
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,960
you're just doing it just cuz you like

834
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,798
to smoke weed and get high, that that's

835
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,319
fun. That's awesome. All right, guys.

836
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,319
Luckily, I got interrupted or I would

837
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:30,158
still be rambling about why I love this

838
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,158
plant. It is time for me to wrap up this

839
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:33,919
podcast. I think I have made my point.

840
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,679
Uh, I have been consuming cannabis since

841
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,120
I was a youngster. I remember one time,

842
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,399
I got to give my uncles another shout

843
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,319
out, then we'll finish this up. I

844
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,959
remember one time being in the back of

845
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,200
my uncle Eric's Chevy El Camino with a

846
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,880
camper shell on it. Uncle Eric and Uncle

847
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,880
Ron, both of them have passed. Miss you

848
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,120
boys. Love you. Rest in peace. They were

849
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,120
smoking a joint. We were on our way to a

850
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,759
concert. They were listening to the

851
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,759
Metallica Black album. That smoke came

852
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,079
to the back of that car and I got so

853
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,480
stoned. Uh I think I've been a pthead

854
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,319
since then and they didn't even know it.

855
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,720
So big shout out to my uncles Ron and

856
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,319
Eric uh for setting me on the right path

857
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,079
and giving me the right idea about

858
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,398
cannabis. I saw them do a lot of other

859
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,000
things and I saw that ganja was the way

860
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,079
to go. I always loved the smell of it

861
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,440
from the beginning. Uh I loved being

862
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,119
around those guys when they smoked and

863
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,558
then I saw it everywhere else I went and

864
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:22,959
I learned to recognize it. I could smell

865
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:25,038
it. could see it and I knew. So, I think

866
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,519
I was a stoner before I even was a

867
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,960
stoner. I was born into this. Um, and

868
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,519
I'm grateful that I found this niche.

869
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,440
Without this plant, who knows? I don't

870
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:35,359
even We'll We'll guess, we'll speculate,

871
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,798
we'll anticipate where I would be. I'd

872
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,719
probably be a failed musician. Um, I

873
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,398
would probably be working at a bowling

874
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,798
alley or something like that right now.

875
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:46,879
I'd probably be working at Guitar Center

876
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:48,398
trying to sling drums or some [ __ ] like

877
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,399
that. That's probably what would have

878
00:29:48,398 --> 00:29:52,398
happened without cannabis. So, I've got

879
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,199
nothing but love, gratitude, and respect

880
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,119
for this plant. Uh, my dude, Lucky Bowl

881
