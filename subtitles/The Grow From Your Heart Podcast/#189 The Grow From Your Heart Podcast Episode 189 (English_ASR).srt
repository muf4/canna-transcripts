today so let me explain something here I

77
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,319
said bad or right I said live batter

78
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:44,659
people are probably going what's he

79
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:47,899
smoking live batter so this is hash this

80
00:02:44,659 --> 00:02:49,579
was a live resin I got to keep backing

81
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:51,020
up steps because the more stuff I say

82
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,750
the more stuff I realize I need to

83
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,850
explain so these plants the plants that

84
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,349
made this material were cut down and the

85
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,299
big leaves were taken off anything with

86
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:01,549
trichomes were left on there those buds

87
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,770
were frozen that frozen bud was

88
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,390
delivered to an extraction company that

89
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,980
extraction company ran it while it was

90
00:03:05,389 --> 00:03:09,409
still frozen through a closed loop

91
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:12,199
butane system i says here solvents

92
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:13,969
butane so this was ran with and butane

93
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,649
is what it was made with so they ran it

94
00:03:13,969 --> 00:03:17,329
through probably a

95
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:19,700
Motech machine or something similar in

96
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,939
obidos ran it through there with

97
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:25,219
n-butane while it was frozen then it

98
00:03:22,938 --> 00:03:26,479
came out very all of the terpenes were

99
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:28,250
still intact that's what I'm trying to

100
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,750
say it came out very turfy all of the

101
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,280
Terps were still there all of the flavor

102
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,560
was still there why are they calling it

103
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,090
live resin live resin is when the plants

104
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,799
are cut down and frozen and we run them

105
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,509
frozen that's what live resin is why are

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,400
they calling it live batter is what I

107
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,318
should get to it looks like cake batter

108
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,780
you guys it's got the consistency of

109
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,339
cake batter it's not quite as runny as

110
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,989
cake batter but it's thick and battery

111
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,469
it's got a really interesting and unique

112
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:52,639
consistency to it

113
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:54,500
a long time ago we might not have

114
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:55,670
approved of this a long time ago we

115
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,459
might have said this look too bad but

116
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,899
the new tech makes it look delicious so

117
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,009
big shout out to everybody I've just

118
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,269
kissed their ass for a good solid

119
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:04,638
minute-and-a-half but I completely

120
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:06,739
approve of this I bred the lemon Jeffrey

121
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,939
so when I saw that apothecary had ran it

122
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:08,389
and turned it into batter I had to go

123
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:10,219
get it

124
00:04:08,389 --> 00:04:12,109
so big shout out everybody did a great

125
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,068

savage

168
00:05:29,689 --> 00:05:32,839
and when I put out new content you

169
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,060
consume it immediately and then you beg

170
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:36,379
for more I want to have more for you

171
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:38,629
lined up I don't want to put out stuff

172
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:40,370
and then not have anything ready for the

173
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,800
people that are savages so be patient

174

175
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,430

176
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:47,929

because I shipped them in one of those

188
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:08,509

189
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:10,670

because I love cannabis and I can't shut

269
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:39,899
up about cannabis I was sitting at the

270
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,789
table with Maddy and Spence and a bunch

271
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,440
of the crew a long time ago and people

272
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:45,208
would ask me questions about growing and

273
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,130
I caught myself repeating myself saying

274
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,659
the same [ __ ] over and over to people I

275
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:50,100
thought I should just record this and

276
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:51,778
when somebody asked me this question I

277
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,579
can tell them hey go listen to number

278
00:08:51,778 --> 00:08:55,679
seventy four of my podcast and you can

279
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:57,479
learn this and I just love talking about

280
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:58,769
cannabis and I love podcasting I love

281
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,230
communicating with people I want

282
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:03,120
everyone to grow good weed so that's why

283
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:05,190
I do the podcast the reason I'm asking

284
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,959
for financial support is because it does

285
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:08,910
cost me money you guys the equipment

286
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,679

287
00:09:08,909 --> 00:09:12,419
an equipment failure or something always

288
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:14,759
[ __ ] breaks technology always breaks

289
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:17,490

291
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:21,839
where I host the podcast it does cost a

292
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,939
little bit of money since I'm putting up

293

00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:35,850

339
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,068
of time and energy into making every

340
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:51,539
episode and it shows as someone from a

341
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,308
prohibition state it's great to hear

342
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:54,838
about growing and cannabis culture so

343
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:55,708
that i can keep tabs on what's happening

344
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,499
in the free world

345
00:10:55,708 --> 00:11:00,628
white Mike rules as well you hear that

346
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:03,899

348
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,120
out there by far it will grow freely I

349
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,860
appreciate that several people have told

350
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,110
me I'm the best cannabis podcast out

351
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,789
there I'm not in any competition but I

352
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:16,620
completely appreciate hearing that

353
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:18,778
because some of my heroes have podcast

354
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:20,100
about cannabis so knowing that my heroes

355
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,509
you're telling me that you like me more

356
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,490
than the people that have inspired me

357
00:11:21,509 --> 00:11:25,589
that means a lot to me although I don't

358
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,789
find competition in their support all

359
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:27,809
the cannabis podcast who learned

360
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:29,248
something different from everybody

361
00:11:27,808 --> 00:11:30,928
that's why I list I listen to their

362
00:11:29,249 --> 00:11:32,670
podcast I try not to listen to too much

363
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:34,850
of the other podcast I can listen to

364
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:37,110
bone Ellis because she doesn't uh

365
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:38,909
contaminate my thought process but if I

366
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,798
listen to the dude grows and Adam Dunn

367
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:42,928
show too much I feel like they kind of

368
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:45,749
contaminate my podcast I end up doing

369
00:11:42,928 --> 00:11:47,639
their show it's like if I if a musician

370
00:11:45,749 --> 00:11:49,139
if I'm a drummer I feel like if I listen

371
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,298
to Led Zeppelin all day and then I play

372
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:53,339
my drums I sound like Led Zeppelin so I

373
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:54,928
don't listen to the dude grows too

374
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,339
frequently I do listen of course I

375
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:58,289
listen to the dude grow show but I can't

376
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,240
listen religiously because I start

377
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:03,058
talking like Scotty and I start talking

378
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,409
like the dude so I can't listen to too

379
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:05,789
many of the cannabis podcasts but I do

380
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:08,189
listen to him and if I listen to Adam

381
00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:09,269
Dunn podcast I get to

382
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,800
sucked into the topic that they're

383
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:11,819
talking about I want to research it then

384
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,899
I want to do it on my show and I feel

385
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,879
like I'm just ripping them off and

386
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,889
that's not fair so I do listen I just

387
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:18,059
can't because I don't I feel like if I

388
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:19,350
listen to the same comedians all the

389
00:12:18,059 --> 00:12:20,759
time I start telling their jokes I don't

390
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,560
want to do that to the podcast I want to

391
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:23,759
keep it mind

392
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,199
how the hell did I get way out there I

393
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,700
was talking about being the best podcast

394
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,930
yeah I listen to them all I don't I

395
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,370

KC CB 68 the title other comment was

411
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,580
sets the standard they left the comment

412
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:02,340
on February 27th and of course they gave

413
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:03,629
me another five-star rating the comment

414
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,930
is short and simple and it goes like

415
00:13:03,629 --> 00:13:05,879
this

416
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:08,789
Jeff has an elite knowledge of cannabis

417
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,769
horticulture and doesn't push brands I'm

418
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:12,539
glad that you noticed that um there was

419
00:13:10,769 --> 00:13:15,029
another podcast that kind of inspired me

420
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:16,889
to do a show every time somebody would

421
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:19,350
say hey I've got a problem they would

422
00:13:16,889 --> 00:13:21,480
say go buy this product and spray it all

423
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,370
over your plants problem solved and I

424
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,470
feel like that was not a real solution

425
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,299
yeah your that's a band-aid

426
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,350
you've got spider mites spray floor

427
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,859
might you don't have spider mites

428
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,590
anymore

429
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,940
for about 45 days but in 45 days you're

430
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:34,320
gonna get spider mites again because you

431
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,230
did not correct the issue

432
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,660
I don't push brands I push solutions I

433
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:41,970

me to advertise on the show and I I try

450
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,870

all right podcast world I took a couple

474
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,629
more dabs and I took a couple of drinks

476
00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:04,090
garden issue let's talk about thrips and

477
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,399
how to identify eradicate and prevent

478
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,780
getting thrips in your cannabis garden

479
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,459
let's talk a little bit about thrips

480
00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:11,980
before we talk about getting rid of them

481
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,930
thrips are ugly [ __ ] you guys

482
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:15,940
thrips are barely visible to the naked

483
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:17,139
eye they're super tiny you need a

484
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,060
microscope to see them you need a

485
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:20,860
magnifying glass to see them you will

486
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:22,629
probably never see them but you will see

487
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,889
the damage that they leave in your

488
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:26,080
garden you'll see their honeydew you'll

489
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:27,370
see their poop you'll see their effects

490
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:29,139
so let's talk about the adults adults

491
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:31,629
have wings but they don't fly what kind

492
00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,009
of [ __ ] bug is that it's got wings

493
00:15:31,629 --> 00:15:34,689
that doesn't fly so if you see a bug

494
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:37,000
with wings it doesn't fly and your

495
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:39,940
magnifying glass it is probably possibly

496
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,350
a thrip sometimes they jump I've read

497
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,480
that thrips jump I've never seen this

498
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,509
personally because they're so small I've

499
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,480
never seen it happen thrips have yellow

500
00:15:46,509 --> 00:15:50,980
or brown heads and bodies ah

501
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,620
they are yellowish brown they look uh

502
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:55,120
there's ugly there's ugly little nasty

503
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,769
little bugs they attack the leaves and

504
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,620
they're often found on the surface of

505
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:01,059
your leaves honestly you guys the number

506
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,460
one way that I think I have gotten

507
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:05,679
thrips is by purchasing soil I can't

508
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,240
blame any specific brand of soil because

509
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:09,939
it's happened with more than one brand

510
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,430
what happens with soil is it's made by a

511
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:15,220
certain vendor you're buying soil brand

512
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:16,509
a soil brand B they're made by a vendor

513
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,220
and a certain warehouse in a certain

514
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:19,689
location maybe one's made in Colorado

515
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:22,120
one's made in Michigan one's made in

516
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:23,620
California but eventually they all end

517
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,899
up in a shipping warehouse together they

518
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,330
all get stacked together one of those

519
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:29,919
packages had bugs and just like any

520
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,629
other community the bugs spread

521
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,729
throughout all the dirt and now those

522
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:34,129
packs of dirt get put on a pallet they

523
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,110
get

524
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:38,870
to your local hydros shop and you buy

525
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:40,789
them and now you've got free thrips with

526
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,310
your dirt so it's a good idea to treat

527
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:46,099
for thrips right away I like to when I

528
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:48,439
transplant I like to soak a root root

529
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:51,259
drench all of my new transplants with

530
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:54,080
evergreen pyrethrum spray or a pyrethrum

531
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:56,269
drench I use 15 milliliters per gallon

532
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,310
of evergreen that's evergreen pie Ganic

533
00:16:56,269 --> 00:17:00,259
mix that in with your water you can put

534
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,639
it in with your nutrients it can ph it

535
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:03,230
and then just soak your plants with it

536
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,269
soak the water soak that or soak the

537
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:07,338
soils what I'm trying to say and that

538
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:09,289
won't get rid of most of your soil bound

539
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:11,240
pests I would almost recommend doing

540
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:12,949
that again in about five days and

541
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,779
that'll if you they laid eggs in there

542
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,130
that will kill their eggs also that will

543
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:18,410
really help you out if you're gonna go

544
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:20,510
organics use some neem cakes some

545
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,430
karanji meal some neem meal in the soil

546
00:17:20,509 --> 00:17:24,019
that will really help get rid of them in

547
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:26,089
the soil but I feel like a lot of the

548
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:27,529
thrips you buy them free with your dirt

549
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,809
they're like a bonus they're like a

550
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:31,339
prize in your cereal a lot of bugs come

551
00:17:29,809 --> 00:17:33,319
that way so it's a good idea to treat

552
00:17:31,339 --> 00:17:35,539
before you even see problems with drips

553
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:36,980
in a lot of soil especially now in the

554
00:17:35,539 --> 00:17:38,899
springtime and in the summertime when it

555
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,670
gets warmer you will get a lot more bugs

556
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,780
when it's cold they die off there in the

557
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,730
dirt they're being hauled across the

558
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:46,220
country in the soil they're in the back

559
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,690
of a hydro shop in the cold there

560
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,610
they're gonna get cold they're not gonna

561
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,519
live through that but the eggs may so

562
00:17:49,609 --> 00:17:53,959
you need to treat all right so you will

563
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:55,639
find them attacking the leaves in the

564
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,470
leaf surfaces they get up there and they

565
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,060
chew on the leaf surface they penetrate

566
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,710
the leaf surface and they suck out the

567
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,210
SAP and juices you guys that's what most

568
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,190
of these plant insects do they get in

569
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,870
there and suck out the life juice from

570
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,130
your plant they dehydrate your plant

571
00:18:05,869 --> 00:18:09,049
they suck out all the nutrients they

572
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:10,730
suck out all the nourishment this slows

573
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:12,950
down the growth of most of your plants

574
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,440
this slows down the vigor this will

575
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:16,880
certainly slow down and decrease the

576
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,309
yield of your plants this will mess with

577
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,750
the amount of resin and your plants this

578
00:18:19,309 --> 00:18:22,609
will mess with the flavor how does it

579
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,470
mess with flavor the plants will trigger

580
00:18:22,609 --> 00:18:26,029
different terpenoids

581
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,009
and different cannabinoids because

582
00:18:26,029 --> 00:18:29,839
they're under a stress response things

583
00:18:28,009 --> 00:18:31,129
will be different you will see problems

584
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,889
that you didn't see before because

585
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,870
they're dealing with stress is so thrips

586
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,610
will leave like a white silver mark or

587
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:39,859
patches on your leaves we call this

588
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:41,449
honeydew it's their [ __ ]

589
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:42,859
they're biting into your leaves they're

590
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,990
sucking out the juice and then they're

591
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:47,359
leaving these little snail trails this

592
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,079
little glistening glittery they call it

593
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,819
a honeydew tray

594
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,408
it that's their [ __ ] that's their

595
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:53,829
secretions they're pooping all over your

596
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:55,789
plants and I find it to be completely

597
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:56,928
disgusting so you don't want thrips in

598
00:18:55,788 --> 00:18:58,429
there they'll make your leaves look kind

599
00:18:56,929 --> 00:18:59,840
of scab they'll make like you look

600
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,399
leaves just got beat up they'll make

601
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,599
everything ugly it looks like

602
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:05,408
something's been in there chewing on the

603
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:09,319
garden because it has it is thrips

604
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:11,539
sometimes you will see green or black

605
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,428
specks on the bottom sides of the leaves

606
00:19:11,538 --> 00:19:15,558
quite often near the veins of the leaves

607
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:16,730
you got the main vein that runs down the

608
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:18,528
center of the leave then you got the

609
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,659
little veins that branch out you will

610
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:22,929
find a specks of green chunk or brown

611
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:25,519
chunk or black chunks underneath there

612
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:28,548
guess what that is you guys that is

613
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,808
thrip [ __ ] on your leaves you're gonna

614
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:31,460
make hash out of that and you're gonna

615
00:19:29,808 --> 00:19:34,398
smoke thrip [ __ ] and it's gonna be

616
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:36,048
disgusting get rid of the thrips you

617
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:37,189
guys there's several ways to get rid of

618
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:39,679
them we're gonna talk about that here in

619
00:19:37,190 --> 00:19:40,308
just a couple of seconds nobody wants to

620
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,710
smoke

621
00:19:40,308 --> 00:19:44,690
thrips or thrip [ __ ] or thrip honeydew

622
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:47,269
that is gross let's get rid of these

623
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,200
bugs sometimes the damage looks a lot

624
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,509
like spider mites

625
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,730
but it gets a lot worse a lot more

626
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:54,319
quickly thrips can do a lot more damage

627
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,639
than a spider mite Russert mites are

628
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,069
probably more dangerous than through

629
00:19:55,638 --> 00:20:00,138
trips but thrips can really destroy

630
00:19:58,069 --> 00:20:01,548
things quickly thrips can kill gardens

631
00:20:00,138 --> 00:20:04,609
commercial gardens have been shut down

632
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:06,829
and started over because of thrips so if

633
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:07,908
you see thrips if you suspect thrips you

634
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:10,939
need to get in there and you need to

635
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:14,000
take care of it very quickly how can you

636
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,528
prevent thrips just like most of the

637
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,808
other issues i've talked about you can

638
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:19,909
prevent thrips by having a clean sealed

639
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:22,490
environment you need a clean grow room

640
00:20:19,909 --> 00:20:25,100
do not let your pets into the grow room

641
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,778
if you bring in new plants from another

642
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:29,058
grower if you bring in plants from a

643
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:31,250
dispensary treat those plants before

644
00:20:29,058 --> 00:20:34,009
they are introduced to your main grow

645
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:36,500
have a quarantine area if I give you a

646
00:20:34,009 --> 00:20:38,629
clone do not trust me I am a good grower

647
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,519
I am reputable you don't know where I

648
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,139
got clones from you don't know who I've

649
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:43,638
been cloning with you don't know whose

650
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:46,369
garden I've played in you don't know

651
00:20:43,638 --> 00:20:47,839
whose dispensary grow I've been to you

652
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,428
don't know what grow store I went to and

653
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,888
who I brushed up against if I give you a

654
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:53,929
clone act like it's got bugs act like it

655
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:55,369
has powdery mildew treated accordingly

656
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:57,830
and don't introduce it to general

657
00:20:55,369 --> 00:21:01,399
population until you are sure that it is

658
00:20:57,829 --> 00:21:03,049
bug free so don't bring

659
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,180
clones in don't bring plants in without

660
00:21:03,049 --> 00:21:06,319
treating them don't bring your pets into

661
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,450
the garden I've talked about how your

662
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,639
pets carry bugs don't bring them in

663
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:12,440
there treat your soil when you buy a new

664
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,730
soil when you put plants into it treat

665
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,170
it right away if those plants are

666
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,059
vigorous enough treat it with the

667
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:19,640
Evergreen peg annex and that will help

668
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:21,589
you get rid of soil bound pests also

669
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:23,570
don't travel from garden a garden if

670
00:21:21,589 --> 00:21:26,029
you're in another garden take a shower

671
00:21:23,569 --> 00:21:28,609
change your clothes don't drag the pests

672
00:21:26,029 --> 00:21:30,619
around change your shoes don't were the

673
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:32,809
same shoes from one Garden to another if

674
00:21:30,619 --> 00:21:35,059
you were recycling soil if you've got

675
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:36,769
soil in a compost area or if you've got

676
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:39,309
soil outside or if you've got soil in

677
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:42,259
your garage treat that soil as if it are

678
00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:43,730
contaminated with bugs so get rid of the

679
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,470
bugs make sure you don't bring the

680
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,000
thrips in they're a pain in the ass all

681
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:49,190
right a prevention another way to

682
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,230
prevent thrips are the yellow and blue

683
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:52,670
sticky cards put the yellow ones up kind

684
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,980
of higher and the blue ones a little bit

685
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,570
lower they will certainly help you out

686
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,339
those are mostly going to let you know

687
00:21:56,569 --> 00:22:00,259
that thrips are there and that you need

688
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:04,059
to treat harder or start stepping up

689
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:06,619
your pesticide or your beneficial insect

690
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:08,419
program your IPM program needs to be

691
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:09,799
stepped up so use the cards they will

692
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,690
let you know if you've got insects

693
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:12,950
showing up they are not going to catch

694
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:14,930
the large amount of the population

695
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,640
they're going to catch the few that fly

696
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:18,470
to the cards that travel to the cards

697
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,840
when you see those that lets you know

698
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:22,519
there are a lot more there that you need

699
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,189
to treat all right so the cards are a

700
00:22:22,519 --> 00:22:26,019
great start

701
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:27,759
another thing you can do if you see the

702
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:30,039
bugs or you can do it as a preventative

703
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:31,599
you can use diatomaceous earth on the

704
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:33,639
top of your soil this only works of

705
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,439
course if you were using soil plants if

706
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,420
you're growing in hydro this is not an

707
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,720
option for you if you're using soil or

708
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,670
cocoa or soilless mix take the top of

709
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,860
the pot let it dry this is something

710
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:46,600
that Shawn taught us well Shawn at the

711
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:48,159
Shawn king Cola what's up dude also shot

712
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:49,659

713
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,950
was working I didn't have time to stop

714
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,210

715
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:53,680

716
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:54,579

717
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:56,259
hope you're doing well

718
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:58,269
shout out to killer Kelly and King Kola

719
00:22:56,259 --> 00:23:00,730
Ross Kola you guys are doing well keep

720
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:03,549
it organic you guys so diatomaceous

721
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,380
earth when the soil dries sprinkle of

722
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:07,869
layer like just a thin layer of

723
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,670
diatomaceous earth across the entire top

724
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:11,949
of the soil surface you want to cover it

725
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:14,200
all now diatomaceous earth is really

726
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:16,029
coarse it's kind of sharp if you are a

727
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,230
soft bodied insect you don't want to

728
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:19,029
climb through that [ __ ] because it's

729
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,380
gonna call you up it's like trying to

730
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:22,359
watch a human climb through a bunch of

731
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:23,950
lava rocks while naked you're just gonna

732
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,619
get cut to [ __ ] it's not gonna be any

733
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,180
fun so the bugs don't want to climb

734
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:29,379
through the diatomaceous earth they

735
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:30,549
don't want to get in there the thrips

736
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:31,630
don't want to climb down in there they

737
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:33,099
don't want to go into the soil they

738
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:35,260
don't want to climb out they will die

739
00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:37,089
diatomaceous earth is very effective on

740
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:38,710
a lot of insects that travel through

741
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:40,179
your soil that want to go from the

742
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:42,009
leaves to the soil they try to make like

743
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,690
a little Y like a little area like a

744
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:44,289
what does a traveler trade route is what

745
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,059
I want to call it

746
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,309
dad tenacious earth is great for those

747
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,929
types of bugs let the soil dry sprinkle

748
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:51,700
it on there once your plants need water

749
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,080
yes you can water them but it's most

750
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,819
effective to put it on there while the

751
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:56,980
plants are dry try to let it go for a

752
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:58,569
little while another great way to get

753
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,000
rid of thrips are beneficial nematodes

754
00:23:58,569 --> 00:24:03,220
I've talked about beneficial nematodes a

755
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,349
lot of course I recommend a place called

756
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,029
RB Co organics to get your beneficial

757
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:09,699
nematodes if you want their website it

758
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:13,269
is RB CO ARB IC o----

759
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:15,730
- organics dot-com they do not sponsor

760
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:17,889
me I do not pitch them because they pay

761
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:19,809
me I advertise for them because they

762
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,520
send me a very helpful magazine in the

763
00:24:19,809 --> 00:24:23,079
mail every three months and it tells me

764
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,359
which insects I should be using right

765
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:27,939
now for the weather for the environment

766
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,349
and it's very helpful I trust them and I

767
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,269
appreciate this company and they're very

768
00:24:29,349 --> 00:24:33,490
affordable and reliable one thing I want

769
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:35,049
to mention and mentioned some beneficial

770
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,289
insects for other predator for other

771
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:37,909
problems

772
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:40,009
and I should tell you to pay attention

773
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,470
to which predators you're purchasing

774
00:24:40,009 --> 00:24:44,480
because if you don't have the right

775
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:47,059
environment for them they will either

776
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,529
die or leave they will just scamper off

777
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:50,329
and go somewhere where the environments

778
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:52,879
right so when you were looking for

779
00:24:50,329 --> 00:24:54,409
perhaps an aphid predator a food

780
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,000
predators that I'm the ones on this page

781
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,850
that I just happened to see it says here

782
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,670
they prefer 64 to 77 degrees with a

783
00:24:58,849 --> 00:25:03,409
moderate to 70s percent humidity if you

784
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,240
don't have that environment you may need

785
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:06,590
a different beneficial insect because

786
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,150
those guys aren't gonna want to hang out

787
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:09,439
they're gonna take off and go where it's

788
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:12,080
better even if you've got food there

789
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,220
they don't like it if you've got all of

790
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,689
the good food if you've got all the

791
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,490
pizza and dr. pepper on the planet but

792
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:17,720
it's a hundred and two degrees I still

793
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:19,130
don't care about that pizza and dr.

794
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,049
pepper I'm gonna get the [ __ ] out and go

795
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:23,150
where it's about 75 degrees and I'll

796
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:25,069
find some dr. pepper and pizza there so

797
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,470
you may need the right environment for

798
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:29,149
your beneficial insects another thing

799
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,670
that you can do if you see these thrips

800
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,170
coming neem oil helps get rid of the

801
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:35,570
thrips but like I've talked about before

802
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:37,070
neem oil will to make your concentrates

803
00:25:35,569 --> 00:25:39,319
taste like [ __ ] the other day I smoked

804
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:41,210
some concentrate from a dispensary and I

805
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:42,769
could taste the pesticides in it it was

806
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:44,930
not a pesticide it was an essential oil

807
00:25:42,769 --> 00:25:46,789
I hid it and I went ooh

808
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:48,080
peppermint I didn't say anything out

809
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:49,279
loud but I passed it to somebody else

810
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,389
and they took a DAB and I go what do you

811
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,680
think of that and they said it tastes

812
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:53,450
like [ __ ] peppermint and I was like

813
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,950
all right it's not in my head you can

814
00:25:53,450 --> 00:25:57,769
taste the essential oils on plants you

815
00:25:54,950 --> 00:26:01,220
guys only use neem in veg if you're

816
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:03,220
going to use it at all another thing you

817
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,700
can use to get rid of the thrips is

818
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,529
spinosad spinosad is a fungus that

819
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,080
happens if they bottom of whiskey

820
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:14,869
barrels it is a product and off product

821
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:17,359
of fermentation you can spray it onto

822
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:18,709
the plants and it will destroy most of

823
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,000
the insects that are on there it'll take

824
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,740
down white flies and it'll certainly

825
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,960
take down full thrips

826
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:26,660
I called them flips in my head another

827
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,240
thing I like is evergreen pyrethrum or

828
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,950
evergreen pie Ganic it works as a spray

829
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,990
you can spray your plants with it and

830
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,730
you can drench the soil with it I feel

831
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:36,710
like if you do the combo if you put up

832
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,450
some yellow and blue sticky traps you

833
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:40,460
spray the plants with evergreen and you

834
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,799
root drench with evergreen everything

835
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:45,529
except the plant will die and that is

836
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,629
organic and it is not too harmful and if

837
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:49,519
you do it early in veg and one time

838
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,170
before flower you should not have a

839
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,180
problem with funky [ __ ] on your buds

840
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:54,980
when it comes time to harvest there

841
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:57,320
should be a full nine weeks between

842
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:58,610
spraying and harvest time hopefully

843
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:59,960
that's long enough hopefully you're not

844
00:26:58,609 --> 00:27:02,059
[ __ ] up and spraying too heavily

845
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,140
concentrated of anything on there the

846
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:05,419
only thing I would really spray in

847
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:07,070
flower is like a compost tea maybe some

848
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,800
push I don't like hitting them a lot in

849
00:27:07,069 --> 00:27:10,939
flower one one reason you don't want to

850
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:12,200
spray them when they're in flowers cuz

851
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,880
the buds start bulking up and the

852
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,680
moisture gets inside the bud you do run

853
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,240
the risk of promoting bud rot that's a

854
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:19,130
big reason why I talk about not spraying

855
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,900
in flower also you're gonna mess up the

856
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:22,370
flavor you're gonna mess up the taste of

857
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,970
those buds that you're growing for nine

858
00:27:22,369 --> 00:27:24,769
weeks

859
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:26,299
why spray some [ __ ] on them [ __ ] up the

860
00:27:24,769 --> 00:27:27,799
flavor when you can leave them the way

861
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:28,730
they are and it tastes super delicious

862
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:30,349
if you do it right

863
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,720
so what thing I just thought of that I

864
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:34,549
didn't say let the soil dry throw down

865
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,170
some dye Oh tenacious earth soaked with

866
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:37,819
the Evergreen spray with the Evergreen

867
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,990
put up the yellow and blue sticky cards

868
00:27:37,819 --> 00:27:40,970
you should be golden you shouldn't have

869
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,589
any bugs that should get rid of most of

870
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:44,660
your bug problems

871
00:27:42,589 --> 00:27:46,549
I hope unless you've got a serious

872
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:50,390
infest to infestation that should really

873
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:51,740
solve like 75% of your bug problems all

874
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,759
right guys of course another thing you

875
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,079
can do to get rid of your thrips are

876
00:27:54,759 --> 00:28:00,440
pirate bugs there's a bug called theme

877
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:03,619
my new pirate bug the aureus insidious

878
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,080
the suckers ugly he eats

879
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:09,259
thrips white fly spider mites a fatale

880
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,279
kinds of other stuff you guys he loves

881
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:13,640
to get him in and eat stuff in your

882
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:15,200
garden he's a very versatile insect he

883
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:17,150
will thrive in an indoor and a

884
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,670
greenhouse he's something I highly

885
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:21,440
recommended also predatory mites the

886
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,090
sworsky mites that I recommended for

887
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,570
your spider mites will also work very

888
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:28,639
well on thrips all right you guys now I

889
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:29,689
hope you are able to identify thrips it

890
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,920
looks like a little [ __ ] been

891
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,420
crawling on your plants and [ __ ]

892
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:34,250
this shiny stuff and just chewing holes

893
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,600
in it kind of looks like there's glitter

894
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,980
on your plants maybe the leaves are

895
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,209
starting to curl up and wilt a little

896
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,500
bit they're starting to look dry in

897
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:41,390
certain patches maybe they're getting a

898
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,829
little bit crispy you've probably got

899
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:44,810
thrips in there it's time to give out a

900
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:46,579
magnifying glass it's time to identify

901
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:49,519

902
