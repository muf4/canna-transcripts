amazing podcast I promise you in this

36
00:01:31,228 --> 00:01:34,798
episode we're gonna talk about an email

37
00:01:32,609 --> 00:01:36,329
that I was sent a friend of ours in I

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,750
think he's in Michigan we'll verify that

39
00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,519
in the email Michigan he is awaiting and

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,219
anticipating the legalization of

41
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:46,019
cannabis in his area and he wants to be

42
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,118
properly prepared and he wants to know

43
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:50,459
how to get a jump on things basically

44
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,049
and then he also he's got a legislation

45
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:53,579
question lined up for Mike and then he's

46
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,380
got a grow question lined up for me so

47
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:56,609
that'll probably take up most of the

48
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,438
episode and I'm also going to read a

49
00:01:56,609 --> 00:02:01,379
Facebook post from somebody in the

50
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:03,449
cannabis community and I also hope to

51
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:04,618
get to an email you know we'll start

52
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,299
with that one cuz it'll be quick I hope

53
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,280
to get to an email a message that we

54
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,590
received from Instagram we'll probably

55
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,348
start with that but before we get that

56
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:14,759
far it might let everybody on that's

57
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,568
listening let everybody know how they

58
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,039

about the breeding project that I keep

90
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:20,370
telling everybody about I am making I've

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,750
got an arise male if you haven't been

92
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,479
updated yet if you don't listen to the

93
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,060
show regularly I am breeding I am I

94
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,159
region it's breeding cannabis plants

95
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,900
yeah some breeding cannabis they're not

96
00:03:29,158 --> 00:03:32,280
they're not goats or children if you

97
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,359
haven't been listening let's catch you

98
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,549
all the way about breeding

99
00:03:33,359 --> 00:03:37,889
piranhas I'm breeding cannabis plants I

100
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:41,790
made the arize arises a strain that I

101
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:44,189
made it recently tested at 31% THC a it

102
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:46,590
is a cross of golden goat and a day

103
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:49,590
breaker it is a regular seat it is not

104
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,750
feminized IDUs test at 31 percent THC I

105
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:53,549
searched through about a hundred seeds

106
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,229
maybe more than a hundred to find the

107
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,590
male plant that I want I've got a really

108
00:03:55,229 --> 00:04:01,979
killer male I have also got a few

109
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,769
phenotypes of females of the same strain

110
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,689
those are all in a room together the

111
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,949
male has been removed his pollen did its

112
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:09,658
thing the male has been pulled out of

113
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,669
there there is also a lemon skunk plant

114
00:04:09,658 --> 00:04:14,188
in there there's a golden goat plant in

115
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,470
there for experimental reasons and there

116
00:04:14,188 --> 00:04:17,879
is also a grateful dog plant in there

117
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,590
because I wanted to make the arize

118
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,870
crossed a grateful dog because those are

119
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:24,060
my two flagship that I'm known for right

120
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:25,228
- my favorite yes a lot - of a lot of

121
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,668
people's favorite so I put them together

122
00:04:25,228 --> 00:04:28,669
we'll see what happens to that there

123
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:30,409
will not be any retail

124
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,410
dog to arise seeds for a long time I

125
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:35,660
made a very small batch of the project

126
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,180
folks yes do you rise however I just

127
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,130
made f2 the arize male hit the arise

128
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:42,139
females and I made f2 and by hitting

129
00:04:40,129 --> 00:04:45,949
multiple phenotypes of the females I

130
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:48,319
have made a nice option for selection

131
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:50,899
for variation for my f3 so I'll get to

132
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,759
see what that plant what that what that

133
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:54,769
plant expresses in a lot of different

134
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,680
ways so I'll be able to pick a very good

135
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:59,569
male and a very good female to make the

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,639
f3 I'm actually my goal is to take this

137
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:03,170
to f5 and I'm trying not to rush it I

138
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,509
want to go through and find the exactly

139
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,699
the more time and the more plants is

140
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:09,800
sort of the better is the rule of thumb

141
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,289
in these projects yes you know my

142
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,240
encouragement is to go slow and as big

143
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,870
as possible selection is key when it

144
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,150
comes to this nope so I won if I believe

145
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,040
that if I hit multiple females with one

146
00:05:20,149 --> 00:05:23,449
male and then I pull seeds from and I

147
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,360
keep them separate and then I find that

148
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:28,129
golden male I don't have to use say I've

149
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,139
got the females are labeled actually

150
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:31,730
what they actually are is there's number

151
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,189
4 okay the keepers the ones that are

152
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:36,740
going to survive to another run are four

153
00:05:34,189 --> 00:05:38,269
eight and one that was lettered e from a

154
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,759
previous run those are the three that

155
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:42,439
are amazing phenotypes of a rise they

156
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:43,779
will answer those are your ladies yeah

157
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:46,509
those will stick around for a while

158
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:48,679
those that's the i3 the Irie three

159
00:05:46,509 --> 00:05:50,120
around a little bit in the mail I call

160
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:54,470
him solemn and it's a rise he's a male

161
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:57,110
his name is Solomon I feel that alpha

162
00:05:54,470 --> 00:06:01,310
shoo I'll see diversity and I may pick a

163
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:03,590
male from number three or II and then I

164
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:05,810
may pick a female from number four and I

165
00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,369
may breathe that way which that's still

166
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:08,660
the same finial generation and it's

167
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,850
still the same genetic so I'm still

168
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:14,480
making F threes but it gives me a little

169
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,950
show a lot of variation and expressions

170
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,780
than you would have otherwise because

171
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:20,180
you're going as big as you are and I'm

172
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:21,829
trying to narrow it down to where it

173
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,689
almost looks like clones when you grow

174
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:25,009
these seeds by the time I get to f5 I

175
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:26,750
want to be able to say yeah it's gonna

176
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,089
look like this and it's basically a

177
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:31,879
clone that's that's my goal so that's

178
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:33,560
where I'm taking that they listens if

179
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:36,529
you're if you're not quite as nerdy as

180
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,639
we are what the long and the short of

181
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:39,469
what we're getting out of here the goal

182
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,490
all of this is to find the best of the

183
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,639
best of the best

184
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:45,740
yes and basically what that takes is a

185
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:50,228
lot of trial and error and a lot of

186
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:53,569
willingness to kill off plants and

187
00:06:50,228 --> 00:06:56,089
towards the end or at the end the goal

188
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:58,610
is you'll be able to put a ten pack of

189
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:00,829
seeds in the ground and have all of them

190
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,610
come up very very very similar very

191
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:06,560
stable and that's what you're looking

192
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,330
for were for a market ready product and

193
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,240
that's not often what you get when

194
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:13,310
you're buying seeds a lot of what is

195
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:15,050
fair I'll say that that's fair a lot of

196
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,389
what is available and even a lot of what

197
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:20,300
I am making and what is available for

198
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:24,620
myself Aref ones which means that they

199
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,960
have not been f2 which means yeah it's I

200
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:28,639
took a male of one strain and a female

201
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,589
of another and I put pollen on it and it

202
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,939
made seeds and I tested them plenty

203
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:33,649
before they were released there are a

204
00:07:31,939 --> 00:07:35,418
lot of seed companies that do that but

205
00:07:33,649 --> 00:07:37,598
that's what a lot of my stuff is but

206
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:40,098
guys like DJ shoes the market standard

207
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,649
that's kind of yeah that's how cage mean

208
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:46,490
genetics does it that sort of [ __ ] my

209
00:07:42,649 --> 00:07:49,129
head a 10 pack that's one of each strain

210
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,139
and it's like oh like her greenhouse

211
00:07:49,129 --> 00:07:52,819
will sell you well I've seen it from a

212
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,769
number of the major companies where

213
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,050
you'll get it in one form and I've seen

214
00:07:54,769 --> 00:07:59,209
it it's ten little plastic baggies right

215
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,550
here's one og so here's one Sour Diesel

216
00:07:59,209 --> 00:08:05,209
here's one Northern Lights yeah like I

217
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,098
get one seed of that I mean just a trial

218
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:09,709
and error with germination alone makes

219
00:08:07,098 --> 00:08:11,658
that silly yeah but when you know as

220
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:14,388
much as we do about like phenotypic

221
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:16,879
expression and plant stabilization and

222
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:19,610
that this is likely an f1 or maybe if

223
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,110
I'm lucky an f2 like god only knows what

224
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,330
I'm getting you know if I've only got

225
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:25,250
one C it'll make [ __ ] work well I've

226
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:28,038
seen people Bank on it like it's lemons

227
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,019
gunk that I have my lemons gunk that I

228
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:32,120
have came as a gift seed from somebody

229
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,189
else and I got one of them and it was a

230
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,538
gift from green from somebody else did

231
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,969
and they got it from green house seeds

232
00:08:35,538 --> 00:08:39,408
and they got one I've grown a few killer

233
00:08:37,969 --> 00:08:41,390
one offs and mud as well

234
00:08:39,408 --> 00:08:43,549
and that that one that I kept that I

235
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:46,490
have is what I have bred the lemon

236
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:49,429
Geoffrey and cascade from one of your

237
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,600
first big breeding projects had a plant

238
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:52,669
I can never remember if it was the

239
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,360
Bubblegum with a grapefruit some of the

240
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:55,549
best stuff

241
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,930
smoke to this day and it was just the

242
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:58,669
one off that we couldn't find again

243
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:00,379
right yeah I say sometimes if I don't

244
00:08:58,669 --> 00:09:02,389
like the way stuff grows or whatever it

245
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:04,639
is I remember it grew atrociously with

246
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:06,919
the flavor of it was just all the so up

247
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,480
my alley was the grapefruit yeah I

248
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,578
remember that one being a date I didn't

249
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,259
like the way it did its think plan I got

250
00:09:10,578 --> 00:09:13,669
you if I don't like way plant grows I'll

251
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:15,019
just get rid of it because like we're

252
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:17,179
saying I've got so many seeds when I

253
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:19,339
just run more seeds to replace that and

254
00:09:17,179 --> 00:09:21,019
have the best of the best you don't want

255
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,630
something that if you can find a 10 you

256
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:25,549
don't want a bunch of sevens around very

257
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:27,278
very true yeah all right so the breeding

258
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:30,949
project I am speaking of is

259
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:34,159
approximately 62 ish days tomorrow will

260
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:37,040
be tomorrow will be the start of week 10

261
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,990
so it's 63 days it's 9 weeks in which

262
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,909
means it's just about done I've been

263
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:43,100
taking out one I've taken out three I've

264
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:45,019
taken out four seeds now the fourth seed

265
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:47,740
looked completely ready so I'm letting

266
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:50,089
it ripen up and then tomorrow is Monday

267
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:52,009
hopefully if I get all of my work done

268
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,540
at a reasonable hour by the end of

269
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:57,289
Monday I may go in there and start

270
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:59,629
chopping down plants of the new arise f2

271
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:01,759
project I'm loving it

272
00:09:59,629 --> 00:10:03,049
I'm excited for it it's just a small run

273
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,720
it won't take me a lot of trim in the

274
00:10:03,049 --> 00:10:10,278
way I'll do it is I'm gonna cut down one

275
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,690
plant and then these ones uh yeah yeah

276
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,549
yeah the little time they're pretty

277
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:15,529
small plants yep so I'll cut them down

278
00:10:13,549 --> 00:10:18,078
take off all the big leaves hang them

279
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:20,600
upside down let them dry until they're

280
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:22,179
fairly fairly crispy basically and then

281
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,409
just cut off a branch hold it over

282
00:10:22,179 --> 00:10:26,448
either a Tupperware dish or a pie plate

283
00:10:24,409 --> 00:10:27,889
and crumble it up just like a just like

284
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:29,389
a great crispy when you're harvest and

285
00:10:27,889 --> 00:10:32,059
see ya just like you're gonna roll up

286
00:10:29,389 --> 00:10:33,439
old school weed and just crunch it up

287
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,750
and let the seeds fall out and then pull

288
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,130
out the seeds pull out the material we

289
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:38,899
mason roll some joints with the dried

290
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:40,250
material but then a lot of its gonna get

291
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:41,690
turned into concentrates will have some

292
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,879
BHO coming up here in just a little

293
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,410
while but then all upset the seeds aside

294
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:47,539
let them dry out real well get them nice

295
00:10:45,409 --> 00:10:48,799
and hard and then I will put them into

296
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:51,078
little packages I need to get some

297
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,269
packages from le containers calm and

298
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,439
then get those lined up get a few of

299
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:55,850
them into some packages and get them out

300
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,290
to my friends that test them out for me

301
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,480
and then I will grow a shit-ton it up

302
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:02,599
myself and I will see if the arize F

303
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,209
twos are worth growing worth making more

304
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,800
of or if I selected the wrong mail then

305
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,989
I'll go back and find another boy in

306
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,849
[ __ ] try again but since I've used

307
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,919
multiple females I'll keep all the

308
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,589
female separate keep the seeds separated

309
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:17,750
and I will run comparisons of batch a

310
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,339
batch B batch C and I will see which

311
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,110
ones I like better so that I could find

312
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:22,519
my breeders I'm gonna do a lot of

313
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:25,310
research and a lot of work and a lot of

314
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,110
look in before I even continue we funny

315
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,759
even think about making an f2 I want to

316
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,350
really see what the f are before I make

317
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:32,450
an f3 I wanna see what the f2 s really

318
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,889
really do so it's almost time to take

319
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:36,379
those down probably tomorrow night when

320
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,269
I get done doing all my work then I

321
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:39,620
would you guys know how they grow you

322
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:42,110
know I'll talk about that on the show so

323
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:43,759
anyone looking forward to it me too me

324
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,839

338
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:17,870

and fell down the stairs while I was

342

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:53,000
like my body would not regulate its

357
00:12:50,179 --> 00:12:54,078
temperature it was wintertime uh and I

358
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,820
was running around in just like a

359
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:56,809
t-shirt and everyone's in coats and [ __ ]

360
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,220
and they're looking at me like do kind

361
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:00,409
of drugs or you wanna look head injury

362
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,570
no drugs I'm just [ __ ] sweaty all the

363
00:13:00,409 --> 00:13:04,909
time now like it would not stop being

364
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,800
overheated but something that was also

365
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:08,539
funky was my vision my vision would get

366
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,729
wobbly sometimes like if I would watch

367
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:12,708
certain like animated [ __ ] or certain TV

368
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:13,909
shows filmed a certain way my vision

369
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,919
would get weird and I just have to quit

370
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:17,179
watching it certain video games and [ __ ]

371
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,828
with my head if I don't really play

372
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:20,669
video games but if I watch other people

373
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:23,789
play some games have messed with my head

374
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:25,229
ah nothing's really messed with me for a

375
00:13:23,789 --> 00:13:26,969
little while I was having dizzy spells a

376
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:28,019
little while for a little while but

377
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,470
everything's pretty much back to normal

378
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:33,329
I think I'm back on track from all that

379
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,710
until I recorded that episode at elevate

380
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:35,970
a couple of weeks ago if you guys listen

381
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,190
to the podcast I want to elevate and

382
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,350
recorded a show there is a rig there by

383
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:45,780
an artist named Matt Cameron no it's not

384
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:46,409
man yeah his name's Cameron Reed let me

385
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:47,759
correct myself

386
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,870
I think Matt Cameron is a drummer that I

387
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,580
watched a video from the other day but

388
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,740
the dude's name is Cameron Reed Cameron

389
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,930
Reed glass on Instagram this dude made a

390
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,820
rig and the work is called read a cello

391
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:58,620
already work is what they call it and

392
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,629
it's just clear glass with white lines

393
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,190
through it and it's [ __ ] beautiful so

394
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:04,710
I saw this rig and when I stared at the

395
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,860
rig it started moving it had kind of a

396
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:10,080
Christmas ornament glass kind of quality

397
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,850
to it if if that helps describe it for

398
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,190
the listeners it's trippy to my brain

399
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:15,930
dude it makes my brain do weird [ __ ]

400
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:17,520
when I look at it it looks like it's

401
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,379
moving all of those wines look like

402
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,069
they're spinning around like Tron it's

403
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:23,820
like wah wah and when I started

404
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,420
everybody kind of looked at me like I

405
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,710
was crazy

406
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:27,000
and I was like oh you gotta quit looking

407
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,030
at that like cuz you're the only one

408
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,740
seeing that okay I'm gonna walk away

409
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,689
from this but then I posted on Facebook

410
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:35,490
basically my experience is like I fell

411
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:37,620
in love with this rig unfortunately you

412
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:39,570
guys this rig is I looked at the price

413
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,649
tag from underneath because the price

414
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:42,240
tags on the bottom and the glut the

415
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:42,959
shelf it's sitting on his glass so I

416
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,330
could see through it

417
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:46,740
it's either twenty one hundred or twenty

418
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:49,139
four hundred dollars I couldn't read if

419
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,330
that was a one or a four ah that's not

420
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,100
in my budget to spend on a glass rig to

421
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,570
tell you the damn truth I would be

422
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,100
awesome to have I would just stare at it

423
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:57,990
and take dad's out of it and stare at it

424
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,909
some more so I mentioned this on

425
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:01,740
Facebook I posted up to Facebook and to

426
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:03,629
Instagram I pretty much told the same

427
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,190
story hit my head yeah my eyes were

428
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:06,809
[ __ ] up and then I saw this rig and I

429
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:08,610
was mesmerised in that I'm in love with

430
00:15:06,809 --> 00:15:11,639
it so I posted a picture of the rig and

431
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:15,899
the artist that made the rig contacted

432
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:18,539
me and sent me a sweet pendant he sent

433

492
00:17:39,369 --> 00:17:42,529
this podcast

493
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:43,970
holy screenshots here because I like to

494
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:45,769
screenshot the messages it makes it much

495
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,269
easier for me to find them it really

496
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:50,420
does we've got a really quick message

497
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:52,160
this one came from Instagram um usually

498
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,720
I don't see the names but this dude he's

499
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,519
from North Carolina and his name is

500
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:58,549
Carolina cannabis so follow him on

501
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,259
Instagram he says what's something I can

502
00:17:58,549 --> 00:18:02,419
use for food for plants beside by

503
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:04,430
besides buying nutrients in a bottle

504
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:06,289
growing outdoors in North Carolina only

505
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,330
a few weeks of flowering left

506
00:18:06,289 --> 00:18:11,750
surprisingly buds are decently fat but I

507
00:18:08,329 --> 00:18:13,220
know she's probably hungry for something

508
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,690
I'm gonna try to get this episode out to

509
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,730
you as soon as we can

510
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:21,950
because you need this information pretty

511
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:23,480
quickly pronto um you say only a few

512
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,039
weeks left of flowering so you need to

513
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,870
be can't do anything in a bottle so

514
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,869
you're looking for like around the house

515
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:35,779
but but then the grower in me says Jesse

516
00:18:34,339 --> 00:18:37,250
is on the coast right now having a good

517
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,259
time I think Jesse's in Portland is

518
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:47,960
where I think he is so boy shout out bro

519
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:49,849
hope you're having a good time yeah so

520
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,799
Mike Mike nailed what I thought most

521
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:53,509
people would say you want to use some

522
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,099
guano's you're gonna want to use some

523
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:57,559
alfalfa meal you're gonna want to use

524
00:18:55,099 --> 00:18:59,000
something like that but you've only got

525
00:18:57,559 --> 00:19:00,259
a couple of weeks left so you don't want

526
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,940
to pump a whole bunch of stuff into the

527
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,309
plants and if most of those organic

528
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:06,529
products are gonna take at least two

529
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:13,190
weeks to four weeks to closer to six or

530
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:16,039
eight yeah there's some good news though

531
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,570
net nature wise the plants supposed to

532
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:20,779
have used up most of what's around it by

533
00:19:17,569 --> 00:19:21,889
now yes like that's as intended so but

534
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:23,329
there are a couple of things that you

535
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:25,040
can do if you don't want to go buy

536
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:26,839
bottles you've only got a few weeks left

537
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,339
so keep in mind that you're gonna want

538
00:19:26,839 --> 00:19:30,109
to flush even outdoors you need to flush

539
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:31,730
your plants you need a time period where

540
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:32,929
they're not receiving any nutrients so

541
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,279
that they can start to get rid of the

542
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,860
[ __ ] that's stored up in them so that

543
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:40,129
your buds burn and taste and smell

544
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:40,490
perfectly at the right time so keep that

545
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,920
in mind

546
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:45,319
give yourself hopefully ten to 14 maybe

547
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,970
15 to 16 maybe 20 days I like to flush

548
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,619
for a long time well if you haven't been

549
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:50,240
feeding up to this point either you

550
00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:52,669
don't want to hit him with too much now

551
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,000
you'll shock down you probably if he

552
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:55,289
says he knows there

553
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,059
probably hungry for something and if he

554
00:19:55,289 --> 00:19:59,970
hasn't boosted them up they probably are

555
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:02,190
and what I would recommend if you want

556
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,049
to feed them something like I said

557
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,000
earlier some guano's would be cool some

558
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,649
stuff like that would be cool but some

559
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,720
comfrey would be nice maybe make up an

560
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:13,410
iced tea that's probably your best bet

561
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,920
make a tea um a tea with some worm

562
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:19,110
castings somehow falfa meal in there

563
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,970
maybe put a little tiny bit of molasses

564
00:20:19,109 --> 00:20:22,919
in there just to keep it moving and then

565
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,299
any sort of kelp meal or something make

566
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:26,310
a tea out of that and this is just

567
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:28,200
coming to me so I'm trying to go as

568
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,849
smoothly as I can here maybe put some

569
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,370
I'm not sure what all you are willing to

570
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:33,899
use either but kelp meal would

571
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:36,479
definitely help you get some bulk and

572
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,560
some flavor maybe put some fish Hydra

573
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,180
sleights in there that would help you

574
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:41,309
all with some nitrogen and that's a pop

575
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,250
if you make a tea like this brew it up

576
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:45,809
for just a couple of few days and if you

577
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:47,130
need instructions on making a tea send

578
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:48,389
me an email and we'll try to get Jesse

579
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,010
on here to help us with that but I'll

580
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:51,420
answer you you sent me this message on

581
00:20:50,009 --> 00:20:53,009
Instagram so send me a message on

582
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:54,289
Instagram and hopefully I can run you

583
00:20:53,009 --> 00:20:57,059
through making a tea it's really easy

584
00:20:54,289 --> 00:21:00,509
but make it tea feed the plants the tea

585
00:20:57,059 --> 00:21:02,759
if you can't make a tea then some basic

586
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:04,529
fish hydrous lates in a bottle I would

587
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:06,420
work for that put some water into a

588
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:07,799
five-gallon bucket put a little more

589
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:09,810
than what the label says a fish hide

590
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,970
relates in there mix it up real well put

591
00:21:09,809 --> 00:21:14,039
some molasses in there mix that up

592
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,509
and then maybe some kelp any sort of

593
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,220
kelp product that you can put in there

594
00:21:15,509 --> 00:21:18,599
liquid kelp would be more available but

595
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,549
that's a bottled product if you don't

596
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,889
want to do that I think a tea would be

597
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:25,230
your best way to go Jesse and I have

598
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:27,509
done episodes about making teas that is

599
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:28,529
a thing that's available if you don't

600
00:21:27,509 --> 00:21:30,119
want to search for that send me a

601
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,819
message I'll either find it for you or I

602
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:34,649
will reply to you on a delivery I was

603
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,529
just doing the math in my head this is

604
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:39,150
gonna come out um if this show doesn't

605
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:43,920
come out immediately

606
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:46,410
um he's he's only got three weeks from

607
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:49,110
when recording it at most of Gro time

608
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:51,090
left if he's on the East Coast if I've

609
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,349
got my numbers right my ass some of our

610
00:21:51,089 --> 00:21:54,949
friends in Colorado are actually

611
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:57,809
harvesting this music I started having

612
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:59,789
higher up in elevation than we are down

613
00:21:57,809 --> 00:22:02,250
here in Pueblo that are a little further

614
00:21:59,789 --> 00:22:03,329
up into the foothills harvest began last

615
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,669
week

616
00:22:03,329 --> 00:22:08,648
and I mean they're dipping below 50 at

617
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:10,749
night this just what's up the plants are

618
00:22:08,648 --> 00:22:12,998
done you should see him they're huge I

619
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:15,038
actually went to two different grows one

620
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:17,440
that was about 700 feet higher up in

621
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:20,679
elevation than the other and I went to

622
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,480
the higher one first buds were almost

623
00:22:20,679 --> 00:22:25,389
done they they were gonna give him three

624
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,669
more days at harvest I drove down the

625
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:29,798
road a few hundred feet and buds were

626
00:22:27,669 --> 00:22:31,749
three weeks from harvest Wow just a

627
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:39,579
little bit closer to the Sun yep in

628
00:22:31,749 --> 00:22:40,899
which change our side okay so we did we

629
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:42,970
both had to think about that yeah

630
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:45,638
because well the mounds are west and so

631
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:46,868
I had to quick do the direction I'm

632
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:48,069
going people like how do you always know

633
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:49,480
where you're going mountains are right

634
00:22:48,069 --> 00:22:54,519
over there all the time if you've been

635
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:55,868
in Colorado since Mike was talking for a

636
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:58,118
second I got a chance to write this down

637
00:22:55,868 --> 00:23:00,009
if you need to make a tea get yourself a

638
00:22:58,118 --> 00:23:01,569
five gallon bucket get a clean bucket go

639
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:02,079
to Lowe's pay a couple bucks get a clean

640
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:04,749
bucket

641
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,908
I'll get yourself go to the hydro store

642
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:08,980
or the fish store get some an air pump

643
00:23:06,909 --> 00:23:10,899
that pumps out quite a bit Eric it's

644
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:12,608
yourself one of those air stones put the

645
00:23:10,898 --> 00:23:15,548
air stone in the bucket where fill the

646
00:23:12,608 --> 00:23:16,898
bucket with water if you can put the air

647
00:23:15,548 --> 00:23:18,730
stone in there and get that air stone

648
00:23:16,898 --> 00:23:20,709
pumping that water with a lot of oxygen

649
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,659
for 24 hours before you do anything your

650
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:23,858
goal here is to get the chlorine out of

651
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:25,809
that water that's what you're trying to

652
00:23:23,858 --> 00:23:27,099
do so bubble that get the chlorine out

653
00:23:25,808 --> 00:23:29,710
the next day

654
00:23:27,099 --> 00:23:31,928
add some worm castings add some alfalfa

655
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,269
sprouts add some kelp meal and add a

656
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:37,239
little tiny bit of molasses let that

657
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:40,690
bubble for like 24 hours it's gonna get

658
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:43,840
foamy expected to get foamy it will foam

659
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,999
up like a beer and go everywhere if

660
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,439
you're not careful it may or may not it

661
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:49,179
depends on your witch's brew the

662
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,528
proteins in the fish hydro slates I

663
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,820
didn't write fish I dress let's put fish

664
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,460
hydro slates in there the proteins the

665
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:56,408
fish poo this smell out of this carp at

666
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:58,058
one time so just fair warning listeners

667
00:23:56,409 --> 00:23:59,200
be careful with your witch's brew does

668
00:23:58,058 --> 00:24:01,028
the first time you make it because

669
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,389
sometimes it foams up like a song yes

670
00:24:01,028 --> 00:24:05,769
what I would recommend this will make

671
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:06,908
enough so if you use this 5 gallon

672
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:09,429
bucket you could probably cut this in

673
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:10,720
half or if you're going outdoor you just

674
00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:12,460
put a little five-gallon bucket on there

675
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,808
if you want to but it's getting toward

676
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,558
the end of the season keep that in mind

677
00:24:13,808 --> 00:24:17,210
it's

678
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:19,038
huge so take take your five gallon

679
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:20,149
bucket pour the buck put the bubble fill

680
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:21,349
it with water put the bubble in there

681
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:23,089
bubble it long enough to get the

682
00:24:21,349 --> 00:24:25,730
chlorine off then you pour in the fish

683
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:26,990
Hydra sleights worm castings alfalfa

684
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:28,159
sprouts is that the right one is that

685
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:28,579
what I want to use I think that's what

686
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,528
you want

687
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:32,028
kelp meal and molasses pour those things

688
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:33,499
in there there are more things that you

689
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:35,298
could use you can use crab meal you can

690
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:37,308
bone use bone meal you can use fish meal

691
00:24:35,298 --> 00:24:39,440
if you want to those things are not all

692
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:41,240
necessary put that in there let that

693
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,919
[ __ ] stew around in that bubbles for

694
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,409
like 12 to 24 hours it's gonna make a

695
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,059
bunch of foam us do it in the garage if

696
00:24:45,409 --> 00:24:48,499
you have to do it somewhere it's easy to

697
00:24:47,058 --> 00:24:49,908
clean up door you're not worried about a

698
00:24:48,499 --> 00:24:52,490
bunch of foam if it does not fall up

699
00:24:49,909 --> 00:24:55,309
that does not mean it's bad let it

700
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:58,099
bubble up then go outside and pour it on

701
00:24:55,308 --> 00:25:00,528
your plants not on the plants zone and

702
00:24:58,099 --> 00:25:03,019
water your plants with it don't go near

703
00:25:00,528 --> 00:25:04,490
the stock go out because your roots that

704
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:06,019
eat the most and drink the most are the

705
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,519
ones that are on the outer perimeter of

706
00:25:06,019 --> 00:25:08,839
the plant not right there at the stock

707
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:10,009
the part of the stock is always gonna

708
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,138
have some moisture down there at the

709
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:13,308
bottom go on the outer edge that's where

710
00:25:12,138 --> 00:25:15,498
you're growing or it's are the plants

711
00:25:13,308 --> 00:25:17,148
are reaching out for stuff so keep go

712
00:25:15,499 --> 00:25:19,519
out there a little bit so your best bet

713
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:21,168
is to make a tea water with this tea and

714
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:23,210
then hopefully you'll see a little bit

715
00:25:21,169 --> 00:25:24,110
of boost in there the fish hydro slates

716
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,519
are gonna give you a little bit of

717
00:25:24,109 --> 00:25:27,888
nitrogen the worm castings are gonna

718
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:29,388
give you microbes and it's gonna help

719
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:30,798
everything the worm castings will

720
00:25:29,388 --> 00:25:32,719
provide a little tiny bit of nitrogen

721
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,308
but they'll also speed everything up the

722
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,169
alfalfa meal is going to give you

723
00:25:34,308 --> 00:25:38,359
nitrogen that's readily available to

724
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:40,700
kelp meal I just think that that makes

725
00:25:38,359 --> 00:25:42,558
everything stink it makes it smell

726
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:44,899
better it makes it taste better and it

727
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,308
adds tonight so organic growers one of

728
00:25:44,898 --> 00:25:48,319
the first thing that comes up is killed

729
00:25:46,308 --> 00:25:49,548
yeah the ocean products are always gonna

730
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,028
make your stuff taste better in my

731
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,519
opinion

732
00:25:50,028 --> 00:25:54,829
and then molasses molasses will actually

733
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:57,378
feed all of the worm casting microbes

734
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:59,569
and it will also feed your plants a

735
00:25:57,378 --> 00:26:00,829
little bit as well so that's what you

736
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,538
can do outdoors but also keep in mind

737
00:26:00,829 --> 00:26:04,308
bro it's time to start flushing so

738
00:26:02,538 --> 00:26:06,288
you're right at the end of your clock

739
00:26:04,308 --> 00:26:08,058
but and sorry we didn't get this

740
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:09,618

743
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,690

00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:33,000
basement and legislation question that

787
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,750
I've got I saw something on Facebook the

788
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,250
other day and I thought it was very

789
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:37,500
entertaining right after I did an

790
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:38,700
episode about trim machines on a recent

791
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,869
episode we talked about trim machines

792
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,850
and I kind of bashed the [ __ ] out of

793
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:43,169
them somebody said which trim machine to

794
00:27:41,849 --> 00:27:44,279
buy and I said don't buy a bunch of

795
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:46,050
[ __ ] scissors and get your friends

796
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,160
over basically what I told them cuz

797
00:27:46,049 --> 00:27:49,849
that's really what I think you should do

798
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:52,019
that's preach it brother

799
00:27:49,849 --> 00:27:53,819

808
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:17,400
memes trimmed rents are coming so a

809
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:18,990
helpful crop tober or upcoming crop

810
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,060
Tober helpful hints and this dude says

811
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,440
number one if you want to process your

812
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,190
trim into quality meds

813
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:29,279
please do not use a machine trimmer oils

814
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:32,250
from machine and the beaten trim lead to

815
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,019
unsightly slabs so he's saying that

816
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:36,000
there's oils actually in the trim

817
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:37,650
machine on the blades of the trim

818
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,169
machine on the metal parts of the trim

819
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,419
machine that

820
00:28:38,169 --> 00:28:45,489
it's got to be looking so firmer I have

821
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:48,070
ever used yep so those oils will end up

822
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:49,450
on your trim and and that beaten-up trim

823
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:52,808
like I said before it turns into

824
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:54,609
basically mulch and that when the trim

825
00:28:52,808 --> 00:28:55,868
is cut into so many pieces it's um when

826
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,579
you cut it with scissors you cut it one

827
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:59,678
time you cut that leaf off the plant

828
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:01,569
I mean maybe three or four I mean it

829
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,249
must but you're not you can like you

830
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:04,898
know you're not turning it into pet

831
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:06,759
you're not lawnmower yeah this true

832
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:08,558
machine is hitting it to picture and

833
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:11,200
just mulching all your little pieces and

834
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,028
that leaves that many spots for moisture

835
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,340
that much surface area for moisture and

836
00:29:13,028 --> 00:29:17,169
that many spots for chlorophyll to come

837
00:29:15,339 --> 00:29:22,778
out you want you want to hit it with

838
00:29:17,169 --> 00:29:24,700
scissors but so then I mean it's it's

839
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:26,319
not good it does juice it and then that

840
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,298
juice ends up in your hash and it tastes

841
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:29,589
like [ __ ] and looks like [ __ ] and then

842
00:29:28,298 --> 00:29:32,378
number two he says if you plan to

843
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:36,038
process the nug please flush correctly

844
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:39,488
and no spring or pesticides whatsoever

845
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:42,940
these chemicals and nutrients tend to

846
00:29:39,489 --> 00:29:45,999
leach into concentration and lead to

847
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:48,429
unsightly slabs so he's saying flush

848
00:29:45,999 --> 00:29:50,980
properly flush correctly he's using

849
00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:52,629
slightly and there's a lot implied there

850
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,960
especially in a market like Colorado's

851
00:29:52,628 --> 00:29:57,849
yes if you've sprayed your plants with

852
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,278
just about anything while they're in

853
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:02,168
flower and it's processed into a

854
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:04,200
concentrate that concentrates not gonna

855
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:06,309
pass testing and make it onto the market

856
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,720
most of the people he's talking about I

857
00:30:06,308 --> 00:30:16,868
think he's talking about these black

858
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:18,278
market street growers right I had no

859
00:30:16,868 --> 00:30:19,720
spring but absolutely if you're gonna

860
00:30:18,278 --> 00:30:21,460
make concentrates think about this you

861
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,440
guys you're gonna spray some [ __ ] okay

862
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:25,358
you're spraying what's what does

863
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,830
everybody use in like a Xamax is

864
00:30:25,358 --> 00:30:28,628
probably one of the most popular things

865
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:30,009
when I worked in the dispensary our area

866
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:31,689
every I've toured a couple of

867
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:33,339
dispensaries and all of them have a

868
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,109
Xamax on the shelf that's what like the

869
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:36,488
most common spray and we're gonna talk

870
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:39,099
about something that has a max is gonna

871
00:30:36,489 --> 00:30:41,139
do in a future episode that I've got

872
00:30:39,099 --> 00:30:42,779
written down but everyone's got the azza

873
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:44,609
max

874
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,710
I'm sure now you spray as it's kind of

875
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:48,059
waxy it's kind of oily you spray as max

876
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,950
onto your plants it like probably I

877
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:51,509
don't know week two week three that

878
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:53,460
shits in the middle of your buds as your

879
00:30:51,509 --> 00:30:55,079
bud grows around it that waxy oily

880
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,180
concentration is still there and the

881
00:30:55,079 --> 00:31:00,179
buds just grow around it and it's still

882
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:01,500
inside there then the buds dry and he

883
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,090
grind it up and you run it through an

884
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,579
extraction machine to wash it off

885
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:06,449
you can actually see that little layer

886
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:08,069
of a Xamax

887
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,539
right on top of your concentrate

888
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:11,639
sometimes I've seen it I've seen it

889
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:13,559
float to the top I have [ __ ] tasted

890
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,630
it like I've been in rooms that have

891
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,649
chives spring I've I didn't know any

892
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:18,090
better when I started growing but

893
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,259
remember back in the day when we did not

894
00:31:18,089 --> 00:31:20,909
know any better who would spray whatever

895
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:23,430
the [ __ ] the dudes the Hydra I've got

896
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:24,930
this problem spray this okay and then

897
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:26,970
you read five years later like this

898
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,799
causes immediate blindness if you touch

899
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,799
it like oh [ __ ] I used to spray that

900
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:36,720
like I've sprayed these things I've also

901
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:39,269
smelled them I did because other

902
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,210
people's products neem oil is a big one

903
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:44,730
it's God it's something a lot of the

904
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:46,440
organic or the natural people who like

905
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:49,860
to use at one point or another

906
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,289
if you flour my face puckered out a

907
00:31:49,859 --> 00:31:54,479
little when you submitting its everybody

908
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:56,789
that the consumes cannabis at one point

909
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,640
or another has hit a bowl and all they

910
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:02,009
tasted for the next hour was neem they

911
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,020
might not have known what it was but

912
00:32:02,009 --> 00:32:05,690
it's I mean that's incredibly common

913
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,680
just quit spray and [ __ ] that's in Flour

914

915
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:12,630
manjo environment yeah so uh flushed

correctly and don't spray [ __ ] on

917
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,030
your plants if you're trying to make

918
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,259
concentrates out of it you know that's a

919
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,210
general rule if you're trying if you're

920
00:32:16,259 --> 00:32:19,470
going to use if you're making medicine

921
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,590
or something you want other people to

922
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:24,900
consume flush properly and don't spray

923
00:32:22,589 --> 00:32:27,089
[ __ ] on your plants number three take

924

care cleaning and basic hygiene of the

927
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:36,120
plant and material are critical for

928
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:38,490
quality meds you guys one thing that I

929
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:40,919
don't see enough of is people wearing

930
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,109
nitrile or rubber gloves where are some

931
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:45,180
gloves you don't want all your finger

932
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:46,559
skin in my concentrates

933
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,690
or on my flowers when you're trimming

934
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,159
that [ __ ] is sticky where are some

935
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:51,900
gloves please I don't want to smoke your

936
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:54,029

937
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:57,720
love you I do not want to smoke your

938
00:32:54,029 --> 00:32:59,490
[ __ ] hands also take care of stuff

939
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:01,319
just cuz it's gonna get turned into hash

940
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:03,089
doesn't mean you can trim your trim your

941
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,409
leaves and do a tarp on the floor and

942
00:33:03,089 --> 00:33:06,029
have the whole crew walk on them during

943
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:08,040
trim time and then sweep them up and

944
00:33:06,029 --> 00:33:09,599
make a shadow that's [ __ ] gross trim

945
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:11,430
that into a container take care of it

946
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,509
that's somebody's medicine you may make

947
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:14,220
edibles out of it

948
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:15,569
think about like looking at all as

949
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,980
something that you're going to put into

950
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:18,269
your mouth and if you're one of them

951
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,599
dirty [ __ ] people to Lygia off the

952
00:33:18,269 --> 00:33:20,220
floor

953
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:22,109
look at it is something that a princess

954
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,039
has to put in their mouth because it's

955
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:27,750
got to be clean products also cure your

956
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:30,269
[ __ ] just cuz you're gonna blast it I

957
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:31,859
understand live resin let's get it on

958
00:33:30,269 --> 00:33:35,000
well there was that weird thing at the

959
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:38,129
beginning of the butane hash days where

960
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,720
you made BHO with this stuff you

961
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,550
couldn't use the stuff that was trashed

962
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,319
right I remember people saying some

963
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:45,089
crazy [ __ ] like oh that's moldy just

964
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:49,919
blast powdery mildew doesn't exist

965
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:53,129
anymore since we have pho right but if

966
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:55,500
you want to make good concentrates you

967
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,730
really have to produce bud that's ready

968
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,799
to go on a store shelf

969
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,900
yes and then make concentrates from that

970
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,779
out of that bomb and I see so many

971
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:05,490
people that [ __ ] up that last step it's

972
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:07,139
like buying a Lamborghini and Wrekin it

973
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,079
like in the light you're not even off

974
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,940
the lot yet any record if you spent nine

975
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,079
weeks flowering and then you just spend

976
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:16,110
a week harvesting and I'm just gonna

977
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:18,000
[ __ ] it up yeah you continue to roll up

978
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:20,130
the trash once you flush that plant you

979
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,289
can cut it down and knock off most of

980
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:23,640
the big leaves and if you plan on

981
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:26,009
blasting the entire plant

982
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,210
hang it up let it excuse me amber pent

983
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,280
up some dr. pepper hang it upside down

984
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:30,659
let it dry and cure cut it off the

985
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,040
sticks take the sticks out of there and

986
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,200
then you've pretty much got blasted bull

987
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:36,119
material you can't really [ __ ] that up

988
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:38,279
so just take care of it keep it clean

989
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:40,230
wear gloves you wouldn't believe some of

990
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:44,730
the stuff that I have seen and heard of

991
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:46,469
coming in from like grows coming into

992
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:50,030
extraction labs people have found

993
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:53,189
cigarette butts scissors razor blades

994
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:55,530
Forks from launch like all kinds of [ __ ]

995
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:57,539
in the material it was so bad

996
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,280
two years ago when we started

997
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:02,429
implementing lab testing that a number

998
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,110
of extract companies just went out and

999
00:35:02,429 --> 00:35:05,549
bought the hundred thousand or two

1000
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:08,730
hundred to three hundred thousand pieces

1001
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:11,369
of equipment so that they could in-house

1002
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,838
test [ __ ] as it came in because it was

1003
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:14,010
some of the stuff they were processing

1004
00:35:12,838 --> 00:35:17,070
was so nasty

1005
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:19,170
it was [ __ ] up their machines and so

1006
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:21,150
they processed the dude for the first

1007
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,250
guy or the material for the first guy in

1008
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:25,950
the morning it dirties up the machine

1009
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:28,139
everybody else that gets run that day is

1010
00:35:25,949 --> 00:35:29,960
taking home a piece of that trash that

1011
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:32,400
came through in just a little residual

1012
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,050
sink so now they're testing all before

1013
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,400
it goes into the end of their

1014
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,980
machineries so that none of that's

1015
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,180
possible anymore

1016
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,608
that's disgusting thinking about

1017
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:43,078
somebody another farm running some stuff

1018
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:44,608
and this is mazza max in there and then

1019
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:46,260
my farm run on this clean organic

1020
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:48,449
product in there and just mixing it up

1021
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:50,190
and now I've got your as a max residuals

1022
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:52,919
that's gonna grow so completely that's

1023
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:55,440
when I see stuff like black market stuff

1024
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:57,269
whether like just got some awesome SAP

1025
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,230
and you look at it and it's black and

1026
00:35:57,269 --> 00:36:04,019
soupy and it god only knows what's in it

1027
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:05,039
I mean we're so lucky here that we've

1028
00:36:04,019 --> 00:36:06,900
got lab tests

1029
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,088
so let's some regulation that we can get

1030
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:11,400
away from that I wish it was more

1031
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:13,318
available to the recreational grower lab

1032
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,510
testing isn't as available but in the

1033
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:17,759
future it will be yep that's one of the

1034
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:19,980
things that we're I'm gonna hit coming

1035
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,290
up in this last question all right so to

1036
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,699
speak perfect timing we're 36 minutes

1037
00:36:22,289 --> 00:36:25,710
into this podcast and we have not gotten

1038
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:27,779
to the main topics so ah

1039
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,880
shout out to soda pop for the cool of

1040
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,269
Facebook post at the end heat hashtag

1041
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:34,710
that the Machine knows the truth so

1042
00:36:33,269 --> 00:36:36,389
supports my claims that trim machines

1043
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:38,639
suck don't use a trim machine take care

1044
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:40,650
of your plants and take care of the trim

1045
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,389
and ugh if you plan to make x-ray she's

1046
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:44,099
good luck out there this crop Tober

1047
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:48,480
season i hope your plants made it I hope

1048
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:50,789
but none of them got stolen I hope yeah

1049
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,409
it's that time of year we call it crops

1050
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:58,409
over we also call it holy season right

1051
00:36:55,409 --> 00:37:00,118
now yeah Ripper season I've seen some

1052
00:36:58,409 --> 00:37:02,129
social media stuff already if they took

1053
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,619
your [ __ ] they're not your homie well

1054
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:07,140
right now it's it's getting close to

1055
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,579
harvest if you're growing outdoors in

1056
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:10,578
any way shape or form it's smelling

1057
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:19,440
you're freaking out just take some deep

1058
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:20,669
breaths relax your [ __ ] getting stolen

1059
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,159
is not the worst thing that can happen

1060
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,200
to you

1061
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:24,578
if you did take your [ __ ] I hope they

1062
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:26,199
left part of it for you I hope they were

1063
00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:29,440
a cool theif and if he had four plants I

1064
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:30,879
hope they only took one it's it's just

1065
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,079
unfortunate that we still have to deal

1066
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:33,910
with this yes

1067
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,140
all right so I wish we could just go

1068
00:37:33,909 --> 00:37:36,429
outside nobody comes to steal the

1069
00:37:35,139 --> 00:37:37,778
tomatoes in the backyard why are they

1070
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:39,639
stealing cannabis when cannabis is

1071
00:37:37,778 --> 00:37:41,739
somebody's cancer medicine you know that

1072
00:37:39,639 --> 00:37:44,259
shitty it's just worth so much in

1073
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:46,298
certain places it's I mean it's like

1074
00:37:44,259 --> 00:37:48,309
leaving your your bank account in the

1075
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,630
backyard at some place yeah nobody

1076
00:37:48,309 --> 00:37:52,028
ballistas to the show would steal any

1077
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:54,160
plants well let's jump into this email

1078
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:56,650
that I got this email the student signed

1079
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,149
his name dabbe Smiths and he says hey

1080
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,028
what's up Rasta Jeff huge fan of the

1081
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:03,009
podcast as I've said before he said I

1082
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:05,349
had a few questions I thought could be a

1083
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:07,059
podcast I'm in Michigan and we just

1084
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,190
passed three bills pushing us into a

1085
00:38:07,059 --> 00:38:11,710
seed to sale system based on Colorado

1086
00:38:09,190 --> 00:38:13,420
system I'm gonna quickly talk about that

1087
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:15,670
in Colorado we have a seed to sale

1088
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:17,619
system everything that is for sale

1089
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:20,920
recreational or medically in the state

1090
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:24,250
of Colorado has been grown from seed or

1091
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,009
a clone underneath a Colorado marijuana

1092
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:28,900
Enforcement Division camera inside of a

1093
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:31,119
Colorado marijuana Enforcement Division

1094
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,490
regulated facility also known as an

1095
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,588
optional premises cultivation facility

1096
00:38:33,489 --> 00:38:37,629
everything that happens in there every

1097
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:39,788
square [ __ ] inch of this facility is

1098
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,700
on camera they have it set up to where

1099
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:44,589
if you can be in that building and there

1100
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:46,179
is a spot where you're not on camera you

1101
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,858
have to put another camera if you can

1102
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:49,750
hide around this little partition or

1103
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:51,308
behind this door they want another

1104
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,829
camera in there so that you cannot hide

1105
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:55,630
anywhere so everything that happens in

1106
00:38:53,829 --> 00:38:57,970
there is on camera which that's where

1107
00:38:55,630 --> 00:39:00,430
the seed part starts if you grow a seed

1108
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:03,639
it's on camera if you grow a clone it is

1109
00:39:00,429 --> 00:39:05,169
on camera it is a given an RFID tag we

1110
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:06,818
call those a med tag you have to tag

1111
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,430
every single plant and put it into a

1112
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:10,989
system known as metric then they are

1113
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:12,278
tagged they are accounted for they are

1114
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:15,489
part of your plant count that you're

1115
00:39:12,278 --> 00:39:17,018
allowed to have um when a regular walks

1116
00:39:15,489 --> 00:39:19,358
into a room they've got a tool they can

1117
00:39:17,018 --> 00:39:20,858
just hold up and press the button and it

1118
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,018
tells them exactly how many plants are

1119
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:25,210
in that room yes because of the RFID on

1120
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:28,389
those plant tags I mean everything is

1121
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:30,519
tracked out ridiculously ridiculously so

1122
00:39:28,389 --> 00:39:32,048
as those plants grow there they are now

1123
00:39:30,518 --> 00:39:34,268
cloned in my computer system if they

1124
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:35,159
when I put them into bigger pots now

1125
00:39:34,268 --> 00:39:37,049
they have to be

1126
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:39,269
in two veg if I move them to another

1127
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,010
room they have to be marked in this

1128
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,630
little tab on the computer what room

1129
00:39:41,010 --> 00:39:45,060
they move into when I move them into

1130
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:46,740
flower I have to move them I have to

1131
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:48,539
change their room I have to change their

1132
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,039
status and I have to mark that all the

1133
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:52,590
tags are still the same numbers

1134
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:54,779
everything stays on camera when it's

1135
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:57,510
harvested all of the trimmers are in a

1136
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,340
room guess what they're all on camera

1137
00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:01,950
everything is done on camera it's

1138
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,289
trimmed the trim is kept in one area if

1139
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:06,179
the trash is weighed all of the trash is

1140
00:40:04,289 --> 00:40:08,039
weighed before it's thrown away so that

1141
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:09,599
we know and everything is weighed I cut

1142
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:11,820
down the plant put it on a scale hand it

1143
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,099
to the trimmers they separate buds and

1144
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,660
sticks and trim we weigh the buds we

1145
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:17,369
weigh the trim we weigh the trash we

1146
00:40:15,659 --> 00:40:20,069
throw the trash away the trash is

1147
00:40:17,369 --> 00:40:21,509
documented in the marijuana Enforcement

1148
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,539
Division computer which is known as

1149
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:28,020
metric so everything is on camera then

1150
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:29,940
it is put into specific weight packages

1151
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,530
the packages are documented in a

1152
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:35,340
computer with the tag number on it that

1153
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:37,800
tag again has an RFID code on it then

1154
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:40,800
they are put into what's called a

1155
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,570
manifest a transfer manifest then that

1156
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,360
transfer manifest has the vehicle

1157
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:47,670
operators name driver's license number

1158
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,590
license plate number vehicle make model

1159
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,619
description then you have to type in the

1160
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:54,300
exact route that you are traveling

1161
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:56,190
leaving this street turning left on this

1162
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,840
street right onto this street to the

1163
00:40:56,190 --> 00:41:00,090
destination then once you get there it

1164
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:01,800
is unpacked and checked on camera by the

1165
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:04,110
dispensary that it's taken to then it's

1166
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,850
put on a shelf all under camera then it

1167
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:09,210
is sold all under this day yes

1168
00:41:05,849 --> 00:41:11,880
everything is recorded and covered and

1169
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:14,369
there's absolutely no room for leakage

1170
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,559
the only time that anything could happen

1171
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:18,299
is in a vehicle but if you're following

1172
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,009
marijuana enforcement division rules

1173
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,530
every package that leaves the growth

1174
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:25,800
facility is vacuum sealed in a vacuum

1175
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:27,210
bag with a marijuana Enforcement

1176
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,160
Division sticker on it that has a

1177
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,230
specific weight written on it with a

1178
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:33,690
stream name on it and then that is also

1179
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:36,539
on a paper that matches that tag number

1180
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,710
that has the corresponding X I can't

1181
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:39,750
even tell you how many hundreds of

1182
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:42,960
shipments in my day and not one of them

1183
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:44,159
was off by anything ever right yeah well

1184
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,510
you can't if they're in those vacuum

1185
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:46,440
sealed bags and I open it in the car

1186
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,810
while I'm driving there's no way for

1187
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,880
this is laser night

1188
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:52,500
yeah so that's that's and that's the

1189
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,880
only opportunity really and it's not

1190
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,019
gonna happen nobody's gonna get away

1191
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,140
with it you're gonna get caught if you

1192
00:41:55,019 --> 00:42:00,269
do that stupid [ __ ] highly highly highly

1193
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:04,739
highly regulated is what we're gonna get

1194
00:42:00,269 --> 00:42:06,509
yes now that was one of the three bills

1195
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:08,339
they just passed is a seed to sale

1196
00:42:06,510 --> 00:42:11,010
regulatory assist and it works it

1197
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,539
actually works so this it sounds

1198
00:42:11,010 --> 00:42:14,670
stringent and it sounds ridiculous but

1199
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:16,320
when we have problems like we've

1200
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,789
recently talked about on the show there

1201
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,320
have been batches of concentrates that

1202
00:42:17,789 --> 00:42:20,820
have been made with flowers that were

1203
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,880
sprayed with pesticides that were not

1204
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:26,340
allowed since each plant was tracked and

1205
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:28,500
when we apply a pesticide we write down

1206
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,289
every tag number that that pesticide is

1207
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:34,590
applied to or a foliar spray or any type

1208
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:37,619
of everything that happens to them so

1209
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:39,170
they could see that everything grown in

1210
00:42:37,619 --> 00:42:41,609
facility number four zero three

1211
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:43,889
extracted by extraction company four

1212
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:45,809
zero two and there's be dashes at the

1213
00:42:43,889 --> 00:42:48,719
end of those everything from that batch

1214
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:50,519
was contaminated at plant tag number one

1215
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:53,069
thousand six five five five through

1216
00:42:50,519 --> 00:42:55,170
1,000 in the stage whatever releases the

1217
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:57,330
list retailers check the serial numbers

1218
00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:00,150
on their product and you know instantly

1219
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:03,480
if you're carrying some tainted products

1220
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:07,380
campus or hash or edibles or topical

1221
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:10,349
defense we'll also you can follow all of

1222
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,119
it from or agenda to retail and back so

1223
00:43:10,349 --> 00:43:15,779
it's absolutely helpful even though it

1224
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:18,779
seems really weird it seems you know

1225
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,340
once it took me a couple of months of

1226
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,990
working with but after like a month or

1227
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:23,850
two of doing metric every single day I

1228
00:43:21,989 --> 00:43:26,099
was like this is easy it's just what you

1229
00:43:23,849 --> 00:43:27,690
do it becomes part of your routine no

1230
00:43:26,099 --> 00:43:29,670
you just treat your workday like chess

1231
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:32,190
moves yeah and as soon as you accept

1232
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,960
that you're good to go well I would make

1233
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:35,639
notes on a little piece of paper of

1234
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:36,809
things that I needed to do in metric as

1235
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,309
I did it and then I would go to the

1236
00:43:36,809 --> 00:43:39,779
office and just catch up metric right

1237
00:43:38,309 --> 00:43:41,130
before lunch and then go back and catch

1238
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,900
up metric right before I leave at the

1239
00:43:41,130 --> 00:43:44,220
end of the day or when it got down to

1240
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:46,950
cutting clones and doing things that

1241
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:48,239
needed a lot of metric attention I had a

1242
00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:50,159
little cart and I would just take my

1243
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,329
macbook to work and sign into metric

1244
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,769
right there and just do it on the card

1245
00:43:51,329 --> 00:43:54,809
it was it was second nature by the time

1246
00:43:52,769 --> 00:43:56,309
I was done there so the seed to sale

1247
00:43:54,809 --> 00:43:58,079
system is definitely helpful I think

1248
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:59,159
it's gonna work I'm gonna continue with

1249
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,799
the email because this is gonna be a

1250
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:02,489
long damn podcast if I don't he said

1251
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,010
mission

1252
00:44:02,489 --> 00:44:06,509
we passed three bills pushing us into a

1253
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:08,790
seat of sale system based on Colorado

1254
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:11,940
system I was wondering if you and white

1255
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:13,619
Mike could touch on the subject like how

1256
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,289
do I go about finding out information

1257
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:18,450
from the city about how many license

1258
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:20,639
facilities they will allow and then he

1259
00:44:18,449 --> 00:44:22,169
also says what's the biggest hurdle

1260
00:44:20,639 --> 00:44:23,789
going from a basement grow to a

1261
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:25,920
warehouse which i think is more directed

1262
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:27,059
at me then he continues to say I know

1263
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,980
you have recently made the switch from

1264
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,320
soil to cocoa and any advice on that

1265
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,510
transition I am planning on running veg

1266
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,490
bloom and I'm already in a basement but

1267
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:37,680
do you add anything else to the wine as

1268
00:44:35,489 --> 00:44:39,539
well what are some things you didn't

1269
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,669
expect going to such a large scale and

1270
00:44:39,539 --> 00:44:44,279
any other advice you may think one would

1271
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,900
need to know about taking a leap into

1272
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,880
the big leagues thanks again for such a

1273
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:52,559
great podcast I hope you can answer some

1274
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:54,119
questions for me and other other

1275
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:55,980
questions others I'm not sure how you

1276
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,170
wanted to end that but yes will answer

1277
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,639
your question bro all that might go with

1278
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:01,650
the first part I've got a lot of stuff

1279
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:08,699
to say first of all lawyer up if you're

1280
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:10,289
gonna give me the canvas not [ __ ]

1281
00:45:08,699 --> 00:45:11,608
with you and then get a lawyer to keep

1282
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:12,750
an eye on your accountant you know get

1283
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:13,799
to your lawyers in an accountant to make

1284
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:15,239
sure they're all [ __ ] keeping an eye

1285
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,970
on each other that's that's my first bit

1286
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:19,919
of emphasis that should really be like

1287
00:45:17,969 --> 00:45:24,089
the first half of like every business

1288
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,139
school 101 class yes lawyer and don't

1289
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:26,880
let it be too good a friends make

1290
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,868
hopefully your lawyer in your accountant

1291
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,010
don't seem like they like each other

1292
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:30,329
because then they can't team up on you

1293
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,680
um they don't you don't want them

1294
00:45:30,329 --> 00:45:32,969
embezzling from you just keep them

1295
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,289
watching each other I think he's

1296
00:45:32,969 --> 00:45:35,699
stealing from you I think he's stealing

1297
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:39,480
from you just keep him like that people

1298
00:45:35,699 --> 00:45:41,129
watch it so Mike the first question how

1299
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:43,139
do we go about finding out information

1300
00:45:41,130 --> 00:45:47,010
from the cities how many license

1301
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:49,440
facilities they will allow before we

1302
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:51,600
before we hit record we I jumped online

1303
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,400
we jumped online and checked out some of

1304
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:59,190
the stuff about your law in Michigan

1305
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,150
local control is part of it and so and

1306
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,858
this is from the cannabis

1307
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:05,510
surprise-surprise reported here in

1308
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:08,190
Colorado but according to the cannabis

1309
00:46:05,510 --> 00:46:11,730
the local control part in Michigan's law

1310
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,980
is growers processors shippers testing

1311
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:15,980
facilities and dist

1312
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,980
dispensaries

1313
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,239
could not obtain a state license unless

1314
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,210
their local government adopts an

1315
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:26,069
authorizing ordinance municipalities

1316
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,079
could cap the number of licenses within

1317
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:30,090
their borders and assess no more than a

1318
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,579
five thousand dollar fee per license a

1319
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:34,559
state board would charge application and

1320
00:46:32,579 --> 00:46:36,150
renewal fees to cover costs including

1321
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,159
for substance abuse programs in law

1322
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:41,250
enforcement so basically what that means

1323
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:43,349
is you're gonna need two licenses to

1324
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,969
open any sort of marijuana business in

1325
00:46:43,349 --> 00:46:46,619
Michigan and now we're talking about

1326
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,569
medical marijuana businesses here

1327
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:53,250
recreational is not quite legal in

1328
00:46:48,570 --> 00:46:56,340
Michigan yet I don't think so

1329
00:46:53,250 --> 00:46:58,289
if your local area does not create some

1330
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:00,660
sort of licensing process for these

1331
00:46:58,289 --> 00:47:03,389
businesses you can't get a state license

1332
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:05,909
to operate in that area so how do you

1333
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:10,769
find out what those rules are in your

1334
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:14,119
area the first step is head to your

1335
00:47:10,769 --> 00:47:17,610
local Planning and Zoning hop online

1336
00:47:14,119 --> 00:47:20,250
spend a few seconds with Google figure

1337
00:47:17,610 --> 00:47:23,309
out where you're planning the Zoning

1338
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:25,050
Department is and while you're there you

1339
00:47:23,309 --> 00:47:27,779
can want to look up City Council or

1340
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:30,000
county commissioner whichever sort of

1341
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:33,960
governing body decides the land use

1342
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,900
rules for your area for example here in

1343
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:38,340
Pueblo Colorado in the city we have a

1344
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,430
city council who makes those decisions

1345
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:43,500
and then in the county of Pueblo we have

1346
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:45,960
a Board of County Commissioners these

1347
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,550
people are totally separate and have

1348
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,170
totally different rules for marijuana

1349
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:51,690
businesses because they're totally

1350
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:53,970
separate governmental entities I assume

1351
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:56,720
it's very similar in Michigan so first

1352
00:47:53,969 --> 00:47:59,339
step is figure out which municipality

1353
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:02,519
city county whatever you want to have

1354
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:04,260
your marijuana businesses in head down

1355
00:48:02,519 --> 00:48:07,980
to planning and zoning or City Council

1356
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:10,910
or whatever and ask is is your first

1357
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:13,829
step and because this is brand new

1358
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:15,329
you're likely to get to be met with a

1359
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:18,090
confused look which means you've got

1360
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:21,239
some work ahead of you if you're lucky

1361
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:24,000
the area you're in has favorable

1362
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:27,059
government officials who saw this coming

1363
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,070
and have already crafted some sort of

1364
00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:32,940
land-use code

1365
00:48:29,070 --> 00:48:34,680
I'm specifying which zoning designations

1366
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:38,190
the property for these businesses have

1367
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:40,669
to carry distances from schools

1368
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:43,289
libraries churches those kinds of rules

1369
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,360
if they haven't gotten that far yet

1370
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:47,099
you're looking at a year or more of

1371
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:49,890
public hearings while these rules get

1372
00:48:47,099 --> 00:48:52,739
hashed out so like I said you've got

1373
00:48:49,889 --> 00:48:55,049
some work ahead of you this is where I

1374
00:48:52,739 --> 00:48:56,789
sort of got my activist credentials in

1375
00:48:55,050 --> 00:49:01,170
pueblo was helping pueblos do all of

1376
00:48:56,789 --> 00:49:03,659
this so when you've checked with

1377
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:05,970
Planning and Zoning to see a if your

1378
00:49:03,659 --> 00:49:08,250
area has these rules yet and if not how

1379
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:09,839
they're being created the next thing to

1380
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:13,579
do is get yourself involved in that

1381
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:15,720
conversation it's really easy to do

1382
00:49:13,579 --> 00:49:19,019
especially as these rules are being

1383
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:21,000
crafted whatever governmental agencies

1384
00:49:19,019 --> 00:49:22,679
crafting this rules will take a lot of

1385
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,780
public comment so you get the

1386
00:49:22,679 --> 00:49:27,059
community's input how far they want them

1387
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:30,120
from schools how high the licensing fees

1388
00:49:27,059 --> 00:49:31,860
should be if they want to add any sort

1389
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:33,690
of other rules and regulations for

1390
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,670
example there's an area in Colorado that

1391
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:38,400
requires marijuana businesses to be a

1392
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:39,630
hundred percent energy neutral which

1393
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,019
means they can't consume electricity

1394
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:44,460
they don't also generate wrap your head

1395
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:47,699
around that one in a county that doesn't

1396
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,340
allow outdoor growing but get involved

1397
00:49:47,699 --> 00:49:55,739
with these in this conversation now and

1398
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:58,050
that way you can help nudge or guide the

1399
00:49:55,739 --> 00:50:03,029
regulator's as they write the rules for

1400
00:49:58,050 --> 00:50:06,350
your area if you're smart you'll help

1401
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:08,820
them steer clear of business number caps

1402
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:10,559
and things like that that's really

1403
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:12,720
really really bad for business

1404
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,170
it just creates monopolies right it

1405
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:18,629
immediately creates a monopoly it forces

1406
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:21,269
the local municipality to to do a bunch

1407
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:23,460
of obnoxious things like having a

1408
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:26,130
license lottery and some sort of review

1409
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:29,610
process for applicants that's

1410
00:50:26,130 --> 00:50:32,550
additionally unnecessary I mean it

1411
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:35,160
creates a real legislative and practical

1412
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:38,010
nightmare for the the government agency

1413
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:40,319
trying to do it and yet in Colorado they

1414
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:42,870
continue to do it all over and over and

1415
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:45,269
over again but just give

1416
00:50:42,869 --> 00:50:49,589
all that this conversation now and now

1417
00:50:45,269 --> 00:50:51,989
with in all likelihood you'll be able to

1418
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:54,030
steer whatever local government agency

1419
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:55,769
that's writing these rules into crafting

1420
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:58,350
smart rules for your agencies so that

1421
00:50:55,769 --> 00:51:00,119
you're not looking at huge licensing

1422
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:03,569
fees I like that they have a cap in the

1423
00:51:00,119 --> 00:51:05,909
state rules at five grand I've seen it

1424
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:08,700
as high as 50 here in counties and

1425
00:51:05,909 --> 00:51:10,949
cities this state only charges five or

1426
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:12,809
seven or ten depending on the size of

1427
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:15,589
your license but I've seen individual

1428
00:51:12,809 --> 00:51:17,730
counties charge much much more than that

1429
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,760
so he's gonna need a ton of money a

1430
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:23,400
lawyer an accountant no he said Planning

1431
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,770
and Zoning and City Council he also

1432
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,990
joined forces with his local marijuana

1433
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:30,269
activist groups that that depends on the

1434
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:32,369
climate in your area if you go down to

1435
00:51:30,269 --> 00:51:34,230
Planning and Zoning and are greeted by a

1436
00:51:32,369 --> 00:51:35,789
really friendly person who hands you a

1437
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:38,070
printout of the rules they've already

1438
00:51:35,789 --> 00:51:39,659
crafted and all you have to do is fill

1439
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:41,370
out the application and find a piece of

1440
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:44,190
property that's zoned appropriately and

1441
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:46,190
get a rental agreement will Congrats bro

1442
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:48,750
you live in a really enlightened area

1443
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:51,599
but what's likely to happen is you're

1444
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:53,909
gonna be met with a confused look and

1445
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:57,119
they're only gonna just be creating

1446
00:51:53,909 --> 00:52:00,619
these rules now and so if that's the

1447
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:04,319
case your best bet is to start attending

1448
00:52:00,619 --> 00:52:05,819
County meetings zoning meetings just

1449
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:08,700
watching how those meetings take place

1450
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:10,080
I'm getting a feel for the people in

1451
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:11,969
charge of those meetings who's on your

1452
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,500
City Council who's on your Board of

1453
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:13,859
County Commissioners or your Zoning

1454
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,460
Board

1455
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:19,470
what are they like and dislike and I

1456
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:22,889
basically it just takes a lot of sitting

1457
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:26,369
and watching I mean watching walls get

1458
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:28,259
made is incredibly boring but they're

1459
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:31,409
legalizing marijuana across the country

1460
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:33,420
we have to write all those laws if you

1461
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:35,039
don't want really really messed up laws

1462
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:36,090
written by people who don't understand

1463
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,679
what we're doing and what we're working

1464
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:39,450
with

1465
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:39,839
stand back and wait for somebody else to

1466
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:40,980
do it

1467
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:42,570
I mean some of the rules that were

1468
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,360
proposed here in Colorado during this

1469
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:48,030
process we're asinine and it took a

1470
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:52,380
while for people like myself to explain

1471
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:54,630
to legislators why it was asinine

1472
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,519
because I face value a lot of them

1473
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,260
seemed like a good idea

1474
00:52:56,519 --> 00:52:59,909
when you take it into practice like the

1475
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:02,370
last episode we talked about edibles

1476
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:05,399
labeling they were ready to get rid of

1477
00:53:02,369 --> 00:53:06,509
all drinks just we'll get rid of them

1478
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,750
period it's never been a problem

1479
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:12,990
anywhere but we're gonna cut out a

1480
00:53:08,750 --> 00:53:15,210
massive majors edibles industry um just

1481
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:17,399
for no reason at all or the people that

1482
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,960
are making these rules are not consumers

1483
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,579
they are not producers they're just

1484
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,079
people they're a lot of time so they

1485
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:24,150
don't know anything about it their best

1486
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,650
their background is in like finance and

1487
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:26,670
they were a dentist for 20 years or some

1488
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,500
[ __ ]

1489
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:32,309
they don't know anything about mass

1490
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:33,989
production of cannabis retail rules what

1491
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:38,279
those rules might be for alcohol and

1492
00:53:33,989 --> 00:53:40,379
tobacco retailers why little tweaks to

1493
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,240
those rules are appropriate for cannabis

1494
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,559
I mean getting them to understand all

1495
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,059
that can be quite a bit of work

1496
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:49,570
and it probably got some fear in them

1497
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:51,099
also well yeah they've you have to go

1498
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:53,830
into this knowing that most of the

1499
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:57,250
people you talk to we're the hall

1500
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:59,380
monitor not to be a dick about it but

1501
00:53:57,250 --> 00:54:00,940
that's yeah when you start going to city

1502
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:02,590
government meetings you're like that's

1503
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,500
what happened to all those people from

1504
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:07,900
high school they just disappeared from

1505
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:09,280
my world after graduate they've got jobs

1506
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:11,740
in city government that's where they all

1507
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:14,140
went yeah they're all Jeff went on tour

1508
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:15,969
all these people got jobs at their local

1509
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:17,920
zoning department and have worked their

1510
00:54:15,969 --> 00:54:20,019
way through the ranks of city

1511
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,369
bureaucracy for twenty years those are

1512
00:54:20,019 --> 00:54:22,750
the people you're dealing with and

1513
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:25,239
they're not bad people most of them are

1514
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:26,949
wonderful but they don't really know

1515
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:28,539
anything about marijuana they don't know

1516
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:30,250
why we consume it they don't know why

1517
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:31,599
it's fun at concerts they just know it

1518
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:34,329
gives them a headache when they go see

1519
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:35,949
popular music and that's really the

1520
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:39,190
extent of their education so getting

1521
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:41,169
them to understand that moving all

1522
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:44,470
marijuana production indoors is

1523
00:54:41,170 --> 00:54:47,980
incredibly bad for the environment when

1524
00:54:44,469 --> 00:54:51,819
especially when cannabis can be grown so

1525
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:54,099
effectively outdoors how that

1526
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:56,200
conversation we fail that having a lot

1527
00:54:54,099 --> 00:54:57,699
of places in Colorado which is why

1528
00:54:56,199 --> 00:54:59,349
Pueblo County's so popular with

1529
00:54:57,699 --> 00:55:01,869
production facilities right now we're

1530
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:04,329
too loaded yep one of the few places you

1531
00:55:01,869 --> 00:55:05,980
can grow outdoors and we're one of the

1532
00:55:04,329 --> 00:55:08,199
few places you can grow in greenhouses

1533
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:10,360
and we're one of the few places where

1534
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:11,980
Lane isn't ridiculously expensive I mean

1535
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,750
we've got the trifecta down here and

1536
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:16,449
that's why we have so many companies

1537
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:17,769
locating and it's changing B the whole

1538
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:19,059
landscape here you could tell that

1539
00:55:17,769 --> 00:55:20,409
there's some money here now we didn't

1540
00:55:19,059 --> 00:55:21,759
have any money here before and you can

1541
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:23,399
tell that there's actually some future

1542
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:27,040
for this place

1543
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:30,519
had our county commissioners followed

1544
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,480
suit with Denver and Aurora and Boulder

1545
00:55:30,519 --> 00:55:33,880
in Longmont

1546
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:36,159
and Lakewood in band outdoor growing

1547
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:40,119
band greenhouse growing pushed it all

1548
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:42,579
indoors the economic recovery we have

1549
00:55:40,119 --> 00:55:44,199
enjoyed has been berry or would have

1550
00:55:42,579 --> 00:55:47,860
been very different

1551
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:50,559
and so in Michigan I know you guys have

1552
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:55,559
been taking economic hit after economic

1553
00:55:50,559 --> 00:55:55,559
hit for the last my whole life sorry

1554
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:03,570
this can really be an economic engine

1555
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,870
for for growth and prosperity and it's

1556
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:10,050
not a tidal wave of money that's gonna

1557
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:11,279
fix everything I watched the video on

1558
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:13,680
Detroit not too long ago where people

1559
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,370
with disassembling skyscrapers and

1560
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:19,379
selling parts of scrap I'm like like

1561
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:21,299
active skyscrapers are old skyscraper

1562
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:24,090
like an old one okay as long as I still

1563
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:27,150
people in them the amount of recession

1564
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:28,860
in Detroit is is significantly different

1565
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,320
than what we see here even it even

1566
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:33,900
though we've got the blow and Detroit

1567
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:37,370
have gone through similar things the

1568
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:37,369
scale is very different

1569
00:56:38,699 --> 00:56:45,329
in a state like Michigan marijuana

1570
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:47,700
really could be two or three or twenty

1571
00:56:45,329 --> 00:56:49,650
or thirty thousand jobs oh yeah it could

1572
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:52,980
bring it back now these people aren't

1573
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:55,110
all gonna be making 75,000 a year a lot

1574
00:56:52,980 --> 00:57:00,210
of them are gonna be making 1015 our

1575
00:56:55,110 --> 00:57:02,700
1215 our fourteen an hour but that's

1576
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:05,550
still thousands of jobs you're still

1577
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:07,889
talking about hundreds of millions of

1578
00:57:05,550 --> 00:57:09,840
dollars into improving properties and

1579
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:11,730
bringing them up to code and when Jeff

1580
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:13,680
starts talking about is what what do you

1581
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:16,469
need to know going from green house to

1582
00:57:13,679 --> 00:57:18,449
warehouse the improvements that are

1583
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:20,909
required in a lot of the warehouses to

1584
00:57:18,449 --> 00:57:22,859
get them up to where he's gonna get at

1585
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:25,559
that costs a lot of money and that

1586
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:28,800
improvement is massive for the area we

1587
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:30,449
had a excuse me we needed to upgrade our

1588
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,470
air flow system a little bit of green

1589
00:57:30,449 --> 00:57:33,000
and healthy and I was getting some

1590
00:57:31,469 --> 00:57:34,769
estimates we're trying to connect two

1591
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,239
rooms two sides of the building and just

1592
00:57:34,769 --> 00:57:37,650
run a through one air conditioning thing

1593
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:40,139
and handle some humidity and some air

1594
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:41,910
control through one thing yeah probably

1595
00:57:40,139 --> 00:57:44,159
six to eight thousand each side to make

1596
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:46,619
that happen just for a small air

1597
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,929
exchange set up so just it's going from

1598
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:50,609
the home to the commercial that when he

1599
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:55,710
said eight thousand each side I was like

1600
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:59,309
oh this is gonna take a second just the

1601
00:57:55,710 --> 00:58:01,880
economic boom a state can feel if this

1602
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:05,070
is done correctly if it's done smartly

1603
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:08,070
and and to have but have it done

1604
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:10,760
correctly really takes people willing to

1605
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:13,140
do the lake work to go to City Council

1606
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:15,210
meetings to go to state legislature

1607
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:17,989
meetings and make sure that they don't

1608
00:58:15,210 --> 00:58:21,360
do thousand-foot from everywhere rules

1609
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:24,209
I remember here in Pueblo the the first

1610
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:26,460
proposal I saw for for buffer zones the

1611
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:28,230
distance your marijuana business has to

1612
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,610
be from other stuff there were like 25

1613
00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:32,699
different businesses on there

1614
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:34,500
yeah like nursing homes right all kinds

1615
00:58:32,699 --> 00:58:36,809
of different churches liquor stores

1616
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:41,130
farmers it was a specific business name

1617
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:42,440
rehab specifically seek out adults with

1618
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:45,160
developmental disabilities

1619
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:48,159
[Music]

1620
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:51,038
as employees these oh yeah that's that

1621
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:52,868
companies kind of niche is giving that

1622
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:57,609
whole segment of the population a great

1623
00:58:52,869 --> 00:59:00,789
job and our original legislation had a

1624
00:58:57,608 --> 00:59:02,558
thousand feet from their property and

1625
00:59:00,789 --> 00:59:05,049
then in the middle of all of this

1626
00:59:02,559 --> 00:59:07,390
Colorado redefined what a thousand feet

1627
00:59:05,048 --> 00:59:11,259
from a school meant they changed how its

1628
00:59:07,389 --> 00:59:14,019
measured halfway through the game and it

1629
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:15,940
wasn't like feet 2 inches kind of

1630
00:59:14,019 --> 00:59:20,259
distance but it was what they call as

1631
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:22,389
the crow flies versus walking and so

1632
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:25,030
originally dispensary owners walked out

1633
00:59:22,389 --> 00:59:27,308
their front door and took the street on

1634
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:30,160
foot version right to the nearest school

1635
00:59:27,309 --> 00:59:31,599
and then applied that way saying that

1636
00:59:30,159 --> 00:59:33,818
there were a thousand three hundred feet

1637
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:36,400
from a school and then they changed the

1638
00:59:33,818 --> 00:59:38,949
rule to ask the clothed crow flies and

1639
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:42,700
it turns out the nearest pieces of their

1640
00:59:38,949 --> 00:59:45,159
property lines are only 600 feet apart

1641
00:59:42,699 --> 00:59:47,259
because of a mass that was literally

1642
00:59:45,159 --> 00:59:49,690
only mass shut down of business in

1643
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:54,670
general ad in Colorado is because that

1644
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:56,528
rule changed and so I mean for you I

1645
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:57,700
when Jeff first told me this was a

1646
00:59:56,528 --> 01:00:00,639
question I was like dude that's a whole

1647
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:04,149
podcast we can't do that as part of a

1648
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:08,019
thing because where your state is right

1649
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:09,548
now and honestly this applies to like 14

1650
01:00:08,019 --> 01:00:11,710
different states across the country

1651
01:00:09,548 --> 01:00:14,318
depending on what happens in November's

1652
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,548
election 14 different states will be

1653
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,219
going through the process we're talking

1654
01:00:15,548 --> 01:00:20,798
about right now or are about to be

1655
01:00:18,219 --> 01:00:22,419
depending on how the election goes so a

1656
01:00:20,798 --> 01:00:24,608
lot of you need to start thinking about

1657
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:28,659
this who makes these decisions in your

1658
01:00:24,608 --> 01:00:30,250
area what kind of process is that what

1659
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:31,899
does it look like how do I get involved

1660
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:33,579
in that if you don't make those

1661
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:35,920
decisions and start writing those rules

1662
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:39,910
somebody will write them for you yep

1663
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,858
and unfortunately for you and what this

1664
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:46,149
wasn't as bad when Colorado was doing

1665
01:00:41,858 --> 01:00:51,068
this the anti pop movement is very vocal

1666
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:53,318
now it was just the DEA in the police

1667
01:00:51,068 --> 01:00:55,630
and law enforcement in the prisons and

1668
01:00:53,318 --> 01:00:58,308
police unions when Colorado was doing

1669
01:00:55,630 --> 01:01:00,739
this now there are parents groups

1670
01:00:58,309 --> 01:01:02,420
freaked out and when you get into this

1671
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:03,798
mainly you'll find that the anti pot

1672
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:05,209
groups are just people who didn't have

1673
01:01:03,798 --> 01:01:08,688
anything in their world and needed of

1674
01:01:05,208 --> 01:01:10,368
something in trying to remind us all

1675
01:01:08,688 --> 01:01:12,048
that in eighth grade we learned that pot

1676
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:17,440
is bad has become their goal in life

1677
01:01:12,048 --> 01:01:20,380
right and they're not

1678
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:24,690
very good at research or arguments we

1679
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:24,690
just got a male or a liar in the mail

1680
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:33,340
but the one thing they they really

1681
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:35,139
really are is vocal yes and when you do

1682
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:36,670
get involved in this process in your

1683
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:38,920
area one of the first things you're

1684
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:40,720
gonna realize is that the old dude who

1685
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:42,900
shows up to every meeting and won't shut

1686
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:44,859
up about whatever their topic is

1687
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:46,900
everybody that's involved in city

1688
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:49,059
government knows that [ __ ] topic

1689
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:50,710
intimately they know every in and out of

1690
01:01:49,059 --> 01:01:53,469
it and they're sick of hearing about it

1691
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:55,539
for one reason because that dude shows

1692
01:01:53,469 --> 01:01:57,459
up and makes a lot of noise and that's

1693
01:01:55,539 --> 01:02:01,239
what the anti pop people do they'll

1694
01:01:57,460 --> 01:02:03,670
rally 35 or 40 church moms they'll show

1695
01:02:01,239 --> 01:02:06,309
up in force to two or three hearings and

1696
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:08,200
all of a sudden your city doesn't get to

1697
01:02:06,309 --> 01:02:10,389
enjoy any of the economic benefits of

1698
01:02:08,199 --> 01:02:12,309
legalization and every marijuana

1699
01:02:10,389 --> 01:02:14,889
consumer in that geographic area that

1700
01:02:12,309 --> 01:02:18,480
wants to participate in the legal market

1701
01:02:14,889 --> 01:02:21,509
has to drive to the next county to do so

1702
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,280
because of who showed up at a meeting

1703
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,990
you really really really need to start

1704
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:27,640
taking a look at this especially if you

1705
01:02:25,989 --> 01:02:30,369
want to be part of the industry as an

1706
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:32,500
owner you've got a chance to get in on

1707
01:02:30,369 --> 01:02:34,569
the ground floor right now if you're

1708
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:37,050
willing to put in serious legislative

1709
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,050
legwork

1710
01:02:37,659 --> 01:02:42,429
that's my half of the question I just

1711
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:43,690
glanced over a second I was like we're

1712
01:02:42,429 --> 01:02:45,159
in an hour in two minutes I'm almost

1713
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:47,139
tempted to make this a two-part question

1714
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:49,869
and cut this dude off now and make

1715
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:51,639
another episode this your half of the

1716
01:02:49,869 --> 01:02:53,799
question is huge

1717
01:02:51,639 --> 01:02:55,299
because there's a lot of stuff I mean we

1718
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,940
can give them the glance over if you

1719
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:59,470
want no I think we would there's enough

1720
01:02:57,940 --> 01:03:01,119
I mean he asked like four questions in

1721
01:02:59,469 --> 01:03:02,559
here so I think we're gonna make this a

1722
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,449
two-parter are you down to record a

1723
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:05,710
little bit more with me I totally am and

1724
01:03:04,449 --> 01:03:06,969
I could use like a two minute break I

1725
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:08,349
knew you needed a stretch break a

1726
01:03:06,969 --> 01:03:10,089
cigarette break I could use a fresh

1727
01:03:08,349 --> 01:03:14,319
drink and a couple of dabs so ladies

1728
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:15,519
miss podcast is yeah this podcast is

1729
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,470
going just over an hour

1730
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:19,150
I would rather record two episodes out

1731
01:03:17,469 --> 01:03:21,009
of this so Mike and I are gonna take

1732
01:03:19,150 --> 01:03:22,660
some dabs let's do this if you have not

1733
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:24,070
before your listeners because we kind of

1734
01:03:22,659 --> 01:03:25,480
do us on the fly can I twist your arm

1735
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,280
and make this a Thursday episode or

1736
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:28,599
what's gonna happen we're gonna put

1737
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,340
these out one is gonna be a Monday one's

1738
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:33,130
gonna be a Thursday so that was I don't

1739
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:35,140
know if this is for me this is more than

1740
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:36,579
interesting enough to do a week teaser

1741
01:03:35,139 --> 01:03:38,769
and I think our listeners are that

1742
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:40,599
dedicated but I want to hook them up and

1743
01:03:38,769 --> 01:03:42,519
do it closer if we can this is I've been

1744
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:44,230
trying a lot of times I try to do two

1745
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:46,030
episodes a week but I can't commit to

1746
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:47,440
that I can't dedicate to that so I

1747
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:48,760
haven't made the promise I would do

1748
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,200
we're we have trouble getting one of

1749
