72
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,349
podcast I've got a patreon account

73
00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:34,658
let me explain patreon really quickly

74
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:36,818
patreon is a website where people can go

75
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:39,128
and they can sign up to financially

76
00:02:36,818 --> 00:02:40,628
contribute to the podcast you sign up

77
00:02:39,128 --> 00:02:43,870
you put in your credit card info and

78
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:45,878
once a month it will pay me the amount

79
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,299
that you have decided to give me or

80
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,560
donate to me or contribute to me

81
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,329
yesterday I got an email somebody has

82
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,310
decided that every month they are going

83
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:56,409
to contribute $10 to the girl from your

84
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:58,479
heart podcast one person is throwing

85
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,949
down $10 every month that is awesome

86
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,238
huge shout-out to that person I don't

87
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:02,768

88
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,939
show so I'm not gonna call you out if

89
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:05,530
you'd like your name said on the show

90
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:07,810

92
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,069

93
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:13,780
patreon contribution those are all

94
00:03:12,068 --> 00:03:15,369

95
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,789

96
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,469
account

97
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:19,030
I truly appreciate that you guys I'm not

98
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,859
trying to get rich off the podcast like

99
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,289
I've said many times I'm using the

100
00:03:20,859 --> 00:03:25,419
patreon contributions to cover the cost

101
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:27,638
of my website and it will also replace

102
00:03:25,419 --> 00:03:30,040
some recording equipment my SD card for

103
00:03:27,639 --> 00:03:31,659
my zoom h6 took a [ __ ] so I will use the

104
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,939
funds to replace that we can do more

105
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:35,889
podcasts on the road I buy these little

106
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:37,930
microphone covers I'm gonna rub it sort

107
00:03:35,889 --> 00:03:39,489
of foam microphone cover here I buy a

108
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:42,219
lot of those because I try to give a

109
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:43,900
fresh foamy cover when the guests come

110
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:45,489
over I try to have a fresh foam cover on

111
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,319
there because people coffin to it and

112
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:48,639
people rub their faces on it on accident

113
00:03:47,318 --> 00:03:50,318
cuz they forget the mics there and they

114
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,609
bump into it like that so I spend the

115
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,530
money on these little foam covers and

116
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,030
stuff like that eventually I'm gonna

117
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,799
need a new MacBook I feel this one's

118
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:58,269
starting to slow down and glitch out so

119
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,980
that's where that funding will go you

120
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:01,329
guys so huge thank you those people that

121
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:02,888

122
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:05,409

123
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:07,329

125
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:22,269
information on patreon go to

126
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:23,949
patreon.com/crashcourse now there we go

127
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:25,990
let's get down to business you guys

128
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:28,029
today we are going to talk about proper

129
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,449
mixing and watering technique somebody

130
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,918
was asking

131
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:31,360
me questions about mixing their

132
00:04:29,918 --> 00:04:33,068
nutrients and mixing their water and

133
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,020
then I got a tweet about mixing

134
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:37,509
nutrients in mixing water and I thought

135
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:39,248
this would be a great episode to do I

136
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,020
also have a friend starting a brand new

137
00:04:39,249 --> 00:04:43,270
hydro setup and he needed some advice

138
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:44,709
since I was going to talk about it I

139
00:04:43,269 --> 00:04:46,748
figured let's put a microphone in front

140
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:48,668
of my face and do it properly so today's

141
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:51,309
podcast is going to be about properly

142
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:52,870
mixing your nutrients and then we're

143
00:04:51,309 --> 00:04:55,870
gonna talk a little bit about properly

144
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:57,399
watering your plants all right you guys

145
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,918
before I get too far into this I want to

146
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,348
say that this advice should work for

147
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:05,168
small gardens large Gardens this should

148
00:05:02,348 --> 00:05:07,120
work for soil lists and soil gardens and

149
00:05:05,168 --> 00:05:08,560
this also should work for hydro gardens

150
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,538
of course there will be some adjusting

151
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,848
to be done for different applications

152
00:05:10,538 --> 00:05:15,399
but most of this will apply to most

153
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:18,430
Gardens if you're running a TLO or a

154
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:21,158
no-till or a living soil this probably

155
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,528
won't work for you for you know till and

156
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:25,240
TLO guys will get frosty organics back

157
00:05:23,528 --> 00:05:27,009
we'll get bare foot back and we'll do

158
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:28,569
another show about that organic stuff

159
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:31,210
but for now we're gonna talk about

160
00:05:28,569 --> 00:05:33,639
mixing with bottles and such so my first

161
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:36,128
point will be clean water good water is

162
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,800
very important reverse osmosis water RO

163
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:40,599
water is ideal I understand that not

164
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,069
everybody can get an RO machine and

165
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:44,139
install it in their bathroom or in their

166
00:05:42,069 --> 00:05:46,680
kitchen for their home grow I do get it

167
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:49,899
if you can't do RO water tap water is

168
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,509
okay if you're using tap water I would

169
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:54,759
recommend that you go to either the pet

170
00:05:52,509 --> 00:05:56,649
store like the fish tank store or either

171
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:58,930
the hydroponic store and get yourself an

172
00:05:56,649 --> 00:06:00,759
aquarium air pump and what this is is a

173
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,319
pump that sits outside of the water it

174
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,430
does not go in the water don't put it in

175
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,899
the water it will kill it you might

176
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:06,759
electrocute yourself it'll be bad don't

177
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:08,139
do that so it's a pump that goes outside

178
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:10,479
of the water and it's got a wine that

179
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,759
runs to an airstone and you'll need to

180
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,959
buy some clear wine some flex hose or

181
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,430
some clear line they'll have the right

182
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:17,199
size line sitting right next to the pump

183
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,569
don't worry and then you'll need air

184
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,218
stones to put in the bottom of your

185
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:23,830
reservoir so you'll fill up your

186
00:06:21,218 --> 00:06:25,509
container you put the aquarium air pump

187
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:27,609
next to it it's a good idea to have the

188
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,379
aquarium air pump higher than your water

189
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,149
because if the power does go out you

190
00:06:29,379 --> 00:06:33,338
don't want water siphoning down the line

191
00:06:31,149 --> 00:06:35,050
and coming out at the other end that has

192
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:37,750
happened before so keep the pump higher

193
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,038
than the water get a get it on a shelf

194
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,110
don't put it on the ground cuz it can

195
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,000
work as a siphon if the power goes out

196
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,560
so you've got your filled container

197
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,168
you've got your aquarium air pump

198
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,209
you've got your plastic line going to

199
00:06:47,168 --> 00:06:50,918
some air stones those air stones go in

200
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,839
the bottom of that container that's

201
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:54,519
filled with water and you plug it in and

202
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:55,929
it simply bubbles I turn it up all the

203
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,198
way it might get kind of light I'll just

204
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:01,509
like just turn it up it'll bubble and

205
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,949
it'll bubble bubble bubble that chlorine

206
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:05,348
out of your water and hopefully within

207
00:07:02,949 --> 00:07:07,389
24 to 48 hours you'll get rid of most of

208
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:09,908
that chlorine now there are some things

209
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:12,759
that can only be taken out by reverse

210
00:07:09,908 --> 00:07:15,310
osmosis but honestly if you are running

211
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:17,080
a home grow and your grow is not large

212
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,939
enough to where you've got extra money

213
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:21,158
to invest in an RO machine you're

214
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,379
probably going to be ok using tap water

215
00:07:21,158 --> 00:07:25,629
you guys it's not that major of a deal

216
00:07:23,379 --> 00:07:28,718
one thing I should mention is if you're

217
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:30,699
using tap water you can use less cal-mag

218
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:33,098
than if you're using reverse osmosis

219
00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:34,810
water the tap water already has plenty

220
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:37,209
of calcium in it so you can reduce that

221
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,250
if you're using RO you need to use the

222
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:41,859
recommended amount or pretty close to it

223
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:43,389
that's the major difference so you

224
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:46,479
should be okay if you can't use reverse

225
00:07:43,389 --> 00:07:47,500
osmosis water is what I'm getting at all

226
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:49,628
right now let's talk about the

227
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,038
temperature of your water it's very

228
00:07:49,629 --> 00:07:53,889
important that when you're mixing your

229
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:56,860
nutrients you have your water between 65

230
00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:59,019
and 75 degrees that's best for your pH

231
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,449
and for your nutrients if you're going

232
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:03,908
hydro I can say that if you go anywhere

233
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:06,278
above 70 you do kind of encourage algae

234
00:08:03,908 --> 00:08:08,199
growth so if you're going hydro try to

235
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:11,918
keep your water around 70 degrees if

236
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:15,098
you're going soil soilless mix 65 to 75

237
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:16,568
works seventy is about ideal 65 is a

238
00:08:15,098 --> 00:08:19,149
little low I would never go lower than

239
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:21,669
65 if you water your plants with water

240
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:23,649
that's cooler than 65 they will start to

241
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:26,258
make this claw-like shape and the leaves

242
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:28,060
and they will stop growing they

243
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:29,919
basically freeze they chill out they

244
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,718
don't do [ __ ] you don't like sticking

245
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,189
your feet or your hands in cold water so

246
00:08:31,718 --> 00:08:35,528
don't do that to your plants that's my

247
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:37,990
recommendation um if you need to get the

248
00:08:35,528 --> 00:08:39,908
if the water is coming out of your

249
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,649
spigot or your spout wherever your water

250
00:08:39,908 --> 00:08:45,490
is coming from if the source is too warm

251
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:47,589
or too cold for example right now in

252
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:49,990
Colorado it has been ridiculously cold

253
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:53,050
it was 17 degrees the other day when I

254
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,909
went to work at 7 in the morning we

255
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:57,279
filled the containers with water

256
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,689
the RO machine and that water was 62

257
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,000
degrees there was no chance I was gonna

258
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:04,210
feed that water to the plants so we use

259
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,250
bucket heaters to heat the water if it's

260
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:09,400
too cold you can use chillers if you're

261
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:11,080
not looking to invest money and items to

262
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,870
keep your water at the right temperature

263
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,170
you can use the lights in your grow room

264
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,879
if you are filling your reservoir and

265
00:09:17,169 --> 00:09:21,219
putting your bubblers in there you can

266
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,500
move that to the grow room you may deal

267
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,389
with a little bit more humidity but the

268
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,820
grow lights and that grow room will get

269
00:09:25,389 --> 00:09:30,069
your water to the correct temperature it

270
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,500
may take a little while but that will

271
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:34,540
get it to the right temperature this may

272
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,519
also have the opposite effect if you're

273
00:09:34,539 --> 00:09:38,769
running a hydro grow and you've got the

274
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,210
hydro reservoir in the room perhaps

275
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:42,100
you're running a flood and drain table

276
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:43,930
and the reservoir is underneath the

277
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,370
table maybe the room is heating up the

278
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,469
water too much and that's when you're

279
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:48,879
gonna need a chiller I actually realized

280
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:51,490
that I said something wrong a couple of

281
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,100
minutes ago if your water is too cold

282
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:56,230
you need a bucket heater and if your

283
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,730
water is too warm that's when you need a

284
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:59,980
chiller I realized as I was saying it

285
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:01,539
that I said that backwards so we have

286
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,000
covered the basics of getting your water

287
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:06,370
to the appropriate temperature now it's

288
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,889
time to talk about measuring and mixing

289
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,360
your nutrients into your water so the

290
00:10:08,889 --> 00:10:13,480
first thing you need for this is a clean

291
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:16,090
and accurate measuring device maybe you

292
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:18,250
have some measuring cups I like the shot

293
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:20,740
glass and the beer glass looking style

294
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,360
cups they're really easy to clean the

295
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,639
downfall with them is they're a glass if

296
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,169
you're clumsy like me it may be better

297
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,789
for you to get the plastic style there

298
00:10:26,169 --> 00:10:29,769
are a lot of options get something with

299
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:32,709
milliliters with tablespoons and

300
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,059
teaspoons with ounces because each brand

301
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,000
of nutrients is going to ask for

302
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,799
different stuff I like brands that go by

303
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,960
milliliters milliliters per gallon is my

304
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,419
favorite but each brand does their own

305
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:46,480
thing so you'll need a measuring cup or

306
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:48,699
a measuring device if you're using dry

307
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,370
nutrients like veg bloom you may need a

308
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:55,270
scale I recommend that you have a pH

309
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:58,750
meter a ppm meter and possibly an EC

310
00:10:55,269 --> 00:11:01,449
meter and a thermometer I can highly

311
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:03,190
recommend the blue lab combo meter it's

312
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,220
got all of the above on there it's got

313
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,100
the ppm the EC the pH and a thermometer

314
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,590
all in one unit I really love the device

315
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:14,050
it's a little expensive one thing that I

316
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:16,509
can recommend if you with any pH meter

317
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:19,839
keep the probe wet seal it up somehow

318
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:22,389
with some pH 7 solution in there and

319
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:24,190
keep that probe wet as long as you can

320
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,860
because that will keep it alive they say

321
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:29,680
about pH probes if it dries it dies so

322
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,560
keep that [ __ ] wet and also calibrate

323
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,029
your equipment frequently at least once

324
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,129
a month if you're working with it a lot

325
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:38,500
do it once a week but at least once a

326
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:39,879
month if the big grow if I'm working in

327
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,649
a big grow you guys you know I bounce

328
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:44,470
around from large grow to large grow if

329
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:46,959
it's up to me when I'm using those pH

330
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,790
meters about once every two weeks I

331
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,070
catch myself just going to some solution

332
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:52,480
you dump the pH solution into a

333
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:54,070
container there's one that's four and

334
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,840
then one that's probably seven or ten

335
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,550
and just check up and see and if they

336
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,190
don't come out perfectly accurate take a

337
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:02,019
minute and fix the pH meter it can't

338
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,580
take that long maybe five maybe 10

339
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:04,960
minutes at the absolute most if it's

340
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,620
frustrating give me a hard time

341
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,490
it'll get quicker so just adjust the

342
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,810
calibration on your pH meter that's

343
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,940
super important sorry I went off on a

344
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:16,029
rant there so you're going to need a

345
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:19,230
bucket or a reservoir with a clearly

346
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,370
marked measurement area either like a

347
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:24,730
reservoir from the hydro shop that is

348
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,519
already a predetermined volume or what I

349
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:29,430
like to use is the I think they're

350
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,620
thirty two and fifty five-gallon

351
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:34,419
Rubbermaid trash cans by the trashcan at

352
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,429
Lowe's and I also get the little wheels

353
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:39,189
that go underneath it so that you can

354
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:41,559
roll that sucker around then I will get

355
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:43,510
a five-gallon bucket or one of those

356
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:45,369
5-gallon like the deep rock water

357
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:46,720
bottles or whatever brand water bottle

358
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:49,450
the five-gallon kind that gets delivered

359
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,029
I'll go buy one of those and I will use

360
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:54,129
it to measure out five gallons and I'll

361
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:55,720
mark it on the inside and the outside of

362
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:57,399
my trash can and then I'll measure to

363
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,200
ten gallons and mark it on the inside

364
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:01,059
and outside of my trash can and then

365
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,700
I'll do 15 and I'll do it in increments

366
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,919
of five all the way up to 25 or 30 or 50

367
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,620
or however big my container is so that

368
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,539
way I can see 5 10 15 or however many

369
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,490
gallons I've got and I can be accurate

370
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:15,459
that's important to me so you need a

371
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:17,889
clean marked container that you could

372
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,570
put water in I may need to be movable

373
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,850
you may need to get it from your water

374
00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:22,780
to your gross so think about wheels

375
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:24,700
think about

376
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:25,990
you're gonna carry it most of you guys

377
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,860
are probably just gonna be mixing in a

378
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,049
five-gallon bucket

379
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:31,480
I like the Lowe's bucket Home Depot

380
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:33,309
bucket keep it simple keep it affordable

381
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,830
if you want to buy one of those fancy

382
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:36,669
reservoirs from the gross store go for

383
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:38,650
it be my guest

384
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:40,449
it looks great looks weird in pictures

385
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:43,179
and it's already marked for the the

386
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,560
volume just keep in mind as soon as you

387
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:46,479
pull up to the house and carry that

388
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,459
thing in the house everybody knows you

389
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,289
grow weed now all right so you've got a

390
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,490
chosen reservoir a chosen container one

391
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:53,980
thing I should mention is that you need

392
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,500
to clean this occasionally I would clean

393
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:57,940
it probably every use if you can if it's

394
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,320
a big trash can I understand that's kind

395
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,610
of a pain in the ass if you don't have a

396
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,379
place to rinse it out and hose it out

397
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:04,659
try to get to it as frequently as you

398
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:06,279
can you'll see some biofilm buildup on

399
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:08,699
it it'll get funky that will start to

400
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,870
mess with your EC your ppm and your pH

401
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:13,090
clean your [ __ ] it only takes a few

402
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,470
extra minutes just clean stuff up take

403
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,460
it out it's a try if is a trash can you

404
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,810
could probably sneak it out to the

405
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,310
backyard and hose it out people won't

406
00:14:16,809 --> 00:14:20,289
wander too much what's going on if

407
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:22,059
you've got that reservoir from the hydro

408
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:24,129
store everyone's like oh he's cleaning

409
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,119
his weed reservoir so that's when you

410
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:26,409
might want to think about what you're

411
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,940
gonna buy hosing out a five-gallon

412
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:29,799
bucket is really easy you can do that in

413
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,660
the bathtub you do that the shower so

414
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:33,429
just think about cleaning your container

415
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:35,709
do that frequently please clean

416
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:37,209
everything very frequently all right so

417
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,310
you've got a clean container now the

418
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,960
next step is to fill it up you're there

419
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,599
using your RO water or your tap water

420
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:45,580
fill your container fill it up - if you

421
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,200
need 15 gallons if you need 20 gallons

422
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,550
fill it to where you need it to that

423
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,930
gallon amount if you're using a five

424
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:52,479
gallon bucket fill it up to the five

425
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:54,729
gallon point in a five-gallon bucket

426
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,960
there will be some extra space you will

427
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,389
not fill it all the way to the top

428
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,160
there's probably like an inch or two of

429
00:14:58,389 --> 00:15:02,769
extra space and there may be three

430
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,689
inches of extra space don't fill it all

431
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:06,039
the way to the top if you're making a

432
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:08,080
reservoir try to have a little extra

433
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:09,669
room in your reservoir as well we're

434
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,920
gonna talk about why here in just a

435
00:15:09,669 --> 00:15:13,929
couple of seconds so you fill up your

436
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:15,849
container and you check the temperature

437
00:15:13,929 --> 00:15:18,339
the first thing I would do is check the

438
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:20,379
temperature if the temperature is too

439
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,840
high or too low we're gonna use the

440
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:25,480
proper tool either the bucket heater or

441
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,000
maybe an aquarium heater or a chiller or

442
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:30,250
we're gonna use the heat from the grow

443
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,679
room or we're gonna use whatever however

444
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:35,019
you got to do it get that water to the

445
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:36,309
appropriate temperature

446
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:38,769
you're using tap water you may have

447
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:40,119
wanted to fill this up 24 to 48 hours in

448
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:41,860
advance so that you can start bubbling

449
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,840
it and then you can also get your

450
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:45,669
temperature correction device in there

451
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,649
at that time so that when it comes time

452
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:49,149
to mix the nutrients you're already at

453
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,709
the right temperature so if you're

454
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,600
running a commercial grow before you

455
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:54,639
leave tonight fill up your containers

456
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:56,409
with water put your chillers or your

457
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,250
bucket heaters in there and let them run

458
00:15:56,409 --> 00:15:58,870
for a little while

459
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,399
set them on a timer maybe to click on

460
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:02,139
three hours before you come in in the

461
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,789
morning that [ __ ] might start getting

462
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:05,439
right it'll be correct by the time you

463
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:07,029
get there I think I had you guys

464
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,430
thinking ahead and growing is very

465
00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:11,500
important so fill your container get the

466
00:16:09,429 --> 00:16:13,899
temperature of that water correct now

467
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,909
it's time to mix up your nutrients now

468
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:19,360
it's when you need that clean mixing

469
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:22,120
container that clean measuring device so

470
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,580
when you're mixing be accurate you guys

471
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:26,649
if the bottle says okay this is a side

472
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,379
rant if the bottle says 50 mils per

473
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:32,079
gallon you can probably get away with 25

474
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:35,110
to 30 mils per gallon but whatever you

475
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:38,379
decide to mix be accurate if you wrote

476
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,899
down that your mix is 30 milliliters put

477
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:44,679
30 milliliters in that bucket don't do

478
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:46,870
29 don't do 32 be as accurate as you can

479
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:48,279
and your plants will love you you will

480
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:49,600
like it you'll be able to take better

481
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:51,339
notes you'll be able to correct things

482
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,950
in the future if you see problems so

483
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,820
when you're mixing your nutrients be as

484
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,590
accurate as you possibly can also never

485
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,870
mix your bottled nutrients together

486
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:04,779
without mixing them into a large

487
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:06,849
container of water those nutrients are

488
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:08,170
in separate bottles for a reason it's

489
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:11,019
not just because they want to sell you

490
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,400
two bottles there are elements in each

491
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:14,549
bottle that if they were sold together

492
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,540
would bind and it would deactivate

493
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:18,369
basically the ingredients that are in

494
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:21,670
each bottle so they keep them separate

495
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:23,889
and when you pour bottle a into this

496
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:25,600
much water it dilutes it strong enough

497
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,670
to where when you pour a bottle B into

498
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,679
that much water they will not create a

499
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:32,140
chemical bond and it will not disrupt

500
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,660
your solution so never mix your

501
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,660
nutrients together without plenty of

502
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,970
water in the container now let's move

503
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,950
into actually doing the mix the actual

504
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:45,100
mix of the nutrients making the soup

505
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:48,100
something I should talk about is wear

506
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:48,579
gloves put on some nitrile gloves some

507
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:50,379
rubber glue

508
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:52,119
of some hand protection some of the

509
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,820
things you're gonna be touching pH down

510
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:56,619
is bad for your skin my skin reacts

511
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:58,750
funky to cal-mag from some brands of cow

512
00:17:56,619 --> 00:18:00,819
bag my skin will get splotchy if I touch

513
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,648
it a lot of the things that we play with

514
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:04,689
in the grow are not really good for our

515
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:06,278
skin so I recommend that when you walk

516
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,558
into the grow you're just wearing rubber

517
00:18:06,278 --> 00:18:10,000
gloves all the time have some gloves the

518
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,950
Black Knight trials are my favorite they

519
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,329
fit the best of the shape the best shape

520
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:15,429
they don't make my hands smell super

521
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:17,710
funky that's what I would recommend so

522
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:20,320
wear gloves also when you're mixing

523
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,169
nutrients you guys wear eye protection

524
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:24,700
you might feel nerdy who cares you're

525
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,649
not in there to be stylish nobody's

526
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,450
looking at you wear some sort of

527
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:30,518
protective eyewear if it's those goggles

528
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:32,889
the science lab goggles that's probably

529
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:34,899
what I would recommend because I have

530
00:18:32,888 --> 00:18:36,879
heard a story of a friend who actually

531
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:38,949
listens to this podcast he was mixing

532
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,980
nutrients in his private grow and he

533
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:44,679
splashed maybe one drop of pH down in

534
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,079
his eye and he had to pull his phone out

535
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,210
of his pocket and he had to use Siri to

536
00:18:47,079 --> 00:18:51,220
call 911 for himself because he could

537
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,259
not see he went into full panic mode

538
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,630
because it hurts so bad and he had to

539
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:58,480
call the police and the paramedics to

540
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,639
come to his grow to rescue him because

541
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,690
he got products in his eye so you guys

542
00:19:00,638 --> 00:19:03,250
wear eye protection

543
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:05,288
you only get one set of eyes you don't

544
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:07,179
want to [ __ ] him up be very careful in

545
00:19:05,288 --> 00:19:08,919
the grow please with your eyes with your

546
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:10,179
fingers with your hands we're gonna talk

547
00:19:08,919 --> 00:19:12,700
about grow room safety in another

548
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:14,230
episode that's a really good idea so put

549
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:17,230
on some nitrile gloves put on some eye

550
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:20,200
protection and then grab your clean and

551
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,970
trusty measuring device and we're gonna

552
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,889
talk about actually mixing nutrients now

553
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:25,538
I asked our Facebook friends and my

554
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:28,750
Instagram friends for guidance on this

555
00:19:25,538 --> 00:19:31,240
and 9 out of 10 people said makes your

556
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,669
potassium silicates first so if you're

557
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:35,409
using some sort of potassium silicon

558
00:19:33,669 --> 00:19:37,809
product if you're using botanic air it's

559
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:39,820
just called potassium silicon if you

560
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:41,558
were using Oh sand 90 is that oh so

561
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,879
ninety or twenty-eight whichever Ossa

562
00:19:41,558 --> 00:19:45,308
products you're using if you're using

563
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,429
OSA for potassium silicates everybody

564
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:51,190
says to put that in first so potassium

565
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:54,370
silicates first stir that for a few

566
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:56,048
minutes get it emulsify that's the word

567
00:19:54,369 --> 00:19:57,759
I'm looking for get it fully emulsified

568
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:59,859
into your water if you can see it in

569
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,240
there you need to stir longer after the

570
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:04,939
potassium silicates everybody recommends

571
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,039
that you add calmac and in the

572
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:09,740
recommended or appropriate amount of Cal

573
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:11,839
mag stir again and then after that if

574
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:14,120
you're using micro that's when you would

575
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,279
add in your micro if you're not using

576
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,649
micro you might want to read about it

577
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:20,720
maybe your nutrient line has something

578
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,769
else that is covering the micro check

579
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,259
and see what you're missing

580
00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:26,150
after that everybody would recommend

581
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:27,980
that you use your base nutrients if

582
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,200
you're using a brand that only has one

583
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,880
bottle of Base nutrients add in your

584
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,679
base nutrients at the appropriate amount

585
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:35,750
if you're using something like advanced

586
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,360
nutrients that has an A and a B you

587
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,700
would definitely do a first give it a

588
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,889
little stir then put in B and give it a

589
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:45,019
little stir again this is all about

590
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:47,270
chemical bonds we're doing things in

591
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:50,839
this order so that things do not bond in

592
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:53,269
specific ways so mix in your potassium

593
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:55,639
silicon your cal-mag your micro your

594
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:57,470
base your a and B if you have a two part

595
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,870
and that was when you would add in any

596
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,789
other additives that you've got if

597
00:20:59,869 --> 00:21:04,279
you're adding a bloom booster if you're

598
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:06,920
adding any sweeteners or Bud hardeners

599
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:08,599
those would all get mixed in last now

600
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,700
something that somebody recommended to

601
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:11,089
me and I checked on this and it makes

602
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:15,019
sense

603
00:21:11,089 --> 00:21:19,039
stir counterclockwise again this is all

604
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:20,329
about bonding of certain molecules so I

605
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,500
know it sounds crazy you guys we do

606
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:23,689
research on that if you'd like to

607
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,630
stirring your solution counterclockwise

608
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,220
will have a difference in bonding of

609
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,290
molecules in your solution if you're

610
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,380
interested read about that it's very

611
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:36,259
interesting alright so we've got all of

612
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,880
our products stirred into our water it

613
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:39,679
has all been stirred counterclockwise

614
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,270
it's all at the appropriate temperature

615
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,860
it's hanging out for a couple of seconds

616
00:21:41,269 --> 00:21:46,519
getting all mixed in together now it's

617
00:21:42,859 --> 00:21:48,649
time to check the ppm s why do we want

618
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,529
to check the PPM s the particles per

619
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,970
million tells us how much stuff is in

620
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:55,639
our water and if you feed your plants

621
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,140
too much stuff they're gonna choke

622
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,460
they're gonna get nutrient lock out

623
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:00,710
they're gonna get burnt they're gonna

624
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:02,329
look funky so we want to make sure that

625
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:03,740
there's not too much stuff in there

626
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:06,019
not too many particles not too many

627
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:08,900
nutrients not too many elements so how

628
00:22:06,019 --> 00:22:11,569
many PPM's do we want to get our water

629
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:15,290
to that kind of depends on what phase of

630
00:22:11,569 --> 00:22:16,009
growth or bloom you are in so seedlings

631
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:17,599
in small

632
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:20,240
don't need a lot of nutrients they don't

633
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,279
need a lot of PPM's I try to start off

634
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:26,089
at a lower ppm for my smaller plants

635
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:28,308
somewhere around 600 to 900 PPM's for

636
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:30,470
the small stuff like the small veg

637
00:22:28,308 --> 00:22:33,410
plants and cups and small pots as they

638
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:36,589
get bigger I do increase by week four

639
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,690
I'm usually up to about 1500 PPM's in

640
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:40,428
veg I don't really go too hard with the

641
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,798
nutrients I give them base nutrients

642
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,059
potassium silicates cal-mag I'll give

643
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,369
them some stuff to keep them moving

644
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:48,589
route wise but they really don't get a

645
00:22:46,369 --> 00:22:50,209
whole lot of nutrients in the veg phase

646
00:22:48,589 --> 00:22:52,939
I just want them to grow I want them to

647
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,250
get stout I want them to be healthy so

648
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:58,340
once we start flowering that's when I

649
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:59,960
kind of start boosting it up I week one

650
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:02,779
of flowering I'll probably start off

651
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,808
right about maybe a thousand or 1300 ppm

652
00:23:02,779 --> 00:23:08,960
and then I will increase I until I hit

653
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:10,940
honestly I'll get close to 1900 PPM's

654
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,798
but honestly I would not recommend if

655
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,750
you're using bottled nutrients and

656
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,359
you're not a very experienced grower you

657
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:19,579
probably shouldn't get over 17 or 18

658
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,079
hundred particles per million in your

659
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:23,089
solution or you'll start burning your

660
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:24,319
plants if you think you know what you're

661
00:23:23,089 --> 00:23:26,659
doing and you can mix and match

662
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,918
nutrients so you're not giving it too

663
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,690
much of one thing but you're

664
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,090
supplementing what's missing by adding

665
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:34,130
more PPM's then you may be able to get

666
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:35,599
away with it but be very careful because

667
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,299
once you've burnt the plants you can't

668
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,909
take that back you can give more but you

669
00:23:38,298 --> 00:23:42,859
can't take anything out honestly most of

670
00:23:40,910 --> 00:23:44,509
the feed charts that come with bottled

671
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:46,189
nutrients these days most of them are

672
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:48,140
pretty accurate if you follow that feed

673
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:51,230
chart maybe you reduce it maybe use

674
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,520
about 75% of what the bottle says most

675
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:54,470
of the companies will make a feed chart

676
00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:56,179
you can find it online follow that and

677
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,519
it won't get you over seventeen or

678
00:23:56,179 --> 00:24:00,410
eighteen hundred ppm and then see what

679
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,269
that chart does and adjust from there if

680
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,470
you want to go a little harder go for it

681
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:05,599
if you realize you need to go a little

682
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,339
wider go for it that's something that

683
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,409
you could do so you've got your solution

684
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:10,759
mixed up you're checking your ppm s if

685
00:24:09,410 --> 00:24:13,519
you feel like it's right where you want

686
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:15,710
it now you need to adjust the pH if you

687
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,240
feel like the ppm s are too high if you

688
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,090
feel like it's too hot for your plants

689
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,710
you can simply add water if you've got

690
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:23,659
everything mixed up and the PPM's are

691
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,919
hitting more than you want for that week

692
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,870
and you feel like it's too hot for the

693
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,940
plants add a little bit of water if

694
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:29,449
you're using RO water put RO water in

695
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,100
there

696
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:33,680
if you're using tap water add more tap

697
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:35,509
water get your ppm meter and put it in

698
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,980
your solution that's mixed up and then

699
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:39,529
get your regular water and just slowly

700
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,390
add it and watch the numbers on your ppm

701
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:43,460
meter go down and then once you've get

702
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:45,200
it to the acceptable appropriate number

703
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,390
then you can stop and that's when it's

704
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,539
time to adjust your pH the last thing

705
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:52,490
you do is adjust your pH now you need

706
00:24:50,539 --> 00:24:54,259
your pH meter you want to put it in the

707
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,390
water give it a little stir around give

708
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:58,490
it a couple seconds to adjust and see

709
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:00,440
where you are if it's up too high you

710
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:02,240
need to put some pH down in there if

711
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,990
you're too low you need to put some pH

712
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,140
up in there a good area for your plants

713
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:11,480
for most plants to be is six-two pH your

714
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,700
solution to 6.2 and you should be just

715
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:15,529
fine my smaller plants I go a little

716
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:18,380
lower my larger plants may get a little

717
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:22,460
higher but 6-2 is a good general range

718
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:24,410
of pH for most cannabis plants I did a

719
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,240
whole episode about the importance of pH

720
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:29,090
I recorded that episode on August 10th

721
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,609
of 2015 it's actually episode number 88

722
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:33,409
and it is called the importance of pH if

723
00:25:31,609 --> 00:25:35,869
you want to check that out it is still

724
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:37,400
in the feed on iTunes and stitcher and

725
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:40,849
it's on the website I read genetics

726
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,500
Colorado calm there are a hundred

727
00:25:40,849 --> 00:25:44,269
episodes available there so if you want

728
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:47,390
to go back in history check those out

729
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:50,900
again it's episode number 88 it's called

730
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,610
the importance of pH all right you guys

731
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,259
so we've got our reservoir filled we've

732
00:25:52,609 --> 00:25:55,789
got our nutrients mixed in there we've

733
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:57,589
got our PPM's adjusted to the

734
00:25:55,789 --> 00:25:59,809
appropriate ppm store it won't be too

735
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:01,869
strong of a solution for our plants we

736
00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:04,190
have got our pH adjusted to

737
00:26:01,869 --> 00:26:05,959
approximately 62 or whatever you're

738
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:08,210
finding appropriate for your garden at

739
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:10,039
this stage of its life now let's talk

740
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,960
about actually physically feeding the

741
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:14,539
plants if you're running an auto hydro

742
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:17,420
system or a soil or soil s or cocoa

743
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:19,879
system that's on a drip system make sure

744
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:22,610
that the plants get that the root zone

745
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,720
that the soil gets fully saturated when

746
00:26:22,609 --> 00:26:26,329
you water those plants with your

747
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,160
automation system you have to figure out

748
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:30,710
how long it comes on and how frequently

749
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,779
that watering system comes on I am going

750
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:34,519
to do an entire episode about building a

751
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,829
watering system and getting that set up

752
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:39,019
so that will be probably 2 or 3 episodes

753
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:42,529
from now I may put out put that one out

754
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:43,849
as a Thursday bonus episode so if you're

755
00:26:42,529 --> 00:26:46,759
running an automated system May

756
00:26:43,849 --> 00:26:50,058
we focus on getting everything saturated

757
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:52,429
let it dry kind of and then saturate it

758
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:54,019
again you need a timer you'll have to

759
00:26:52,429 --> 00:26:55,519
run the timer and see how long it takes

760
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:56,808
to saturate the plants and then you'll

761
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:58,429
have to pay attention to how long it

762
00:26:56,808 --> 00:27:00,259
takes him to dry and then you'll have to

763
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:01,880
make that timer run again so its

764
00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:03,558
duration and interval is what you're

765
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,780
gonna have to figure out it's not too

766
00:27:03,558 --> 00:27:06,980
hard it just takes a day to do it that's

767
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:08,569
pretty much how you're gonna have to set

768
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:13,038
up any drip system with any sort of

769
00:27:08,569 --> 00:27:14,659
hydro or cocoa or soilless mix just make

770
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,009
sure that if you're using cubes or

771
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:17,480
whatever you're using make sure that

772
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:19,279
they get fully saturated and that

773
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,259
they've got the appropriate dry time and

774
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,788
then just repeat that cycle over and

775
00:27:21,259 --> 00:27:24,589
over as the plants get larger and

776
00:27:22,788 --> 00:27:27,288
further into the flower phase you may

777
00:27:24,589 --> 00:27:30,500
have to increase either the duration of

778
00:27:27,288 --> 00:27:31,849
watering or the less interval between

779
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,750
waterings is something you'll have to

780
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:33,889
think about but you'll see that

781
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:35,509
happening as it grows and we're gonna

782
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,220
talk more about that and that auto

783
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:39,919
watering episode that's coming up so

784
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:42,319
let's talk about watering your soil or

785
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:46,220
cocoa or soilless mix plants that are in

786
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:48,019
pots um maybe you're watering with a

787
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:49,548
pitcher maybe you're going to the

788
00:27:48,019 --> 00:27:51,829
reservoir just getting a pitcher like I

789
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:53,418
use and my personal grow I use like a

790
00:27:51,829 --> 00:27:55,308
kool-aid pitcher I use a one gallon

791
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:56,809
plastic pitcher I use two of them so

792
00:27:55,308 --> 00:28:00,200
that I could scoop water with both hands

793
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:02,750
my plants are in seven gallon pots so

794
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,240
they're not too too low I can reach them

795
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:06,349
just by kind of doing a short band I can

796
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,058
walk down the middle of the row and

797
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:10,038
water two plants at a time I scoop water

798
00:28:08,058 --> 00:28:12,319
out of the rez turn a little bit water

799
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:14,900
to plants so I used the kool-aid pitcher

800
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,960
if the commercial girl I use a water

801
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,788
wand I put a pump in a trash can

802
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,308
which is the reservoir the trash cans on

803
00:28:19,788 --> 00:28:23,929
wheels I put a pump there it's like a

804
00:28:22,308 --> 00:28:25,579
sump pump that plugs into the wall that

805
00:28:23,929 --> 00:28:27,950
runs to a hose which runs to a water

806
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:29,599
wand that water wand I basically squeeze

807
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:31,850
a trigger and the water comes out it's

808
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,288
got about a two foot attachment

809
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:34,639
extension on it so that I can get to the

810
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:36,019
plants that are at the end of the rows

811
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,000
that's why I like the water want for the

812
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:40,908
commercial grow so I either use the

813
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,319
pitcher or a water wand however you want

814
00:28:40,909 --> 00:28:44,390
to do it is find the water wand you tend

815
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,619
to make a little bit of a mess with the

816
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,210
pitcher you can kind of put the water

817
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:49,668
where you want it I feel like the

818
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,130
pitcher is more time efficient because I

819
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:54,049
can grab water and pour it grab water

820
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:55,429
and pour it in it there's no time for it

821
00:28:54,048 --> 00:28:57,009
to come out it just pours out of the

822
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:58,480
picture but the water wand

823
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,099
with the seven count with the five

824
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,610
gallon pot if the commercial grow I

825
00:29:00,099 --> 00:29:06,399
count to 70 as I water I count one two

826
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:08,829
three four five and it takes me to 72

827
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:11,230
water a 5-gallon pot appropriately so

828
00:29:08,829 --> 00:29:12,879
that takes it's probably 50 seconds of

829
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:14,980
me counting to 70 that's how fast I just

830
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,240
probably over a count time but that's a

831
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:19,450
lot of time so I prefer the pitcher

832
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:21,250
method anyway you do it soak the plant

833
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,529
when you are watering the plants make

834
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:26,740
sure you fully saturate that root zone

835
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:28,779
all that soil needs to get wet you want

836
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,460
to see some runoff you want at least a

837
00:29:28,779 --> 00:29:31,869
little bit of runoff if you got catch

838
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,090
trees underneath your plants if you're

839
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:36,428
in the table you want to see runoff from

840
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:38,349
every single plant I like to know that

841
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,480
every inch of soil inside that pot got

842
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:41,980
saturated with nutrients and water so

843
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,929
that when those roots when it does start

844
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,700
to dry out and those roots go growing in

845
00:29:43,929 --> 00:29:47,650
there they find those nutrients in that

846
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:50,140
soil and it's like hey there's some more

847
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,450
stuff for me to eat and it's really good

848
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:54,640
to saturate the whole thing I think so

849
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,890
make sure you saturate your entire root

850
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,200
ball get a little bit of runoff and then

851
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,330
let them start to dry out over the next

852
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,029
few days and I don't water until they

853
00:30:01,329 --> 00:30:05,500
get kind of dry I like to pick them up

854
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:06,879
and see how light they are once they

855
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,410
start getting light that's when they

856
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,320
need water you'll know the difference

857
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:13,000
you'll start learning the difference I

858
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,879
also like to watch for when the leaves

859
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,929
start to droop just a little bit

860
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,850
normally the if you're doing it right

861
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:20,590
your leaves are facing up just a little

862
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:21,069
bit they're praying if you're doing a

863
00:30:20,589 --> 00:30:22,928
good job

864
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,639
the leaves are horizontal well they

865
00:30:22,929 --> 00:30:26,380
start getting thirsty they'll start to

866
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,110
curl down and hang and droop just a

867
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,000
little bit as soon as you see that droop

868
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:32,769
is when those plants want water that is

869
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,558
the most ideal time to water those

870
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:37,389
plants if you can figure out that timing

871
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:39,849
from when you water them to when that

872
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:41,710
droop barely starts and water them right

873
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:45,129
then every time your plants will be as

874
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,660
happy as they can be so try to find that

875
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:48,309
timing that sweet spot of right before

876
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,470
they droop and when they get super light

877
00:30:48,308 --> 00:30:53,109
and then water them right then and it

878
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,390
will get easier the more you go the more

879
00:30:53,109 --> 00:30:56,589
you grow the less these things will seem

880
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,730
like a challenge to you you'll get

881
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:59,199
you'll walk in the grove and you'll be

882
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:00,970
able to see you'll go home I can tell by

883
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,950
looking at the top of the soil that that

884
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:05,079
plant needs water you'll get good at it

885
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:06,789
don't worry just keep practicing so soak

886
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:10,389
the entire plan give it some time to dry

887
00:31:06,789 --> 00:31:10,779
then re soak it then watch the leaves

888
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,790
for

889
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:14,740
indicators of issues you guys if your

890
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:15,940
leaves start doing funny [ __ ] that tells

891
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:18,099
you that there's something wrong with

892
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:19,660
the feeding your leaves are gonna tell

893
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:21,099
you if the plants were over watered if

894
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:23,500
the plants are over watered they're

895
00:31:21,099 --> 00:31:25,449
going to start making a claw if that's

896
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:27,430
over watered or too cold it will look

897
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,170
very similar the leaves will still be

898
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:31,150
horizontal and they won't droop but they

899
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,980
will claw up they will start to look

900
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,210
like just hold your hand out straight

901
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:36,130
and then make a call like you're a

902
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:37,990
monster that claw shape that's what your

903
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:39,970
leaves will start doing if they are over

904
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:41,589
watered if they are under watered

905
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:43,870
they'll just start drooping they'll just

906
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:45,849
go limp and start hanging down if they

907
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:47,619
get severely under water the top to your

908
00:31:45,849 --> 00:31:49,539
plants will just start drooping over and

909
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:51,789
they'll look dead you'll be able to see

910
00:31:49,539 --> 00:31:54,009
it it's sad you'll be scared of [ __ ] if

911
00:31:51,789 --> 00:31:56,230
your plants do get to that sort of a

912
00:31:54,009 --> 00:31:58,150
dryness I recommend that you don't water

913
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,250
them with full strength nutrients right

914
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:02,140
away I would water them with light

915
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,299
nutrients just to get them alive and

916
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:07,780
back to life and woken up and then feed

917
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:09,069
them with nutrients later on because the

918
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:11,230
way I see it is I don't want to get

919
00:32:09,069 --> 00:32:13,059
woken up to a big gigantic meal I don't

920
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,529
want to eat spaghetti and meatballs and

921
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:16,329
garlic bread first thing in the morning

922
00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:18,220
I'd rather have maybe some oatmeal and

923
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:20,289
some OJ to get myself started maybe some

924
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,759
fruit and I feel plants are the same way

925
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:22,930
you don't know in there that droopy you

926
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,879
just want to hydrate them and get

927
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:26,769
a-movin you don't want to clog them up

928
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,970
with more food I don't know maybe some

929
00:32:26,769 --> 00:32:30,039
of you guys want to wake up and eat a

930
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:32,680
steak right away but that is not how I'm

931
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:34,480
gonna roll okay so under water we talked

932
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,759
about that burn if the plants start

933
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,529
looking like they are getting crispy or

934
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:40,329
if they're getting funky on the edges or

935
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:41,799
if they have rust looking spots on them

936
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:44,199
you may be giving them too much

937
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:45,909
nutrients if the edges of your leaves

938
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,269
are starting to get crispy and over

939
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,160
sharp you may be using too much cal-mag

940
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:53,019
pay attention to the leaves if you need

941
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,630
to reduce your nutrients you can do that

942
00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:57,730
but that burn is probably not going to

943
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:58,990
go away keep an eye on the new growth

944
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:01,390
and make sure that you're not burning

945
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,460
the new growth it is okay if leaves get

946
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:06,160
funky it is okay to go ahead and remove

947
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,539
a leaf don't be worried just cut it

948
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,670
right off or pull it off with your

949
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:11,379
fingers there are probably more leaves

950
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,640
coming to back that one up one thing

951
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:14,560
I've noticed is when you take off leaves

952
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,900
the plants will just replace it if it

953
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,700
needs it also the leaves are gonna tell

954
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,800
you if you have any sort of deficiency

955
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,960
if your leaves start getting pale yellow

956
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,049
if the plants are going slow and not

957
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,509
growing fast enough

958
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:28,430
probably are missing some nutrients and

959
00:33:26,509 --> 00:33:31,430
you could probably increase your ppm s

960
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:32,930
also that could be a pH issue you could

961
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,180
have a lot of problems if you're showing

962
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:36,920
deficiencies quite often pH issues

963
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,890
disguise themselves as deficiencies I

964
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:41,240
talk a lot about that in episode 88 so

965
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,730
pay a lot of attention to the leaves you

966
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:46,460
guys paying attention to the leaves will

967
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,099
really help but also keep notes if you

968
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:52,130
keep notes of what you mixed into the

969
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:53,659
solution and what you fed try to write

970
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:55,850
down what you mixed turn it right down

971
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:57,950
the pH and try to write down the ppm s

972
00:33:55,849 --> 00:34:00,409
of every feeding write down the date and

973
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,480
time and also take notes of anything you

974
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,070
saw in the grow room that day so that

975
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,870
you can look back and you can have a

976
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:08,569
chart and some history and you can say

977
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:10,549
oh look on this day my pH was a little

978
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:12,530
high and now this plant is acting funky

979
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:14,630
and now I know that I need to make the

980
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:17,960
pH lower and that's how I've learned

981
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:20,240
that like OG Kush plants the cushier the

982
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,070
plant the more calm agate wants just

983
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,719
stuff like golden go is always macro

984
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,760
deficient there's just stuff like that

985
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,678
that you learn and you can you can

986
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,910
really boost up the macronutrients with

987
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,309
golden good it's just stuff you learn

988
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:33,678
from growing specific plants over and

989
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:36,259
over again so learn from each watering

990
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,760
learn from your notes I think that will

991
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,560
be beneficial take a lot of notes you

992
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,240
guys I take a lot of notes that is

993
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:44,418
definitely a huge part of what makes me

994
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:46,129
a better grower all right I feel like I

995
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:48,219
have covered the basics and maybe a

996
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:51,079
little bit of more than the basics of

997
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:52,579
mixing your nutrients and properly

998
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,319
watering your plants to properly

999
00:34:52,579 --> 00:34:55,069
saturate the soil and give them some

1000
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,130
time to dry out

1001
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,480
now I posted to Facebook that I was

1002
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,710
seeking help and guidance for this

1003
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,630
episode because I wanted to make sure

1004
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:04,789
that I didn't miss anything and when I

1005
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,619
posted to Instagram I got a couple of

1006
00:35:04,789 --> 00:35:08,480
replies that I felt I wanted to share

1007
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:10,639
with you the first one comes from

1008
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,469
dragonfly Earth Medicine the question

1009
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,480
that I posted Instagram basically said

1010
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:16,129
hey I'm writing a podcast about growing

1011
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,230
with bottled nutrients does anybody have

1012
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:20,210
any guidance the folks at dragonfly

1013
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:22,219
Earth Medicine said more importantly

1014
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:23,659
what bottled nutrients make sure you

1015
00:35:22,219 --> 00:35:26,750
read ingredients and make sure it is

1016
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:28,519
healthy for mind body and soil let's

1017
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,349
also remember there are only six

1018
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:32,269
companies that sell synthetics and all

1019
00:35:30,349 --> 00:35:34,250
fertilizer companies are from those six

1020
00:35:32,269 --> 00:35:35,690
companies and then they also say that

1021
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:37,719
brewing is only expanding your

1022
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:39,639
microbiology so if you're brewing since

1023
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,439
you're wasting your time it is

1024
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:43,449
counter-intuitive to brew synthetics it

1025
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,730
is like treating your body herbally and

1026
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:49,149
doing a round of antibiotics at the end

1027
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:50,650
so the important part here was that we

1028
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:52,869
need to pay a little bit of attention to

1029
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:54,639
where our products are coming from and

1030
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:56,500
what we are putting into the products

1031
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,179
that we are calling medicine so pay

1032
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,400
attention make sure that what you're

1033
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:03,250
using is healthy for your mind body and

1034
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,970
your soil I also got another message on

1035
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:09,849
Instagram this one says if you add a

1036
00:36:06,969 --> 00:36:11,618
form of high quality fulvic acid to your

1037
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:13,869
guys water before anything else

1038
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,940
it helps buffer ph of your solution and

1039
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:20,170
provide a natural form of chelation

1040
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:22,450
without adding any p + PK or ppm s to

1041
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:24,639
your water it works and any type of

1042
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:26,199
setup super cost-efficient and it helps

1043
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,179
your plants to naturally and easily

1044
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:30,549
uptake the nutrients and minerals you

1045
00:36:28,179 --> 00:36:33,339
give them especially the hard ones such

1046
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:36,130
as iron so this guy recommends that we

1047
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:38,829
add a form of high-quality fulvic acid

1048
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,410
and he recommends full power or Shilla

1049
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:43,929
JIT as the brand to use and he says it

1050
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:45,309
will he says to add that before adding

1051
00:36:43,929 --> 00:36:48,730
anything else and it will help buffer

1052
00:36:45,309 --> 00:36:50,619
your pH and it will help your plants

1053
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:52,210
uptake your nutrients better so that's

1054
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:54,460
always helpful then here's the part that

1055
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,019
really got my attention he said also we

1056
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,240
should completely move away from harmful

1057
00:36:56,019 --> 00:36:59,920
and non regenerative farming practices

1058
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,108
such as synthetic fertilizer programs

1059
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,750
that aren't sustainable and do more harm

1060
00:37:02,108 --> 00:37:06,429
than good to our Gardens planet and its

1061
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:09,369
limited natural life-sustaining

1062
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:11,348
resources of life such as water land and

1063
00:37:09,369 --> 00:37:12,579
clean air he goes on to say there's

1064
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:14,200
nothing wrong with using bottled

1065
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:15,940
nutrients or other forms of farming but

1066
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:17,469
we must still be aware of the effects we

1067
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,358
have on our planet and fellow man

1068
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:21,819
through our action or worse yet in

1069
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:24,159
action he said I feared I'd touch on

1070
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:26,950
that last part my shameless alternative

1071
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,230
techniques promoting that came from a

1072
00:37:26,949 --> 00:37:31,629
guy who calls himself el OS gardens on

1073
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:33,429
instagram l OS underscore Gardens hey I

1074
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:35,320
appreciate it because we all need to be

1075
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:36,699
reminded occasionally to pay attention

1076
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,320
to where our products are coming from

1077
00:37:36,699 --> 00:37:39,519
and what we're putting into ourselves

1078
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,289
and our Gardens

1079
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:44,650
I appreciate the insight and I

1080
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:46,329
appreciate the help and advice you guys

1081
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:48,369
I understand that not everybody is able

1082
00:37:46,329 --> 00:37:50,889
to grow organically not everybody lives

1083
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:51,610
in a farm area I understand that a lot

1084
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:53,199
of us live in

1085
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:55,059
city's a lot of us have our neighbors

1086
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:56,289
right next door I can almost reach out

1087
00:37:55,059 --> 00:37:57,880
one of my windows and touch my

1088
00:37:56,289 --> 00:37:59,619
neighbor's house is how close we are

1089
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,510
I completely understand that we don't

1090
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:03,429
all have space to do organic farming

1091
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:05,020
practices I understand that we can all

1092
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:06,399
conceal the odors and the extra

1093
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:08,619
ingredients in the extra steps I

1094
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,869
understand that I'm not judging you if

1095
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,609
you need to use bottled nutrients let's

1096
00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:13,960
do it I use bottled nutrients myself

1097
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:15,430
let's just think a little bit while

1098
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:17,170
we're doing it let's not try to support

1099
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:18,699
companies that don't support us and

1100
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:20,500
companies that don't support the

1101
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:22,960
environment you get to choose where your

1102
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:25,119
money goes so choose wisely I want to

1103
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,619
thank everybody who commented and

1104
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,239
replied on my Facebook and Instagram

1105
00:38:26,619 --> 00:38:30,699
post that helped me put this episode

1106
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:32,679
together I truly do appreciate it I also

1107
00:38:30,699 --> 00:38:34,210
want to thank everybody they'll listen

1108
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:36,009
to the bonus episode that I put out

1109
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:38,019
Thursday you guys if you did not listen

1110
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,970
to the episode that I put out Thursday

1111
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:41,079
about seasonal affective disorder you

1112
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:42,879
may want to go give that a listen

1113
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,349
especially if you live in one of the

1114
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,030
colder winter climates where we are

1115
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:48,309
freezing our asses off for the past few

1116
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,400
weeks it may be a good episode for you

1117
00:38:48,309 --> 00:38:53,110
to listen to also I have found two

1118
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:55,630
solutions for the folks that have been

1119
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:57,550
asking for old podcast episodes I have

1120
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:59,559
got a short-term solution and a

1121
00:38:57,550 --> 00:39:01,150
long-term solution they are under way I

1122
00:38:59,559 --> 00:39:02,679
am NOT going to tell you what I'm going

1123
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,960
to do because they are not there yet

1124
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:06,339
once they are out I will tell you all

1125
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,909
about it you guys will be able to give

1126
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:09,490
it a listen

1127
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:11,139

1130
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:18,070
ass I will get those episodes out to you

1131
