appreciate it uh as always I need to

33
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,040
give a big shout out to the Mystic Roots

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:17,520
man for letting me play their music on

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,880
the show big huge thanks to cat and coup

36
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,399
and the Mystic Roots crew um I usually

37
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:23,640
do an ad but sea just said something

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,400
that really got my attention here uh he

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,239
said that NPK value no longer matters to

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,359
him uh would you like to elaborate that

41
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:33,798
now that I've got some microphones

42
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:36,959
turned on yeah so uh I think mpk uh with

43
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,360
Organic true organic gardening isn't a

44
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,519
necessity that's something that is in PK

45
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,478
value is all synthetic it was invented

46
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:48,239
for synthetic fertilizers okay as a way

47
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:50,039
to sell them exactly um you know you're

48
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,239
you're just giving the plant what they

49
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,799
need when they need it uh and the reason

50
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:57,718
I brought this up to you is actually saw

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,479
a post earlier today and it was uh out

52
00:01:57,718 --> 00:02:02,158
of a publication I'll just read it for

53
00:01:59,478 --> 00:02:05,879
you quick do it give credit to who it is

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,118
okay so uh this is plant and prosper uh

55
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,359
you he's a really cool guy if you don't

56
00:02:08,118 --> 00:02:13,199
follow him on Instagram it's plantor

57
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:17,560
inore Prosper sweet I saw him throw this

58
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:21,318
up earlier it's uh Justin Von liebig

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,878
he's actually credited with creating

60
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:26,119
synthetic fertilizers so here's a little

61
00:02:23,878 --> 00:02:28,679
excerpt that plant Prosper posted from a

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,159
book that he was reading NPK gardeners

63
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,120
owned their practices to the great

64
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:35,199
scientist Justin Von Li big the father

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,000
of artificial fertilizers what most

66
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,839
don't know is that later in life Von Li

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
big acknowledged a grave mistake in

68
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,719
relying only on chemistry in fact he saw

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,759
negative impacts of artificial

70
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:47,400
fertilizers on life in the soil and his

71
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,359
own vegetable garden and thereafter

72
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,920
preferred organic matter to inorganic

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,319
chemical fertilizer he invented to quote

74
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,000
Von Li big after I learned the reason

75
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,158
why my fertilizers weren't effective in

76
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,959
the proper way I was like a person that

77
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:02,560
received a new life understanding how

78
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,759
nutrients will make us work will make us

79
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,759
all see the light and then ultimately

80
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:08,919
make us better gardeners with no with

81
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:11,079
more sustainable Gardens sorry kind of

82
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:12,679
buered that at the end oh no that's uh

83
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:15,000
that's pretty much been your message the

84
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,080
whole time anyway yeah is it the uh the

85
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,919
synthetics are disrupting the E life the

86
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,640
organic life in the plants and that we

87
00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:22,639
need to get away from that and uh have I

88
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,759
said on the show that you brought me a

89
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,238
bokashi bucket have I said that yet uh

90
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:27,598
no I last show I mentioned I was going

91
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,680
to bring it to you but yeah okay well I

92
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:30,000
got to give you a big thanks for that

93

one uh big thanks and shout out to the

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,280
Rocky Mountain worm company Sean brought

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,799
me a Bashi bucket so I'm one step closer

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,199
to becoming organic as [ __ ] hell yeah I

97
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,120
ordered one last week too sweet let me

98
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:44,199
know how it goes we Bashi together yeah

99
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,239
we'll be Bashi buddies Bashi Bros and

100
00:03:44,199 --> 00:03:49,719
don't don't say that out loud little

101
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:50,878
we all the Growers are like sounds fun

102
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,120
everybody else is like what the hell are

103
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,759
those guys doing I'm going to Bashi with

104
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,759
Jeff we got to go

105
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,959
class that's like the purple kangi

106
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:02,239
purple kangi Club wi and purple too I

107
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,479
took a lot of pictures today shout out

108
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,640
to the kangi Kush that's a sweet strain

109
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,679
so what were you saying about the NPK so

110
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,958
yeah basically NPK was created uh with

111
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,840
synthetic fertilizers is kind of you

112
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:17,199
know the basis behind it you you give PL

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,759
nitrogen when it needs it you give the

114
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,160
plant phosphorus and potassium when they

115
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,240
need it or when you think they need it

116
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,960
and you byass this natural process and

117
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,720
by doing that when you when you bypass

118
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,478
this process basically you're just Le

119
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,639
leaving the salts the mineral salts and

120
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:35,159
everything that's left over from the

121
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,759
fertilizer that's not immediately taken

122
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,919
up by the plants Roots you're leaving

123
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,879
that in the dirt because you've bypassed

124
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:42,959
all natural chemistry it's not being

125
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:44,879
digested it's not being broken down it

126
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,478
stays there it's like what you were

127
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,560
saying about uh CO2 in synthetic rooms

128
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,120
in the last episode yeah exactly there's

129
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,240
yeah there's nothing that you know I'm

130
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,759
going to have some numbers on that here

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,759
that's basically if I just drank uh

132
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:00,639
Gatorade all day or something salty all

133
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:02,280
day I can't say cuz they'll sue the [ __ ]

134
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,038
out of me but if I drink some if I just

135
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,079
put salt water all day that's

136
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:06,279
essentially what we're feeding the

137
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:08,079
plants by feeding them synthetic

138
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,159
nutrients exactly like you'll you'll pee

139
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,038
out the water but the salt stay in there

140
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,880
you know I mean it's you it's not good

141
00:05:12,038 --> 00:05:15,120
for you it's not good for the plant

142
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,120
someone's going to say but I flush

143
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,959
heavily but you don't flush often enough

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
I don't think even if you get run off

145
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,079
that salt is still binding to your

146
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,918
because your plant has to metabolize it

147
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,399
and what it does metabolize is still

148
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:27,959
coming out of the roots as well so

149
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,318
you've got the extra buildup you put in

150
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,758
there you got the part that was never

151
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:32,199
used used and then you got the part that

152
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:33,879
was metabolized you got a lot of salt

153
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,879
stuck in there using the synthetics well

154
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,959
and then it also forms the plant too so

155
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:41,478
it's in the plant materials as well yeah

156
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,918
you got to smoke those salts right yeah

157
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:44,038
salts what are you rolling up dude

158
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:45,680
because you're a couple feet away from

159
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:48,240
me and that [ __ ] smells delicious over

160
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,560
here I swear it's getting stronger I

161
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,280
think that I brought the Wi-Fi Tahoe the

162
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,478
Wi-Fi Tahoe smells delicious did you

163
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:56,758
grow that uh no no I picked it up from a

164
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,120
local shop up in the springs nice shout

165
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,400
out to that local shop in the springs

166
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:05,478
good work yeah but uh yeah so with the

167
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:07,758
mpk uh we don't rely on the numbers we

168
00:06:05,478 --> 00:06:10,918
rely on more of what it's called The

169
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,639
nutritive Cycle Theory so it's you know

170
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,680
the plant it's kind of like a person you

171
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:20,240
know the plant's a baby it's growing it

172
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,439
needs things to Aid in you know its

173
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,280
vegetative growth so that's where your

174
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:28,120
nitrogen comes in that's

175
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:29,758
where the those your potassium comes in

176
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,360
to help strengthen those cell walls as

177
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,639
your plants get bigger to make sure you

178
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,639
know that everything's going properly

179
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,879
instead of giving the plant directly

180
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,879
what it needs what we'll do is we'll let

181
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,800
the plant decide for itself all of those

182
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:42,918
things will be available in the soil and

183
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,960
not in the sense that we're going to

184
00:06:42,918 --> 00:06:47,680
load it down without falam meal or bone

185
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:51,079
meal or blood meal but we'll we the soil

186
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,639
will have an mpk value usually you know

187
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:57,399
I calculated last time and just with the

188
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,840
real basic mix of like neem and Kaja and

189
00:06:57,399 --> 00:07:02,279
Kel meal and things like that I think we

190
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,159
were running around like a 324 is kind

191
00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,959
of what the fertilizer quote unquote was

192
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,439
coming out at that's fairly low but I'm

193
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:09,399
sure you got I'm sure that plant got

194
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:11,000
everything it needed yeah and that's and

195
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,598
that's where we come from is you know

196
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,319
that's the reason that when you go to

197
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:17,759
the grow store you'll see that organic

198
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:21,240
fertilizers are like zero or you know

199
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,680
1.23 or these extremely low numbers and

200
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,840
people see that and they're like oh

201
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,879
that's the other one says 0 60 like

202
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,758
that's going to yield me way more and

203
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,879
that's that's an that's a common

204
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:35,720
misconception you it's

205
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,199
not I mean you will get bigger buds

206
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,599
using that they're not going to be the

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,000
tastiest or the cleanest in the world if

208
00:07:38,598 --> 00:07:41,439
I ate a bunch of pennies I would feel

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,959
full but I just [ __ ] out a bunch of

210
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:45,240
pennies exactly and I would yeah I

211
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,758
wouldn't get anything from it I'll argue

212
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,639
that you're not necessarily going to get

213
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,360
bigger buds from it um right a lot of

214
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:56,038
the like the you know 00 60 that sounds

215
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,120
like a a powdered uh Bloom booster and

216
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:00,478
uh those things can really [ __ ] your

217
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,680
plan up in a hurry if you uh try to go

218
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:06,918
too crazy with them they're

219
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,639
yeah yeah I like I said I as far as the

220
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:11,639
whole mpk thing I I wouldn't stress it

221
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,280
I'd make sure that when you you go into

222
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,960
your cycle make sure your soil's amended

223
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:19,119
properly and then is you know make sure

224
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,758
that you're feeding it it beneficial

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,879
bacteria that it's getting everything it

226
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,560
needs if you

227
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,240
know it'll have alphalpha in it it'll

228
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,639
have kelp in it if you need that booster

229
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,038
you can always top dress with like a

230
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,799
fish bone meal or make a nettle tea or a

231
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:36,559
Yaro tea there are many different

232
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,519
options and

233
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,439
those while they may not be high in mpk

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,879
that's what they're predominant with and

235
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,800
that's going to you know that's going to

236
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,120
get the you enter that into the soil

237
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,278
that's going to get the bacteria and the

238
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,799
fungi cycling whatever nutrient you just

239
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:51,159
ingested you know you entered into the

240
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,639
soil so they're just going to keep

241
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:54,120
carrying on that process and keep

242
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,639
delivering it to your plant as your

243
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,519
plant needs it does your plant know when

244
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:00,958
to stop eating at that point if it's it

245
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,799
it'll be like oh so you can't you're not

246
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,039
you don't run as much risk of burning it

247
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,000
with the Organics is something I've

248
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:08,480
noticed yeah I well when I was when I

249
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,360
really kind of first got into it I kept

250
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,839
getting a lot of nitrogen deficiencies

251
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,079
at the beginning of flour I mean like

252
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,839
every ran I did organic it would just

253
00:09:15,078 --> 00:09:19,399
for some reason I would just get these

254
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:20,640
yellow ass leaves you know week three

255
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,159
and it just it

256
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,480
sucked trying to F your feed to keep up

257
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,919
and try to do everything you can to

258
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,800
chase it yeah but in week three if

259
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,479
you're already yellow and it's yeah it's

260
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,199
a lost race and I thought that it was

261
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,639
because yeah I wasn't feeding the plant

262
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,040
enough nitrogen and that wasn't

263
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,240
necessarily the case where I really saw

264
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,480
the Improvement was when I dialed my

265
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,600
amendments back you know when I really

266
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,920
slowed things down and was like okay I'm

267
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,399
not going to pound it with stuff I'm

268
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,360
going to make sure that the you know

269
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,440
soil food web's alive that everything's

270
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,278
cycling how it needs to that everything

271
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,640
is working and will let the plant decide

272
00:09:54,278 --> 00:10:00,439
for itself and yeah I mean I haven't I

273
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,319
haven't seen you know any more I haven't

274
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,720
dealt with the deficiency in a while I

275
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,600
will say that I

276
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,120
don't I haven't ran comparisons I don't

277
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,720
run when I I don't run traditional

278
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:13,240
growth so I can't say that this is what

279
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,639
I'm you know you're going to yield

280
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:20,600
compared to this I only do my own thing

281
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:23,360
yeah um sorry I uh just trans um I just

282
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,278
made the switch back to full Organics in

283
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,360
my indoor grows um I had been using

284
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,879
bottled

285
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,399
nutrients um

286
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,159
and my my first I took the Clones my

287
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,078
first uh set of plants that we uh

288
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,759
transplanted into a good soil and

289
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:41,319
everything um we never fed them any

290
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,720
bottle nutrients or anything like that

291
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:47,600
so there wasn't any uh flushing involved

292
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,839
but I used the soil mix that was pretty

293
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,560
much what I'd been using previously um

294
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,440
when I grew indoors and I nitrogen

295
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:59,078
burned some of them I think uh the the

296
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,320
first half of the plants I transplanted

297
00:10:59,078 --> 00:11:03,799
um

298
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:06,839
used one amount of uh all the inputs and

299
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:08,278
I got yellowing instantly and you know a

300
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:10,480
lot of people could have been like oh

301
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,159
that's lack of nitrogen but I already

302
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,240
knew there was a [ __ ] ton of nitrogen in

303
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,679
there so the next night when we

304
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,079
transplanted the other half of the

305
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:20,958
plants I uh just cut the the amount in

306
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,919
half and used the half amount of

307
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:26,239
everything and those plants just

308
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,199
exploded instantly um and they're still

309
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,759
out growing you know this been 3 weeks

310
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,759
ago and they're still out growing uh the

311
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,720
plants that we transplanted the first

312
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,799
night so go easy with the Organics

313
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,000
because they're bioavailable the plants

314
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,879
are that's right there the plants can

315
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,399
eat it you don't have to yeah they don't

316
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:43,639
have to do as much work to eat that so

317
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,919
you can speed them up too much by

318
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,079
overfeeding them with a lot of these

319
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:47,479
Organics and that's something we're

320
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,159
talking about with one of our favorite

321
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,480
products is ogt and Sean was teaching me

322
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,919
how ogt can kind of speed up the

323
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,839
metabolism of your plants a little bit

324
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:58,399
too much so go easy on the ogt guys I've

325
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,920
been recommending that a lot um replace

326
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,278
that with Rocky Mountain worm castings

327
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:04,000
if you're able to I was wondering uh

328
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:08,320
when I heard I listened to the podcast

329
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,519
last night um but uh uh was wondering if

330
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,440
that could be useful and flushing in any

331
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,720
way yeah you know it can it actually

332
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,760
absolutely could that makes a lot of

333
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,240
good sense I know you're a super huge

334
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:22,799
fan of OG bowar I started using them

335
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:26,639
here recently I am so impressed with OG

336
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:30,319
bowar holy hell I mean I'm talking just

337
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,519
from the standpoint of the plan

338
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,839
overall health I mean I haven't seen a

339
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,120
damn Yellow Leaf I haven't everything's

340
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:41,480
green and waxy it's it's pretty cool I

341
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,198
mean but the that goes to the new pack I

342
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,079
I had read somewhere that somebody had

343
00:12:43,198 --> 00:12:46,240
actually mentioned hitting it because

344
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,958
you're only supposed to use the nutrient

345
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,680
pack I believe three times throughout

346
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,638
the whole cycle but I heard him about

347
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,719
introducing it a fourth time into yeah

348
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,000
about like or not even into flush I

349
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,360
think they were saying like around like

350
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,278
week you know a couple of weeks before

351
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,039
flush actually like really start cycling

352
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:04,320
in but yeah I mean that's definitely

353
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,958
something worth looking into it's a

354
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,240
great idea you guys are going to have to

355
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:09,159
start taking a lot of notes on these

356
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,680

367
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,320

375
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,720
I think that we'll we'll we'll bring it

376
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,119
out on the next episode on the next time

377
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,160
that Shawn comes over he's going to talk

378
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,120
about re amending recycled soils and

379
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,480
then he's got a a bomb to drop on the

380
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,759

383
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,560
we're going to change the way you think

384
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,159
about a certain item that most people

385
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,758
are using regularly in their lineup

386
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,159

lineup I use it regularly in my lineup

389
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:19,278

it's time to let Jesse talk about light

524
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,159
deprivation he's got a lot of notes over

525
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:32,158
there

526
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,240
um do you want me to just let you go

527
00:18:32,159 --> 00:18:34,520
about it or do you want me to ask you a

528
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,200
couple of questions I had written down

529
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:37,639
how do you think is cool you got a good

530
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,600
starting point yeah I got a good

531
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,159
starting point well then get started bro

532
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,279
Here Comes Jesse I actually don't have

533
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,000
as many notes as it looks like I haven't

534
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:49,038
even read most of this stuff this is

535
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,519
just it's really big print it is pretty

536
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:55,960
big this top paragraph or three is the

537
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:59,440
important part um this was written by

538
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:01,558
um either either Eric or Jonathan from

539
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,279
uh forever flowering green houses sweet

540
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:06,678
I was going to shout them out yeah yeah

541
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:08,759
they're great guys great products um and

542
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:14,080
I found it on a website called the

543
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:16,400
gan.com which is also a great website

544
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:19,038
um joint

545
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:22,519
break so light deprivation this is just

546
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,400
a definition that weat tastes good I uh

547
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:28,240
yeah I can uh taste the Tahoe in there

548
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,360
for sure yeah um I was having trouble

549
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,240
and I've always always had trouble uh

550
00:19:30,359 --> 00:19:36,719
explaining light depth to some people so

551
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,159
I would use someone else's definition of

552
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,400
it light deprivation AKA light dep is

553
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,520
the process of forcing plants to flower

554
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,519
with sunlight in a time of year that is

555
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,960
not normally the flowering period of the

556
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,200
sun's natural light cycle similar to

557
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,038
controlling the light cycle with the

558
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,519
grow light by turning it on and off with

559
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,960
the timer farmers can control the

560
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,119
budding cycle by blocking the sunlight

561
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,759
and making the plants think it's time to

562
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:08,798
flower um typically this is done with

563
00:20:06,759 --> 00:20:11,558
the hoop house or Greenhouse of some

564
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,240
kind um however it's not actually

565
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:17,678
necessary

566
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:19,240
um and um [ __ ] I forgot what I lost my

567
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,000
track all right so I'll recap a little

568
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,599
I'll recap a little while you catch up

569
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,119
uh basically what we're trying to do we

570
00:20:22,599 --> 00:20:25,599
want to grow outside but we want to get

571
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,359
a little bit of a jump on the outdoor

572
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:31,000
season before the police and thieves go

573
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:33,319
look for the outdoor crops so our trick

574
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,759
is to build a greenhouse outside or a

575
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:35,879
hoop house which I'll let Jesse explain

576
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,119
how to build a hoop house he's our

577
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,360
construction guy he's got a beard um and

578
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:43,519
a hammer and a truck so uh basically

579
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,759
what we need to do we want to put our

580
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,720
plants outside and outside we'll put

581
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,599
them out early before we get to our

582
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,640
flowering cycle that nature gives us

583
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,319
with the sun the sun cycles the photo

584
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,480
period is what makes these plants flower

585
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,038
so we are going to trick them we're

586
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,839
going to cover up our outdoor Greenhouse

587
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,079
or hoop house house we're going to cover

588
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,918
that up every day at the same time and

589
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,678
let them sleep for 12 hours and then

590
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,840
uncover it every morning at the same

591
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,159
time so that these plants are tricked

592
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,879
into thinking that the season has

593
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,200
changed to fall and it's time for them

594
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,640
to flower so maybe we can do this with

595
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,319
the if you schedule it right you can get

596
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,240
these going four weeks maybe three or

597
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,678
four weeks before everybody else is in

598
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,400
flower you can pull off one crop before

599
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,919
everybody else and that [ __ ] won't get

600
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,960
stolen here you can uh [ __ ] I have it

601
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,600
all figured out cuz I'm doing it myself

602
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,440
um if you put your plants out April 25th

603
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:37,480
here you will harvest um July 30th I

604
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,200
want to say wow that's early yeah yeah

605
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,400
because nobody gets a harvest till SE

606
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,600
late September early October mid October

607
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,278
yeah and that's with the 65 day strain

608
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:46,918
um you know so and you're not going to

609
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:48,400
worry about any cold you're not going to

610
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:50,200
get that freeze that everybody worries

611
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,798
about but you know in our region

612
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,080
possibly a little bit in the early

613
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:56,038
season you can put Plants back in there

614
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,960
and reflower them couldn't you you can

615
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:01,000
actually um you get two runs out of that

616
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,640
yeah two run easily um I've seen three

617
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,960
runs so actually I've seen four runs but

618
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,080
that was with a forever flowering

619
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,798
Greenhouse yeah forever flowering you

620
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,558
guys so a hoop house or a small

621
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,319
Greenhouse is the way to go if you guys

622
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,399
are trying to do this on a small level

623
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:16,038
the smallest level of light deprivation

624
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,480
I think you could do put a couple of

625
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:21,919
potted plants uh try to use a seven

626
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,278
gallon or bigger at least yeah at least

627
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,679
but I mean some people you know this is

628
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:26,599
for the guy that's just trying to do one

629
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,798
plant for himself or whatever put your

630
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:29,480
seven gallon a lot of guys are going to

631
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:31,000
use a 5 gon Bucket from Home Depot you

632
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,798

with your big ass plant in there and

637
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:44,240
every day at 6 o00 or every day at 7

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,558
o'cl whatever time you choose you got to

639
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,038
pay attention what time the sun goes

640
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,720
down uh get that plant and go put it in

641
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:51,319
a closet in the house just put it back

642
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,000

00:22:56,679 --> 00:22:59,519
night at the same time and then it has

647
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:01,000
to go back out outside under the Sun

648
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:02,879
every night at the or every day at the

649
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,839
same time as long as you give that plant

650
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,200
12 hours of consistent 12 hours of

651
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:08,879
Darkness uninterrupted every night you

652
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,519
can do a light depth like that and use

653
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,159
the sun and a closet for your grow area

654
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:16,119
here's a trick too um you don't actually

655
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,240
have to uh put it back out at the same

656
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:23,399
time just have to wait for um you know

657
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,400
10 11:00 at night you know safe time uh

658
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,440
Sun completely down no

659
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,000
lumens genius and then use a uh use your

660
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,240
Farmer's Almanac to find out what time

661
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,278
the sun goes up that morning there you

662
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,960
go yeah and typically you're probably

663
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,519
getting your first actual this is from

664
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,278
uh Jonathan a forever flowering actually

665
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,759
I'm not this smart but um you get your

666
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:48,640
first lumens probably before the sun

667
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:51,839
actually comes up yes so you know take

668
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:55,520
20 minutes off that time um but yeah

669
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:57,759
that's uh I've done it before the old

670
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:59,240
fash or the the other way of you know

671
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,798
Seven and Seven

672
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,400
and it's very tedious yeah yeah so you

673
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:05,480
can take it back outside guys bring it

674
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,679
in if the sun's going to set at 8:00

675
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,599
bring that plan in at 7:00 let it chill

676
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,278
out before you go to bed at 11: or 12 go

677
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:12,278
put it back outside cuz it's night time

678
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:13,679
or you got to find out what time the

679
00:24:12,278 --> 00:24:15,640
sun's going to come up you know it's

680
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,038
going to be 630 7:00 in the summer

681
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:19,200
probably exactly depending on where you

682
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,319
are yeah yeah so that's a good good idea

683
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,240
right there and that's basically free

684
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,639
yeah you got to buy a pot of big ass pot

685
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,120
you got to buy some soil you got to buy

686
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,679
some Rocky Mountain worms you got to buy

687
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,798
some gr Kashi you need some drag fly

688
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:32,200
Earth medicine uh a lot of cool other

689
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:33,278
[ __ ] some azomite a little bit makes

690
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,960
that up Sean's going to teach you what

691
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,278
to put in your soil in a couple episodes

692
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:39,798
put all that [ __ ] in a in a pot put a

693
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,240
nice clone of some Grateful Dog in there

694
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:44,798
throw that sucker outside yep you can do

695
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,839
it that's free weed um you could I mean

696
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,519
you could use a garage a shed you know

697
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,079
anything if it's just a couple plants

698
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,679
old grow tent I've seen uh people take a

699
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,519
big ass trash can if you got a little

700
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,000
plant you take a little big 30 something

701
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:58,480
gallon trash can drill some holes in the

702
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,159
bottom of it so that you got air flow

703
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:02,079
and just set that [ __ ] right on top of

704
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,799
it yeah I've seen him do that for hail

705
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:06,119
storms but also seen him do that for a

706
00:25:03,798 --> 00:25:07,599
shitty light dep it'll work I mean I'm

707
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:08,678
sure it work it'll work it's not going

708
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,119
to be you know it's not going to be the

709
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,360
most amazing but it's what you got so uh

710
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:14,639
do you want to teach these guys how to

711
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,719
do uh a hoop house yeah just like a

712
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,038
quick since you're since you're the man

713
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,240
with the hammer and all uh real simple

714
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:22,720
one is just you need a gravel pad or an

715
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,079
elevated area um I mean you don't need

716
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:30,319
it but you need drainage uh it keeps it

717
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,319
from being a muddy mess Jesus I'm ston

718
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,960
again um I made the mistake of not

719
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,599
smoking all day before coming at Jeff's

720
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,440
com to Jeff when you when you show up at

721
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:43,079
my spot it's dab time too you got a

722
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,399
pregame yeah you got to warm up um but

723
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:47,639
yeah I mean take two by fours lay them

724
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:51,759
down on the ground uh screw them to each

725
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:56,278
other make a big rectangle um 8 foot by

726
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:59,839
let's say 12T um so you need two 8T 2x4s

727
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:02,038
two 12T 2x4s

728
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:05,678
um make a rectangle pretty much handful

729
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:08,359
of screws um build that stake it to the

730
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,240
ground um lots of different ways to do

731
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:14,278
that uh piece of rebar or something and

732
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,079
then nail the you know nail the rebar to

733
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,398
the uh

734
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:22,960
um to the 2x4 with a fence staple or

735
00:26:19,398 --> 00:26:24,759
something like that um and then take you

736
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,679
let's see 8 or

737
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:30,720
12T he's counting he's doing he's doing

738
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,080
construction I'd say at least six uh

739
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,519
pieces of

740
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:40,158
um at least 2 in

741
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:43,480
PVC um would need to

742
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:46,960
be at least 12 or 14t long I think to

743
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,798
make the entire hoop over okay um and at

744
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,720
the front you'll screw basically you're

745
00:26:49,798 --> 00:26:54,319
just going to bend the the PVC into hoop

746
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,200
yeah into a half circle where you're

747
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,960
making kind of a it just looks like a

748
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,399
really cheap Greenhouse yeah yeah and

749
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:03,519
then you you'll use some clamps

750
00:27:00,398 --> 00:27:05,639
um uh like some conduit clamps you can

751
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,519
even just screw straight through the PVC

752
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,799
into the but I mean you got to secure it

753
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:13,398
to the 2x4 somehow so um for a 12T

754
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:16,960
Greenhouse I'd put

755
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:19,319
up four of those pieces of PVC or four

756
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:22,319
hoops and then use one as a skeleton

757
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,798
beam down the middle that that would be

758
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:27,639
at the peak um attach it with zip ties

759
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:30,398
or something like that um if you're in a

760
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:33,278
really windy area um you'll probably

761
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,918
want to beef up your material a little

762
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:39,440
yeah um like the Front Range

763
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,720
Colorado but um and then you you know

764
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,440
just throw some plastic over it and uh

765
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,038
boom you got a greenhouse uh it's pretty

766
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,080
simple some Thin see-through plastic

767
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,558
right over it yeah yeah now you've got a

768
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:53,319
weatherproof a weather resistant

769
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,240
Greenhouse yeah and then so now you

770
00:27:53,319 --> 00:27:57,439
basically built this big rectangle you

771
00:27:55,240 --> 00:28:00,519
secured the rectangle to the ground uh

772
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,880
then we took VC and made arches and then

773
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:04,880
you just made one two three four or so

774
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,919
arches you got one at each in and then a

775
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,200
couple in the middle then you take that

776
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,880
one right down the center yeah and then

777
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,038
we just drape plastic and secure the

778
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:14,080
plastic at each on the bottom on each

779
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:15,278
side mhm and then uh do you let it

780
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,678
hanging you get make some on the front

781
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,519
and back too or do you just leave the

782
00:28:16,679 --> 00:28:20,120
front back open if you're wanting to do

783
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:21,759
it cheap I just really recommend leaving

784
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,119
them open okay airow you get some air

785
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,879
flow in there yeah you're not going to

786
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,079
get unless it rains totally sideways you

787
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,799
should be legit right yeah I mean okay

788
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:31,759
you can have the plastic uh now that

789
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,319
Greenhouse is good all year right like

790
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,158
you can use that for if you don't want

791
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,798
to do light depth that's a perfect cheap

792
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:38,640
little hoop house you can a bunch of

793
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:40,839
cannabis in there 8 X 12 you can put a

794
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,000
lot of pots in there a lot fu yeah [ __ ]

795
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:44,278
yeah so guys get get some seeds going or

796
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,240
get some clones cut now because you're

797
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:47,640
going to want to get these suckers

798
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,919
outside pretty soon yeah like this is

799
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:53,240
real time stuff uh vegum inside uh we

800
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:55,840
haven't actually addressed this uh but

801
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,798
vegum inside to the size that you would

802
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:01,558
normally flip a plant um or even [ __ ]

803
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:04,359
bigger um top them a few times fim them

804
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:08,079
if you can our light dep plants are

805
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:10,719
[ __ ] G gigantic I mean um and they're

806
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:14,119
turpy they taste good they're as big as

807
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,000
an outdoor plant um when it's start

808
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,918
starts flowering Outdoors you know an

809
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,759
inground traditional or natural uh light

810
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:25,120
cycle plant so that's I mean the yield

811
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,119
is uh I'm not going to say numbers but

812
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,278
it it it's it's very much worth it okay

813
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:30,879
do it right yeah this will definitely

814
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,240
pay for itself definitely and that

815
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,760
outdoor cannabis is so good it's

816
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,120
definitely good it tastes good it's well

817
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:40,599
grown and then uh sun does amazing

818
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:42,079
things Greenhouse cannabis uh you know

819
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:45,599
has been protected from the wind and

820
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:48,359
rain so it's a a lot more frostier uh

821
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,319
looks a little more like indoor weed

822
00:29:48,359 --> 00:29:53,319
green I think Greenhouse weed is my

823
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:56,000
favorite mine too yeah for sure yeah I I

824
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:58,158
honestly prefer it to indoor Sun turps

825
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
exactly you can't match that sun yeah

826
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:01,679
that controlled environment all right so

827
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,558
we've got this hoop house and it's

828
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,679
pretty much weather resistant it's 8 by

829
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:07,558
12 uh how tall does it usually end up

830
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,000
about 78 ft tall is usually about where

831
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:11,678
we are yeah yeah the uh the one I was

832
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,440
thinking of in my head would be about 7t

833
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,399
tall I've been in the one that I've

834
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,880
pretty much been in one that you've

835
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,518
built I've been in two they were side by

836
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,320
side I know exactly what we're dealing

837
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:21,480
with here you can get some big ass your

838
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,480
points can finish 7 feet tall in here

839
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:28,000
you can get gigantic with this I've seen

840
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,599
some guys in NorCal um I mean they have

841
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:32,558
scissor lifts to uh pull the plastic

842
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:33,959
over and [ __ ] like that they're I mean

843
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,119
just all right so that's the part we're

844
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,200
going to have to talk about now we're

845
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,639
trying to make this light dep so we're

846
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,360
going to put our plants out there when

847
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,759
they're waist highish maybe a little

848
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,278
higher maybe I'm tall so I can't really

849
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:49,359
judged by that I guess when they're

850
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:51,240
about 36 to 42 in tall you want to start

851
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:52,798
inducing flour and now we can't just

852
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,038
flip the light like we used to indoors

853
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,879
to 1212 now we've got to do it like

854
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:58,359
Jesse was saying we've got to use some

855
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,880
sort of cover we got to use some kind of

856
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:02,879
tarp so you need if you've got if your

857
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,399
Greenhouse is 12T long and 8T wide

858
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,720
you're going to need like 12 x 12 at

859
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,558
least to cover it because that Arch is

860
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,558
going to take a lot more space probably

861
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:12,440
12 x 15 or so right yeah yeah yeah so

862
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,319
just get a 15 x 15 tarp just that you

863
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,200
have plenty of coverage um yeah and make

864
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:19,599
sure it's actually um it actually blocks

865
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:23,240
out the sun yeah you might have to use

866
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:26,519
two layers um I have used I get green

867
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,440
tarps um because of the green Spectrum

868
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,839
uh supposedly you know

869
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,639
that's pretty um I don't know if that's

870
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:34,119
yeah I don't know actually yeah I don't

871
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:35,678
know about the science behind that

872
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:38,798
that's just I was standing there and I

873
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:40,360
was like H green t so the point is to

874
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,918
keep out all of the light because you

875
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:45,319
need it dark so whatever time you pick

876
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:46,360
every night if you pick 7 o'cl you got

877
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:48,200
to figure out what time the sun's going

878
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:50,158
to come up but if you pick 7 o'cl you

879
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,880
got to go out to this hoop house every

880
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,720
night and cover it up with the tarp so

881
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,240
it's completely dark the first few times

882
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,679
you do it go in there and hang out wait

883
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,679
for like

884
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,360
just lay down and hang out for a little

885
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:04,480
bit close your eyes and adjust to the

886
00:32:02,359 --> 00:32:06,638
dark and if you can see any light if you

887
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,159
can see any light in there it's too much

888
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:10,319
light you got to make it darker I

889
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,039
continuously do that through the season

890
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:16,000
um yeah so it's um with tarps and

891
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:18,519
cheaper material I mean forever

892
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,759
flowering makes really nice stuff yeah

893
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,319
if you've got if you've got some money

894
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,200
to spend and some land to put it on

895
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:24,960
check out forever flowering green houses

896
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,278
well yeah that's not your backyard setup

897
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,278
though you can get just the greenhouse

898
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:29,919
Fabrics from them and sweet and they're

899
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:32,519
actually not too expensive uh I'm going

900
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:35,919
to do it this year um and they also have

901
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:37,638
a blackout tarp that's breathable so um

902
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,840
you know that's and it's not too much

903
00:32:37,638 --> 00:32:43,719
just order the tarp from them um so if

904
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:45,839
you can afford that that um otherwise

905
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,960
sent you yeah yeah

906
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,480

sweet um but uh uh damn I lost my train

910
00:32:56,038 --> 00:32:59,519
of thought thinking about their bigeon

911
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,440
hats covering it up getting dark oh yeah

912
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,880
the cheap plastic it it's going to tear

913
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,919
throughout the season um so you know uh

914
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:11,559
continuously check it have extra plastic

915
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,240
um I put plast I put the tarp and then

916
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:17,398
plastic over it so um to make sure I get

917
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,798
a Total Blackout okay yeah yeah so you

918
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,239
can't have any light in there that's our

919
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,079
Point guys so every night this is the

920
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,240
whole time you're doing this every night

921
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:26,879
somebody hopefully you hopefully you've

922
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,558
got the dedication somebody's got to go

923
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,519
out there every night and make this [ __ ]

924
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,398
dark and then every morning you have to

925
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:33,960
go out there and turn the lights on by

926
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,119
uncovering it yeah and you're going to

927
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,960
get some air you got to have to get air

928
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,959
flow in there while it's covered up so

929
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,079
think about a way to to get air flow in

930
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,000
there while you're covered you might

931
00:33:40,079 --> 00:33:45,158
need a fan towards the floor to get some

932
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,240
air in and out uh trick I use for that

933
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:50,080
is um this also helps keep everything

934
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,638
secure Sean's dedicated he just pulled

935
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,960

you you were just kind of talking about

965
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:06,879
what fabric and stuff you were going

966
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:12,440
ventilation um I'll take a booster fan

967
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:14,519
like a 10in or 12in one um and hook the

968
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,079
ducting to it um tie it to the side of

969
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:17,759
the greenhouse so it's up off the ground

970
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,480
it doesn't suck any dirt or anything

971
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,839
into the fan um set that on the floor of

972
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,800
the greenhouse uh plug it in pull your

973
00:35:22,838 --> 00:35:29,000
tarp uh hook to that have like a six

974
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,400
foot chunk of ducting and pull that out

975
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,358
wrap the plastic around it there you go

976
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,200
and make it do a couple s's on the

977
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:37,400
ground and all that good stuff so the

978
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,759
light comes in you got to bend your

979
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,000
duting to keep the lights out I know

980
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,160
everybody tells you to keep your ducting

981
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,719
straight but at this time you got to

982
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,399
bend it that's how you keep light out

983
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:47,598
and that puts a um negative pressure on

984
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,400
the greenhouse too helps suck the tarp

985
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,599
nice and tight yeah if you've got it

986
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,680
sealed up good okay yeah that's a good

987
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:58,838
idea uh use some uh some Timbers rocks

988
00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:02,000
whatever that is or whatever um to hold

989
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:06,440
the tarp down um you know once you pull

990
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,239
it over uh you can have sandbags um but

991
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,599
that'll be on the edges on the ground

992
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,239
something heavy enough to keep wind from

993
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,039
lifting taking your tarp away giving you

994
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,959
sunlight when you don't need it and then

995
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:20,119
like squeeze clamps from Harbor Freight

996
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:23,960
like uh big old alligator clips um like

997
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:27,400
a jumper cable yeah yeah um use those to

998
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:30,960
uh help secure it all to the PVC frame

999
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:33,400
um um and also close up the ends uh wrap

1000
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,559
to plastic real tight and clamp the uh

1001
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,318
clamps on them yeah all right we got a

1002
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:38,679
sweet structure we got some cover we've

1003
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:41,960
got some air

1004
00:36:38,679 --> 00:36:43,358
flow um you can do the exact opposite we

1005
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,960
got some big ass plants to go in there

1006
00:36:43,358 --> 00:36:46,559
hopefully you got some good iy genetics

1007
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,800
or some gaug green genetics or something

1008
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:50,960
to put in there that'd be pretty sweet

1009
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,200
um you can do the opposite with this

1010
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,599
also you guys if you're trying to keep

1011
00:36:52,199 --> 00:36:57,318
your growing season going longer you can

1012
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,800
put lights in this greenhouse too mhm uh

1013
00:36:57,318 --> 00:37:00,159
which sounds strange but sometimes your

1014
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,119
plants are going to flower earlier than

1015
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:03,639
you want them to in some areas if you're

1016
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,160
in a warmer place and then you can keep

1017
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:06,480
it going and then you may have to add a

1018
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:07,960
heater later in the season but if you're

1019
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,240
trying to get two grows out of it like

1020
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,119
we were talking about you can pull off

1021
00:37:09,239 --> 00:37:12,959
that light depth grow hang up a couple

1022
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,119
lights veg some plants in there all you

1023
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,039
have to do when the Sun goes down at

1024
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:17,400
night just turn on one or two lights and

1025
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,239
those will keep your plants awake so

1026
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,760
that they don't go into flower and when

1027
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,598
you're ready just take the lights down

1028
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:24,760
then you can get that whole other it can

1029
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:26,000
just be CFLs too it doesn't have to just

1030
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,200
enough to keep them awake they don't

1031
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,280
have to stay on all the time you can

1032
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:30,759
just walk through every couple hours

1033
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,119
with the light and it'll wake them up

1034
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,319
for sure and just disrupt that and they

1035
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,838
won't hurm out cuz they're out in the

1036
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,358
sun like that they'll be cool so that's

1037
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,199
a good way to get two full harvests out

1038
00:37:36,358 --> 00:37:39,920
of this cheap uh you're going to have to

1039
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:41,000
put a heater in there by the end of the

1040
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,480
season if you do it that way but you'll

1041
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,239
get two full crops out of this and if

1042
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,679
you're doing 18 by what are we doing 12

1043
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,679
by 8 yeah 12 by8 you can fit quite a few

1044
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,519
plants in there we don't want we don't

1045
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:53,039
want to get you hyped up on numbers but

1046
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,440
well it depends on your container size

1047
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,400
and your plant size right but if you're

1048
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:59,519
8T wide you can do either two or three

1049
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,039
pots yeah I mean cram them in there

1050
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,960
there's no need to have a walk space if

1051
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,079
you need to get in there just pull the

1052
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,639
plants out I mean it's freaking Outdoors

1053
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:09,720
so um you know that's uh you like to

1054
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:11,039
army crawl through your rooms yeah I'm

1055
00:38:09,719 --> 00:38:12,598
big and clumsy I leave a little bit of

1056
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:14,318
dreadlock space or I'll get a dreadlock

1057
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:16,880
hung up on a branch or something and

1058
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:20,119
that's 96 square foot of biomass if you

1059
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,640
do it right so toing lots of training

1060
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:24,838
get the plants going all right 96 Square

1061
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,838

00:39:14,679 --> 00:39:19,118
days just go right through it and empty

1087
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,519
out the inbox takes work though yeah

1088
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,160
yeah and then then you assign yourself

1089
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:23,400
tasks when you do it yes I can do this

1090
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,960
for you and then you're like oh there's

1091
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,760
more work I'm already kind of I'm

1092
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,400
already working light light Deb takes uh

1093
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,880
a lot of dedication and commitment so

1094
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,160
yes it's like ninja status but for the

1095
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,880
cost of the supplies the time you're

1096
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,960
going to do it uh you don't have to pay

1097
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:41,680
for any electricity and the Sun is free

1098
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,720
as long as you're reliable with getting

1099
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,759
out and covering and uncovering every

1100
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:47,799
day and not letting uh keeping the airf

1101
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,440
flow in there not letting it get

1102
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:52,318
stagnant in there you should be cool I

1103
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,039
think yeah um I think when Shawn comes

1104
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:56,358
to talk about his soil recycling we'll

1105
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:57,719
talk a little bit about keeping bugs

1106
00:39:56,358 --> 00:39:59,960
away unless you guys want to talk about

1107
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:04,358
bugs in the outdoor right

1108
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,318
now I mean prevention yeah prevention

1109
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:07,559
spinosad let's go for it talk about yeah

1110
00:40:06,318 --> 00:40:10,719
how are we going to keep bugs away

1111
00:40:07,559 --> 00:40:15,078
actually okay I had a friend ask me um

1112
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:17,639
about caterpillars last night so um and

1113
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:20,720
there's not a lot you can do about them

1114
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:23,480
um once it happens just you know manual

1115
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:24,679
labor pick them out um cut away the rock

1116
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,000
you got to call Manuel and have him come

1117
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:30,358
pick them up for you that's a p thing

1118
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,679
that is a local joke sorry I actually

1119
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:34,679
used to know a guy he uh he told

1120
00:40:32,679 --> 00:40:37,239
everyone that was his name and his first

1121
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:39,078
name actually was manual but so how do

1122
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:40,118
we keep the caterpillars from getting

1123
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:44,318
into the

1124
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:46,358
grow um I believe I was told those

1125
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:50,519
little [ __ ] lay their eggs about 3

1126
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:52,679
weeks before you actually see them um so

1127
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:55,199
that's when it's still pretty early Bud

1128
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:56,879
growth um you know it's especially

1129
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:58,399
Outdoors they're still stretching a lot

1130
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,160
at that point Point um there's just

1131
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,760
little popcorn nugs on

1132
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:07,440
[ __ ] um so uh spinosad is something I

1133
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,040
had great success with last year um I

1134
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,159
got it in a montere spray yeah Monterey

1135
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:14,400
bug

1136
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:17,759
spray supplies no actually we don't have

1137
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,920
that one I think I bought it there oh oh

1138
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,079
well we have the Captain Jacks now too

1139
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:27,519
which um actually has more spinosad in

1140
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:31,760
it than montere I believe so um

1141
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:33,679
uh neem oil although um I mean ne ne oil

1142
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,440
works great so yeah how do you feel

1143
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,679
about spinosad it's a it's actually a

1144
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:40,079
bacteria found in the bottle of rum uh

1145
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:42,559
barrels yeah I think it's it's good to

1146
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,280
be used it needs to be it's something to

1147
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,799
be used strategically Like Jesse was

1148
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,920
saying it it needs to be well planned

1149
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,519
thought out talk to other people figure

1150
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:53,920
out when they usually see these prob way

1151
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,759
to put my thoughts on neem oil too

1152
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,838
strategically you don't just spray

1153
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:00,520
willy-nilly I mean you want you want to

1154
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:02,519
apply for reasons at certain times you

1155
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:04,480
you want to get in tune with your

1156
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:06,280
environment that's where I feel about

1157
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,639
that I mean you yeah you want to utilize

1158
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,480
everything that you can there's you

1159
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:13,318
don't have too many options especially

1160
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,838
here in Pueblo with our extreme weather

1161
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:19,079
and we get a huge variety of pet it's

1162
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:21,558
amazing yeah well as you're high and dry

1163
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,039
was if I was a spider M I'd want to live

1164
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:27,280
here um Outdoors is the only one don't

1165
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:30,358
say those words bro here I mean I've

1166
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:32,839
seen crops here completely wrecked by uh

1167
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:35,039
here goes Organics again I've seen crops

1168
00:42:32,838 --> 00:42:37,358
here completely wrecked by spiderm sand

1169
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:41,119
powy mold and I've never had an issue

1170
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:42,558
with them personally um I've found that

1171
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,079
you know occasionally you'll have some

1172
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,280
when the plants come out in the spring

1173
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:52,318
and they're very easy to deal with um uh

1174
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:56,280
a little neoil um maybe some uh uh like

1175
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:58,880
lemongrass based something uh water uh

1176
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:00,760
this you you know very easy to deal with

1177
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,519
most of the bugs just don't like water

1178
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:06,640
yeah um moisture the gardens I've seen

1179
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,559
wrecked by them are new or bottle fed um

1180
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:10,759
they're pouring [ __ ] chelated

1181
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:13,280
nutrients into the Earth you know yeah I

1182
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,599
think the the the big problem is is it's

1183
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,400
usually in it comes in two situations

1184
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,838
either a they don't do anything about it

1185
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:22,039
and then they just get the infestation

1186
00:43:20,838 --> 00:43:23,480
and then that's usually where they want

1187
00:43:22,039 --> 00:43:27,719
to come in and treat with Like an Eagle

1188
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:30,119
20 or tetran or something like that um

1189
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:33,159
or the other situation is is that

1190
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:36,318
they'll actually use those things on a

1191
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:39,399
regular basis as a preventative uh the

1192
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,199
plant builds no sort of self-immune

1193
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,838
system you know you're all you're doing

1194
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,558
it for it the second that you forget the

1195
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:48,279
second that that insect builds up a

1196
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,559
resistance you've lost the war so yeah

1197
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:52,800
the trick is prevention you want to go

1198
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:54,800
at it really you want to go out it you

1199
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,519
systemically you want to add in neem

1200
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,480
cake and crustation meal things like

1201
00:43:56,519 --> 00:44:01,880
that into your soil mix you want to

1202
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,920
plant out spray regiments of NE oil uh

1203
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:09,160
essential oils like he was saying uh

1204
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:12,159
lemongrass uh peppermint oil uh Rosemary

1205
00:44:09,159 --> 00:44:14,399
Rosemary kill spidermite eggs on contact

1206
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:16,000
um so if you see a little bit of an

1207
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,880
infestation your first thing is to go

1208
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,599
and remove any stippled you know

1209
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:20,760
anything with stippling and then go back

1210
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,720
through and hit them with some uh

1211
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:25,720
rosemary oil what's your thoughts on

1212
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:27,838
this um I have Rosemary growing in my

1213
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:29,759
yard um

1214
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:33,318
how would I go about just taking the raw

1215
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,400
plant and utilizing that into a so you

1216
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:37,079
can go a couple of ways so there's

1217
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,720
either a you can make it like a

1218
00:44:37,079 --> 00:44:43,000
traditional essential oil which is I

1219
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:44,318
have no idea how to do yeah that's just

1220
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,358
that's just a quick Google search it's

1221
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,960
really not that hard it's just kind of

1222
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:50,480
like you you know you mix it sit and

1223
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,000
forget it you know you might have to

1224
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,880
apply some heat to it or things like

1225
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,480
that the other option would be like a

1226
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,838
cold process kind of like a ferment to

1227
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,760
kind of extract those essential oils so

1228
00:44:58,838 --> 00:45:02,799
that would be more like a fermented

1229
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,319
plant juice so then you would go that

1230
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,760
would go back to like the Korean natural

1231
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:08,719
farming that I kind of do where you

1232
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,160
would take the Rosemary or whatever

1233
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:13,838
plant you would want mix it in basil

1234
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:16,558
yeah basil honestly you could do

1235
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:22,239
mixtures of them all I do uh personally

1236
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:24,440
I do ginger garlic cinnamon sticks and

1237
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:27,159
then I'll grind all of that up mix it in

1238
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,760
with the indigenous microorganism and em

1239
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:32,719
one and yeah that's usually how I I'll

1240
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:35,119
create a little you know spray off of

1241
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:37,879
that also have a damn I bet that smells

1242
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,440
amazing it does like like my girlfriend

1243
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:42,039
actually likes that when I spray it in

1244
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,519
the house um but yeah

1245
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:46,239
so yeah damn I'm like forget what I'm

1246
00:45:44,519 --> 00:45:48,679
saying too man we got to smoke different

1247
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,159
dabs next time I'm sorry we only took

1248
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:52,078
one or two dabs and everybody looked at

1249
00:45:50,159 --> 00:45:54,799
me like I'm high let's

1250
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:57,160
podcast uh so preventatives the stuff

1251
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,440
you mix up so yeah you just want to uh

1252
00:45:57,159 --> 00:46:01,358
preventive preventatives are key so you

1253
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,599
want to plan out your neem sprays your

1254
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:06,400
essential oil sprays uh your spin ofy

1255
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:08,160
anything that you're going to use you

1256
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,838
want to make sure that you have it

1257
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,480
planned out on a calendar when you're

1258
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:14,000
going to use it before you go if you're

1259
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:15,240
going to make things like I was saying

1260
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,838
you want to make sure that you give

1261
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,959
yourself a month or two in advance so

1262
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:21,880
you can make them and they'll be ready

1263
00:46:19,960 --> 00:46:23,519
cuz these are you know 30day ferments

1264
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,079
right and making worm casting tees and

1265
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:28,000
things has taught me to plan several

1266
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:30,480
days ahead now exactly you have to start

1267
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,760
it you know 12 to 48 hours before you're

1268
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,920
actually going to apply it yeah before

1269
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,480
it's even useful yep get that foamy

1270
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,639
layer which when you when you get used

1271
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:39,199
to it it actually is kind of turns out

1272
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:40,598
to be a lot easier cuz you know you're

1273
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:42,639
like well I'm on your way out of the

1274
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,240
garden you start this tea up and you'll

1275
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,318
hit it the next day with it so yeah it

1276
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:49,199
works out like that I'm getting away

1277
00:46:47,318 --> 00:46:50,759
from the bottles thank you you guys are

1278
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:52,318
doing it for me so we got some hoop

1279
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:54,280
house action kind of got some ideas on

1280
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:55,558
how to keep away the bugs uh what was

1281
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:59,240
the one thing you talk about a lot

1282
00:46:55,559 --> 00:47:01,880
karanja meal so yeah so there's neem and

1283
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:03,879
then there's Kanga they're the same

1284
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,280
thing you hear a lot of people talk

1285
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:09,440
about like a neem and Kaja 50/50 mix

1286
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,960
it's really unnecessary the big

1287
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:16,119
difference is that like neem oil

1288
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:19,000
technically has uh like uh what's the

1289
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:23,200
word I'm looking for uh almost like

1290
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:25,400
birth control style uh properties to it

1291
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:28,879
okay which for human health reasons and

1292
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,760
karaja oil doesn't okay so that's kind

1293
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,880
of my basic understanding is that

1294
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:36,240
they're the same thing basically kage

1295
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,240
oil is a hell of a lot cheaper to Source

1296
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,479
or at least karaja meal uh I can't I've

1297
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:44,118
never personally used karaja oil

1298
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:45,838
specifically but the uh it's basically

1299
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:47,079
the same thing as NE okay you got me

1300
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:50,719
curious about these birth control

1301
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:52,880
properties now yeah I won't

1302
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:54,679
ask oh if you really want some birth

1303
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,200
control properties go use Eagle 20 I'll

1304
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:59,480
make you ster oh yeah it'll make you

1305
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:01,639
it'll make you twitch you won't get laid

1306
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,519
at all because your eyes are twitching

1307
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:05,558
yeah definitely birth control right

1308
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,800
there all right I want to see if I got

1309
00:48:05,559 --> 00:48:08,280

1313

1351
00:49:28,599 --> 00:49:36,760
applies to your Gardens too um corn

1355
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:44,318

hydro store either there's there are

1357

you know the hydro shop is a sponsored

1359

00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:03,480
know why they keep doing that it's hard

1641
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:05,280
to find a spot for comments sometimes

1642
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:07,000

I can find them I'll read them for you

00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,440
ass it's free so I can't complain that's

1647
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,920
where I listen to it at most of the time

1648
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:16,880
we get a lot of good ratings on Stitcher

1649
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,039

1653
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:27,079

1654
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:28,440

1655
