really sweet I got to hang out with you

100
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:13,089
all night actually Jess yeah you can you

101
00:05:11,348 --> 00:05:17,589
can retell the story that you told Mike

102
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:20,649
about the day I took we shout out to

103
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:23,049
Mary's motivation on Instagram Brent I

104
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:28,329
got to meet him at a secret session he

105
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:31,329
had some of this THC disel it and Jeff

106
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:35,250
is a walk and always takes such big dabs

107
00:05:31,329 --> 00:05:37,439
and he took a nice chunk glob of this

108
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,560
THC distillate and you just watched his

109
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:43,290
whole face change and that was it he was

110
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,180
like super stoned I mean don't get me

111
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:47,280
wrong Jeff was still dabbing Jeff was

112
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,930
still like you know smoking it was

113
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,059
assess he's not gonna look like a wimp

114
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,610
but I mean like he you could just see it

115
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,829
all over his face that that dab changed

116
00:05:53,610 --> 00:06:04,949
his level for the whole night and like

117
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:06,359
that was it you can pull the fattest so

118
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,180
we should kind of try to describe what

119
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,970
distillate is so they take co2 have a

120
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,100
and a hash maker will take co2 hash hash

121
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,510
that's made with co2 oftentimes it's

122
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,520
kind of black and goopy sometimes it

123
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,469
comes out kind of gold but then they do

124
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,990
what I think is fractal distillation is

125
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,550
what I think it's called and it it could

126
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,019
be done with steam it could be done I'm

127
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,889
not sure how a lot of companies do it

128
00:06:25,019 --> 00:06:28,229
all the companies have their own

129
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:30,389
proprietary method but they pretty much

130
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,810
distill this product and they give you

131
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:36,740
pure THC with terpenes put back in or

132
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,550
some of the companies actually put in

133
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,470
terpenes that are purchased from other

134
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,810
products that are derived from other

135
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:44,430
products but what this guy had was just

136
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,319
pure cannabis with cannabis terpenes in

137
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,810
it cannabis terpenoids and so it's all

138
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,319
parrots just super parrots THC and turps

139
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:54,540
and you can take the biggest freaking

140
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,519
dabs and you don't choke yeah my lungs

141
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:04,110
feel like they got a little little smoke

142
00:06:56,519 --> 00:07:08,519
in them I was like I could definitely

143
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:11,419
feel the face bounce from white to red

144
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,418
to white to red

145
00:07:11,509 --> 00:07:16,129
[Music]

146
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:17,359

147
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:19,968
out of this world

148
00:07:17,358 --> 00:07:22,188

149

about a couple of things here

167
00:08:02,088 --> 00:08:05,778
Mike and I and Lindsay Mike and I have

168
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:07,908
lived here for a long ass time we've

169
00:08:05,778 --> 00:08:09,439
seen this cannabis industry change we

170
00:08:07,908 --> 00:08:10,848
thought all the the raids and all the

171
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,079
cannabis [ __ ] has gone away --lens he's

172
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:13,579
been here for a while she hasn't seen

173
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,499
any cannabis trouble the time that she's

174
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:18,468
been here no and then in the past how

175
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:21,588
many weeks Mike is seven seven weeks

176
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:23,269
how many raids eighteen now eighteen

177
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,639
raids and seven weeks in well they're

178
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:27,408
all they're not like stores or licensed

179
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,369
facilities or anything they're private

180
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:32,088
groves that are way over their legal

181
00:08:31,369 --> 00:08:33,860
plant account

182
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:35,419
way over the legal plant count I saw him

183
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:38,389
pulling a whole bunch of plants out of

184
00:08:35,418 --> 00:08:41,120
one guy's garage on the news though the

185
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:42,528
number 18 only have like 50 plants but a

186
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,058
couple of them before that were in the

187
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:48,528
the several hundred or like 1200 1500

188
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:51,110
there I read somewhere that a lot of

189
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:53,269
these girls are connected there was

190
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,459
another set of raids up in spring

191
00:08:53,269 --> 00:08:57,318
another 17 doesn't count that we're all

192
00:08:55,458 --> 00:09:00,979
connected in like El Paso in Denver

193
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:03,740
County our laws didn't change the black

194
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,300
market anywhere else and so there's

195
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,980
still a bunch of black market growers

196
00:09:05,299 --> 00:09:08,508
that are sitting around all winter going

197
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,879
where's the place where I think I can

198
00:09:08,509 --> 00:09:13,490
hide and no one will notice me growing

199
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,749
marijuana and apparently like if you're

200
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,490
sitting in Florida all where they're

201
00:09:14,749 --> 00:09:17,720
thinking that the answer is Colorado

202
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:19,159
because there's a shitload of people

203
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,950
from Florida getting busted growing a

204
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,779
shitload of plants here yeah

205
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,520
most of the raids happen to people yeah

206
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,870
they happen to be people yes worried

207
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:28,059
from over there miss Lindsay missed the

208
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:37,570
traveling stoner I was born in Jersey so

209
00:09:28,059 --> 00:09:39,309
I guess I'll claim that today I've made

210
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,620
a couple of friends that are recent

211
00:09:39,309 --> 00:09:43,719
arrivals and Colorado in the last year

212
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,860
to half or so from Florida and I've told

213
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,259
all of them like you if you're growing

214
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,180
weed make sure your plant counts about

215
00:09:47,259 --> 00:09:50,590
the [ __ ] on because it's only a matter

216
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:52,000
of time before I Sheriff knocks on your

217
00:09:50,590 --> 00:10:00,009
door and is like I hear you're from

218
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:03,370
Florida there's a couple of things that

219
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:08,139
work like all the busts are in the same

220
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:09,730
area and if you ask me because all the

221
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:11,830
the press stories all say the same thing

222
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:14,730
a citizen complaint was called in the

223
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:16,870
sheriff's went out to check confirmed

224
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:18,430
the suspicion that there was marijuana

225
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,289
being grown there checked the plant

226
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:23,469
counts found as [ __ ] little plants and

227
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:25,299
no paperwork and arrest of the recent

228
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,370
arrival from Florida like there's like

229
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:31,000
18 grows and like 15 of a match that

230
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,889
exact layout and so I think it's the

231
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,419
anti-fog people that have that that are

232
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:37,210
working on that ballot initiative most

233
00:10:34,419 --> 00:10:39,219
of them live out Pablo West just driving

234
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:42,370
around looking at new house looking at

235
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:44,950
houses for vents and the stink of weed

236
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:47,740
and they're just calling on everything

237
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:49,690
they find they're not reporting on all

238
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,950
the grows that are perfectly legal where

239
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,810
they knock on the door and the dude's

240
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,270
like I totally grow marijuana here it's

241
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:57,549
on 2% legal I have blank number of

242
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,649
plants and X number of paperwork sheets

243
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:01,479
here's everything to confirm what I'm

244
00:10:59,649 --> 00:11:04,509
legally allowed to have come take a look

245
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:06,779
here's what's I've got you can confirm

246
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:09,819
it's all correct have a nice day yeah

247
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:13,089
leave having a small grow isn't a big

248
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,920
deal right now no issue at all they're

249
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:17,500
not messing with the businesses they're

250
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:20,319
not because that happens in a lot of

251
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:22,269
states it's just the home growers that

252
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,590
are way out of compliance with that law

253
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:25,100
do you think they're using electricity

254
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:26,879
bills to find

255
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,649
[Music]

256
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,539
I was just like yep I was gonna say

257
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:31,919
they're looking at that then they have a

258
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:33,179
lot of angles but at the end of the day

259
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:36,240
when it comes down to is that if you

260
00:11:33,179 --> 00:11:38,519
come out here please do it legally get

261
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,560
the paperwork do I have listened to so

262
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:43,649
many podcasts of you to sit here and say

263
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:45,839
do it the right way stop you know stop

264
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:48,509
trying you're making our community look

265
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,430
bad you're making us look like we're

266
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,679
trying to break the laws and trying to

267
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:54,569
get away with this none of us in the

268
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:56,219
community are trying to I have not

269
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,140
started growing yet since I have come

270
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,600
out here because my paperwork is not in

271
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:02,639
order yet I'd love to be growing I'd

272
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,220
love to have a whole you know two rooms

273
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,649
going but it's not gonna happen right

274
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:10,050
like I need to get my paperwork in line

275
00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:13,110
first and I can grow six legally as a

276
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:14,819
Colorado resident I can't I know there

277
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,200
was a time where I was moving and

278
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:20,520
shaking and doing [ __ ] that should not

279
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:29,190
be spoken up on a podcast stories of my

280
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:31,379
past but eventually there's gonna come a

281
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:34,020
time when you think about shifting to

282
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:36,299
the legal market there's a difference

283
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,699
between making money to survive and

284
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,500
being greedy and having these huge grows

285
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,330
that these people are getting busted for

286
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,000
and that's the issue it's it's these

287
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:47,759
huge commercial grows in houses for no

288
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
reason like you're all gonna go and sell

289
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,409
that in another so you know why I mean

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,330
if you really think about it it's just

291
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:58,069
so stupid like this is why they were in

292
00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:00,570
the national parks ten years ago and

293
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:03,450
they hide anywhere they think they can

294
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:06,240
hide it's they're trying to hide in

295
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:08,280
Colorado they just they don't realize

296
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,470
how well-publicized the rules are I've

297
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:12,600
been here because they're not publicized

298
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:14,850
anywhere else like New Mexico Florida

299
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,550
Kansas none of these places care about

300
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,950
what the zoning rules are for the shops

301
00:13:17,549 --> 00:13:22,079
or what the home grill rules are in each

302
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,730
city and county so no that [ __ ] makes

303
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,900
the paper just as weeds legal and

304
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:27,450
they're allowed to grow their own how

305
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,549
strange and so they think oh I can move

306
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:32,310
to Colorado I can go to the gross store

307
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:34,519
I can throw down the 18 grand or

308
00:13:32,309 --> 00:13:38,389
whatever I've managed to save up on

309
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:40,579
equipment right a house pull a crop or

310
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:43,669
to drive it all back to Florida and bam

311
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:46,670
I've got four on her grand and they just

312
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:48,559
don't see how insane that plan is um

313
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:51,439
like the gross stores gonna sell you all

314
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:53,029
that [ __ ] no problem but the when you

315
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,860
plug it all in you're gonna have to have

316
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:56,629
the power company come out by the time

317
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,980
the power company's done upgrading you

318
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:00,529
all your neighbors want to know what the

319
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:03,080
[ __ ] you're doing as soon as it smells

320
00:14:00,529 --> 00:14:05,689
like weed which is gonna be about what

321
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,950
eight weeks later one of them's gonna

322
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:14,780
call the sheriff and go would you knock

323
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:17,150
on this box door creaks I'm pretty sure

324
00:14:14,779 --> 00:14:18,649
he's got an illegal operation yeah and

325
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,269
this is all assuming you don't have a

326
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:23,870
landlord that's gonna be checking on

327
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:25,789
everything a couple of these guys were

328
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:27,860
like just showed up right at a house

329
00:14:25,789 --> 00:14:31,219
went to BOTS supply board it's sort of

330
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:32,750
ply boarding over exterior windows like

331
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:38,410
one dude had a pit bull chained to a

332
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:41,059
window well in the most extreme sense

333
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:44,600
because I mean if you think about it you

334
00:14:41,059 --> 00:14:48,049
could move here grow even your six plant

335
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,090
just being here as an adult limit and if

336
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:52,069
you were dumb enough to take the risk to

337
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:55,000
move that back to Florida just that

338
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:58,040
smaller harvest you could still make a

339
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,990
fair living like it wouldn't be

340
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:02,629
extravagant you wouldn't be rolling back

341
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,669
and forth in a brand-new Escalade but I

342
00:15:02,629 --> 00:15:07,009
mean you could make enough to pay your

343
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:08,629
rent and pay your bills but they're

344
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:10,610
trying to do hundreds of plants because

345
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:11,990
they're stupid and greedy and they think

346
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,600
no one's gonna notice here and it's

347
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:17,750
that's just so insane like it's a

348
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,009
neighborhood even if you do get it

349
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,269
harvested and dried and cured you're

350
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:21,919
gonna get pulled the [ __ ] over as soon

351
00:15:20,269 --> 00:15:24,649
as you cross it the kids a couple of

352
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,659
them got busted halfway to where they

353
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,250
were headed because they just turn

354
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:29,870
signal violation and hundreds of pounds

355
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:31,940
of weed in the car smells like covers

356
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,889
two pounds of weed in the car

357
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:35,480
y'all know how bad your quarter ounce

358
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:38,779
snakes on the way home from picking it

359
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,519
up like magnify that by a hundred pounds

360
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:42,980
yeah because you guys aren't being smart

361
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:44,419
and vacuum-sealing it and like doing it

362
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,629
the right way you're just putting it in

363
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:47,099
trash bags and throw

364
00:15:45,629 --> 00:15:50,600
in the back and praying to God you'll

365
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,600
make it there eggs is the gangster

366
00:15:51,490 --> 00:16:00,480
[Music]

367
00:15:57,769 --> 00:16:11,730
that's not real tall used to give me the

368
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:13,620
trash bag the clear trash bag coming up

369
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:15,360
and grown big ridiculous amounts of

370
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,039
cannabis in Colorado maybe come into it

371
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,139
and here it's still possible if you're

372
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:20,610
gung ho you got to be smart about it but

373
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:21,750
be careful you guys if you're gonna come

374
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,820
here from another state think you're

375
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:25,200
gonna set up shop read the rules get get

376
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,700
really familiar with the rules be

377
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,530
careful the two parts of this that

378
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,000
pissed me off the most is like a now we

379
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,720
got to pay to send these folks to jail

380
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,659
and be there [ __ ] up our reputation

381
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,149
and they're giving a whole bunch of fire

382
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:42,240
to the anti pot people and they didn't

383
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:43,169
need to fire they they've lost two years

384
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,940
in a row

385
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:48,120
every time they smoke up they got told

386
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,750
[ __ ] off and they're really really angry

387
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,889
they don't need fuel for that fire yeah

388
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:56,820
bus in seven weeks

389
00:16:52,889 --> 00:17:00,149
like in every single one of those out

390
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,350
Pablo West basically you've lived here

391
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:06,599
for how long trouble doesn't report [ __ ]

392
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:10,099
and all of a sudden we've got 18

393
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:12,149
successful pot grow tips in seven weeks

394
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:15,438
like there's some weird [ __ ] going on

395
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:17,550
right now and people didn't see coming

396
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,709
so if you're growing in Pueblo be

397
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:24,389
careful right now like gearing up for

398
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:26,730
the election we got a new president

399
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,950
coming in everywhere everywhere if

400
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:30,329
you're growing get your [ __ ] cleaned up

401
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,190
now's a good time to think about it if

402
00:17:30,329 --> 00:17:34,980
you if you're a medical marijuana grower

403
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,019
if you've got a plant count count your

404
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,519
[ __ ] plants go consider like go get

405
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:39,779
one under your plant count so that if

406
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:41,099
some [ __ ] goes wrong and you break off a

407
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,910
branch and it looks like an extra plan

408
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:44,669
on accident

409
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,080
go check your gramley get to your

410
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:51,390
perfect gram weight and then roll a fat

411
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:52,859
joint I just go get your [ __ ] in order

412
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,110
my clique to me like that's that's

413
00:17:52,859 --> 00:17:57,359
really good I had that thought the other

414
00:17:55,109 --> 00:18:00,178
day I've got a nice hash piles going

415
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,889
right now and I was like like I can't

416
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:03,570
even take this like when I move

417
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:05,580
technically I'll have to break the love

418
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:06,899
moving this from house one the house to

419
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:09,509
because I'm not supposed to have that

420
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,550
much [ __ ] out in the world I'm over my

421
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:15,960
grand limit wait how much weight can we

422
00:18:14,549 --> 00:18:17,460
talk about tricks in the plank count on

423
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,850
your medical marijuana card we talked

424
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,259
about but just for the legal rules

425
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:24,240
because at the same time I was thinking

426
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:26,369
about needing to go get my card again

427
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,039
like a lot of this applies to us too

428
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:31,409
like we're not special right we've got

429
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,319

503
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:13,788
I wanted to throw in right now is a lot

504
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:15,279
of people focus on the November election

505
00:22:13,788 --> 00:22:19,509
as they should be

506
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:22,058
yay for paying attention good for you

507
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:24,500
[Music]

508
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:26,000
the other night where he was like really

509
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:32,150
mean to the listeners and you're like to

510
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:34,788
him but there's primary elections too in

511
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:38,690
everybody's area in these matter and no

512
00:22:34,788 --> 00:22:41,179
one ever turns out for these the example

513
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:43,130
down here is this November we might be

514
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:47,298
voting to ban the recreational marijuana

515
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:50,210
industry however before we even get to

516
00:22:47,298 --> 00:22:53,869
that vote possibly happening there'll be

517
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:55,990
election election primary election that

518
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:58,279
it sorry about that space the word a

519
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:00,380
primary election down here will reelect

520
00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:02,808
people like city councilman and county

521
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,000
commissioners in the local judge and

522
00:23:02,808 --> 00:23:07,339
maybe there'll be a couple of small

523
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,140
local issues that get handled like city

524
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:12,459
or county why what are you going to run

525
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:15,038
for nothing in this round

526
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,929
if two people down here happened to get

527
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,158
elected instead of the two people that

528
00:23:16,929 --> 00:23:21,190
currently have this job getting

529
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,500
reelected retail marijuana could go away

530
00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:25,330
anyway because the number of pro and

531
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:27,609
anti marijuana votes would swing that

532
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:32,168
far with just two people getting swapped

533
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:34,658
out so there's a lot going on

534
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:36,190
politically in everyone's area that they

535
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:39,700
need to be paying attention to right now

536
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:41,980
and right now is the time to go find out

537
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:44,590
if you're registered to vote go find out

538
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,028
how that works in your area in Colorado

539
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,408
it's awesome they just mail it to your

540
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:49,960
house you don't have to do anything but

541
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:52,240
check the mail when it shows up you fill

542
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,009
it out you take it to a drop-off point

543
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,659
you get the sticker that says I voted

544
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:58,109
and you get to be awesome for like the

545
00:23:55,659 --> 00:24:00,429
whole next year it's really that simple

546
00:23:58,109 --> 00:24:03,308
in other places it's a little harder you

547
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:04,870
got to go stand in line but do it like

548
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,609
figure out how to do it now is the time

549
00:24:04,869 --> 00:24:08,319
to figure out how to do it I know it's

550
00:24:06,609 --> 00:24:10,689
not till November I know that's a long

551
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:21,158
time away I know a lot of you are like I

552
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:23,679
just planted my outdoor November why pay

553
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:25,330
attention I'm not saying I'm not telling

554
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,730
them to [ __ ] off I'm saying that I was

555
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:29,199
thinking this they don't want to pay

556
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:31,659
attention to politics yet because that's

557
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,240
just months and months away like but

558
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:36,190
now's the time to get registered now is

559
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,870
the time to start paying attention to

560
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,909
what's going on in your area and start

561
00:24:37,869 --> 00:24:43,509
do making sure you've done what you need

562
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:45,190
to do to actually vote I'm sick of the

563
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:48,069
marijuana community just being a

564
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:51,399
non-existent entity politically like we

565
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:53,158
outnumber Christians think about the

566
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:55,148
number of Christians that annoy you

567
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,190
constantly because they're doing [ __ ]

568
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:59,048
politically think about how powerful

569
00:24:57,190 --> 00:25:01,090
that particular group of people is in

570
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:05,319
the United States we outnumber NRA

571
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:07,990
members by five times

572
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:09,339
and that's just the DA's estimate for

573
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:11,140
how many people smoke pot in the u.s.

574
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:18,459
there are more pot smokers than gun

575
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:20,380
toters yep Wow politically why because

576
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,519
we don't show up I got no hatred for

577
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:27,760
anybody with a gun if I said that

578
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:29,619
condescending influence the NRA wields

579
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,180
and then you look up the actual number

580
00:25:29,619 --> 00:25:34,599
of NRA members and their actual

581
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:36,670
operating budget it's terrifying how a

582
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:38,769
group that small can be that influential

583
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:40,900
if we were just to get a little bit

584
00:25:38,769 --> 00:25:45,210
organized or at least just all show up

585
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:48,220
on Election Day we could have a serious

586
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,769
Authority coast-to-coast but we don't

587
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,720
and we definitely those of us that do

588
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:57,099
show up don't show up unified even a

589
00:25:52,720 --> 00:26:00,519
little bit yeah I'm pushing your

590
00:25:57,099 --> 00:26:02,199
listeners get out get out we all will

591
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,539
take a party bus anywhere if you put a

592
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:12,430
dab rig on a bus oh yeah and a bhag on a

593
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:14,170
bus put some people get on there and

594
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:17,890
smoke some [ __ ] hash and smoke joints

595
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:19,810
have a good a social time let's let's

596
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,820
get one of those and pickups no neurs

597
00:26:19,809 --> 00:26:25,240
and drive them to polling places to get

598
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:28,750
them to vote it's not an unheard-of idea

599
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:30,730
I'm hoping a couple of the industry

600
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:33,250
players do something similar yes

601
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:35,349
somebody somebody that doesn't work a

602
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,950
lot and have a podcast and drive too

603
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:37,990
much already

604
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:47,019
help me out with this put together like

605
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:50,559
some buses do like Denver that would

606
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:53,349
totally fly I think something like

607
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:56,409
Pueblo that might not get away with

608
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:58,089
driving them smoking them out while you

609
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,180
drive on requires a lot of extra

610
00:26:58,089 --> 00:27:03,429
insurance and a much much larger vehicle

611
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,890
but every election there's groups that

612
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:07,330
grab vans and go bus seniors and other

613
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,040
people that love to vote and have

614
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:10,720
trouble sometimes getting to the polling

615
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,579
station I'm taking the seniors often

616
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,048
vote though whatever way they

617
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:16,689
want them to vote like they'll go round

618
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:26,918
up those people on signal free joint if

619
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:30,788
you just give them a ride that's helping

620
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,200
someone perform their civic duty I'd

621
00:27:30,788 --> 00:27:33,519
love to see someone getting legal

622
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,538
trouble for that that'd be an awesome

623
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:40,659
court case yeah get involved

624
00:27:37,538 --> 00:27:42,429
googling after the show you do right now

625
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:49,330
where you listen if you're at work you

626
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:51,340
could in your cubicle behind you just

627
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:53,079
wanted to know what Election Day was so

628
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:55,298
you could think about requesting it off

629
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,740
because civic pride is important to you

630
00:27:55,298 --> 00:28:00,398
or if your work just go to the bathroom

631
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:03,160
acts like you're taking a dump come back

632
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:08,189
out until all of your friends about

633
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,190
[Music]

634
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:33,490
Instagram liable way to hide like weird

635
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,288
again I think something that mike said

636
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,058
on the last podcast though that's really

637
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:38,919
important to say again though is that a

638
00:28:37,058 --> 00:28:40,898
lot of people this year up for

639
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,288
re-election and if we get the right

640
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:46,629
people in the right seats we could be

641
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:48,369
looking at this moving a lot faster than

642
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,370
we really thought it was going to we're

643
00:28:48,369 --> 00:28:57,428
already at the breaking point we're at

644
00:28:50,369 --> 00:29:00,788
24 25 including 25 but does that count

645
00:28:57,429 --> 00:29:03,580
Pennsylvania since Pennsylvania's loose

646
00:29:00,788 --> 00:29:05,558
okay so 24 plus DC so we're still

647
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:07,658
looking at 25 we're at the halfway mark

648
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:09,009
where you know and it's funny because my

649
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:12,570
dad said something really interesting to

650
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:14,589
me the other day that at this point in

651
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:18,490
gay marriage it would already

652
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:20,349
steamrolled and it went across all 50 so

653
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:22,089
maybe we just have to hold on for a

654
00:29:20,349 --> 00:29:25,139
little bit longer showed up in big

655
00:29:22,089 --> 00:29:28,198
groups and voted

656
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,199
[Music]

657
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,798
[Music]

658
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:49,140
[Music]

659
00:29:56,430 --> 00:30:07,190
[Music]

660
00:29:58,659 --> 00:30:09,169
I know I know Mike does mean to be

661
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:11,269
motivating inspiring he wants you to go

662
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:13,940
out vote there is a chance that we could

663
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:15,368
lose recreational cannabis in Pueblo

664
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:17,990
Colorado yeah

665
00:30:15,368 --> 00:30:19,849
tremendous politics and public opinion

666
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,460
work on a pendulum if you look at your

667
00:30:19,849 --> 00:30:25,939
history we swing from liberal to

668
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:29,210
conservative socially and so social

669
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:33,169
issues like this can swing back quickly

670
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:34,909
in the early 70s we had a president that

671
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:37,700
was thinking about legalizing marijuana

672
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:39,490
nationally we had a number of states

673
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,450
that have passed medical marijuana laws

674
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,990
anybody remember these when we were

675
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,269
children

676
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,730
no because the [ __ ] eighties happened

677
00:30:44,269 --> 00:30:49,069
in public opinion swung back the other

678
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:50,808
way hard we decided to do a war on drugs

679
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:55,308
instead of legalization we all know how

680
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:57,230
that played out and had a couple of

681
00:30:55,308 --> 00:31:01,278
candidates stayed in the election or

682
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:02,868
done better running up to this point we

683
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:04,788
could still have candidates that were

684
00:31:02,868 --> 00:31:07,928
promising to send the military to stop

685
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:11,499
Colorado's weed stores like that's a

686
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:14,419
reality in 2016 that we have a major

687
00:31:11,499 --> 00:31:16,129
popular well-funded candidate for the

688
00:31:14,419 --> 00:31:17,538
highest office in the land who's talking

689
00:31:16,128 --> 00:31:19,849
about sending the army to shut down a

690
00:31:17,538 --> 00:31:21,499
weed stores in Colorado you guys work in

691
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:22,849
the retail what are you gonna do when

692
00:31:21,499 --> 00:31:25,659
they want a tank rolls up into the

693
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:25,658
[ __ ] parking lot

694
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:33,250
spring so like I don't know well I guess

695
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:34,539
if it goes away for good yeah their

696
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,329
first in the spiritual that are already

697
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:38,950
in the spring when the tank shows up I'm

698
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:40,480
gonna stop worrying about the

699
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,039
consumption on site rule take it down

700
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:44,890

like obligated but like I don't know how

735
00:33:49,429 --> 00:34:00,769
to do push-ups you have to learn a new

736
00:33:56,509 --> 00:34:02,628
physical activity I feel like that was

737
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:04,038
rude to so I mean not like you would

738
00:34:02,628 --> 00:34:05,388
have noticed right but I like I don't

739
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:08,809

976
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:50,800
what happened so we did an article where

977
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:51,909
people collect the trash in the park and

978
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,990
then clean up the park and after they

979
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:54,759
picked up the trash they got a free

980
00:47:52,989 --> 00:47:56,079
joint it was under my assumption they

981
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,120
got the joint at the park because the

982
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:59,769
news kind of made it look that way I was

983
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:01,389
told that they got a coupon and they had

984
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:04,210
to take the coupon to the

985
00:48:01,389 --> 00:48:06,250
club and the smoke Club then gave them a

986
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:08,230
joint when they presented proper ID and

987
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:09,670
that coupon so a correction had to be

988
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:11,769
made they did not give the joints out at

989
00:48:09,670 --> 00:48:13,389
the park they did it correctly so shout

990
00:48:11,769 --> 00:48:17,320
out and also shout out to my friends for

991
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:19,089
correcting me I do appreciate that week

992
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:21,340
because I'm recording on a Saturday

993
00:48:19,090 --> 00:48:23,350
usually I record on a Thursday but this

994
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:25,570
week was chaotic this week on Thursday I

995
00:48:23,349 --> 00:48:27,099
had a medical marijuana doctor at 9:30

996
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:28,240
in the morning in Colorado Springs then

997
00:48:27,099 --> 00:48:30,880
I worked all day and then I went to the

998
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:33,849
secret stash the secret stash was

999
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,950
amazing I almost forgot part of my day I

1000
00:48:33,849 --> 00:48:37,569
got up I drove to Colorado Springs and

1001
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:39,309
then I got stuck in a [ __ ] elevator

1002
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,559
yes I've never been stuck in an elevator

1003
00:48:39,309 --> 00:48:43,000
before but Thursday morning it happened

1004
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:45,250
I was stuck in an elevator with two

1005
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:47,230
strangers I wasn't in there for very

1006
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:48,489
long it was a little bit freaky but I

1007
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:50,260
didn't panic or anything so I was like

1008
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:51,669
whatever I'm just in an elevator people

1009
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:54,250
know I'm here someone's gonna get wasn't

1010
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,990
that big of a deal one of the people in

1011
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,489
the elevator was a couple and the older

1012
00:48:55,989 --> 00:48:59,049
dude was getting a little bit pissed off

1013
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:00,609
if he was stuck in an elevator there's

1014
00:48:59,050 --> 00:49:02,380
no reason for him to be mad but I think

1015
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,990
just the simple idea that he was stuck

1016
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,400
pissed him off I was going to the

1017
00:49:04,989 --> 00:49:08,349
medical marijuana doctor I walked in

1018
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,329
there's no stairs at this building

1019
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:12,400
oddly oh there's an elevator got in the

1020
00:49:10,329 --> 00:49:14,590
elevator more people walked in and held

1021
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,960
the door for them I hid for three it

1022
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:18,220
started to go it went and then it

1023
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,210
stopped and I looked at the dude and I

1024
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:21,009
was like I don't know that I want to be

1025
00:49:19,210 --> 00:49:22,510
in here he said I think we're stuck in

1026
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:26,230
here and I said if it stops and then it

1027
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:27,670
stopped I was like well [ __ ] so first my

1028
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:29,079
first instinct was trying to pull the

1029
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:30,610
door open just to see where we are you

1030
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:33,039
know how far up did we go how far down

1031
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:34,599
did we go nor the [ __ ] we went I tried

1032
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:35,860
to pull the door open it was stuck it

1033
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,139
was good and stuck so nothing was gonna

1034
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,610
happen there's a little law an alarm

1035
00:49:38,139 --> 00:49:40,659
button on the elevator I hit that and

1036
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:43,030
there's a button that says call for help

1037
00:49:40,659 --> 00:49:45,099
I hit that a couple seconds later a

1038
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:46,450
young lady answered she's like hello and

1039
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:47,739
I was like that I just called the front

1040
00:49:46,449 --> 00:49:48,779
desk or what the [ __ ] just happened

1041
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:51,159
I was like hey I'm stuck in the elevator

1042
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:53,140
she asked if I was at the address where

1043
00:49:51,159 --> 00:49:54,730
I was and I confirmed that she said okay

1044
00:49:53,139 --> 00:49:57,609
hang tight we'll send someone to get you

1045
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,869
out and I was like well that's like and

1046
00:49:57,610 --> 00:50:01,420
I just basic you know what I mean like

1047
00:49:58,869 --> 00:50:02,859
ask if we're okay or some [ __ ] geez so

1048
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,260
we sat in the elevator for a few minutes

1049
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:06,579
and then another person

1050
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,540
kept hitting me a little alarm button

1051
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:08,739
they would just go jingle jingle jingle

1052
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:10,539
so that somebody would know I was in

1053
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:11,679
there and then another person came and

1054
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,759
they're like hey are you stuck and I was

1055
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,230
like yes we're stuck

1056
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:15,790
she just started pushing buttons and

1057
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:16,900
when she pushed I don't know which

1058
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:18,340
button cuz I wasn't there when she

1059
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:19,960
pushed the button I could feel the

1060
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:22,180
elevator shift a little bit and I said

1061
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:23,650
hey keep doing that and then I saw

1062
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:25,719
through the crack in the door I could

1063
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:27,010
see that we were only six or eight

1064
00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:29,139
inches up off the ground we've only

1065
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:30,700
moved 1/2 a foot so as I keep doing that

1066
00:50:29,139 --> 00:50:33,190
cuz we're going down every time she did

1067
00:50:30,699 --> 00:50:35,019
it and then I saw I saw the little

1068
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:36,280
threshold piece like where the elevator

1069
00:50:35,019 --> 00:50:37,329
would fit into the floor as I call out

1070
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,710
hold on I wanna see something quit

1071
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:40,210
pushing it I didn't want to squish my

1072
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:41,590
fingers and I stuck my fingers in it and

1073
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:42,909
I totally just pulled the door open so I

1074
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:44,920
was able to slide the door open once she

1075
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:46,239
got it a little bit lower we were a

1076
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:48,579
little bit late for our medical

1077
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,019

1111
00:51:45,699 --> 00:51:50,049
session we took a DAB much love I was at

1112
00:51:48,789 --> 00:51:52,090
the secret stash I was dabbing and

1113
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,340
Hannah mill said I'm higher than

1114
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:55,660
everybody here and I was kind of pretty

1115
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:57,309
sure that I was higher than him so I was

1116
00:51:55,659 --> 00:51:58,659
like no you're not and he saw me he goes

1117
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:00,639
Ross and Jeff I see you shaking her head

1118
00:51:58,659 --> 00:52:02,859
come here bro and he called me up to the

1119
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,109
stage I went to the stage he his buddy

1120
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:06,880
Tim gave me and it was at least a gram I

1121
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:08,320
think I took a gram and a half dab on

1122
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,970
the stage at the secret session burn

1123
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,050
everybody and did not choke and then we

1124
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:13,419
brought up a couple of people on the

1125
00:52:11,050 --> 00:52:15,610
stage and dab them out that was a pretty

1126
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:16,869
good time but honestly I was lit up

1127
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:17,960
because I would give people like a two

1128
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:19,219
gram dab and whatever they

1129
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:21,289
couldn't take I would finish it for him

1130
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:23,118
and oftentimes it was most of a gram you

1131
00:52:21,289 --> 00:52:24,349
trying to dab somebody a to grab dab and

1132
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,880
they start choking and they look at you

1133
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,559
like I'm done so I would just grab and

1134
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,820
finish it so it's pretty late we took a

1135
00:52:27,559 --> 00:52:30,170
little break and went sat in the

1136
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,390
greenroom and I ate a bunch of Cheetos

1137
00:52:30,170 --> 00:52:33,769
uh drank some dr. pepper I usually don't

1138
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:35,299
eat a bunch of crap but I needed some

1139
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:37,429
crap in my body so I had a bunch of junk

1140
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:38,780
and drop my [ __ ] back together while I

1141
00:52:37,429 --> 00:52:40,250
was sitting in the greenroom chilling

1142
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:41,780
out our good friend Lindsay the

1143
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:43,190

1144
00:52:41,780 --> 00:52:45,200

1145
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,940
shoutout to Lindsey and Molly ah they

1146
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,348
encouraged me to have another bag of

1147
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:51,260
chips and get my [ __ ] together and then

1148
00:52:48,349 --> 00:52:52,820
get back to the party so Lindsey and our

1149
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:56,089
new friend Molly and I went and cruised

1150
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:58,519
around the secret sesh and shout out to

1151

1156
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:11,420
bark on top of them sorry I'm my brain

1157
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:13,550
still they'd be fuzzy from the secret

1158
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:15,800
session I think there were 250 or 300

1159
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:18,980
milligrams each and I ate two of those I

1160
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,960
had some fruit there was pineapple and

1161
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:23,119
strawberries and some other random fruit

1162
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,190
that was chopped up that had medicated

1163
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,338
chocolate ganache that was hot on top of

1164
00:53:25,190 --> 00:53:29,630
it that stuff was so tasty so the secret

1165
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:30,889
session I got stupid late if you walked

1166
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:32,838
up and tried to talk to me and I was

1167
00:53:30,889 --> 00:53:35,000
kind of non-responsive I do apologize I

1168
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,739
had eaten about 850 to a thousand

1169
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,358
milligrams of edibles and I had smoked

1170
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:39,919
about four or five grams of hash so I

1171
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:41,509
was in no condition to be conversational

1172
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,608
I apologise but shout out to everyone at

1173
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:46,060

1174
00:53:42,608 --> 00:53:49,579
huge shout out to our friends at TNT

1175
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:52,489
extractions and Shuman bars human

1176
00:53:49,579 --> 00:53:55,219
edibles those dudes gave me a 1000

1177
00:53:52,489 --> 00:53:57,979
milligram edible and I ate that 1000

1178
00:53:55,219 --> 00:54:00,739
milligram edible yesterday on my way to

1179
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:02,838
work and by the time I got to work it

1180
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:06,679
felt like somebody had replaced my blood

1181
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:07,969
with sand my body was so dry and heavy

1182
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:09,559
that I just wanted to curl up in a

1183
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:12,529
corner and take a nap I have not been

1184
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:14,119
that ridiculously high in a long time a

1185
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:16,250
thousand milligrams is no joke you guys

1186
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:18,019
I do not recommend it I don't know that

1187
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,329
I want to do it again I feel like I

1188
00:54:18,019 --> 00:54:22,460
wasted probably a day and a half because

1189
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:24,259
the entire day I was useless and then

1190
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,329
half of today it took me half of the day

1191
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:27,650
to get my [ __ ] together so a thousand

1192
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,119
milligrams will [ __ ] you up if that's

1193
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,910
what you're looking for but oh my god I

1194
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,950
don't recommend it was an adventure

1195
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:35,469
it was it was like a shamanic journey

1196
00:54:32,949 --> 00:54:36,608
but I had to go and live my day doing it

1197
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:38,618
I had to go to work and I had to

1198
00:54:36,608 --> 00:54:40,150
function so it's kind of hard don't do

1199
00:54:38,619 --> 00:54:42,640
that unless you can lay around and just

1200
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:43,720

1235
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:51,818
you I appreciate that that's something I

1236
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:55,000
noticed when I used to listen to another

1237
00:55:51,818 --> 00:55:57,068
cannabis podcast people would ask aggro

1238
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,960
question and instead of giving solid Gro

1239
00:55:57,068 --> 00:56:01,449
advice the host of that show would sell

1240
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,220
you a product and it wouldn't solve your

1241
00:56:01,449 --> 00:56:04,689
problem it would temporarily solve your

1242
00:56:03,219 --> 00:56:06,129
problem it would mask your problem is

1243
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:07,778
what it would do and then you'd have to

1244
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:09,278
keep buying that product what I like to

1245
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:11,349
do is if you have a problem in your grow

1246
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:12,460
if you say hey I have spider mites I

1247
00:56:11,349 --> 00:56:14,109
like to help you figure out how you're

1248
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:15,699
getting spider mites teach you how to

1249
00:56:14,108 --> 00:56:17,199
correct that so that you don't ever get

1250
00:56:15,699 --> 00:56:19,389
mites again instead of having to buy

1251
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,679
some product that is sponsoring me over

1252
00:56:19,389 --> 00:56:23,368
and over again I don't think that's cool

1253
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:26,048
so I do appreciate that you notice that

1254
00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:27,700

the cannabis industry let's just say

1310
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,860
that she posted something to Facebook

1311
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,739

1312

1313

1314
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:19,070

1315
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:20,570

1316
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:23,720

1321
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,750
document correctly the first three times

1322
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:34,670

1324

1328
00:58:42,530 --> 00:58:46,910

at the people trying to get a job but

1404
01:01:07,570 --> 01:01:11,559
it's so real that it was worth sharing

1405
01:01:09,789 --> 01:01:13,779

01:02:35,079 --> 01:02:38,619
memes ah sometimes I act like I don't

1451
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:40,449
see them because I don't even know what

1452
01:02:38,619 --> 01:02:42,480
the [ __ ] to say so he sent me a long

1453
01:02:40,449 --> 01:02:44,159
Facebook message with several

1454
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:47,250
I'm gonna go through a couple of them

1455
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:49,739
here the first one he says how can a

1456
01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:52,440
humble simple ganja farmer folk avoid

1457
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:55,049
buying an ro and get rid of clora mites

1458
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:58,260
is asking how he can get rid of the

1459
01:02:55,050 --> 01:03:00,750
chlorine and whatever else the water

1460
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:02,760
company is putting in your water without

1461
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:04,199
buying a reverse osmosis machine because

1462
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:05,790
those are quite expensive and sometimes

1463
01:03:04,199 --> 01:03:07,710
people can't afford that sometimes you

1464
01:03:05,789 --> 01:03:10,590
don't have word of anywhere to put it so

1465
01:03:07,710 --> 01:03:12,570
how can a simple ganja farmer get rid of

1466
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:15,630
the chlorine and the stuff that the city

1467
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:17,940
is putting in our municipal water quite

1468
01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:19,800
simply you can put it in a giant jug and

1469
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,780
set it in the Sun and the Sun will help

1470
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:24,240
evaporate off any of those contaminants

1471
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:25,590
also I recommend putting if you need to

1472
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:27,689
do it indoors if you have to do it

1473
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:29,309
indoors most of us have to put the water

1474
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,530
put the tap water in a reservoir

1475
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:33,539
whatever size you're using and put a lot

1476
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:35,070
of air stones in there put air stones in

1477
01:03:33,539 --> 01:03:36,659
there and make it bubble real heavily

1478
01:03:35,070 --> 01:03:39,240
because then you'll move all that water

1479
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:40,289
around and surface area excuse me for

1480
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:42,059
clearing my throat over and over again

1481
01:03:40,289 --> 01:03:43,349
but surface area is what you're trying

1482
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:44,610
to create so you want to bring some of

1483
01:03:43,349 --> 01:03:45,960
that water from the bottom up to the top

1484
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:47,280
and help move some of that chlorine

1485
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:49,980
that's trapped in there up to the top

1486
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:52,380
and then it can evaporate so the easiest

1487
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:54,059
way is just to put your water in a big

1488
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,140
container and put air stones in it and

1489
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:57,329
bubble the [ __ ] out of it it's your

1490
01:03:55,139 --> 01:03:59,219
night itself a nice error an air bubble

1491
01:03:57,329 --> 01:04:00,659
or what do they call an air pump I just

1492
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:01,980
get yourself a nice powerful one they

1493
01:04:00,659 --> 01:04:04,379
make one that's got like eight air

1494
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:06,360
things coming off of it but all eight of

1495
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:08,160
them in like a thirty gallon trash can

1496
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:09,510
and fill that sucker with water and just

1497
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:11,159
pump the [ __ ] out of the air into there

1498
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:12,330
and that'll get rid of the chlorine of

1499
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:13,799
the chloramine or whatever you're

1500
01:04:12,329 --> 01:04:15,900
worried about in there will get rid of

1501
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:17,130
most of it and then of course before you

1502
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,750
give that to your plants make sure you

1503
01:04:17,130 --> 01:04:20,550
adjust the pH check the pH of that

1504
01:04:18,750 --> 01:04:22,440
adjust it before you feed it to your

1505
01:04:20,550 --> 01:04:23,880
plants depending on the plants age their

1506
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:25,349
pH they will want different stuff so

1507
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,940
that's how you get rid of that stuff and

1508
01:04:25,349 --> 01:04:28,799
it's free and it doesn't take much but

1509
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:31,619
time and a little bit of energy you may

1510
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:33,210
have to go buy yourself an air pump the

1511
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:35,339
second question said asked is thoughts

1512
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:40,369
on my coryza and Trichoderma bacteria

1513
01:04:35,340 --> 01:04:40,370
beneficials do you use and how much

1514
01:04:40,570 --> 01:04:44,170
he wants to know which of these

1515
01:04:42,039 --> 01:04:45,730
beneficials I use and how much there are

1516
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:48,159
several brands out there they're mostly

1517
01:04:45,730 --> 01:04:49,929
the same you guys I like there are

1518
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:52,269
several brands that I like I really like

1519
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:54,399
great white shark sometimes I like oh

1520
01:04:52,269 --> 01:04:56,289
gee bio war I like a lot of different

1521
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:59,559
things the chunkier white ones seem to

1522
01:04:56,289 --> 01:05:02,259
work the best for me um how much a whole

1523
01:04:59,559 --> 01:05:03,909
bunch when I put my when my seedlings

1524
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:05,500
cover when my clones come out of the

1525
01:05:03,909 --> 01:05:07,480
cloner they're going into a cup of soil

1526
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,829
or a small pot of soil I like to

1527
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:10,539
sprinkle a little bit of the great white

1528
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:12,969
shark around the base area where the

1529
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:15,730
roots are gonna hit and then put or also

1530
01:05:12,969 --> 01:05:17,799
I can't forget this one dragonfly earth

1531
01:05:15,730 --> 01:05:19,809
medicine they make a wash roots is also

1532
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,850
a great product for this a dust the

1533
01:05:19,809 --> 01:05:22,840
roots in there or put a little right

1534
01:05:21,849 --> 01:05:24,789
where the roots are gonna go and then

1535
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:26,800
bury the plant into that and then when I

1536
01:05:24,789 --> 01:05:28,360
let the roots grow in that cup or a

1537
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:29,800
small container for a long time until

1538
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,150
it's almost too much and then I

1539
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:33,580
transplant it into the next container

1540
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,480
and as I do I'll coat right where I'm

1541
01:05:33,579 --> 01:05:36,069
gonna put the plant

1542
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:39,309
I'll coat that area with just a sprinkle

1543
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:40,900
of whatever powdered root inoculants

1544
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:43,559
sort of thing that I'm gonna use if it's

1545
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:45,550
great white shark if it's og bio war

1546
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:47,469
whichever brand you're using you can use

1547
01:05:45,550 --> 01:05:48,880
OGT they're a whole bunch of different

1548
01:05:47,469 --> 01:05:50,889
products they're mostly the same I

1549
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,960
really like the great white shark it's

1550
01:05:50,889 --> 01:05:54,699
affordable its cost effective OG bio war

1551
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,230
is affordable its cost effective it's

1552
01:05:54,699 --> 01:05:58,480
worth its weight in gold in my opinion

1553
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:00,190
so those would be the two I'd recommend

1554
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,380
the great white shark or the og bio war

1555
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:04,780
and you can't use too much use it when

1556
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,890
you go from the cloner into the cup and

1557
01:06:04,780 --> 01:06:07,390
then when you go from the cup into the

1558
01:06:05,889 --> 01:06:10,420
pot and then if you go into another pot

1559
01:06:07,389 --> 01:06:11,650
do it again every time right where

1560
01:06:10,420 --> 01:06:13,150
you're putting those roots the fresh

1561
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:14,170
roots just put some of that into the

1562
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:16,900
dirt right where those roots are gonna

1563
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:18,789
touch and then I like to fill a

1564
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:20,470
container with clean water and then I

1565
01:06:18,789 --> 01:06:22,300
just mixed the powdered solution into

1566
01:06:20,469 --> 01:06:24,639
the water with my nutrients and feed it

1567
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:26,380
to the plants just like a water feed

1568
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,759
just like I feed all my other nutrients

1569
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:29,740
and I feel that that helps soak it in

1570
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:31,330
there real good so now I've got some

1571
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:32,619
that was in there with the roots when I

1572
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:34,059
put it in there in the dirt it's already

1573
01:06:32,619 --> 01:06:35,859
touching it the roots are eating it and

1574
01:06:34,059 --> 01:06:38,079
then I feed some in kind of like a tea

1575
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:39,880
so that it can get more I really like to

1576
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,269
give it that sort of stuff give it all

1577
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:44,500
give it excuse me once again give it

1578
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:47,050
give it these things all through the veg

1579
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:50,409
phase like maybe once every other week

1580
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:52,930
through the veg phase and then do it the

1581
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:54,699
first three weeks in flour one

1582
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:56,019
be a bad idea at all because you want to

1583
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:58,779
build those roots and keep those roots

1584
01:06:56,019 --> 01:07:01,750
moving so I hope that answered your

1585
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:05,079
question dude which uh which beneficials

1586
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:07,150
do I recommend so the next question you

1587
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:09,068
said my thoughts on LED lights the

1588
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:10,630
benefits you're thinking better tricone

1589
01:07:09,068 --> 01:07:13,150
production maybe if used in conjunction

1590
01:07:10,630 --> 01:07:16,289
with HBS not to mention energy savings

1591
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:18,670
ten to one for similar lumens output

1592
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:20,588
I've seen a lot of great [ __ ] come from

1593
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:23,050
LED lights I don't have any experience

1594
01:07:20,588 --> 01:07:25,328
with them honestly they're expensive and

1595
01:07:23,050 --> 01:07:27,280
I'm afraid to invest in a light that's

1596
01:07:25,329 --> 01:07:29,829
not going to make my plants perform the

1597
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,960
way that they need in the right

1598
01:07:29,829 --> 01:07:35,230
situation if you're in a small area and

1599
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:36,940
you can't run a big light do it if what

1600
01:07:35,230 --> 01:07:39,010
you're able to do is run an LED run an

1601
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:40,750
LED my friend Amanda has an LED and I've

1602
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:43,809
seen pictures of her cannabis plants and

1603
01:07:40,750 --> 01:07:45,849
they look good uh I can't argue with the

1604
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:47,619
led my friend Nancy Budd well I don't

1605
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:49,480
know if she listens to this podcast but

1606
01:07:47,619 --> 01:07:51,760
shout out to Nancy she grows with a lush

1607
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,949
LED and her plants look [ __ ] stellar

1608
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,540
her plants look really really good she

1609
01:07:53,949 --> 01:07:57,250
does a great job I've seen a lot of

1610
01:07:55,539 --> 01:08:00,849
great stuff from LEDs I just don't have

1611
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:03,400
any experience you are totally accurate

1612
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:05,109
with the cost-effectiveness of LEDs they

1613
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:07,389
really do keep electricity costs down

1614
01:08:05,108 --> 01:08:08,858
the lights themselves don't pull as much

1615
01:08:07,389 --> 01:08:10,420
power which means they don't make as

1616
01:08:08,858 --> 01:08:12,880
much heat which means you don't need as

1617
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:15,159
much air-conditioning so it's really

1618
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:17,560
beneficial it is a good thing if you get

1619
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:19,479
the right LEDs I'm sure that there are

1620
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:20,798
some cheap china-made ones out there

1621
01:08:19,479 --> 01:08:22,298
that you wouldn't want to purchase I'm

1622
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:26,079
sure there are some great american-made

1623
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:27,278
LEDs that would work very well so just

1624
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:28,568
do your research if you're gonna buy an

1625
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,219
LED I guess that's the best I could say

1626
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:31,060
on there try co-production yeah it's

1627
01:08:30,219 --> 01:08:32,409
gonna help you out with try

1628
01:08:31,060 --> 01:08:34,539
co-production because you're getting

1629
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:36,159
more types of light it's gonna make the

1630
01:08:34,539 --> 01:08:38,769
plants grow a little bit differently

1631
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:40,448
also it's gonna change them gosh I'm

1632
01:08:38,770 --> 01:08:43,390
sorry you guys I'm just choking up over

1633
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:44,710
here it's gonna change the nutritive

1634
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,000
cycle of that plant a little bit it's

1635
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:47,380
gonna speed it up a little bit I feel

1636
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,238
like cuz it's getting more different

1637
01:08:47,380 --> 01:08:50,409
light so you're gonna probably need to

1638
01:08:49,238 --> 01:08:51,879
feed a little bit differently there will

1639
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:54,939
be adjustments to be made if you shift

1640
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:57,579
shift from an HP S to an LED or if you

1641
01:08:54,939 --> 01:08:58,928
add an LED to your HP s room you're

1642
01:08:57,579 --> 01:09:01,210
gonna see different [ __ ] happening that

1643
01:08:58,929 --> 01:09:04,880
you're gonna have to adjust to I saw sub

1644
01:09:01,210 --> 01:09:07,369
cool hang a lush LED in his HBS room

1645
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:09,350
the plant underneath it hated it but

1646
01:09:07,369 --> 01:09:10,489
that's just cuz it wasn't some coals

1647
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:12,770
grow style so you're gonna have to

1648
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:14,420
adjust some [ __ ] I hope that answered

1649
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:17,930
your question about LEDs in my opinion

1650
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:20,420
so the next one is why I want to ask why

1651
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:23,960
more commercial grows don't get solar to

1652
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:26,119
offset massive power costs honestly at

1653
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,609
the amount of electricity we're using I

1654
01:09:26,119 --> 01:09:30,920
don't know that solar would even be a

1655
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:32,420
viable source I honestly don't know

1656
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,210
enough about solar that's something I

1657
01:09:32,420 --> 01:09:39,050
would have to research but honestly I we

1658
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:41,960
pull we've got a t5 1000 watt lights in

1659
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:42,800
one room and 25 1000 watt lights in

1660
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,439
another room

1661
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:50,210
the electricity bill is high dude and

1662
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:51,710
we've also got [ __ ] tons tons and tons

1663
01:09:50,210 --> 01:09:53,930
of air conditioning on top of that

1664
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:56,239
building that just keep us cool all day

1665
01:09:53,930 --> 01:09:58,280
it was really warm today when I really

1666
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,719
want it was fairly warm to the outside

1667
01:09:58,279 --> 01:10:01,699
it's gonna get way hotter but it was

1668
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:03,619
fairly warm and the building was nice

1669
01:10:01,699 --> 01:10:04,670
and cool it's probably 74 degrees in the

1670
01:10:03,619 --> 01:10:06,470
whole building and we've got a nice

1671
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:08,630
office space we've got a trim area so

1672
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:11,150
there's a [ __ ] ton of lights I don't

1673
01:10:08,630 --> 01:10:12,260
think that motorcycle was so loud I hope

1674
01:10:11,149 --> 01:10:14,119
you guys heard that cuz it's kind of

1675
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:16,340
scared the [ __ ] at me I don't think that

1676
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:19,099
we could get enough electricity through

1677
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:21,500
solar to run all of the stuff that we

1678
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:23,900
have of course I am NOT an electrical

1679
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,520
engineer or anywhere educated in any

1680
01:10:23,899 --> 01:10:26,960
means of solar power but that's my

1681
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,550
opinion that's what I would assume

1682
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:30,529
that's what I would guess dude so then

1683
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:32,180
he asked me question number five said

1684
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:33,920
said how do you keep so cool under

1685
01:10:32,180 --> 01:10:36,440
pressure when the cop pulled you over

1686
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:38,149
and then he also said being responsible

1687
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:40,009
for so much medicine in patients as it

1688
01:10:38,149 --> 01:10:41,929
does it keep you awake at night worrying

1689
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:44,270
about timers and stuff any tips on how

1690
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:45,829
to relax and not freak out like I tend

1691
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,570
to

1692
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:50,390
well [ __ ] bro I I didn't worry about

1693
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:51,649
timers and stuff until you just pointed

1694
01:10:50,390 --> 01:10:53,119
it out now I'm having a damn panic

1695
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:55,189
attack and I want to check the cameras

1696
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:56,930
on my phone and see if everything if the

1697
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:59,210
grow is cool and I'm just totally joking

1698
01:10:56,930 --> 01:11:00,560
with you um how do I keep my cool under

1699
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:03,619
pressure like when that cop pulled me

1700
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,360
over well I'm a grown-ass adult and that

1701
01:11:03,619 --> 01:11:07,460
cops just a grown-ass man with a job to

1702
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:12,049
do and I didn't have anything to hide

1703
01:11:07,460 --> 01:11:14,060
and I guess being a white dude with a

1704
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:15,350
nice car probably helped me out so I

1705
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,780
didn't feel like it was worried about

1706
01:11:15,350 --> 01:11:19,700
too much and because I mean we know I'm

1707
01:11:17,779 --> 01:11:20,869
not even kidding if I was a different

1708
01:11:19,699 --> 01:11:22,550
race it could have been a totally

1709
01:11:20,869 --> 01:11:23,750
different outcome I'm not accusing this

1710
01:11:22,550 --> 01:11:25,789
cop of anything but we know how things

1711
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:27,380
go so being a spoiled white dude helps

1712
01:11:25,789 --> 01:11:30,470
me out for sure in that case keeping my

1713
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:32,750
cool with the cops and I'm just well

1714
01:11:30,470 --> 01:11:34,640
educated and I speak well and I'm very

1715
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:36,350
sociable so I don't worry about cops

1716
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,060
they're just people with a job to do and

1717
01:11:36,350 --> 01:11:40,460
if you're not doing anything stupid and

1718
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:42,680
hiding anything most of the time you

1719
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:45,590
should be cool I feel like and so I just

1720
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:46,730
I hoped for that I guess that's how I

1721
01:11:45,590 --> 01:11:48,440
stayed cool with the cops

1722
01:11:46,729 --> 01:11:51,289
honestly I'm not intimidated by people

1723
01:11:48,439 --> 01:11:54,139
people are people if the person next to

1724
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:55,850
me is Rasta Seb if the person next to me

1725
01:11:54,140 --> 01:11:57,770
is white Mike if the person sitting next

1726
01:11:55,850 --> 01:11:59,570
to me is Lindsay or if the person

1727
01:11:57,770 --> 01:12:01,730
sitting next to me is the President or

1728
01:11:59,569 --> 01:12:04,909
if the person sitting next to me is

1729
01:12:01,729 --> 01:12:06,799
whoever I feel the same they're people

1730
01:12:04,909 --> 01:12:08,960
we're all humans we all fart we all poop

1731
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,550
we all have to go pee we all need to eat

1732
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,810
food to live life we all have feelings

1733
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:13,100
where all those people so I don't people

1734
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:15,200
don't make me nervous they were all just

1735
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,940
people like rock stars are just people

1736
01:12:15,199 --> 01:12:18,079
that play guitars real well I don't get

1737
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:20,569
nervous around people so that's how I

1738
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:23,180
keep cool in that situation the part

1739
01:12:20,569 --> 01:12:24,859
about being responsible for so much

1740
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:27,409
medicine and patience and does it keep

1741
01:12:24,859 --> 01:12:30,259
me awake at night ah no because I

1742
01:12:27,409 --> 01:12:31,760
wouldn't be in the position if the

1743
01:12:30,260 --> 01:12:33,380
people that put me they let me have this

1744
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:37,010
position didn't have full trust of me

1745
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:38,239
and I would not I wouldn't even do it if

1746
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,650
I didn't have faith in myself that I

1747
01:12:38,239 --> 01:12:41,539
could do this I would say straight up

1748
01:12:39,649 --> 01:12:44,149
like hey this is not my thing I can't

1749
01:12:41,539 --> 01:12:46,579
handle this and also I've got good

1750
01:12:44,149 --> 01:12:48,739
backup it is my I do run that girl by

1751
01:12:46,579 --> 01:12:51,019
myself for the most part but if I need

1752
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:52,760
help I can call hunt hunt will come help

1753
01:12:51,020 --> 01:12:55,160
I can call Zach Zach will come help I

1754
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:57,530
have a tremor that's there trimmin eight

1755
01:12:55,159 --> 01:12:59,329
days a week now so I can have him help

1756
01:12:57,529 --> 01:13:01,189
me if there is trouble in the growth

1757
01:12:59,329 --> 01:13:02,659
need help with so yeah I am responsible

1758
01:13:01,189 --> 01:13:04,849
for but it doesn't keep me awake at

1759
01:13:02,659 --> 01:13:06,800
night I've got it figured out I know the

1760
01:13:04,850 --> 01:13:08,030
building really well I know every timer

1761
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:09,980
in the building I know what time

1762
01:13:08,029 --> 01:13:11,840
everything clicks on what time

1763
01:13:09,979 --> 01:13:13,729
everything clicks off I know what the

1764
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,819
temperature is in each room right now so

1765
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:18,709
I don't worry too much about that and

1766
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:22,399
then you said does it keep you awake at

1767
01:13:18,710 --> 01:13:25,310
night worrying about timers and stuff so

1768
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,989
one time dude uh it was late it was

1769
01:13:25,310 --> 01:13:28,610
midnight and I was laying down to go to

1770
01:13:26,989 --> 01:13:30,260
sleep and I thought I should check the

1771
01:13:28,609 --> 01:13:32,029
cameras at the Gros just to see what's

1772
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:34,820
going on and it's an hour away from my

1773
01:13:32,029 --> 01:13:37,429
house in good weather so I look at the

1774
01:13:34,819 --> 01:13:39,170
camera and I can see that this one pump

1775
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:42,020
is broken I can see it on the camera

1776
01:13:39,170 --> 01:13:44,029
that a tank that should have been fed to

1777
01:13:42,020 --> 01:13:46,660
these plants was totally full and the

1778
01:13:44,029 --> 01:13:49,279
pump had not pumped in several hours

1779
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:50,649
probably six good hours and if these

1780
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:53,599
plants didn't get a drink of water

1781
01:13:50,649 --> 01:13:56,119
within the next three or four hours it

1782
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,530
probably were gonna die and it was

1783
01:13:56,119 --> 01:14:00,079
midnight and I was getting ready to go

1784
01:13:57,529 --> 01:14:01,609
to bed and I saw this so I did the only

1785
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,350
thing I could do I put on my shoes and I

1786
01:14:01,609 --> 01:14:05,869
got my car and I drove the hour there

1787
01:14:03,350 --> 01:14:09,230
and I fixed the pump honestly it took me

1788
01:14:05,869 --> 01:14:11,000
maybe five minutes to fix that pump then

1789
01:14:09,229 --> 01:14:12,529
I got back in the car and my car broken

1790
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,939
down it wouldn't start a head up I had

1791
01:14:12,529 --> 01:14:15,139
to get my car [ __ ] towed home that

1792
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:16,549
night that was really funny cuz it's

1793
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:20,060
5:00 in the morning by the time I got

1794
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:21,920
home but I have cameras I can check and

1795
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:23,330
see if anything goes really wrong and at

1796
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,329
this point I've been there long enough

1797
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:28,159
to where I know like I said earlier I

1798
01:14:26,329 --> 01:14:30,890
know every timer in that building I know

1799
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:33,710
every breaker in the breaker box I know

1800
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:35,570
where I know every if I'm if a leaf

1801
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:37,609
moves in that room I know which plant it

1802
01:14:35,569 --> 01:14:39,859
was on that's how well I know that grow

1803
01:14:37,609 --> 01:14:42,289
so it doesn't stress me out too much it

1804
01:14:39,859 --> 01:14:43,969
doesn't keep me up at night ah man if

1805
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:45,560
you smoke as much hash as I did and

1806
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:48,650
smoked as many edibles as I did you'd

1807
01:14:45,560 --> 01:14:51,530
have no problem sleeping at night but I

1808
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:52,789
just have faith in myself honestly I've

1809
01:14:51,529 --> 01:14:54,920
been doing this for a long time I'm a

1810
01:14:52,789 --> 01:14:56,630
confident dude I take a lot of notes

1811
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,430
honestly I write notes on everything

1812
01:14:56,630 --> 01:15:00,199
I've got billions a little post-it notes

1813
01:14:58,430 --> 01:15:01,730
all over the grow that helps me know

1814
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:04,130
that honestly helps me keep my cool

1815
01:15:01,729 --> 01:15:05,329
because they're just all the [ __ ] that I

1816
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:07,279
need to do is right there and once I

1817
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:08,750
figure finish a couple of tasks I cross

1818
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:10,399
them off the list and throw the post-it

1819
01:15:08,750 --> 01:15:12,359
note away if you give me something that

1820
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:13,439
I need to remember I just write it down

1821
01:15:12,359 --> 01:15:15,359
I just keep post-it notes that really

1822
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:16,888
helps me that's something that really

1823
01:15:15,359 --> 01:15:18,509
helps me keep my [ __ ] together his notes

1824
01:15:16,889 --> 01:15:20,190
and then I talk notes into my phone also

1825
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:23,280
I felt Siri hey Siri make a note of this

1826
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:26,488

1835
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:44,488
but that's life when you do fix it

01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:47,130
you'll be okay like seriously I run a

1837
01:15:44,488 --> 01:15:48,419
big ass growing I was talking to a guy

1838
01:15:47,130 --> 01:15:49,650

the first thing you do when you get here

1841
01:15:50,729 --> 01:15:53,428

1842
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:56,060
every morning when you walk into a big

1843
01:15:53,429 --> 01:15:58,980

1846

other day a breaker had flipped and a

1847
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:07,980
cloner filled with clothes that I really

1848
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,750
wanted to have of the breaker flipped in

1849

1853
01:16:17,368 --> 01:16:20,549
breaker I had nothing to do with me but

1854
01:16:19,260 --> 01:16:22,170

1855
01:16:20,550 --> 01:16:24,600

1864
01:16:37,649 --> 01:16:40,408

1865
01:16:39,300 --> 01:16:42,449

no one's gonna laugh at you maybe we are

1868
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:50,039
but laugh at yourself too and if you

1869
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:51,719
overflow reservoir ah get the squeegee

1870
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:53,939
and push that water down to the drain

1871
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:56,219
and then mop up the floor and then next

1872
01:16:53,939 --> 01:16:57,629
time don't overflow that reservoir if

1873
01:16:56,219 --> 01:16:59,639
you kill a plant remember what you did

1874
01:16:57,630 --> 01:17:01,400
don't kill a plant again that's how I

1875
01:16:59,639 --> 01:17:03,779
stay so I don't freak out about stuff

1876
01:17:01,399 --> 01:17:05,099
I've been at this a long time and I've

1877
01:17:03,779 --> 01:17:06,210
dealt with a lot of mistakes and a lot

1878
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,130
of problems and I know that I'm prepared

1879
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:10,289
to deal with almost anything you can

1880
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:12,270
throw at me in a grow room and if I

1881
01:17:10,289 --> 01:17:14,760
haven't dealt with it yet I'm ready to

1882
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:16,440
learn so that's how I don't freak out

1883
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:19,440
but I just stay confident and know that

1884
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:21,359
I got this [ __ ] that's life just now it

1885
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:24,699
does plants are gonna die reservoirs are

1886
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:26,409
gonna overflow things are gonna happen

1887
01:17:24,699 --> 01:17:28,750
a fall I've seen whites just completely

1888
01:17:26,409 --> 01:17:30,609
fall I've seen tables fall over random

1889
01:17:28,750 --> 01:17:31,930
[ __ ] happens I'm just confident that I

1890
01:17:30,609 --> 01:17:34,210
can deal with it when it does

1891
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:35,680
part of that is cuz I have I got a

1892
01:17:34,210 --> 01:17:37,119
little bit a little bit of faith in me

1893
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,460
and some other things so it makes me

1894
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:42,189

1903

1904
01:17:58,449 --> 01:18:02,380

big oil shout out to my buddy citizen

2083
01:26:35,380 --> 01:26:40,779
Jay thanks for putting me on the network

2084
01:26:37,988 --> 01:26:43,000
I think that's all of the official

2085
01:26:40,779 --> 01:26:55,750
business that I need to spit out for

2086
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:57,010
right now I just got an email that I

2087
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:58,689
wanted to read and I'm sure that you'll

2088
01:26:57,010 --> 01:27:02,199
have a couple of things to chime in with

2089
01:26:58,689 --> 01:27:03,519
because always and Lindsey always has

2090
01:27:02,198 --> 01:27:05,710
good [ __ ] to say she brings up good

2091
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:06,820
points that I overlooked so let's just

2092
01:27:05,710 --> 01:27:07,859
jump right into we've got an email

2093
01:27:06,819 --> 01:27:10,719
that's part of the topic of the show

2094
01:27:07,859 --> 01:27:13,089
this one comes from our friend does he

2095
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,409
want me to say his name or not I'm not

2096
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:16,150
gonna say his name because he's from an

2097
01:27:14,409 --> 01:27:17,679
illegal state it says that he lives in

2098
01:27:16,149 --> 01:27:18,819
an illegal state he says hi my name is

2099
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:20,469
something and they live in an illegal

2100
01:27:18,819 --> 01:27:21,789
State and I was wondering if you could

2101
01:27:20,469 --> 01:27:26,590
do that episode about how to control

2102
01:27:21,789 --> 01:27:31,238
fungus gnats that's not too hard of a

2103
01:27:26,590 --> 01:27:34,989
problem I don't have a great method okay

2104
01:27:31,238 --> 01:27:37,209
my my one and only bug solution that I

2105
01:27:34,988 --> 01:27:39,309
ever had the power to implement and

2106
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:45,819
really carry out to my own desire is

2107
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:48,639
sort of nuclear you got bugs at one time

2108
01:27:45,819 --> 01:27:51,698
I got bugs like a spider bite it bad Oh

2109
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:53,560
I just I went to town it's a month-long

2110
01:27:51,698 --> 01:27:56,319
process that involves a couple gallons

2111
01:27:53,560 --> 01:28:05,889
of bleach and killing everything you own

2112
01:27:56,319 --> 01:28:07,509
twice it works do that um a lot of

2113
01:28:05,889 --> 01:28:09,100
people have to fight but no fungus Nets

2114
01:28:07,510 --> 01:28:10,570
was never one I really had to play with

2115
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:13,030
well this dudes asking about fungus

2116
01:28:10,569 --> 01:28:14,679
gnats fungus gnats occur they show up

2117
01:28:13,029 --> 01:28:17,079
when your soil is kept too moist or when

2118
01:28:14,679 --> 01:28:18,730
your medium is kept too moist I'm

2119
01:28:17,079 --> 01:28:20,079
growing in a giant commercial warehouse

2120
01:28:18,729 --> 01:28:22,718
and in that warehouse we've got a giant

2121
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:24,250
floor drain and often times I see little

2122
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:25,630
[ __ ] fungus gnats trying to flap

2123
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:36,760
through that floor drain I hear it every

2124
01:28:25,630 --> 01:28:38,739
bug they transfer how people fight these

2125
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:40,270
infestation if you can keep moisture

2126
01:28:38,738 --> 01:28:41,649
levels down a little bit in your soil

2127
01:28:40,270 --> 01:28:44,080
let your dirt dry up a little bit

2128
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:46,569
that'll help get rid of them you can use

2129
01:28:44,079 --> 01:28:49,000
diatomaceous earth on top let the soil

2130
01:28:46,569 --> 01:28:50,710
dry applied the diatomaceous earth to

2131
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:52,359
the top of the soil or the medium if you

2132
01:28:50,710 --> 01:28:54,489
got Coco and just leave it on their wall

2133
01:28:52,359 --> 01:28:55,599
to dry and then water a little later are

2134
01:28:54,488 --> 01:28:57,849
you gonna put that [ __ ] on there Walt's

2135
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:00,010
try it it works on its dry then those

2136
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:02,199
bugs won't want to climb in there what I

2137
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:04,539
recommend if you're trying to stay all

2138
01:29:02,198 --> 01:29:06,460
organic there are little things at

2139
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:07,840
Lowe's or Home Depot called mosquito

2140
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:10,239
dunks they're just little donut looking

2141
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:11,860
things in a red package put those in the

2142
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:12,669
water submerge them in the water let

2143
01:29:11,859 --> 01:29:15,039
them sit there for a little while

2144
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:16,630
they'll kind of get mushy wear a rubber

2145
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:17,738
glove and rub them in your hand and

2146
01:29:16,630 --> 01:29:19,270
grind them up a little bit to where they

2147
01:29:17,738 --> 01:29:21,099
turn into a powder and let that sit in

2148
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:22,600
your reservoir and put a little bit of

2149
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:24,489
that in each plant when you water that's

2150
01:29:22,600 --> 01:29:26,469
a beneficial bacteria that I cannot

2151
01:29:24,488 --> 01:29:27,519
remember the name of right now I know it

2152
01:29:26,469 --> 01:29:29,829
but since I'm trying to tell you it's

2153
01:29:27,520 --> 01:29:31,600
gone out of my mind but that beneficial

2154
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:33,789
bacteria will kill off the fungus gnats

2155
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:35,260
and it's cheap effective and organic in

2156
01:29:33,789 --> 01:29:37,750
a home grow if you're doing a big grow

2157
01:29:35,260 --> 01:29:39,070
you may need a product like natural and

2158
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:41,618
you do the exact same process you just

2159
01:29:39,069 --> 01:29:43,448
feed that into the soil and then you're

2160
01:29:41,618 --> 01:29:45,460
gonna wanna triple check that against

2161
01:29:43,448 --> 01:29:48,219
your state's list if your state's gotten

2162
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:49,810
that far but this is a homegrown letter

2163
01:29:48,219 --> 01:29:51,279
in it yeah this is a homegrown guy in an

2164
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:53,289
illegal state but if you're going the

2165
01:29:51,279 --> 01:29:54,148
the mosquito dunks solutions not a bad

2166
01:29:53,289 --> 01:29:57,189
one

2167
01:29:54,149 --> 01:30:00,369
but I mean honestly the go back and

2168
01:29:57,189 --> 01:30:01,869
listen to the episodes about ways of

2169
01:30:00,368 --> 01:30:03,848
maintaining your garden to really

2170
01:30:01,868 --> 01:30:05,708
prevent infestations from occurring

2171
01:30:03,849 --> 01:30:07,029
unfortunately with fungus notes a lot of

2172
01:30:05,708 --> 01:30:09,128
times people bring them home from the

2173
01:30:07,029 --> 01:30:11,108
gross floor yeah they come in the soil

2174
01:30:09,128 --> 01:30:13,149
quite often I've had thrips come in soil

2175
01:30:11,109 --> 01:30:16,359
I can't say that I've had spider mites

2176
01:30:13,149 --> 01:30:19,239
come in so to help to deal with this one

2177
01:30:16,359 --> 01:30:22,719
of them got um when the guy that lived

2178
01:30:19,238 --> 01:30:25,298
in the other side of the split-level um

2179
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:29,439
started to grow oh you know two separate

2180
01:30:25,298 --> 01:30:31,899
grows in domicile dude this started the

2181
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:34,798
second little fun and fun closet grow

2182
01:30:31,899 --> 01:30:37,809
brought home fungus gnats in his soil

2183
01:30:34,798 --> 01:30:40,059
cost the other the guy growing on the

2184
01:30:37,809 --> 01:30:41,918
other side of the grow immensely and

2185
01:30:40,059 --> 01:30:43,329
then the other person I know that got

2186
01:30:41,918 --> 01:30:44,048
him that did that neighbor on the other

2187
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:46,738
side of the fence

2188
01:30:44,048 --> 01:30:48,878
amara the other side of the alley rather

2189
01:30:46,738 --> 01:30:51,638
we couldn't figure out where they came

2190
01:30:48,878 --> 01:30:53,198
from it didn't make any sense just kind

2191
01:30:51,639 --> 01:30:55,479
of wandered in and found the plant and

2192
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:57,458
went nuts was our best guess and then we

2193
01:30:55,479 --> 01:30:58,809
heard that harvesting uh I mean they

2194
01:30:57,458 --> 01:31:01,389
were bitching about all the little white

2195
01:30:58,809 --> 01:31:06,668
bugs flying out of the bud while we were

2196
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:08,109
like we can't retaliate or say anything

2197
01:31:06,668 --> 01:31:20,798
right now because we don't want them to

2198
01:31:08,109 --> 01:31:22,329
know we had plants back here neither of

2199
01:31:20,798 --> 01:31:24,279
those were under my care but both of

2200
01:31:22,328 --> 01:31:26,588
them were like really hard to prevent

2201
01:31:24,279 --> 01:31:27,969
type situations yeah well the way to get

2202
01:31:26,588 --> 01:31:30,158
rid of fungus gnats I think is either

2203
01:31:27,969 --> 01:31:33,338
the dunks or natural and dry out your

2204
01:31:30,158 --> 01:31:35,318
soil you can always use a Xamax as a

2205
01:31:33,338 --> 01:31:37,538
soil drench use it really lightly mix it

2206
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:39,729
in with water I do not know the ratio it

2207
01:31:37,538 --> 01:31:42,099
says on the container is a soil dredge

2208
01:31:39,729 --> 01:31:44,769
so poet pour a little bit as a max into

2209
01:31:42,099 --> 01:31:46,088
your into some water and just water the

2210
01:31:44,769 --> 01:31:47,798
plants with that and that'll help you

2211
01:31:46,088 --> 01:31:49,359
out with fungus gnats I wouldn't go that

2212
01:31:47,798 --> 01:31:51,128
route unless it's extreme but it will

2213
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,659
work unless your plants are really

2214
01:31:51,128 --> 01:31:54,189
healthy I don't know that I would do it

2215
01:31:52,658 --> 01:31:56,888
but it'll work it sounds like you're at

2216
01:31:54,189 --> 01:31:59,709
least headed to Lowe's or the local go

2217
01:31:56,889 --> 01:32:01,208
to Lowe's and try and so put the

2218
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:02,679
mosquito dunks in there in water and

2219
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,658
then if you have the time depending on

2220
01:32:02,679 --> 01:32:06,159
how big your plants are

2221
01:32:03,658 --> 01:32:08,529
cover up the soil

2222
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:10,180
cover up the like if you can maybe take

2223
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:11,949
a paper plate and kind of slit up it and

2224
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:13,600
then put that put the stem in that slit

2225
01:32:11,949 --> 01:32:15,729
and then cover up the soil so the bugs

2226
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:16,900
don't have a way in or out then the bugs

2227
01:32:15,729 --> 01:32:19,000
that are in there will stay in there and

2228
01:32:16,899 --> 01:32:20,139
die no more bugs will be able to land in

2229
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,399
there they won't be breeding that I hope

2230
01:32:20,140 --> 01:32:22,780
you keep more [ __ ] out too so the paper

2231
01:32:21,399 --> 01:32:24,699
plate method will be totally helpful

2232
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:26,349
data nation's earth if you want to go

2233
01:32:24,699 --> 01:32:27,760
hard on it but I think the mosquito

2234
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,930
dunks are some natural will solve your

2235
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:30,850
problem all right

2236
01:32:28,930 --> 01:32:32,800
part two of this email this dude says

2237
01:32:30,850 --> 01:32:34,150
also could you speak about the laws in

2238
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,250
Pueblo Colorado for growing your own

2239
01:32:34,149 --> 01:32:37,509
medicine maybe about four to six plants

2240
01:32:36,250 --> 01:32:39,609
and then he says thank you

2241
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:42,369
I love the show and enjoy all of the

2242
01:32:39,609 --> 01:32:45,250
educational goddamn excuse that all the

2243
01:32:42,369 --> 01:32:46,479
educational information you give dude

2244
01:32:45,250 --> 01:32:48,159
thanks for listening I appreciate it

2245
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:49,929
thanks for the email I'm gonna let Mike

2246
01:32:48,159 --> 01:33:04,840
talk a little bit about growing laws in

2247
01:32:49,930 --> 01:33:07,990
Colorado County both have slightly

2248
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:10,210
different rules for four to six plants

2249
01:33:07,989 --> 01:33:13,149
though in all of Colorado and the adult

2250
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:15,789
in legally grow six plants just because

2251
01:33:13,149 --> 01:33:19,599
amendment 64 passed and marijuana is

2252
01:33:15,789 --> 01:33:21,579
legal heir so as long as you keep no

2253
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:24,940
more than three plants per adult in the

2254
01:33:21,579 --> 01:33:28,119
household and flower and then say you

2255
01:33:24,939 --> 01:33:29,919
were living inside City Limits you kept

2256
01:33:28,119 --> 01:33:32,319
those no more than three plants in

2257
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:34,659
flower and then your three veg plants

2258
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:36,069
and no more than a hundred square foot

2259
01:33:34,659 --> 01:33:38,889
of grow space

2260
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:42,579
ten by ten you'd pretty much be covered

2261
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:46,090
that's a pretty small gross space they

2262
01:33:42,579 --> 01:33:46,659
wanted to make a lot smaller might

2263
01:33:46,090 --> 01:33:47,980
quarter

2264
01:33:46,659 --> 01:33:49,659
yeah and they wanted to liver your plant

2265
01:33:47,979 --> 01:33:52,809
count and basically me and one other

2266
01:33:49,659 --> 01:33:54,930
citizen who does not like his name being

2267
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:57,310
shared publicly but you know who you are

2268
01:33:54,930 --> 01:34:01,390
thank you for the help with that fight

2269
01:33:57,310 --> 01:34:06,240
busy listen me have no idea okay just

2270
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:06,240
recently this house is amazing work

2271
01:34:06,529 --> 01:34:11,789
but yes and when the city you couldn't

2272
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:14,909
you just gotta keep your grow restricted

2273
01:34:11,789 --> 01:34:18,329
to the total square footage under 100

2274
01:34:14,909 --> 01:34:21,449
square feet which is ten by ten or I'd

2275
01:34:18,329 --> 01:34:23,399
in the county it's there's there's a

2276
01:34:21,449 --> 01:34:25,889
square foot limit I think overall but

2277
01:34:23,399 --> 01:34:29,219
it's pretty big and then there's a plant

2278
01:34:25,890 --> 01:34:30,960
count that's total per household but if

2279
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:33,590
you're talking about just growing your

2280
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:38,279
own six legal plants under amendment 64

2281
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:39,900
for say you and a domestic partner that

2282
01:34:38,279 --> 01:34:42,239
would be twelve plants total you're

2283
01:34:39,899 --> 01:34:45,539
under the under the limit and honestly

2284
01:34:42,239 --> 01:34:47,369
before you started your grow in either

2285
01:34:45,539 --> 01:34:48,840
of those locations I would recommend

2286
01:34:47,369 --> 01:34:50,779
heading to the appropriate zoning

2287
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:53,520
department because there are two of them

2288
01:34:50,779 --> 01:34:55,439
and just asking politely for a copy of

2289
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:58,320
the home girl rules which they're happy

2290
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:00,689
to give you or tell you how to find so

2291
01:34:58,319 --> 01:35:02,549
that you can go home and follow them and

2292
01:35:00,689 --> 01:35:04,739
right now there's a bunch of raids going

2293
01:35:02,550 --> 01:35:07,619
on right now people that move here

2294
01:35:04,739 --> 01:35:09,569
didn't read the rules a couple of Mark

2295
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:15,059
wire quoted is going yeah I come in and

2296
01:35:09,569 --> 01:35:16,920
look like it's legal here right yeah so

2297
01:35:15,060 --> 01:35:19,470
you going to jail just like you would in

2298
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:22,500
texas or Florida for the same crimes

2299
01:35:19,470 --> 01:35:23,220
with the same penalties yeah but weeds

2300
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:25,649
legal here

2301
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:27,270
it's a weird conundrum yeah but the

2302
01:35:25,649 --> 01:35:29,399
rules are easy to follow especially if

2303
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:32,640
you're looking for personal a personal

2304
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:34,199
harvest sizes you can play with your

2305
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:37,020
numbers and your gross base and stuff

2306
01:35:34,199 --> 01:35:39,389
and kind of maximize that but for a

2307
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:41,160
small grow four to six plants it's super

2308
01:35:39,390 --> 01:35:43,140
easy to follow the rules some counties

2309
01:35:41,159 --> 01:35:44,909
have made different grow plant count

2310
01:35:43,140 --> 01:35:47,400
limits some counties don't have any

2311
01:35:44,909 --> 01:35:50,869
plant count limits that changes in every

2312
01:35:47,399 --> 01:35:52,589
legal jurisdiction and if in Colorado

2313
01:35:50,869 --> 01:35:56,369
when you go to the medical marijuana

2314
01:35:52,590 --> 01:35:58,409
doctor you can ask them to possibly

2315
01:35:56,369 --> 01:36:00,359
recommend more plants so that you can

2316
01:35:58,409 --> 01:36:02,460
have more medicine and they'll write you

2317
01:36:00,359 --> 01:36:04,289
an extended plant count if you qualify

2318
01:36:02,460 --> 01:36:06,899
and then in some counties you're able to

2319
01:36:04,289 --> 01:36:08,519
grow however many your card says a lot

2320
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:09,969
of counties have limited you a lot just

2321
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:12,939
let you do your thing

2322
01:36:09,969 --> 01:36:15,128
more and more counties in cities towns

2323
01:36:12,939 --> 01:36:16,719
everything every little jurisdiction in

2324
01:36:15,128 --> 01:36:19,300
Colorado they're starting to pass rules

2325
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:22,510
limiting the total size of a home

2326
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:24,550
cultivation basically unless you own

2327
01:36:22,510 --> 01:36:27,668
property where you could grow acres and

2328
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:30,219
acres of corn within the next year to

2329
01:36:27,668 --> 01:36:33,729
expect that that area will have passed a

2330
01:36:30,219 --> 01:36:37,300
limit of at least 20 plants or maybe 200

2331
01:36:33,729 --> 01:36:39,309
or 300 square feet total gross space in

2332
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:41,619
a private private residence in Colorado

2333
01:36:39,309 --> 01:36:44,349
that's I think that's pretty a pretty

2334
01:36:41,618 --> 01:36:46,268
fair bet all right so I hope we answered

2335
01:36:44,349 --> 01:36:48,069
your question very well I think we got

2336
01:36:46,269 --> 01:36:50,469
into that one thanks for help on that

2337
01:36:48,069 --> 01:36:52,478
Mike happy to we got another message

2338
01:36:50,469 --> 01:36:53,469
this one came on Facebook and this one

2339
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:54,458
can I'm not gonna say the dude's name

2340
01:36:53,469 --> 01:36:55,599
cuz I don't know if people want their

2341
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:56,918
name said he sent me a private message

2342
01:36:55,599 --> 01:36:59,109
you said listening to your latest

2343
01:36:56,918 --> 01:37:00,788
podcast diggin it as usual just a quick

2344
01:36:59,109 --> 01:37:03,519
heads up on your chloramine question for

2345
01:37:00,788 --> 01:37:05,889
listener and that's what forcep shot at

2346
01:37:03,519 --> 01:37:07,859
the stem she said asked about the

2347
01:37:05,889 --> 01:37:10,359
chloramine that was hard as [ __ ] to say

2348
01:37:07,859 --> 01:37:13,209
chlorine is a gas that can be bubbled or

2349
01:37:10,359 --> 01:37:15,039
evaporated but chloramine is not nora no

2350
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:17,800
amount of bubbling will remove

2351
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:19,590
chloramine in fact its ability to stay

2352
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:22,449
in solution as the reason water

2353
01:37:19,590 --> 01:37:24,929
municipalities are switching to it ro is

2354
01:37:22,448 --> 01:37:27,608
the only thing that will work

2355
01:37:24,929 --> 01:37:29,319
unfortunately I know this guy knows what

2356
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:31,629
he's talking about because he used the

2357
01:37:29,319 --> 01:37:33,518
phrase stays in solution and that is

2358
01:37:31,628 --> 01:37:35,050
definitely organic chemistry major speak

2359
01:37:33,519 --> 01:37:37,510
because we have a we share a mutual

2360
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:39,099
friend who is an O chem major and he

2361
01:37:37,510 --> 01:37:40,809
says [ __ ] like that to me all the time

2362
01:37:39,099 --> 01:37:42,038
so that makes me think he knows what

2363
01:37:40,809 --> 01:37:44,649
he's talking about so shout out to this

2364
01:37:42,038 --> 01:37:46,658
guy Sam are you listening my friend

2365
01:37:44,649 --> 01:37:48,189
chloramine the only way to get the

2366
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:49,839
chloramine out of your water is a

2367
01:37:48,189 --> 01:37:51,070
reverse osmosis machine so you're gonna

2368
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:52,659
have to purchase one of those they sell

2369
01:37:51,069 --> 01:37:55,148
a cheap one bro they sell a small model

2370
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:58,388
don't go to the hydro shop for an RO

2371
01:37:55,149 --> 01:38:00,070
machine go to either like we got a

2372
01:37:58,389 --> 01:38:02,019
Walmart here in the States I don't know

2373
01:38:00,069 --> 01:38:05,438
what you guys have in Australia but like

2374
01:38:02,019 --> 01:38:09,969
a UH like a home where we do like I bet

2375
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:11,559
intercept the Internet's and find

2376
01:38:09,969 --> 01:38:13,029
yourself an affordable reverse osmosis

2377
01:38:11,559 --> 01:38:16,269
machine you don't need a lot of water

2378
01:38:13,029 --> 01:38:18,309
and I think cake or could he just go out

2379
01:38:16,269 --> 01:38:20,820
and collect

2380
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:23,139
do you not I mean I don't know if

2381
01:38:20,819 --> 01:38:24,368
distilling water would work because this

2382
01:38:23,139 --> 01:38:26,170
guy here says that it will stay in

2383
01:38:24,368 --> 01:38:27,880
solution and I don't know how that's

2384
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:29,199
gonna work when you distill it I don't

2385
01:38:27,880 --> 01:38:31,359
know if the chloramine is gonna move

2386
01:38:29,198 --> 01:38:32,529
this is like seventh-grade science but

2387
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:38,049
I'm pretty sure he's just not

2388
01:38:32,529 --> 01:38:40,630
evaporation so my buddy said in

2389
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:41,650
Australia distilling a bunch of water

2390
01:38:40,630 --> 01:38:49,179
out in the bush

2391
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:50,408
hyah [ __ ] everything's trying to [ __ ]

2392
01:38:49,179 --> 01:38:52,690
kill him no let's help this dude out he

2393
01:38:50,408 --> 01:38:53,828
needs a reverse osmosis machine bro Seb

2394
01:38:52,689 --> 01:38:55,479
aah

2395
01:38:53,828 --> 01:38:57,158
go get her our own machine it's what you

2396
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:58,479

2410
01:39:24,250 --> 01:39:26,948
when these guys send messages I'm like

2411
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:28,239
oh there's that's instant [ __ ] that I

2412
01:39:26,948 --> 01:39:29,408
need to talk about these guys want to

2413
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:30,968
know so I just go and do some research

2414
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:32,738
if I need to and most of time I can spit

2415
01:39:30,969 --> 01:39:35,139
it out off the top of my head like this

2416
01:39:32,738 --> 01:39:39,519
guy just solved subs problem I just got

2417
01:39:35,139 --> 01:39:43,929
to be a medium that's weird all right so

2418
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:45,670
that's down so we were talking about

2419
01:39:43,929 --> 01:39:47,319
this a little bit ago I just went got my

2420
01:39:45,670 --> 01:39:49,389
MMJ card my medical marijuana

2421
01:39:47,319 --> 01:39:51,488
recommendation I'm gonna write for a

2422
01:39:49,389 --> 01:39:52,989
minute there in Colorado there's no I

2423
01:39:51,488 --> 01:39:54,569
don't think anywhere in the United

2424
01:39:52,988 --> 01:39:57,279
States is there a medical marijuana

2425
01:39:54,569 --> 01:39:59,408
prescription other than the type that

2426
01:39:57,279 --> 01:40:00,670
Irv Rosenfeld has which is a totally

2427
01:39:59,408 --> 01:40:03,908
different thing than what's available to

2428
01:40:00,670 --> 01:40:05,380
us yep so it's a recommendation if

2429
01:40:03,908 --> 01:40:07,058
you've got a medical marijuana card here

2430
01:40:05,380 --> 01:40:08,469
in Colorado it is a recommendation as a

2431
01:40:07,059 --> 01:40:10,119
recommendation from a doctor that you

2432
01:40:08,469 --> 01:40:11,170
use cannabis to alleviate your problems

2433
01:40:10,118 --> 01:40:12,158
it's not a prescription because they

2434
01:40:11,170 --> 01:40:13,359
can't prescribe it to you so there's

2435
01:40:12,158 --> 01:40:15,879
nowhere to go get it so it's a

2436
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:17,589
recommendation but people I was talking

2437
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:19,449
about getting my medical marijuana

2438
01:40:17,590 --> 01:40:20,828
recommendation renewed a few days ago

2439
01:40:19,448 --> 01:40:22,719
talking about when I got stuck in the

2440
01:40:20,828 --> 01:40:24,670
damn elevator and a couple of people

2441
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:26,349
were like well how do I get my car I'm

2442
01:40:24,670 --> 01:40:27,639
sure that since you work at a dispensary

2443
01:40:26,349 --> 01:40:29,170
and you work at a dispensary you guys

2444
01:40:27,639 --> 01:40:31,400
heard at least once a week not as much

2445
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:33,829
Mike because his place is recreation

2446
01:40:31,399 --> 01:40:36,199
yeah okay so let's just do a little

2447
01:40:33,829 --> 01:40:37,909
brief talk about how you get your

2448
01:40:36,199 --> 01:40:39,439
medical marijuana card first of all

2449
01:40:37,909 --> 01:40:41,000
you've got to be a Colorado citizen and

2450
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:43,279
have some sort of proof of residency you

2451
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,779
need a Colorado ID or some sort of bills

2452
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:46,340
that show that you're getting bills here

2453
01:40:44,779 --> 01:40:48,259
in Colorado so your phone bills with

2454
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:49,579
water bill electricity bill some kind of

2455
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:51,650
[ __ ] like that you need some bills if

2456
01:40:49,579 --> 01:40:53,149
you don't have the proper ID either need

2457
01:40:51,649 --> 01:40:54,379
a proper ID or two things that will

2458
01:40:53,149 --> 01:40:56,210
prove that you're now a Colorado

2459
01:40:54,380 --> 01:40:58,850
resident like a pay stub and a bill or

2460
01:40:56,210 --> 01:41:00,409
something that's become a resident of

2461
01:40:58,850 --> 01:41:03,260
Colorado get established here get your

2462
01:41:00,409 --> 01:41:05,149
[ __ ] together have an address the second

2463
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:06,530
thing do you have this is what I used to

2464
01:41:05,149 --> 01:41:07,879
say when I worked at a dispensary like

2465
01:41:06,529 --> 01:41:09,800
ten years ago and people would be like

2466
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:11,329
well can I get a card I would say do you

2467
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:13,310
have a condition that would justify the

2468
01:41:11,329 --> 01:41:14,600
use of medical care do you have a

2469
01:41:13,310 --> 01:41:16,039
qualified condition that would justify

2470
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:19,160
the use of medical cannabis to improve

2471
01:41:16,039 --> 01:41:22,310
the quality of your life yeah yeah so if

2472
01:41:19,159 --> 01:41:23,569
you have there's a list on the Colorado

2473
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:24,860
Department of Public Health and

2474
01:41:23,569 --> 01:41:26,389
Environment they have a list of

2475
01:41:24,859 --> 01:41:30,609
qualifying conditions on there

2476
01:41:26,390 --> 01:41:32,900
of things that qualify something hurts

2477
01:41:30,609 --> 01:41:35,149
severe pain is a qualifying condition

2478
01:41:32,899 --> 01:41:38,239
and I'm sure that something hurts

2479
01:41:35,149 --> 01:41:41,179
there's some nine let's list it and if

2480
01:41:38,239 --> 01:41:43,219
you don't have one but you've got

2481
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:46,280
chronic pain of some sort getting a car

2482
01:41:43,220 --> 01:41:48,949
just involves two appointments yeah yeah

2483
01:41:46,279 --> 01:41:50,840
and just have a reason why it hurts and

2484
01:41:48,949 --> 01:41:52,550
have something that hurts and stick with

2485
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:53,840

doctors in the state of sines so they're

2512
01:42:46,309 --> 01:42:49,610
not exactly hard to find I realized is

2513
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:52,429
why I looked up the other day they're

2514
01:42:49,609 --> 01:42:53,868
not visit my Doc's thing he's a medical

2515
01:42:52,429 --> 01:42:56,958
examiner does that mean is the coroner

2516
01:42:53,868 --> 01:42:58,938
it means he can be okay do you remember

2517
01:42:56,958 --> 01:43:01,069
how it was in the beginning now oh you

2518
01:42:58,939 --> 01:43:02,780
know like three doctors they all had

2519
01:43:01,069 --> 01:43:04,038
like a six-month waiting time yeah

2520
01:43:02,779 --> 01:43:05,688
remember that crazy guy that used to

2521
01:43:04,038 --> 01:43:07,698
come to our dispensary and give cards

2522
01:43:05,689 --> 01:43:08,900
yep dude back in the day you could go

2523
01:43:07,698 --> 01:43:10,069
into the dispensary and there would be a

2524
01:43:08,899 --> 01:43:11,569
doctor in there that would write your

2525
01:43:10,069 --> 01:43:13,279
recommendation and you could shop by the

2526
01:43:11,569 --> 01:43:18,259
time that doctor got done filling out

2527
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:19,458

2528
01:43:18,260 --> 01:43:21,409

2529
01:43:19,458 --> 01:43:22,698
the doctor I figure out your condition

2530
01:43:21,408 --> 01:43:24,768
send an appointment find one of these

2531
01:43:22,698 --> 01:43:26,658
doctors send an appointment have records

2532
01:43:24,769 --> 01:43:29,659
if you really want to know what hurts

2533
01:43:26,658 --> 01:43:31,098

01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:11,929
than a minute or two using medical

2547

sort of crunching noises you're gonna

2556
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:29,239
have to show some kind of scars or if

2557
01:44:28,099 --> 01:44:31,760
you got some paperwork that would really

2558
01:44:29,238 --> 01:44:33,498
help so you can ask your doctor would

2559
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:35,090
you be willing to write an extended

2560
01:44:33,498 --> 01:44:37,488
plank count for me and he may ask you

2561
01:44:35,090 --> 01:44:40,639
how many you want be prepared to pay for

2562
01:44:37,488 --> 01:44:43,129
this the normal cost of a doctor should

2563
01:44:40,639 --> 01:44:44,479
be around $100 the basic cost to get

2564
01:44:43,130 --> 01:44:46,429
your basic card should be around a

2565
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:48,168
hundred bucks if you're going to get an

2566
01:44:46,429 --> 01:44:49,939
added fee of probably another hundred

2567
01:44:48,168 --> 01:44:51,859
dollars to get an elevated plant count

2568
01:44:49,939 --> 01:44:53,300
depending on how high it is there are

2569
01:44:51,859 --> 01:44:53,979
some doctors that will go fairly high

2570
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:56,560
and they will

2571
01:44:53,979 --> 01:44:58,238
to four or five hundred dollars don't

2572
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,590
get a cut this is my recommendation I'm

2573
01:44:58,238 --> 01:45:02,259
not a [ __ ] lawyer

2574
01:44:59,590 --> 01:45:03,940
I'm a weed guy this is my experience in

2575
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:06,940
the cannabis world don't get one of

2576
01:45:03,939 --> 01:45:09,159
those 99 plant counts that's a red flag

2577
01:45:06,939 --> 01:45:10,238
for a person that is [ __ ] around and

2578
01:45:09,159 --> 01:45:13,599
trying to beat the system and do

2579
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:15,488
something they shouldn't be doing there

2580
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:17,829
are a couple of five hundred count cards

2581
01:45:15,488 --> 01:45:19,929
in the state don't do that shitty mom if

2582
01:45:17,829 --> 01:45:22,420
there's like eight and they're all on a

2583
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:25,900
list and the meed spend all of the

2584
01:45:22,420 --> 01:45:29,440
addresses yeah the same thing with the

2585
01:45:25,899 --> 01:45:31,389
250 counts and the 300 counts it's all

2586
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:34,238
of that's gonna be gone in a year maybe

2587
01:45:31,390 --> 01:45:36,760
two with the most and it's because of

2588
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:39,039
one or two people abusing it just one of

2589
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:40,810
the people with the 500 count cards is

2590
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:43,269
making oil for kids and it gives it all

2591
01:45:40,810 --> 01:45:46,360
away so like they're not all gaming the

2592
01:45:43,270 --> 01:45:48,130
system they're not right most of them in

2593
01:45:46,359 --> 01:45:50,079
fact are following the rules but there's

2594
01:45:48,130 --> 01:45:53,230
been one or two really really obnoxious

2595
01:45:50,079 --> 01:45:56,380
people that have really really pushed

2596
01:45:53,229 --> 01:45:58,509
the boundaries and most of that system

2597
01:45:56,380 --> 01:46:02,350
is gonna get regulated away the next two

2598
01:45:58,510 --> 01:46:04,210
years the caregivers gonna be a thing in

2599
01:46:02,350 --> 01:46:05,620
the past by 2020 well I'm glad you said

2600
01:46:04,210 --> 01:46:07,899
caregiver just now because that's part

2601
01:46:05,619 --> 01:46:09,430
of the next step ask the doc for an

2602
01:46:07,899 --> 01:46:13,719
elevated plank count if you desire pay

2603
01:46:09,430 --> 01:46:14,710
for it then you're going to be asked if

2604
01:46:13,720 --> 01:46:15,820
this time we're gonna start signing a

2605
01:46:14,710 --> 01:46:18,640
bunch of papers you're gonna be asked to

2606
01:46:15,819 --> 01:46:20,380
assign a provider if you plan on growing

2607
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:22,270
your own medicine you do not want to

2608
01:46:20,380 --> 01:46:24,609
assign a provider if you are going to be

2609
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:26,980
a caregiver you cannot be a have a

2610
01:46:24,609 --> 01:46:28,509
provider nor can you have a dispensary

2611
01:46:26,979 --> 01:46:29,919
as your provider if you're gonna be a

2612
01:46:28,510 --> 01:46:31,900
caregiver if you becoming care if you

2613
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,220
sign your rights to the plants to a

2614
01:46:31,899 --> 01:46:35,529
caregiver you have now waived your

2615
01:46:33,220 --> 01:46:39,100
rights as a caregiver I think I said

2616
01:46:35,529 --> 01:46:40,420
that properly so beside who you want to

2617
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:42,370
grow your cannabis if it's a trusted

2618
01:46:40,420 --> 01:46:43,989
friend I have a couple of people like

2619
01:46:42,369 --> 01:46:45,579
Mike and our good buddy Doug I am

2620
01:46:43,988 --> 01:46:47,529
responsible for growing their cannabis

2621
01:46:45,579 --> 01:46:49,988
and keeping these guys medicated and

2622
01:46:47,529 --> 01:46:52,300
feeling alright so if you know somebody

2623
01:46:49,988 --> 01:46:54,159
that grows well and you trust them make

2624
01:46:52,300 --> 01:46:55,810
an arrangement with them make a

2625
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:57,760
relationship with them and have an

2626
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:59,289
agreement where the medicine comes and

2627
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:00,760
they're ready for it and they've got it

2628
01:46:59,289 --> 01:47:02,409
and you've got it and [ __ ] works and

2629
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:04,300
then make them you have to get papers

2630
01:47:02,409 --> 01:47:05,619
notarized you'll need a copy of their ID

2631
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:07,690
if you're gonna make them your caregiver

2632
01:47:05,619 --> 01:47:08,890
but so the doctor

2633
01:47:07,689 --> 01:47:10,479
everything there you need other than

2634
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:11,739
your buddies ID there will be a notary

2635
01:47:10,479 --> 01:47:14,169
there they'll take care of all that [ __ ]

2636
01:47:11,738 --> 01:47:15,549
so a sign of caregiver and then they're

2637
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:17,529
going to give you a bunch of papers

2638
01:47:15,550 --> 01:47:18,940

2647
01:47:35,020 --> 01:47:38,170
that you get the return receipt so that

2648

you know that they have received it and

2649
01:47:38,170 --> 01:47:41,710
then you wait in the mail I'm not sure

2650
01:47:40,448 --> 01:47:45,000

sure I accepted fake paperwork when I

2657
01:48:26,109 --> 01:48:29,859
worked at that old dispensary because

2658
01:48:27,399 --> 01:48:31,389
the paperwork changed so frequently they

2659
01:48:29,859 --> 01:48:49,238
would show up with new stuff and it

2660

2698
01:50:06,409 --> 01:50:11,180
[Music]

2699
01:50:08,020 --> 01:50:13,040
required and it's seen the one or two

2700
01:50:11,180 --> 01:50:15,020
reports that the dude who does rob one

2701
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:16,729
you get arrested like an hour later you

2702
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:18,830
get seen from 17 different angles just

2703
01:50:16,729 --> 01:50:20,179
walking in the place you can zoom in on

2704
01:50:18,829 --> 01:50:24,350
the camera and read the VIN number and

2705
01:50:20,180 --> 01:50:26,539
you'll meet you we had we can read the

2706
01:50:24,350 --> 01:50:28,340
VIN number on on the inside of your car

2707
01:50:26,539 --> 01:50:29,930
on the dash tucked in that little gap we

2708
01:50:28,340 --> 01:50:32,630
can read that number with the cameras I

2709
01:50:29,930 --> 01:50:35,060
hear the security guard go nope that's a

2710
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:37,369
cigarette and he's zooming in across

2711
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:39,080
like the other side of the parking lot

2712
01:50:37,369 --> 01:50:40,279
to somebody who just fired something up

2713
01:50:39,079 --> 01:50:42,199
in the driver's seat before we had a

2714
01:50:40,279 --> 01:50:44,239

2722
01:50:55,699 --> 01:51:08,989
cameras on the outside of the building

2723
01:50:57,050 --> 01:51:12,289
every eight feet he looked up on the

2724
01:51:08,989 --> 01:51:14,329
roof pretty damn sure yeah it's people

2725
01:51:12,289 --> 01:51:17,149

2729
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:23,889
I don't know

2730
01:51:21,189 --> 01:51:26,169
although I I'd have to tell the new

2731
01:51:23,890 --> 01:51:28,270
employees remind every employee the

2732
01:51:26,170 --> 01:51:29,710
first couple times that they're working

2733
01:51:28,270 --> 01:51:36,790
like just remember that you're always on

2734
01:51:29,710 --> 01:51:40,899
camera like it's recorded in HD for

2735
01:51:36,789 --> 01:51:43,238
Prosperity for all time yeah and the

2736
01:51:40,899 --> 01:51:45,069
people are watching these cameras like

2737
01:51:43,238 --> 01:51:46,599
it's not like nobody's watching these

2738
01:51:45,069 --> 01:51:48,639
cameras and oh it doesn't even matter

2739
01:51:46,600 --> 01:51:50,260
they're just there for show and they're

2740
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:52,239
just there something bad happens like

2741
01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:53,710
people are always watching those cameras

2742
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:56,019
they're always reviewing it

2743
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:57,819
we have weird things happen our grow is

2744
01:51:56,020 --> 01:51:59,830
not in the best part of town and it's at

2745
01:51:57,819 --> 01:52:01,299
the end of a street where you could do

2746
01:51:59,829 --> 01:52:02,710
whatever you want because honestly it's

2747
01:52:01,300 --> 01:52:04,480
the end of the street there's nothing

2748
01:52:02,710 --> 01:52:05,829
else down there so nobody travels that

2749
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:07,979
direction unless they're coming to our

2750
01:52:05,829 --> 01:52:10,930
grow to do some stupid [ __ ] and

2751
01:52:07,979 --> 01:52:12,849
oftentimes I'll find parts of the gate

2752
01:52:10,930 --> 01:52:15,670
like they'll have unscrewed all of the

2753
01:52:12,850 --> 01:52:17,260
bolts on the gate but they used the

2754
01:52:15,670 --> 01:52:18,579
types of bolts to where the nuts won't

2755
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:21,039
come off the end of the bolt they took

2756
01:52:18,579 --> 01:52:22,539
the end of the bolt and flattened it so

2757
01:52:21,039 --> 01:52:24,189
now you can only unscrew it so far

2758
01:52:22,539 --> 01:52:25,479
you'll get that bracket really well on

2759
01:52:24,189 --> 01:52:27,219
dumb but you can't get it off still

2760
01:52:25,479 --> 01:52:28,809
they're trying to get our gate open

2761
01:52:27,219 --> 01:52:30,189
because our gates barbed wire to the

2762
01:52:28,810 --> 01:52:31,930
cross three letters of [ __ ] barbed

2763
01:52:30,189 --> 01:52:33,698
wire across the top so you can't get in

2764
01:52:31,930 --> 01:52:36,190
through that so just get it open and

2765
01:52:33,698 --> 01:52:38,559
[ __ ] like that happens every other day

2766
01:52:36,189 --> 01:52:41,289
they threw carpets over the barbed wire

2767
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:43,840
and climbed the fence and then we had

2768
01:52:41,289 --> 01:52:46,000
locked trash cans and they climbed up on

2769
01:52:43,840 --> 01:52:48,610
high [ __ ] and jumped like body slammed

2770
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,279
through the trashcan lids to get to our

2771
01:52:48,609 --> 01:52:53,380
trash and there was anything good and

2772
01:52:51,279 --> 01:52:55,719
there there was actually an exploded bag

2773
01:52:53,380 --> 01:52:57,369
of compound putty that I'd thrown away

2774
01:52:55,719 --> 01:52:59,619
so whoever jumped in there that night

2775
01:52:57,369 --> 01:53:01,029
was covered in compound putty [ __ ]

2776
01:52:59,619 --> 01:53:05,529
funny so there's a footprint going to

2777
01:53:01,029 --> 01:53:07,179
the [ __ ] over that gate with their

2778
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:08,738
carpets and covered it compound putties

2779
01:53:07,180 --> 01:53:11,800
and getting their car and drive away but

2780
01:53:08,738 --> 01:53:13,599
we've got footage of all of that [ __ ]

2781
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:16,239
every time we see it we've got a thing

2782
01:53:13,600 --> 01:53:17,920
the camera lights up or the video lights

2783
01:53:16,238 --> 01:53:19,359
up red if there's no action on the

2784
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:20,920
camera and then it lights up green dots

2785
01:53:19,359 --> 01:53:22,659
every time there's movement so you just

2786
01:53:20,920 --> 01:53:24,100
go scroll right to the green oh there's

2787
01:53:22,659 --> 01:53:25,809
that [ __ ] on camera one there is a

2788
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:27,820
camera sixteen there is a camera eight

2789
01:53:25,810 --> 01:53:29,830
you see them from all angles doing

2790
01:53:27,819 --> 01:53:30,698
stupid [ __ ] so people do see all of that

2791
01:53:29,829 --> 01:53:32,559
footage to happen

2792
01:53:30,698 --> 01:53:35,019
everything yeah and even if we're

2793
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:36,460
randomly looking for what time we lost

2794
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:38,080
something in the grower like where the

2795
01:53:36,460 --> 01:53:40,029
[ __ ] did it go we couldn't find where

2796
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:41,679
something went we just totally found

2797
01:53:40,029 --> 01:53:43,179
where it started and then just watched

2798
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:44,440
on the camera watch where it traveled

2799
01:53:43,179 --> 01:53:45,730
through a couple of days and then we're

2800
01:53:44,439 --> 01:53:47,710
like oh it's up on this top shelf where

2801
01:53:45,729 --> 01:53:49,629
nobody can even see it now this is right

2802
01:53:47,710 --> 01:53:51,130
up here and just went and grabbed it who

2803
01:53:49,630 --> 01:53:52,210
knows what other [ __ ] we may have seen

2804
01:53:51,130 --> 01:53:53,560
if we would have paid attention to that

2805
01:53:52,210 --> 01:53:55,270
video because we were on like an entire

2806
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:59,170

2833
01:55:06,909 --> 01:55:10,630
one um cover it again so I want to give

2834
01:55:09,130 --> 01:55:12,940
a shout out I don't have the listeners

2835
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:14,760
name I should push pause press pause and

2836
01:55:12,939 --> 01:55:17,169
go search through my facebook messages

2837
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:18,670
but there was a listener who mentioned

2838
01:55:17,170 --> 01:55:20,260
gary johnson in the past remember this

2839
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:23,670
yeah and suddenly dude is getting

2840
01:55:20,260 --> 01:55:26,140
popular um did you there are a lot of

2841
01:55:23,670 --> 01:55:27,609
people that are dissatisfied with the

2842
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:29,020
current candidates and Gary's getting a

2843
01:55:27,609 --> 01:55:30,670
little bit of traction he was on one of

2844
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:33,610
my favorite podcasts I think he was on

2845
01:55:30,670 --> 01:55:34,750
the Nerdist he was on one of the good

2846
01:55:33,609 --> 01:55:37,479
ones that I listened to him I don't want

2847
01:55:34,750 --> 01:55:38,619
joe rogan that wouldn't surprise me I

2848
01:55:37,479 --> 01:55:39,939
can't remember I should see I should

2849
01:55:38,619 --> 01:55:41,679
press pause and do some research right

2850
01:55:39,939 --> 01:55:42,819
now but I should find the kind of

2851
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:44,349
listener who enter

2852
01:55:42,819 --> 01:55:46,359
thus to Gary Johnson I should go I think

2853
01:55:44,349 --> 01:55:50,679
it was Joe Rogan but Gary Johnson was on

2854
01:55:46,359 --> 01:55:52,420
a podcast recently he seemed to me he

2855
01:55:50,679 --> 01:55:53,949
didn't give politician answers they'd be

2856
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:56,319
like hey what's 2+2 and he wouldn't go

2857
01:55:53,948 --> 01:55:58,779
well I really think like 4.3 would look

2858
01:55:56,319 --> 01:56:00,549
good he would leave it for two and two

2859
01:55:58,779 --> 01:56:01,809
is four like he was straight up about

2860
01:56:00,550 --> 01:56:03,489
[ __ ] that's how I feel like politicians

2861
01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:05,079
do it like what's your favorite flavor

2862
01:56:03,488 --> 01:56:07,000
ice cream into politicians like well I

2863
01:56:05,078 --> 01:56:10,118
really feel like cake is the way to go

2864
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:12,010
in 2017 like a [ __ ] with your

2865
01:56:10,118 --> 01:56:14,229
favorite ice cream well you see pies

2866
01:56:12,010 --> 01:56:15,849
always been my favorite that's what you

2867
01:56:14,229 --> 01:56:19,359
get from those politicians in my opinion

2868
01:56:15,849 --> 01:57:10,539
I'm a big Johnson fan and he's very much

2869
01:56:19,359 --> 01:57:13,000
marijuana but yeah I wanna see what the

2870
01:57:10,539 --> 01:57:14,920
rest of everything does and what the

2871
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,590
[ __ ] is happening in Canada they're like

2872
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:19,630
oh we're gonna cannabis and then why're

2873
01:57:17,590 --> 01:57:21,819
the [ __ ] Royal Canadian Mounted

2874
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:24,069
Police raiding dispensaries in Canada

2875
01:57:21,819 --> 01:57:26,078
now that cannabis is legal people kind

2876
01:57:24,069 --> 01:57:29,738
of jumped a gun okay

2877
01:57:26,078 --> 01:57:33,009
it's it sucks and I really don't agree

2878
01:57:29,738 --> 01:57:34,809
with what the authorities did but at the

2879
01:57:33,010 --> 01:57:36,639
same time if you didn't see it coming

2880
01:57:34,810 --> 01:57:41,230
you're blind deaf and we're watching

2881
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:43,449
something else for weeks that you can't

2882
01:57:41,229 --> 01:57:45,609
do this it's not legal yet the rules

2883
01:57:43,448 --> 01:57:47,979
haven't been passed true they haven't

2884
01:57:45,609 --> 01:57:50,460
figured out zoning or hours of operation

2885
01:57:47,979 --> 01:57:53,729
or taxes and that [ __ ] yet

2886
01:57:50,460 --> 01:57:55,529
um and you just slowing down the

2887
01:57:53,729 --> 01:57:57,988
movement by jump jumping the guy I think

2888
01:57:55,529 --> 01:57:59,429
they decided on the legal age of 24 is

2889
01:57:57,988 --> 01:58:05,009
what consumption age is going to be in

2890
01:57:59,430 --> 01:58:06,869
Canada the Canadian podcast I think he

2891
01:58:05,010 --> 01:58:11,400
was saying that 24 is what they were

2892
01:58:06,869 --> 01:58:14,399
discussing last time that's a little old

2893
01:58:11,399 --> 01:58:17,579
in my mind yeah yeah should be closer to

2894
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:19,500
18 in my opinion but 21 is cool yeah I

2895
01:58:17,579 --> 01:58:21,479
think I have to go with 21 unfortunately

2896
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:24,300
I've got a daughter who's creeping up on

2897
01:58:21,479 --> 01:58:26,189
18 if she came up to me right now she's

2898
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:28,560
like your dad can I get a dad you gotta

2899
01:58:26,189 --> 01:58:30,779
smoke some flour first but I mean like

2900
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,460
I'd probably if you wanted to sit down

2901
01:58:30,779 --> 01:58:33,960
with us in smoke I would not tell her no

2902
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:36,890
because I'd rather her sit down and puff

2903
01:58:33,960 --> 01:58:38,850
what's us little girlfriends in smoke

2904
01:58:36,890 --> 01:58:41,460
well here in Colorado

2905
01:58:38,850 --> 01:58:43,020
if you're under like between 18 and 21

2906
01:58:41,460 --> 01:58:51,659
and have a medical condition you can get

2907
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:53,460
a car stupid is what she said I just did

2908
01:58:51,659 --> 01:58:55,409
this with my niece I'm about to do it

2909
01:58:53,460 --> 01:58:57,510
again with my nephew and I've got a kid

2910
01:58:55,409 --> 01:58:59,309
who's like almost 1 so I'm gonna be

2911
01:58:57,510 --> 01:59:01,739
doing it again in a few years so like

2912
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:06,170
somewhere between 18 and 21 works for me

2913
01:59:01,738 --> 01:59:08,819
I kind of like the idea of a much safer

2914
01:59:06,170 --> 01:59:11,819
gentler intoxicant being legal before

2915
01:59:08,819 --> 01:59:13,079
alcohol yeah like some training wheels

2916
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:16,019

3309
02:27:52,270 --> 02:28:02,060
[Music]

3310
02:27:59,709 --> 02:28:04,219
think the place is called coquettes and

3311
02:28:02,059 --> 02:28:30,549
Colorado Springs shout-out to the vegan

3312
02:28:04,219 --> 02:28:30,549

02:28:30,819 --> 02:28:37,119
[Music]

3314
02:28:32,469 --> 02:28:37,119
was that was probably the best pizza

3315
02:28:37,889 --> 02:28:42,388
[Music]

3316
02:28:47,738 --> 02:28:51,529
there's a little pizza joint that I wish

3317
02:28:50,299 --> 02:28:52,698
I could remember the [ __ ] name of it

3318
02:28:51,529 --> 02:28:55,370
because it's pointless just talk about

3319
02:28:52,699 --> 02:28:56,810
it but it's basically the size of the

3320
02:28:55,370 --> 02:28:59,870
pizza joint is the size of this whole

3321
02:28:56,809 --> 02:29:02,478
recording area and they were playing

3322
02:28:59,870 --> 02:29:04,160
like hardcore music I guess I don't the

3323
02:29:02,478 --> 02:29:06,219
dudes [ __ ] real distorted but kind of

3324
02:29:04,159 --> 02:29:09,289
slow the dude was mad to scream a lot

3325
02:29:06,219 --> 02:29:13,670
I've noticed this before hardcore music

3326
02:29:09,290 --> 02:29:15,280
and pizza places relation yeah near that

3327
02:29:13,670 --> 02:29:30,620
[ __ ] hot ass

3328
02:29:15,280 --> 02:29:32,940
[Music]

3329
02:29:30,620 --> 02:29:34,740
pizza slices were 250 for a slice of

3330
02:29:32,940 --> 02:29:36,239
cheese pizza and then had a topping and

3331
02:29:34,739 --> 02:29:38,219
like certain topics for certain prices

3332
02:29:36,239 --> 02:29:40,799
then your basic [ __ ] but this slice of

3333
02:29:38,219 --> 02:29:41,879
pizza was like a third of [ __ ] eighth

3334
02:29:40,799 --> 02:29:43,920
of the pie you know what I mean there

3335
02:29:41,879 --> 02:29:45,899
was a big-ass [ __ ] slice of pizza so

3336
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:47,430
for 250 our three slices of pizza I

3337
02:29:45,899 --> 02:29:56,069
couldn't even eat the [ __ ] third one

3338
02:29:47,430 --> 02:29:58,889
so you tried Blackjacks tomato and green

3339
02:29:56,069 --> 02:30:00,239
chili no but a good friend of works that

3340

3346
02:30:41,521 --> 02:30:44,971
one place you go to all the time like

3347
02:30:42,899 --> 02:30:46,261
I'm I'm sure there's been a couple

3348
02:30:44,970 --> 02:30:50,119
delivery drivers throughout the time

3349
02:30:46,261 --> 02:30:50,120

3386
02:34:25,170 --> 02:34:30,049

[Music]

3389
02:34:34,459 --> 02:34:41,969
I think this will probably be in the

3390
02:34:38,610 --> 02:34:44,250
130s the mid 131 34 is up this actually

3391
02:34:41,969 --> 02:34:48,359
is the recording this is labeled 135 I'm

3392
02:34:44,250 --> 02:34:51,680
not sure over those 135 or 136 52 weeks

3393
02:34:48,360 --> 02:34:51,680
out of the year doing one a week that's

3394
02:34:51,829 --> 02:34:56,760
Facebook memory the other day it was uh

3395
02:34:54,090 --> 02:35:07,559
just recorded my first podcast or so

3396
02:34:56,760 --> 02:35:10,228
nice a little over two years two years

3397
02:35:07,559 --> 02:35:12,119
round and cannabis cup time mhm or not

3398
02:35:10,228 --> 02:35:14,279
cannabis cup time right before it or

3399
02:35:12,120 --> 02:35:18,930
something yeah I think so because we you

3400
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:20,489
hit uh episode 50 right around cannabis

3401
02:35:18,930 --> 02:35:22,020
cup time I believe because that would be

3402
02:35:20,489 --> 02:35:23,340
about a year Yeah right

3403
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:27,210
you know sometimes that would do two

3404
02:35:23,340 --> 02:35:33,659
episodes a week it's hard to have that

3405

well I don't have anything available at

3804
03:15:45,370 --> 03:15:51,160
the time but I'm making a rise f2s

3805
03:15:48,159 --> 03:15:52,390
okay which I'll be all my testers bust

3806
03:15:51,159 --> 03:15:53,560
through a bunch of those and I may put

3807
03:15:52,390 --> 03:15:59,140
some of those out to the public

3808
03:15:53,560 --> 03:16:00,851
I definitely like a rise a lot number

3809
03:15:59,140 --> 03:16:09,761
three or number five or something like I

3810
03:16:00,851 --> 03:16:11,051
know I rise number one I think it was

3811
03:16:09,761 --> 03:16:17,591
number one that we kept around for a

3812
03:16:11,050 --> 03:16:19,770
long time so of that I've got girls of

3813
03:16:17,591 --> 03:16:22,211
that and then I'm gonna put it like

3814
03:16:19,771 --> 03:16:25,150
several females in a room probably like

3815
03:16:22,210 --> 03:16:26,979
somewhere between 16 and 20 girls and

3816
03:16:25,149 --> 03:16:29,140
that arise male in a room two of the

3817
03:16:26,979 --> 03:16:30,699
arise the same male the two clones of it

3818
03:16:29,140 --> 03:16:32,199
the same room and girl Mountain [ __ ]

3819
03:16:30,700 --> 03:16:34,931
hit that pollen on all those plants and

3820
03:16:32,200 --> 03:16:38,829
make like between 15 and 20 neutrons and

3821
03:16:34,931 --> 03:16:41,950
test them all out now that I think about

3822
03:16:38,829 --> 03:16:45,220
that arrays number one that we had

3823
03:16:41,950 --> 03:16:48,730
it's the your male is the male

3824
03:16:45,220 --> 03:17:05,970
counterpart to that phenotype nice just

3825
03:16:48,729 --> 03:17:11,229
big tall amazing actually that was the

3826
03:17:05,970 --> 03:17:13,229
black I really expected it to take

3827
03:17:11,229 --> 03:17:23,050
longer to finish flowering but I get

3828
03:17:13,229 --> 03:17:27,579
similar to half to eight it's like would

3829
03:17:23,050 --> 03:17:28,930
think golden go on appearances I think a

3830
03:17:27,579 --> 03:17:30,159
lot of growers if they didn't know what

3831
03:17:28,931 --> 03:17:32,171
it was but think it was a longer

3832
03:17:30,159 --> 03:17:34,000
flowering strain that it really is that

3833
03:17:32,171 --> 03:17:36,280
trait actually comes from the Romulan in

3834
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:38,079
it because from Canada those guys

3835
03:17:36,280 --> 03:17:40,030
brother [ __ ] to finish a little earlier

3836
03:17:38,079 --> 03:17:41,649
they found the earlier finishing sativas

3837
03:17:40,030 --> 03:17:43,511
and went for that aspect that's like

3838
03:17:41,649 --> 03:17:45,970

ask you questions and like I was telling

3860
03:19:01,689 --> 03:19:09,459
him to ask you questions like that was

3861
03:19:08,078 --> 03:19:12,549
the worst thing I ever did I covered the

3862
03:19:09,459 --> 03:19:23,680
dirt like 11 in the by 2 they were

3863
03:19:12,549 --> 03:19:25,929
literally floppy plants cover it in like

3864
03:19:23,680 --> 03:19:29,289
fine particulates and that he bought

3865
03:19:25,930 --> 03:19:33,908
from a store and it was I've seen people

3866
03:19:29,289 --> 03:19:36,369
do that to get rid of yes I've tried it

3867
03:19:33,908 --> 03:19:39,129
before it's a pain in [ __ ] ass but

3868
03:19:36,369 --> 03:19:41,260
outdoors is a rootbound container that

3869
03:19:39,129 --> 03:19:43,028
is so root bound is burning out every

3870
03:19:41,260 --> 03:19:45,880
day and they were in a five-gallon

3871
03:19:43,029 --> 03:19:48,930
bucket they were an earth putz but they

3872
03:19:45,879 --> 03:19:48,929
were drying out

cocoa because that's what we we

3880
03:21:49,139 --> 03:21:53,939
purchased and we still have the [ __ ] I

3881
03:21:50,549 --> 03:21:56,899
mix it is because it works but we've

3882
03:21:53,939 --> 03:21:59,011
mixed in things

3883
03:21:56,899 --> 03:22:01,250
like where we did in the first run in

3884
03:21:59,011 --> 03:22:06,560
cocoa and then we're like yeah [ __ ] that

3885
03:22:01,250 --> 03:22:06,560

03:23:16,380 --> 03:23:22,770
was on TV farmer pages way back in the

3892
03:23:21,000 --> 03:23:26,280
day bro yeah remember when you had to do

3893
03:23:22,771 --> 03:23:29,101
[ __ ] on IRC I don't remember IRC sadly I

3894
03:23:26,280 --> 03:23:30,690
remember IRC - Anarchy Online but that

3895
03:23:29,101 --> 03:23:32,700
was my experience with IRC because I

3896
03:23:30,690 --> 03:23:35,819
mean I played in line for 12 years

3897
03:23:32,700 --> 03:23:44,909
it was those years of my wife's life

3898
03:23:35,819 --> 03:23:48,979
that always he goes to Benson and Benson

3899
03:23:44,909 --> 03:23:48,979
so bond point with that am I here hold

3900
03:23:49,790 --> 03:23:56,640
given so then my plan is

3901
03:23:54,539 --> 03:23:58,560
I'm gonna do another run after it with

3902
03:23:56,639 --> 03:24:01,680
the exact same thing but I'm gonna add

3903
03:23:58,559 --> 03:24:04,920
T's to it once a week okay and just see

3904
03:24:01,680 --> 03:24:06,720
compare final product yeah yeah we're

3905
03:24:04,920 --> 03:24:09,799
doing a side-by-side comparison with two

3906
03:24:06,719 --> 03:24:12,118
different nutrient brands right now Oh

3907
03:24:09,799 --> 03:24:13,590
touch it I touched you to get the

3908
03:24:12,119 --> 03:24:23,248
[ __ ] kill it again boil it again

3909
03:24:13,590 --> 03:24:25,770
is it working we're gonna retire one

3910
03:24:23,248 --> 03:24:27,090
brand so I'm not sure what I'm allowed

3911
03:24:25,770 --> 03:24:28,828
to talk about really because some of its

3912
03:24:27,090 --> 03:24:30,148
confidential but we're testing I've

3913
03:24:28,828 --> 03:24:32,609
talked about it on Facebook we've got

3914
03:24:30,148 --> 03:24:34,170
veg Balu in one tank and we're on week

3915
03:24:32,609 --> 03:24:36,420
one like three or what's today

3916
03:24:34,170 --> 03:24:38,430
Thursday's were four days in the plants

3917
03:24:36,420 --> 03:24:40,260
look [ __ ] happy site but I mean

3918
03:24:38,430 --> 03:24:41,639
Warren Coco so I'm sure I would see

3919
03:24:40,260 --> 03:24:43,920
something by now if they were not happy

3920
03:24:41,639 --> 03:24:45,209
and they get fed they're on a cycle so

3921
03:24:43,920 --> 03:24:46,619
they get fed multiple times a day so

3922
03:24:45,209 --> 03:24:48,719
they're giving plenty of opportunity to

3923
03:24:46,619 --> 03:24:51,300
show me if they're happy they look

3924
03:24:48,719 --> 03:24:54,959
really really good I've always been

3925
03:24:51,299 --> 03:24:56,519
intrigued by the I mean I'm an organic

3926
03:24:54,959 --> 03:24:59,009
grower also because of the simplicity

3927
03:24:56,520 --> 03:25:01,260
right but so I've always been intrigued

3928
03:24:59,010 --> 03:25:02,939
by the simplicity of veg food it's all

3929
03:25:01,260 --> 03:25:04,738
they send you like for powders and one

3930
03:25:02,939 --> 03:25:08,309
liquid didn't weigh them out by the gram

3931
03:25:04,738 --> 03:25:09,988
like there's so much per gallon so many

3932
03:25:08,309 --> 03:25:12,269
grams per gallon you just weigh it out

3933
03:25:09,988 --> 03:25:14,459
on a scale and I just pour it in there

3934
03:25:12,270 --> 03:25:15,630
and stir it real real well and just let

3935
03:25:14,459 --> 03:25:17,938
it go I just let the reservoirs

3936
03:25:15,629 --> 03:25:20,339
I put huge pumps in the recipe [ __ ]

3937
03:25:17,939 --> 03:25:23,398
spin real well the water cycling changes

3938
03:25:20,340 --> 03:25:26,068
our water unfortunately it's hard to

3939
03:25:23,398 --> 03:25:29,629
produce that much RO water can I can I

3940
03:25:26,068 --> 03:25:34,398
fill you a little secret there buddy

3941
03:25:29,629 --> 03:25:35,868
Walmart as ro water or a dollar 50 90

3942
03:25:34,398 --> 03:25:38,719
gallon have you go in there and fill up

3943
03:25:35,869 --> 03:26:05,210
water like like gallon bottles it's 89

3944
03:25:38,719 --> 03:26:13,849
cents water station just back the truck

3945
03:26:05,209 --> 03:26:16,549
in veg will actually sent us a mix they

3946
03:26:13,850 --> 03:26:17,869
sent us a two-part mix that I use half

3947
03:26:16,549 --> 03:26:22,158
one and half the other and it balances

3948
03:26:17,869 --> 03:26:24,199
the pH and adjust for my water test they

3949
03:26:22,158 --> 03:26:33,978
sent us a formula for design for our

3950
03:26:24,199 --> 03:26:35,090
water about half way down so I just do

3951
03:26:33,978 --> 03:26:38,688
the hose there filled it up with water

3952
03:26:35,090 --> 03:26:48,648
and it totally six five all the way to

3953
03:26:38,689 --> 03:26:58,100
the top organics great but I mean yeah

3954
03:26:48,648 --> 03:27:01,760
it's time sustainable to kind of style

3955
03:26:58,100 --> 03:27:04,520
of growing to very simple and simplicity

3956
03:27:01,760 --> 03:27:07,540
this is more the round a lot of the

3957
