mothers I love it I love it

70
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,409

71
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,990
remember I said I want your nose cuz you

72
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,099

73
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,540
terpenes yeah a lot of people tell me

74
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:35,250
that lately they want like Turk nodes

75
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,199
that's awesome

76
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,879
that's awesome alright so I want to ask

77
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,589
you first off I did want to start off

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,370
with breeding because I have a feeling

79
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:47,430
it relates to your sensor ease your

80
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,230
sensory perception yes yeah what me

81
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,060
first off if I'm just looking at

82
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:53,969
breeders so what makes a legit breeder

83
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:58,439
what what makes a legit breeder yeah I

84
00:02:53,969 --> 00:03:00,870
may frustrate some people here I call

85
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,210
myself Apollo just cuz I'm humble you

86
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:04,860
can excuse that um a legit reader

87
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,150
somebody with a goal so I'm gonna do

88
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,460
when you start off breeding you have a

89
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,650
goal which not is which is not money

90
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:13,200
right a goal which is to create a line

91
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,240
that is improving something or maybe

92
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,979
you're growing strain a and strain B and

93
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,780
you want the flavor of strain a and the

94
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:20,819
vigor of strain B right you've got a

95
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,379
goal not just put a bunch of elite cuts

96
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:24,449
in a room and a mail and sprinkle some

97
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:25,919
pollen and then sell those seeds sure

98
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,139
that's a pollen chucker that's an

99
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,149
[ __ ] that's somebody up for profits a

100
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,349
breeder is somebody with a goal then

101
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:33,450
once those seeds are made you have to

102
00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:35,099
test them you can't just make seeds and

103
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:37,530
put them out sorry about the throat

104
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:37,949
clearing we got dabbed out we did by the

105
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,689
way

106
00:03:37,949 --> 00:03:41,669
right as well I was asking you about

107
00:03:39,689 --> 00:03:44,129
he's got the rig and the torch and

108
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:46,919
everything I'm like come on man just hit

109
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:49,049
a knee now it's so [ __ ] easy and we

110
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,119
all hit a dab and each one of us one dab

111
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,189
and we're stoned yeah the whole room is

112
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,960
a little lit it's nice but yeah it is

113
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,270
different I you know even smoking out of

114
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,490
a pen or even those little cartridge

115
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:01,050
pens you just don't get it stoned just

116
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:03,120
waiting to just take a [ __ ] full-on

117
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:05,070
torch Devin and I agree that's why I've

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,689
got that rig with me almost all the time

119
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:09,269
yeah and now that's travel piece and

120
00:04:06,689 --> 00:04:10,650
that's cold starters that we can insert

121
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,090
damn I call it an insert I've heard it

122
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:14,039
called a few other things but right I

123
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,990
put the dab in a basically a glass

124
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,399
thimble and then heat the banger and

125
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,350
then drop the thimble into the banger

126
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,120
and cap it right it works kind of like a

127
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,460
double boiler instead of my dad hitting

128
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,439
hot glass it gets to heat up slowly

129
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,449
it's like as it comes to temperature and

130
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,490
sure scolding hot dabs dry

131
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:31,800
to the lungs they're still warm I like

132
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:33,449
I'm kind of hot but right just come it

133
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,949
bubbles up you can watch the dab bubble

134
00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:37,680
and it comes to temperature instead of

135
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:40,079
just instantly yeah I seen it was

136
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,209
awesome it works better you get a lot of

137
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,789
drawers off one good dab yeah really

138
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:47,579
nice - love it everybody in the room is

139
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,200
baked yeah got me going so we're just

140
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,639
gonna [ __ ] a little bit man really

141
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,110
good at that since we've declared we're

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,459
all baked we're just gonna [ __ ] a

143
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:56,430
little bit we're good at that

144
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:58,529
so dude first off I want to know I read

145
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,150
genetics ever since I've been you know

146
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:03,419
in the DGC I've always known you guys

147
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:08,399
existed but you guys are when you go pro

148
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:10,890
I'm gonna ask I didn't know we did it

149
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,000
just seemed to kind of I took I just

150
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:13,589
followed the steps and I seemed we're

151
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,029
supposed to happen in life as well

152
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:17,219
whereas a breeder at all just kept

153
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:19,199
coming to me naturally and I would see

154
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,360
opportunities and some I had to decline

155
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,789
and some I knew were right and one day I

156
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,939
was here doing this I don't know that

157
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:28,230
this was the exact intention you can

158
00:05:26,939 --> 00:05:30,420
tell what I obviously believe in the

159
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,340
colors I wear hair style that had a lot

160
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,199
to do with it I just listen to the steps

161
00:05:32,339 --> 00:05:35,459
from above and followed the path it was

162
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,170
light in front of me and I think I'm

163
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:39,169
right where I'm supposed to be and just

164
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:41,640
you'll say where did you get the skills

165
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:43,590
most of that I think comes from passion

166
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,279
I love cannabis I've got crazy

167
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:49,109
ATD and when I smoke that seems to stop

168
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,549
there are seven thousand thoughts

169
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,470
happening in this crazy brain of my

170
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,990
shirt so when I smoke I can hear five of

171
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,340
them really clearly I'm so advantageous

172
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,009
for my life it just makes all that

173
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:02,369
background chatter stop and then I can

174
00:05:59,009 --> 00:06:05,339
function mmm excuse me again so then I

175
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,720
started smoking a lot right in I think

176
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:08,489
like most of us I got tired of paying

177
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,260
for it so I wanted to grow my own and

178
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,840
then I wasn't satisfied with the clones

179
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:14,250
and the seeds I was getting so I started

180
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,009
making my own stuff and then how long

181
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:19,470
ago is this probably before I should

182
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,209
admit there weren't legal cannabis when

183
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,650
I first got into it but as soon as we

184
00:06:21,209 --> 00:06:24,539
were able to get more rooms and more

185
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:27,989
space I was up in breeding and doing it

186
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,210
nice 2008-2009 okay blow

187
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,379
yeah and for that in other state and you

188
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,120
were breathing though you had the

189
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,670
foresight to brow is just super psyched

190
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,590
to be able to find a cut in two thousand

191
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:38,850
eight thousand nine I was lucky to be I

192
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:40,199
had some good friends who are ahead of

193
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:40,710
the game I had some friends who came

194
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,930
from Calif

195
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:44,339
four new ranked in North Carolina who

196
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,720
were growing out in the Hills for years

197
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:48,629
the rise I had friends with Oaksterdam

198
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,660
University teachings who brought cuts

199
00:06:48,629 --> 00:06:53,129
from Oaksterdam but I got a hold of so I

200
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,360
just fell into the right circles I feel

201
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:55,829
like I was really blessed that's why I

202
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,780
say I just followed the steps that were

203
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:59,339
laid in front of me and write whatever I

204
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,639
believe in put me right where I needed

205
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,829
to be yeah that's interesting okay so

206
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,060

it makes you pro because you've been

208
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,750

229
00:07:47,069 --> 00:07:51,899
something and throw something out there

266
00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:01,350
print money you're like they're just you

00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:07,649
sell them for five packs for a hundred

270
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:09,240
bucks or whatever but it's not like I

271
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,579

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,670
many obstacles just about trying to do

276
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:23,309

quickly yeah man what would you say man

282
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:36,269
if we're looking at obstacles obstacles

283
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,970
about being in this business some

284
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:40,289
unforeseen things your social media is

285
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:41,850
gonna be a struggle a lot of people

286
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:43,740
think they're gonna advertise on social

287
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:45,269

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,009
simple things like that then social

297
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,420
media we take that for granted I come

298
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:05,429
from an era where we didn't really have

299
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,809
that right like when I started doing

300
00:10:05,429 --> 00:10:08,399
this we weren't supposed to be doing

301
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:11,159
this so for me just to be able to post

302
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,019

303
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,309
it's a special thing so I feel yeah I

304
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:16,169
understand when people say they're

305
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:20,819
lurkers like I've been lurking for a

306
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:22,559

and we don't at all I love it that I

312
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:34,500
feel like we're really taking that for

313
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,269
granted now we feel it's really a huge

314
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,929
privilege I didn't have that back when I

315
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:41,340
was starting this obstacles as a seed

316
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:43,139
breeder there's a lot of work to it

317
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,399
you've got to become relevant you said

318
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,649
people it's a license to print money

319
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,360
sure but that money is a lottery or

320
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,429
monopoly money until you've established

321
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,320
that your seeds are worth something oh

322
00:10:50,429 --> 00:10:53,459
that's true no offense do you or the

323
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,470
guys in this room but if we made

324
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:57,090
warehouse Kyle seeds they're not gonna

325
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:59,250
go anywhere what if we put his picture

326
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,690
on the back maybe if that picture with

327
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,480
no shirt

328
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:05,129
rose-cut baby but the ladies will buy a

329
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,230
few packs and then real stop moving of

330
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:09,750
it I understand it is there's a lot of

331
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,550
work a lot of regulations you have to be

332
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,649
vetted by the community a lot of people

333
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:15,269
have to grow it Brian if somebody

334
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,129
doesn't like you in the canvas industry

335
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,860
or community that spreads more quickly

336
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:21,930
than a good reputation kid you've got a

337
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:22,800
thousand likes and one thumbs down and

338
00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:25,049
everyone goes what's with the thumbs

339
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,120
down why that pisses me off I do that

340
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:28,708
myself there's a hundred nice comments

341
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,318
about something and one person being

342
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:32,969
like ooh you know whatever negative and

343
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:34,198
I'm like why did he think that I'm

344
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,699
sitting there at the you know the

345
00:11:34,198 --> 00:11:37,769
baseball game I'm like why do you think

346
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:40,469
that I wonder why doesn't everybody like

347
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:42,990
what I say everybody likes you it's one

348
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:45,360
person has to not like you then right

349
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,470
because if somebody doesn't like it

350
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,810
you're you're pissing someone off and

351
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,490
that's you should be everybody likes it

352
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,899
you're fake it's kind of like one of

353
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:54,028
those I tell my kid a product for

354
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:54,688
everyone is a product for know yeah I

355
00:11:54,028 --> 00:11:56,578
guess

356
00:11:54,688 --> 00:11:58,438
absolutely dial it in get your target

357
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:00,088
and if you don't like me that's okay yes

358
00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:03,120
I do you do like it absolutely is

359
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:04,560
absolutely yes all right so getting back

360
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,299
to breeding if I'm because I'm just

361
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,008
thinking about how I've talked to like a

362
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:09,838
bunch of breeders and everybody wants to

363
00:12:08,009 --> 00:12:11,970
get into the game house thinking about

364
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,529
how long we just how long it takes to

365
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,740
figure out even if something's working

366
00:12:13,528 --> 00:12:20,278
okay you got a cross you did arise by

367
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,600
Mac maybe okay which seems to be on your

368
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,600
mind that's happening geez you're a

369
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,639
psychic or did I blow it I know I'm

370
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,870
gonna make myself summarize to maxi's

371
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,938
and we'll see what happens right now

372
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:32,459
that's exactly what you'll see what

373
00:12:29,938 --> 00:12:34,500
happens see what has it take to see what

374
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:36,268
happens what kind of investment is got

375
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,250
to veg but we've got to cut clothes you

376
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:39,750
have to cut and a rise male King Solomon

377
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,970
you got to get a Mac clone so you're

378
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,549
cutting those you got what 14 days in

379
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,110
your cloning machine 1014 days then

380
00:12:44,549 --> 00:12:47,278
you've got to put those in small pots

381
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,289
you got probably two or three weeks

382
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,990
there right can I go into a three gallon

383
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:53,909
pot for four maybe six weeks there we're

384
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:55,680
already at about 10 weeks right

385
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:57,659
we've got soil we've got lights we share

386
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:01,318
water already I know I'm gonna flower

387
00:12:57,659 --> 00:13:03,179
about round 8 18 to 25 all pollinate

388
00:13:01,318 --> 00:13:05,308
then I've got another 40 or 50 days

389
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:07,349
before those seeds are done then we

390
00:13:05,308 --> 00:13:08,889
harvest is that like a plants dry it's

391
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:11,109
like the halfway out now

392
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:12,609
got seeds and now I've got to grow the

393
00:13:11,109 --> 00:13:15,100
seeds to find out if what I've created

394
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:17,350
is worth a [ __ ] because it could be it

395
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,699
could be amazing it could be a total dud

396
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,920
I don't know because I've never played

397
00:13:18,698 --> 00:13:22,479
with the Mac before sure I know what

398
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:24,519
Solomon does he's reliable

399
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,139
but I don't know what that Mac girl how

400
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,730
she's gonna react to that pollen and

401
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,899
what those genes are gonna do together

402
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,379
it could make a bunch of lopsided

403
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,789
handicap planets for all I know and okay

404
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:36,308
and what's the deal you were talking

405
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:38,230
about reputation earlier firms are the

406
00:13:36,308 --> 00:13:40,088
worst thing you know for the reputation

407
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,129
yes if I were to release hermaphrodite

408
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,989
seeds I would destroy all of this that

409
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:45,909
I've built um right stop all of

410
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:47,259
everything he's done so when you're

411
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:48,818
crossing with things you don't really

412
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,798
know we're kind of we're just kind of

413
00:13:48,818 --> 00:13:53,019
looking for the best here the way that I

414
00:13:50,798 --> 00:13:55,358
do my best to prevent that is to not use

415
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:56,499
some Afra Didache parent plants it so

416
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:58,269
that's what it is science that you're

417
00:13:56,499 --> 00:13:59,798
using have a tendency to her do not

418
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:02,259
breed with them because that will come

419
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:04,149
out down the line yeah maybe not a whole

420
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:05,769
bunch but it will show up and if it

421
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,058
shows up then it's a problem it has to

422
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:08,948
happen so I've got to grow those seeds

423
00:14:07,058 --> 00:14:09,999
that I make your right myself or send

424
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,889
them out so I've got a lot of good

425
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:13,778
friends who are reliable testers they

426
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:16,360
get them and they know hey this is brand

427
00:14:13,778 --> 00:14:18,639
new you try this you take pictures look

428
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,709
out for problems right could be it could

429
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,970
be a ticking time bomb in your grow so

430
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,409
just pay attention for this it could be

431
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,178
a hermaphrodite it could be totally

432
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:27,129
weird or it could be the new Mac you

433
00:14:25,178 --> 00:14:28,808
never know god yeah you have to give

434
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:30,339
them a warning but they grow that for me

435
00:14:28,808 --> 00:14:32,350
or I grow them and then we make sure

436
00:14:30,339 --> 00:14:34,029
then if it's successful then I give it

437
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,069
to James bean she lets it out as a

438
00:14:34,028 --> 00:14:37,418
tester or as a freebie to other people

439
00:14:36,068 --> 00:14:39,308
and then they grow it also and say I got

440
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,918
free stuff then we see that it works

441
00:14:39,308 --> 00:14:45,548
well in a lot of garden feedback hydro

442
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:46,749
coco soilless organics LEDs whatever

443
00:14:45,548 --> 00:14:48,698
kind of lighting you could think of I

444
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:50,589
want all the results and then we'll put

445
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:52,328
it out for the public sure yeah all

446
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,309
right that makes sense it makes okay now

447
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:56,678
here's one I'm trying to I've had this

448
00:14:54,308 --> 00:14:59,168
explain to me before you're you're a

449
00:14:56,678 --> 00:15:00,458
good good you're actually a podcaster

450
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:01,769
you could probably explain this to me in

451
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:04,628
a very simple way

452
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:06,818
MCS feminized seeds there's all sorts of

453
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:09,639
you know the Internet's full of [ __ ]

454
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:11,528
Oh FEM seeds will harm on you you know

455
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:13,448
that kind of stuff would you explain

456
00:15:11,528 --> 00:15:15,818
feminized seed I think it's fairly

457
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:17,948
simple if MA like I said a minute ago if

458
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:20,259
you use hermaphroditic parents you get

459
00:15:17,948 --> 00:15:21,500
hermaphroditic offsprings okay if the

460
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:23,419
fem seeds are made with

461
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,159
hermaphrodite girls they will be

462
00:15:23,419 --> 00:15:27,289
hermaphrodites the way that I make them

463
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:29,750
is I carefully select my girls I stress

464
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:31,759
test the females that I use so if I'm

465
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,649
gonna use a Strawberry Fields girl and

466
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,879
I'm right golden bill the stakes I'm

467
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:36,590
popular for using the golden go and

468
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,629
reversing it sure I put those in a row

469
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:40,550
and I'll run them on 1212 like we

470
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:43,700
normally do but about two weeks in I'll

471
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:45,319
go and change the light cycle you know I

472
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,970
all want to see it right they do under

473
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,470
stress and if they hermaphrodite they

474
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:50,389
don't get to breed they get taken out of

475
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,070
the breeding schedule they're gone awry

476
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:53,840
eaters if they show me that they're

477
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:54,890
worthy then I'll work with them and

478
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:57,710
that's where we'll get to the feminized

479
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:59,569
talk so I'll take the golden goat plant

480
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:01,550
and I make a product called silver

481
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:03,440
thiosulfate it's really easy to figure

482
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:04,879
out how to make that I don't teach a lot

483
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,230
about how to make that I don't want to

484
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,939
get too detail I just want to get a

485
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,670
product I spray that product on the

486
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,770
plant right turns the plant it's makes

487
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:14,839
pollen sacks that contain pollen that

488
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:17,000
only have female chromosomes there's no

489
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:19,009
male chromosomes in that plant but I

490
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,769
have just tricked that planter or

491
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:23,929
something basically yeah it's the silver

492
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:29,000
stops the copper movement which creates

493
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:31,609
other things so it's a blocker yes step

494
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,279
at a time all right so we stop the

495
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,080
copper movement we create other hormones

496
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,689
from moving then we create pollen sacks

497
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,060
with female pollen then I put that

498
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,650
female pollen on a female plant now

499
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:44,779
there's no opportunity for male it's all

500
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:46,789
female chromosomes happening right if I

501
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,470
have chosen my parents correctly and I'm

502
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:50,179
quite careful to do it I don't get any

503
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:51,320
reports of hermaphrodites in my seeds

504
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,059
that's huge

505
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,680
yes that's why you got a good reputation

506
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:56,119
thank you that's why they're breathless

507
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:57,799
and there are a lot of them out there

508
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,019
now a lot of lemon Jeffrey's a lot of

509
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,639
golden right they're out right and first

510
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,929
up what do you do I'm gonna guess you

511
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:04,160
haven't have you ever had it because I

512
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:06,559
mean what the hell do you do that's like

513
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,140
a fire right there well I get rid of

514
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,609
them I chop them down right yeah if I've

515
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:11,900
had it in the room and I see a

516
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,818
hermaphrodite I remember what the

517
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,199
parents are I take good notes right line

518
00:17:13,818 --> 00:17:16,909
it goes I don't continue that anymore

519
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,160
there's no need for that we've got so

520
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,900
many opportunities for good genetics

521
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,180
yeah I'll play with anything that isn't

522
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,829
a tent we've got 11s now we used to

523
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,480
scale things on a one to ten we found a

524
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:28,269
Levin

525
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:30,849
why do you want to mess with a 7/32 I've

526
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:32,380
seen that Mac and I was like oh yeah and

527
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:34,480
so let's play with the nines and tens

528
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,460
and 11s and leave the hermaphroditic

529
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,860
sixes and fives out of it couldn't agree

530
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,860
with ya okay so just as we're gonna

531
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:43,329
leave this subject feminized seed has

532
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,129
nothing to do with hermaphrodites

533
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:47,528
correct AB some Aphrodite's have to do

534
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:49,539
with hermaphroditic plant parents FEM

535
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:51,398
seeds are just blocking what's blocking

536
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:51,788
some kind of male hormone or something

537
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:54,398
like that

538
00:17:51,788 --> 00:17:55,898
allowing female seeds to grow that's the

539
00:17:54,398 --> 00:17:58,329
best explanation I've heard you give a

540
00:17:55,898 --> 00:18:01,719
FEM so far you've got it alright I maybe

541
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:04,298
I'm getting it man go hmm excellent man

542
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,579
how long you been doing FEM seeds I have

543
00:18:04,298 --> 00:18:08,408
been do I released Femmes at one of the

544
00:18:06,579 --> 00:18:11,230
first cannabis cups we had here in

545
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:13,179
Colorado I think it was 2010 bouquet

546
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:14,919
very wrong all right I've got a brain

547
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,840
injury that makes dates really fuzzy for

548
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:18,580
me no yeah I was giving away yeah I was

549
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,918
giving away grateful dog and heart of

550
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:22,480
gold seeds I gave away probably ten

551
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,830
thousand seeds at a couple of cannabis

552
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,089
cups just walking around giving them

553
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:26,648
away five seeds at a time

554
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:28,509
oh if you were carrying like if you had

555
00:18:26,648 --> 00:18:29,888
a bag with those nutrients right my saws

556
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:31,240
like he's gonna grow here a free see

557
00:18:29,888 --> 00:18:32,798
that's so cool that way you could go

558
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,558
home anyhow to everything that's so cool

559
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,538

563
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,288
bullshitting about following the trends

00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:46,839
I mean my buddy Jan comes over he gave

565

570
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,850
supposed to give it to people that we

571
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:59,859

love to smoke that high P stuff but I

592
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,430
don't follow it in my growing or

593
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:51,589
breeding I avoid it that's not uh I

594
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:54,289
don't look like the most trendy guy I'm

595
00:19:51,589 --> 00:19:56,869
pretty sure well nowadays yeah but these

596
00:19:54,289 --> 00:19:58,279
were way before most people's if I let

597
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:00,169
him down you'll see I was first not

598
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,119
really yeah you wait long enough yeah

599
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,920
yeah but I stay away from a lot of the

600
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:05,479
trends a lot of the hype stuff I do my

601
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,370
thing what feels right to me when I see

602
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,289
a girl plant and a male plant right it's

603
00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:10,819
like when you see a girl at the bar in

604
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:12,859
your friend like hey dude you and her

605
00:20:10,819 --> 00:20:14,450
should talk you guys would all right you

606
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:15,740
know who should and I'm like that with

607
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:17,960
plants I'm like this the plant

608
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:20,029
matchmaker the plant porn producer ah

609
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,430
that's funny who would make a good scene

610
00:20:20,029 --> 00:20:25,220
I do think of that frequently I think of

611
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:27,769
the Mack cut as like this beautiful girl

612
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,660
with just a whole shitload of baggage

613
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:31,670
with her you know every should grow slow

614
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,380
she blah blah you know what I mean but

615
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:39,620
I'll still probably hang out there for a

616
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:41,480
little bit yeah yeah Oh baby I stay away

617
00:20:39,619 --> 00:20:44,119
from the hype I just I dodge the trends

618
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,950
right I'm obviously I'm pollinating the

619
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:47,509
Mack so that's that just sounds fun I

620
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,610
want to see what it does sure but I

621
00:20:47,509 --> 00:20:51,109
don't have wedding cake and all that

622
00:20:49,609 --> 00:20:52,909
other stuff right on you don't see a lot

623
00:20:51,109 --> 00:20:53,479
of that stuff in my grow I do what I

624
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:56,060
like

625
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:58,190
so tell me come on let's show off what

626
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:00,470
you got man maybe Geoffrey's a legend

627
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,059
day I brought some lemon Geoffrey

628
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:04,160
which camera am I gonna bet I got laid

629
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:05,960
feminized seeds this is uh the lemon

630
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,700
skunk and golden goat so give me come on

631
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:09,799
you're the best guy to describe this

632
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,900
[ __ ] paint me a picture man so if you

633
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:13,339
took a box of lemon head candies okay

634
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,350
poured those on the table and smelled

635
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:17,990
the box it's not real overwhelmingly

636
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:20,059
powerful all right but like soft lemon

637
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:21,529
kind of a dryer sheet and lemon sort of

638
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:24,289
a thing that's the wrong I think comes

639
00:21:21,529 --> 00:21:25,160
from here to sort of a a dish soap great

640
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:28,190
flavor

641
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,140
real big giant buds on this one it's not

642
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,519
super tight on some phenotypes some of

643
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,200
them are a little airier that comes from

644
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,240
the lemon scum right I think that makes

645
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,309
amazing concentrates so there's gonna be

646
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:38,690

other right two starters I'm probably

718
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,369
saying also it's cool though but what I

719
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:59,990
was gonna say is there's one that's a

720
00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:00,719
Valencia or something like that and

721

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,610
the orange yeah so there is an orange

723
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,288
terpene I remember out drive by the

724
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:09,029
citrus squeeze plants in Florida and

725
00:24:07,288 --> 00:24:10,558
they would have big barrels of orange

726
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:14,548
juice and then it would have a little

727
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,779
tiny barrel of something like a 25 25

728
00:24:14,548 --> 00:24:17,819
gallon barrel there's always so

729
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:21,329
different a hundred hundred bucks says

730
00:24:17,819 --> 00:24:23,308
those are the terpenes right oh yeah man

731
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:24,928
they got a little bit of Turkey you

732
00:24:23,308 --> 00:24:27,029
probably made cleaner and all kinds of

733
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:28,710
crazy stuff out of that I want or I

734
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:31,019
wonder if they sell it for stuff rose

735
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,429
ium yeah you're right yeah I think this

736
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:33,839
smells like the orange ozium if you get

737
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:35,669
the orange one right and smells like the

738
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,500
orange Ozio that's what I think we shout

739
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:40,350
out to that was one of the best I mean

740

742
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:46,470

00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:58,440
cookies right Angie cross to the golden

748
00:24:55,409 --> 00:25:00,720
goat feminize as well recognized as well

749
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,179
it's so [ __ ] important people give me

750
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,500
seeds all the time and I was looking

751
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:06,120
through and being like I need some stuff

752
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,548
to plant I was gonna actually for the

753
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:10,319
greenhouse and I was like I don't go on

754
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:12,150
a phenol hunt yeah and not only you know

755
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,740
on I don't want to lose half my crop to

756
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,298
males and you don't want to accidentally

757
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,250
pollinate the neighbors for the next

758
00:25:15,298 --> 00:25:19,500
three miles if you forget a male and the

759
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,000
wind comes yeah people forget about that

760
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,740
I think that's one of the things we need

761
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,750
to pay more attention to so yeah FEM

762
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,490
seeds for lots of new Instagram breeders

763
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:32,400
online now they all come from here and

764
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:34,798
welcome that's it so you know what

765
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,659
everybody's crosses right yeah alright

766
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,940
and then I've got the the staple the

767
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:40,350
golden goat s1 some of those labels get

768
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,570
confusing it's a golden goat

769
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:44,250
reversed so I made golden goat to create

770
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:46,079
pollen and put that on another golden

771
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,548
goat so it's just a self golden goat you

772
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,109
know I heard you say golden goat and I

773
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:51,750
was already thinking of my next question

774
00:25:49,109 --> 00:25:53,908
and I just have to stop and cuz that's a

775
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:57,329
really special strain I agree when I

776
00:25:53,909 --> 00:26:00,780
first got here amazing flavor to it a

777
00:25:57,329 --> 00:26:03,629
great plant you know just a big just a

778
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:05,548
beautiful plant yeah and I mean who was

779
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:07,860
it that made that shatter was it was it

780
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:10,009
a darkness gross gross and that

781
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:12,649
beautiful orange shadow

782
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:14,359
that slab this smell hit my face and

783
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,780
came back down and I went oh that's the

784
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:19,879
most delicious golden goat and he smiled

785
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:22,279
golden goat its absolutely butyl is so

786
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,050
delicious yeah yeah wonderful job with

787
00:26:22,279 --> 00:26:25,730
that you can't lose with that plant you

788
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,930
can't you can crack it you could twist

789
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:28,519
it you can kick it over

790
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:30,500
yeah it just grows it goes okay now

791
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:32,599
that's why the dude gave it to me when I

792
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,759
first got here that was the one he's

793
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,379
like Scotty I set you up for success

794
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,779
well that's partly why I love reading

795
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:40,670
with her you can't do her wrong right if

796
00:26:38,779 --> 00:26:42,589
the pH is too high or too low she'll go

797
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:44,120
then that'll be all right she likes a

798
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:45,919
lot of nutrients so you can't really

799
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:46,309
over feed her it's real simple to work

800
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,170
with

801
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,480
I'm good potency good flavor good

802
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:52,430
harvest and she breeds really well now

803
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,839
you said as long as you're good at

804
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,340
explaining stuff so I'm gonna take a

805
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:57,169
little lesson I'll be listening in this

806
00:26:55,339 --> 00:26:59,059
back and I keep on glossing over stuff

807
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,410
how'd you get the golden goat again

808
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:02,629
because I want to learn this you

809
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,570
reversed did you say reverse with the

810
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,920
seeds come from making getting a golden

811
00:27:05,569 --> 00:27:08,960
goat clone right and I treat it with a

812
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:11,029
silver thiosulfate garnishing and it

813
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,049
turns it into it's basically a male it

814
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,569
looks like a male but it's still a

815
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:17,450
female it's just got male pollen sacks

816
00:27:14,569 --> 00:27:19,490
with female pollen got it and I put that

817
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,950
on a female plant so it's just golden go

818
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:24,109
to golden coat okay wait I got the plant

819
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:25,970
I didn't create it a lot of people think

820
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:27,679
I made golden goat I didn't I got it as

821
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:29,450
a gift from my friend who I call

822
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,710
pineapple Express all right he's

823
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,180
actually from Hawaii

824
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:34,490
the golden girl has nothing to do with

825
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:36,950
Hawaii but my friend pineapple Express

826
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:38,480
is from Hawaii that's what I named him

827
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,250
that's just his nickname he doesn't his

828
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,870
real name out there sure if he got that

829
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,799
clone from another person it actually

830
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:46,729
came from mr. dank in Topeka Kansas he

831
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:48,500
bred yes

832
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:51,110
Topeka Kansas there's a recycling center

833
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,119
in Topeka known as the golden go

834
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,409
recycling plant and it's a hundred

835
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,909
degrees out here imagine if I had a

836
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,350
bunch of soda bottles out there and how

837
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:59,150
sweet and sticky and good that would

838
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:01,339
smell right it smells like a golden goat

839
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:03,200
plant and that's why he named it golden

840
00:28:01,339 --> 00:28:04,909
goat after the golden goat recycling

841
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,009
center yeah that's a lot a lot of people

842
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,750
probably I get credit for it quite often

843
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:09,109
and it was not me I didn't create that

844
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,450
huh

845
00:28:09,109 --> 00:28:13,490

short and squat that's what is the other

850

two or a tall monster right what keeps

851
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,210
it short and keeps the finishing time

852
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,880

really know exactly some of the specific

889
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:44,898
questions to ask so I was getting with

890
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:47,390
Jeff and one of the questions he said to

891
00:29:44,898 --> 00:29:48,918
me was hey man how would these guys are

892
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,960
sure that they're delivering a really

893
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,409
high-quality a really clean medical

894
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,840
product you know IPM you know nutrients

895
00:29:54,409 --> 00:29:58,730
leach and that kind of stuff even going

896
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,369
as far as having mold on there you know

897
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:02,899
even when you're curing processes man

898
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:04,489
I'm asking you this you know ask you the

899
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:07,278
same thing you're not in a commercial

900
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,500
production like that but what what kind

901
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,769
of advice could you give as far as IPM

902
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:15,890
as far as keeping a good making a good

903
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:17,960
safe product even I do consulting for

904
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,520
commercial growers so I know and I'm

905
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,710
also certified by the Colorado

906
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,720
Department of Agriculture everything I

907
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:25,700
do in any grow I follow Colorado

908
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,159
Colorado Department of Agriculture and

909
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:30,319
marijuana Enforcement Division pesticide

910
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,570
guidelines right so nothing I play in

911
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:34,460
any grow that I consult for my personal

912
00:30:32,569 --> 00:30:35,439
grows none of my breeding grows if the

913
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,210
Colorado Department

914
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,558
bag won't let us use it I don't use it

915
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,419
sure I'm not restricted by those

916
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,888
guidelines in my private grow but I

917
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:43,269
still choose to follow that sort of a

918
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:45,579
restriction yeah I mean that

919
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,558
concentrates are exactly what they say

920
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:48,878
your cause you're taking it yeah think

921
00:30:47,558 --> 00:30:50,408
about somebody yields from these things

922
00:30:48,878 --> 00:30:52,269
you take a whole plant and get three

923
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:53,950
grams out of it or something you're

924
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:55,329
taking that all the essence of that

925
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:58,058
whole plant or at least all the

926
00:30:55,329 --> 00:31:00,638
trichomes and and concentrating it down

927
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:02,470
dig up there's even that tiny fraction

928
00:31:00,638 --> 00:31:04,000
of pesticide on there oh yeah know

929
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,259
enough that you smell the little flower

930
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,609
and it'd be okay now you're

931
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:10,480
concentrating it down to where you're

932
00:31:06,609 --> 00:31:12,308
smoking right right on that plant you

933
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,259
just basically broke that back down into

934
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:16,690
a little ball dangerous I've smelled

935
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:18,759
sulphur I've tasted sulphur before the

936
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,440
concentrate tastes like fish or like

937
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:21,579
burnt fish or something rice they use

938
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,500
sulfur too late in their flowering

939
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,939
process and really what that's from

940
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,829
and I mean Iggy I could see that

941
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:28,210
happened you know you know I could put

942
00:31:26,829 --> 00:31:31,720
it this way I can see somebody making

943
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:34,269
that mistake if I had a big pot of soup

944
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:36,100
or chili how much pesticide can I put in

945
00:31:34,269 --> 00:31:37,450
there that you still want to eat it you

946
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:40,839
know and then I might you like the

947
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:43,569
people you're serving absolutely right

948
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:45,308
come on guys it's right come on we've

949
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:47,230
all gotten I had thrips before I used

950
00:31:45,308 --> 00:31:49,028
the a mammoth IPM and knocked them out

951
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:50,919
for me what do you do when you have bugs

952
00:31:49,028 --> 00:31:53,558
are you preventing it with with other

953
00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,269
bugs give me some advice in veg I am a

954
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:58,178
spray guy I like to use a reliable

955
00:31:55,269 --> 00:32:00,128
sprays and veg later on to the veg phase

956
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,990
I like to give to be the predator bugs

957
00:32:00,128 --> 00:32:03,730
going I like to use Swarovski's I

958
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:05,109
depends on what kind of pest I think I'm

959
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:07,419
gonna get right these are always the

960
00:32:05,109 --> 00:32:10,628
go-to nice swear skis and green lace

961
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:11,919
wings they're definitely aggressive and

962
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:13,628
they'll keep anything away so if you get

963
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,610
them colonized and get them started I

964
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:18,250
liked it so I do the sprays it's easier

965
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:20,019
to spray smaller plants and control them

966
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:21,638
keep the moms all sprayed up it's

967
00:32:20,019 --> 00:32:22,839
reliable and as I move toward the

968
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:25,148
flowering phase I'll start releasing

969
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:27,369
massive amounts of predator bugs my god

970
00:32:25,148 --> 00:32:29,168
and to always filled with predators and

971
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:31,628
I like to keep perpetual flowering areas

972
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:33,490
so there's always predators over here

973
00:32:31,628 --> 00:32:35,439
let's move to the next spot as they come

974
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,269
in and they're coming from the late veg

975
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,009
plants so I like to start with sprays

976
00:32:37,269 --> 00:32:41,558
and then move to the predator bugs I

977
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:43,628
also do a lot of defoliation a few

978
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:45,099
defoliate that's less opportunity for a

979
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,209
pathogen all right look if you don't

980
00:32:45,099 --> 00:32:48,829
have a leaf that wears that bug gonna go

981
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:50,779
come on give us give us your advice on

982
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:52,730
day what day what do you do Foley aid

983
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:54,889
you got specific days when three when I

984
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:56,539
go into flower ID foliate hard I put on

985
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,680
the trellis I pop all the sticks I

986
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:59,029
dressed all the stems and work

987
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,590
everything into the net and I take off

988
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:02,119
quite a bit of loose a twist on stem

989
00:33:00,589 --> 00:33:03,799
super crop and basically for crop them

990
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:05,509
put one hand here one hand here and give

991
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,649
it a twist yep Google that if you all

992
00:33:05,509 --> 00:33:08,089
don't know that's an interesting

993
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:09,950
technique it sounds just like a knuckle

994
00:33:08,089 --> 00:33:12,409
pops now you know you did it right yeah

995
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,970
go up a few inches and do it again let

996
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,650
that heel about two or three weeks and

997
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:16,789
go back and do it all over again right

998
00:33:15,650 --> 00:33:18,950
yeah like did you and that will prevent

999
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:21,109
your stretch and early flower so I'll do

1000
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,610
that on day one I'll do defoliation in

1001
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:25,219
about week three do some defoliation

1002
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:27,319
then again about week five or six okay

1003
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,910
and then as they mature and harvest I'll

1004
00:33:27,319 --> 00:33:30,379
just strip them is there getting close

1005
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:32,330
to the end week eight week nine really

1006
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,040
Katy yeah well a lot of times I'm in a

1007
00:33:32,329 --> 00:33:35,599
large commercial cultivation facility

1008
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,920
where hundreds of lights right and so

1009
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:38,509
I'll just send a crew of dudes in there

1010
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:40,130
and just say make them naked boys and

1011
00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:41,509
that way when it comes time for harvest

1012
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:43,460
you don't have all that leaf to take off

1013
00:33:41,509 --> 00:33:45,289
you chop them hang them upside down you

1014
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,450
don't have that mess of chlorophyll

1015
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:50,000
basically to deal with yeah I used to do

1016
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,710
that Easter I think it was in the 90s

1017
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,420
that people I guess strip off all the

1018
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:55,819
leaves boys you know you only want buds

1019
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,590
yeah and yeah I wasn't sure the

1020
00:33:55,819 --> 00:33:58,879
technology science behind that so I

1021
00:33:57,589 --> 00:34:00,859
stopped doing it you're saying you don't

1022
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,240
if you do it late enough you're not

1023
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:04,009
seeing any negatives you do it late

1024
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,970
enough you don't see any negatives we've

1025
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:06,109
already done what they're gonna do

1026
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:08,119
you're just work it and I don't strip

1027
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:09,859
them completely naked naked but right at

1028
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:11,719
the end right we'll go naked but we've

1029
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:13,099
up to week six there I'm keeping some of

1030
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:15,169
the bigger leaves but I take if it's got

1031
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:17,389
a purple pea do that comes off like a

1032
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:19,730
purple or something that'll stay there

1033
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,379
yeah okay yeah I want as much light

1034
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:23,840
penetration as I can get I want as much

1035
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:25,099
air flow as I can get right in a big it

1036
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,410
changes when you're in a big facility

1037
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:29,210
that one little spot of powdery mildew

1038
00:34:27,409 --> 00:34:31,039
can multiply you know and you know eight

1039
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:32,329
pounds and pounds I'm not risking one

1040
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:34,730
pound like in a home gram

1041
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:36,079
risking 500 pounds sure so I've got to

1042
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,360
be a little more aggressive with my

1043
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,369
prevention as far as P n goes you got

1044
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:43,010
any time you need loves there correct

1045
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:44,719
the rooms it's all about money P D we

1046
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,700
talked about VP deal or I out the bar

1047
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:48,619
shows all about proper yeah no

1048
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,689
microclimates people forget that you

1049
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,969
need a fan here and share not just way

1050
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,829
over there that used to be my I was like

1051
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:56,719
I never got powdery mildew but I'll be

1052
00:34:54,829 --> 00:34:58,219
damned to fight him he'd go crazy with

1053
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,399
the fans he would be like dude what's up

1054
00:34:58,219 --> 00:35:01,798
with you and these fans and

1055
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,329
make floor fans and I put a fan on the

1056
00:35:01,798 --> 00:35:05,190
floor and pointed up a fan over there

1057
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:06,869
and point it down yep and don't have all

1058
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,730
your fans I've seen rooms where all the

1059
00:35:06,869 --> 00:35:10,890
fans oscillate together you're just

1060
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:12,630
moving you want to stir the air yeah he

1061
00:35:10,889 --> 00:35:14,129
was moving that heat over here and move

1062
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,509
the heat over here we want to mix it so

1063
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,480
the heat and the cool and the humid and

1064
00:35:15,509 --> 00:35:21,298
the yeah well combines yeah since we're

1065
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,039
talking grow VPD is basically vapor

1066
00:35:21,298 --> 00:35:24,929
pressure deficit we talk about it all

1067
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:26,880
the time it's the first time you tuned

1068
00:35:24,929 --> 00:35:28,739
in here it's basically the pressure

1069
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,749
that's keeping the water onto the leaf

1070
00:35:28,739 --> 00:35:32,758
if you're able to get it correctly the

1071
00:35:30,748 --> 00:35:35,038
leaves actually able to respire and

1072
00:35:32,759 --> 00:35:36,778
breathe basically yes yeah it's almost

1073
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:38,940
like if we were in a rubber suit man

1074
00:35:36,778 --> 00:35:40,318
yeah gonna work so good yeah you're

1075
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:42,630
getting good at this cutting Oh a man

1076
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:46,018
where's my mister analogy coffee cut man

1077
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:48,358
another gold star for you I appreciate I

1078
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:50,429
love bullshitting with you about grow I

1079
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:52,170
also like bullshitting with you you know

1080
00:35:50,429 --> 00:35:53,879
if you listen to the show I'm more about

1081
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,769
the culture I'm more about what sit

1082
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:57,809
we're interested in what's happening now

1083
00:35:55,768 --> 00:36:00,449
we listen to all the same podcasts

1084
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:02,670
weren't all the same [ __ ] yeah it's an

1085
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:04,469
absolute revolution what's happening I

1086
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,289
love it I got my mother-in-law using

1087
00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:09,538
started off with CBD now she hits the

1088
00:36:07,289 --> 00:36:11,069
pen every now and again you know but I

1089
00:36:09,539 --> 00:36:12,119
never would have I don't say I never

1090
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,400
would have thought I don't know it would

1091
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,759
have been hard to imagine this I think

1092
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,759
the the easy way that we got in here is

1093
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:23,278
because it is really good medicine it is

1094
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:25,858
super easy to convince people that this

1095
00:36:23,278 --> 00:36:28,710
is really good medicine usually it just

1096
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:31,018
takes one hit off one of those price if

1097
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,579
you were running thanks man

1098
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:34,498
all right if you had a minute to talk I

1099
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:36,989
would tell you my father-in-law holy

1100
00:36:34,498 --> 00:36:38,669
[ __ ] he don't believe it man you don't

1101
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:40,588
believe you just you stayed the course

1102
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:42,480
actually it was weird cuz I knew I was a

1103
00:36:40,588 --> 00:36:44,278
grower and never admitted it and then

1104
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,289
after it became legal and I came here

1105
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:47,608
and he goes up good I'm glad I just

1106
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:49,589
don't want you breaking the law like he

1107
00:36:47,608 --> 00:36:49,920
had a problem in a breaking the law not

1108
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:51,748
really

1109
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,269
cannabis is medicine or anything like

1110
00:36:51,748 --> 00:36:56,248
that but if you were trying to convince

1111
00:36:54,268 --> 00:37:00,058
somebody like him that cannabis is real

1112
00:36:56,248 --> 00:37:01,768
medicine what would you say who I got a

1113
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,739
minute I had a traumatic brain injury in

1114
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:06,238
2015 I'm easily a pretty upbeat guy you

1115
00:37:04,739 --> 00:37:08,130
could say I like life right I'm not dark

1116
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:10,289
in session is he absolutely my brain

1117
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,730
injury had me thinking it was tricking

1118
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:13,920
me into thinking I wanted to

1119
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,409
you hurt myself and do bad things to my

1120
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,119
life and I knew that wasn't right

1121
00:37:16,409 --> 00:37:19,589
right but my head hurts so bad and my

1122
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:21,690
thoughts are so twisted from a brain

1123
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:23,430
injury like my brain just my waters were

1124
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,858
[ __ ] on for watches and I get I was

1125
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:27,449
doing purple orange I thought that

1126
00:37:25,858 --> 00:37:30,029
purple was orange now and I thought that

1127
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:31,379
a burrito was called a banana holy [ __ ]

1128
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:32,640
but yeah that's where my brain was it

1129
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:34,650
took a while for it to come back and

1130
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:36,000
then amazing how it works and like you

1131
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,950
have something like that me like I can't

1132
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,289
believe it worked in the first place my

1133
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:42,629
computer was scrambled yeah messy maybe

1134
00:37:40,289 --> 00:37:44,579
go to the doctor and he you're like no

1135
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,130
we could watch it work we kind of we

1136
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:49,349
don't really know how it works though

1137
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:51,269
they tried were scary one of my friends

1138
00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:54,358
was entering a cannabis cup for a CBD

1139
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:56,519
concentrate and he said hit this and I

1140
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:58,079
said okay right when I was smoking dabs

1141
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:01,019
or flowers it would make my head throb

1142
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,179
from the injury I hit I dabbed that CBD

1143
00:38:01,019 --> 00:38:05,579
and it felt like I had a belt around my

1144
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,719
head and when I hit that CBD it felt

1145
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:08,159
like he just went back there and turned

1146
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:11,849
a little knob that loose into that belt

1147
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:13,500
two or three notches really oh and as

1148
00:38:11,849 --> 00:38:14,880
soon as I hit it and exhaled his

1149
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:17,429
girlfriend goes give him another one

1150
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,950
just like they could see my puzzle

1151
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:22,529
pieces just coming I was like whoa like

1152
00:38:19,949 --> 00:38:24,750
hey hey guys like I'm back and they're

1153
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:26,910
like keep hitting this Wow so they gave

1154
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,800
me a few days supply I can't give you a

1155
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:30,839
lot right cannabis cup entry but here's

1156
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,600
you know it's work and hit this and so I

1157
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:35,700
smoked CBD first so I don't like CBD now

1158
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,469
right but I smoked CBD for several days

1159
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:39,269
and then it kind of put me back on the

1160
00:38:37,469 --> 00:38:40,649
tread sped up my healing whatever was

1161
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:43,889
happening in my brain that put it back

1162
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:46,050
together in this mm lens you saw us 2015

1163
00:38:43,889 --> 00:38:48,239
holy crap yeah that's not long no not

1164
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,680
long ago and I'm pretty much back -

1165
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:50,579
there are still things that happen -

1166
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:51,779
sure sure

1167
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,730
well do you ever have the thoughts and

1168
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,880
you're going hey wait whoa how did I end

1169
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:58,949
up in this room like only when I'm super

1170
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:00,869
duper stone not at the end of the joint

1171
00:38:58,949 --> 00:39:02,969
of the a what room I didn't see when I

1172
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:04,200
smoked my brain doesn't I see that

1173
00:39:02,969 --> 00:39:06,029
there's like a skip on my record

1174
00:39:04,199 --> 00:39:08,069
wherever I hit right my record was spin

1175
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:11,070
and I dinged it right there and so and

1176
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:12,809
so and so sometimes skip you know I mean

1177
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,609
right when I smoked that little they

1178
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,739
wipe off the skips on my record when I

1179
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:18,539
dab like the lemon Jeffrey's you're

1180
00:39:16,739 --> 00:39:20,669
holding goats right the right strain so

1181
00:39:18,539 --> 00:39:23,460
I'll just clean my my skips right on up

1182
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:25,710
so that's that's amazin want to kill

1183
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,570
myself anymore from consuming CBD

1184
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,710
sounds really weird to say but rising it

1185
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:30,450
wasn't like me being crazy it was a

1186
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,130
brain injury an injury that does things

1187
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:34,409
so I mean CBD really does have

1188
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:35,880
anti-inflammatory properties I mean if

1189
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:38,309
any if you think about what inflammation

1190
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,570
is shoving everything to get it it don't

1191
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:43,409

something like that how do you mean

1199
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,840
motivated in general man you just get up

1200
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:59,460
every day to mansion do the passion I

1201
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,230
love cannabis

1202
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,269
I loved it before my brain injury it

1203
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:05,699
sure made my smile you can tell I talk

1204
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:08,369
too much and it talked to me just right

1205
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:10,889
just right I would talk too much then if

1206
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:12,809
I didn't consume right ah but so the

1207
00:40:10,889 --> 00:40:14,159
brain injury the just the passion and

1208
00:40:12,809 --> 00:40:15,570
then I became a caregiver and I was

1209
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,549
involved in the medical marijuana from

1210
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,990
the beginning very cool ah people would

1211
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:20,789
come to our dispensary and we would I

1212
00:40:18,989 --> 00:40:22,619
had time then at dispensaries to sit

1213
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:23,969
just like this and write what's wrong

1214
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,099
and they would say it hurts I would say

1215
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:27,179
where and they would tell me how and

1216
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:28,980
where and I'd say oh you want this

1217
00:40:27,179 --> 00:40:31,889
strain and we'd actually get to develop

1218
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,170
that so I would see young guys like you

1219
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:35,639
and I and little ladies and everybody

1220
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,559
all walks of life would come in and

1221
00:40:35,639 --> 00:40:39,420
after a week of talking to me and

1222
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:40,889
consuming a product I recommend they

1223
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,700
would I would see improvement in their

1224
00:40:40,889 --> 00:40:43,859
quality of life

1225
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:45,539
just a better smile yeah maybe a little

1226
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:47,430
more pep in their step and do that put

1227
00:40:45,539 --> 00:40:50,130
something in you that is irreplaceable

1228
00:40:47,429 --> 00:40:51,359
I'm a father and that that's a magical

1229
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,460
feeling that thing when you see other

1230
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:55,890
people healed from a product you may so

1231
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:58,139
true is the next best thing maybe the

1232
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:59,579
next best it's funny we were talking

1233

1234
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:03,690
about the joy of being able to actually

1235
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:05,190

1258
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:53,720
how to grow you look great and you can't

1259
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:56,059
be down when you have support like that

1260
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:57,500
no so it's that's part of what does it

1261
00:41:56,059 --> 00:42:00,019
and we talked about checking out the

1262
00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:02,630
one- hundred people that say nice things

1263
00:42:00,019 --> 00:42:04,940
and all our friends it does round it out

1264
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,470
bracing it definitely does yeah it's

1265
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,880
just weird how your brain works oh oh

1266
00:42:06,469 --> 00:42:09,349
yeah you don't want that bad you want to

1267
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:11,119
make everybody happy you know what I

1268
00:42:09,349 --> 00:42:13,190
think it is I think it's primal I think

1269
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,319
it's like when you would see a fire back

1270
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:17,179
in the day you know from been thousands

1271
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,620
of years ago based about that fire you

1272
00:42:17,179 --> 00:42:20,029
know there's a potential problem there

1273
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,829
when somebody Falls you want to pick

1274
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,300
them up yeah I think it's really bright

1275
00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:24,980
like you you want to pick them up make

1276
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,940

same about you so I think that's big I

1358
00:45:07,730 --> 00:45:10,579
think you really have to associate you

1359
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:12,588
have to find people that want to help

1360
00:45:10,579 --> 00:45:13,940
you that want to teach you things and

1361
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:16,278
man people don't want to teach you

1362
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,889
things if you got a a big sourpuss right

1363
00:45:16,278 --> 00:45:20,539
right yeah yeah why am I gonna teach you

1364
00:45:18,889 --> 00:45:22,250

that's what we got it what thing I try

1368
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:29,088
to do I give credit to the people who

1369
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,039
taught me a lot of times I say I learned

1370
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:32,568
this from this person right and that's

1371
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,039
just giving credit to my source so that

1372
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:37,068
