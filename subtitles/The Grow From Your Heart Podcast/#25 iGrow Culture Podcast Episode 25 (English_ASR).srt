went to a comedy show at Comedy Works in

112
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,360
Denver we saw a comedian called Todd

113
00:03:56,438 --> 00:03:59,759
Johnson called Todd Johnson I sound like

114

115
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:04,318
yeah this guy called Todd Johnson I saw

116
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,360
the comedian named Todd Johnson uh he

117
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,798
was pretty funny but I thought he was

118
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,159
kind of clean for my taste he was kind

119
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,480
of good old boy comedy uh you said nasty

120

121
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,959
expecting dirty uh so Comedy Works is

122
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,680

00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:35,639
following up uh that that guy was the

163
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:37,000
host following him was a guy named

164
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:40,199
Deacon gray right was there a comedian

165
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,399
before Deacon gray uh yeah yeah deakon

166
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:43,919
oh no because it seemed like it seemed

167
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,239
like the host kind of did a the host did

168
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,599
a five set a five minut set sure and

169
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,038
then uh then Deacon gray came out and if

170
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,240
you guys don't know Deacon gray Deacon

171
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:54,519
gray is a Denver local as far as I know

172
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,639
uh he's funny as [ __ ] hilarious kind of

173
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:58,599
an older dude and he's had time to calm

174
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,240
down he's not a hyper kid and he's got

175
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:03,520
his delivery is Flawless he doesn't look

176
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,720
like he's up there performing he's up

177
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,598
there having as much fun as we are and

178
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,479
he did quite a bit of high humor too and

179
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:11,478
I mean that's that's not easy I mean it

180
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,879
seems easy to write jokes about pot but

181
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:15,159
it's you know right and it has to be in

182
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:18,159
Denver now there's a thing where

183
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,560
everybody's a pot comic so you can't be

184
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,160
a pot comic you have to have that you

185
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:24,680
can throw in your pot set for when the

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,680
crowd gets there it can't rely on that

187
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:28,560
because it gets old quickly every it

188
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,918
wasn't about pot it was more about the

189
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,720
high humor you know about being high

190
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:34,120
kind of than it was about like I get my

191
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,520

192
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,918

223
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:44,680

224
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:46,158

is great yeah if you guys follow the

226
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,800
show you know that Mark Emer was

227
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,680
arrested and held in in an American

228
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,879
federal prison for Distributing cannabis

229
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,360
seeds across the world uh most listeners

230
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,639
of the show would agree that Mark was in

231
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,720
prisoned for complete [ __ ] so I

232
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:00,280
think it's great to know that he's back

233
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,680
home with his family where he belongs

234
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,839
he's cuddled up with his wife I saw a

235
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,560
picture of him smoking a joint with some

236
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:08,519
people I saw a picture of him hugging up

237
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,158
on his wife that's what a man should be

238
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,598
doing he shouldn't be locked up and he's

239
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,079
right back on the fight I don't know if

240

up there and I i' never really noticed

242
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:21,439
that he spoke with a wisp maybe he has a

243
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,839
retainer or something but it it really

244
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,399
was pronounced when he like when he very

245
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,439
first stepped back into Canada and got

246

295

Lear the Bas in prison that's cool mine

296
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,519
was in County Jail not federal prison so

297
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,759
that's a whole another level even like

298
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:29,799
that's amazing and I'm glad he's free

299
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,480
that's [ __ ] awesome well he was

300
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,838
locked up on in our opinion [ __ ]

301
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,159
charges [ __ ] charges it makes

302
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,040
awesome makes every uh seed breeder pot

303
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:40,199
grower makes us all a little bit kind of

304
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,078
and not only that but he was worried

305
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,200
about ourselves before the rules have

306
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,519
changed and now that they've changed you

307
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,160
know I can just imagine the culture

308
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:50,440
shock I mean from where he was Mark

309
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,719
emmer where he could probably puff on

310
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,120
the street anytime he wanted to but now

311
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,320
in Canada they don't really seem to care

312
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,799
from what people have told me they're

313
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,480
like come here and smoke weed we don't

314
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,240
really they don't talk big problems to

315
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,680
fry they don't talk about it like we do

316
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,159
they don't get all hyped about it but

317
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,159
they also don't give a [ __ ] about it all

318
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:07,759
right so big shout out to Mark Emy if

319
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:09,159

know we both have to quit and she's not

423
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:42,320
that strong willed so if she doesn't

424
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,120
want to quit then she won't quit she

425
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,519
doesn't want to so I'm trying to I've

426
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,519
told her get a get a pen and just smoke

427
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,120
wax you know like you

428
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:55,000
don't you exactly exactly got a little

429
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,959
pen pulls in out of nowhere what is that

430
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,278
what's the you want to say what kind of

431
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:59,919
brand it is or I don't know if you want

432
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:01,320
to shout yeah they gave him that they

433
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:03,159
give him that product to test out and he

434
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,519
doesn't really have a platform to give a

435
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:05,799
review you're tied up in the headphone

436
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,039
cable so you're going to be stuck for

437
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:09,599
life now but go ahead and uh go ahead

438
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,838
and tell them the name of the thing and

439
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,639
then uh I hit it once I'll tell you my

440
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:17,600
opinion um it's will hit it I'll shut up

441
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:21,198
you talk the company is

442
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,040
NEOS um in my opinion it's an easier

443
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,159
draw and uh better tasting and more

444
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:26,799
effective than some of the other

445
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:29,759
companies it's

446
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,679
good that's um that's an interesting

447
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,800
piece they gave us some samples to try

448
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,399
out to see if you know we wanted to

449
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:37,318
carry their stuff they're a fairly new

450
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,879
company okay so they're just trying to

451
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:40,318
get their name out there pretty much but

452
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,838
a lot of that's going down right now the

453
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:44,399
batter is a little bit bigger than some

454
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:47,399
of the other companies that are that are

455
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,958
a similar style so they have

456
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,519
strain strain specific cartridges it's

457
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:56,638
CO2 oil I don't know if you mentioned

458
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:59,919
that yet yeah CO2 yeah yeah uh it's a

459
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,959
it's a good product it is not um it

460
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:04,519
looks Pro level it's not dab kit dabs

461
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,799
but if you're uh if you're if you're

462
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,560
looking for a vape pen like this it's

463
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:11,799
it's really attractive is that okay so

464
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,919
you just replace the cartridge on the

465
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:15,120
end yeah okay I see it now cool I was

466
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:16,120
looking for the unscrew part but you

467
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,159
have your finger right there and I could

468
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:20,318
tell there's a USB that attaches to the

469
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,838
other end cool and the very end of it is

470
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:24,278
a stylus what does that cost if I were

471
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:26,360
if I were a wreck patient what would

472
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,559
that cost me um we haven't started

473
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,440
carrying them yet so I'm not sure but

474
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,479
similar companies with smaller batteries

475
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:35,360
like I said that aren't as great uh

476
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,560
starter package is about $58 and some

477
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,240
change okay uh for a small cartridge

478
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,039
just a 150 mgram cartridge and a and a

479
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:45,079
and a battery you don't have to replace

480
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,599
the battery you can recharge it so you

481
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:48,838
just have to come get cartridges and

482
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,920
they make them in three different sizes

483
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,279
but these ones that we're uh these new

484
00:16:50,919 --> 00:16:54,439
ones that we're testing out were

485
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,958
probably going to start carrying those

486
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,720
and I'm not sure what the price will be

487
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,000
on those it'll be similar definitely so

488
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,440
it's a cool little it's a cool little

489
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,399
piece I a different High I noticed a

490
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,600
different high from it we've been

491
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:06,919
dabbing for a while and I just took

492
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:08,279
another rip off that and my high changed

493
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:09,880
it got me a little different so yeah

494
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,318
it's a cool product it's it's Lemon

495
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:13,919
Diesel that's this particular cartridge

496
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,119
I'm going to take a dab of some turpex

497
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,319
of course i' uh I might have friends at

498
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,958

505
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,319

want to talk about acquiring seeds but

532
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,519
before I do that let me give a little

533
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,919
bit of a legal disclaimer because we

534
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:40,879
don't want to be the next Mark Emer okay

535
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:44,840
uh it may be illegal to acquire cannabis

536
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,840
seeds in your location is your

537
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,440
responsibility

538
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:51,240
awesome let's start that again I'm not

539
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,558
even going to try to edit any of that it

540
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,079
is your

541
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,279
responsibility to know the laws in your

542
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:59,079
location uh any company online that will

543
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:02,279
send you seeds is only only sending them

544
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:05,038
to you for souvenir purposes germinating

545
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:07,519
seeds germinating cannabis seeds is

546
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,279
illegal in most places I'm not here to

547
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,440
help you break the law if you decide to

548
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:13,759
buy and/or germinate cannabis seeds I

549
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,759
cannot be responsible for

550
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:19,038
you I live in Colorado or cannabis is

551
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,200
legalized so most of my advice is for

552
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,759
Colorado California Oregon Washington or

553
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,600
Michigan residents uh be careful and

554
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,879
don't get your ass into trouble because

555
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:31,639
I'm not a lawyer and I'm not responsible

556
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,240
I'm simp L the host of a badass podcast

557
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,799

558
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,400
absolutely all right I just had to do

559
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:40,119
that because I don't I don't cuz you're

560
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,600
if you're ordering seeds you must be 18

561
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:46,079
or 21 and you got to be responsible you

562
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:47,639
have to be smart mhm um know the rules

563
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,000
where you

564
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,720
are in your location I I think they

565
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,880
might have used that's not good know the

566
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,679
rules in your location I use poor

567
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,960
grammar but still do that [ __ ] so now

568

cannaboid profiles and they're getting

606

what they want out of it and a lot of

607
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,839
that has to do with the way they do

608
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,558
things a lot of the new seed breeders

609

are really uh Community friendly and

610
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,480
dispersing a lot of seeds to a lot of

642
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,599
want to get into a breeding stuff and

643
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,000
you want a reliable male I can't believe

644
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:48,639
I'm [ __ ] telling the world this but

645
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,319
Gage green is a good place to find a

646
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,278
nice reliable male that's true [ __ ]

647
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:55,639
right there that's how friendly I am uh

648
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:56,960
but be careful with your breeding CU you

649
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,720
can still [ __ ] up even with that good

650
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,919
male so much I like you guys you listen

651
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,640
to my show it's awesome uh so bag seeds

652
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,480
are fun but they're not as reliable bag

653
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,360
seeds are seeds that you find in wheed

654
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:09,798
of course right uh they're not as uh

655
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:11,839
reliable as something you'd find you

656
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,400
want something with uh specific parents

657
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:14,678
bread for certain traits like Kevin was

658
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,840
saying earlier so it's kind of cool that

659
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,320
he touched on that uh your first option

660
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:19,599
is bag seed that's [ __ ] that you of

661
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,038
course found in that cush that you

662
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,599
bought from that guy in the park and it

663
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,960
had a seed in it grow that out see what

664
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:27,199
happens but keep a close eye on any bag

665
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,319
seed because it could be a male or it

666
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:35,080
could be a Aphrodite yep yep Adam's got

667
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:37,399
a yard full Herms mhm mhm mhm okay so if

668
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,158
you're in a legal State you can possibly

669
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,360
get seeds at a dispensary or a co-op uh

670
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,400
many of the shops in California Colorado

671
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:46,918
Washington and Michigan have seeds from

672
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,919
reputable reputable breeders available

673
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:50,600
on the shelves in the dispensaries

674
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:54,159
almost everywhere in the Pacific

675
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:57,038
Northwest has [ __ ] TGA subcool seeds

676
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,640
all over the place uh most of the shops

677
00:23:57,038 --> 00:23:59,599
in Colorado you you can pick up yourself

678
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,000
some rare

679
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,639
dankness uh Michigan's got uh oddly

680
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,839
enough they've got gaug green genetics

681
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,919
because our friend Yankee uh trolls up

682
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,319
and down the East Coast there and takes

683
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,240
care of them with the guge green he's

684
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:14,918
gug green rep and he's awesome so

685
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,359
they're taking care of there so there's

686
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,038
seeds on shops and shelves I was reading

687
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,158
I forgot there you go uh you can also

688
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,599
pick up seeds at cannabis events like

689
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,159
the Cannabis Cup and Hempfest or

690
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:25,959
whatever else is happening this month

691
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,880
because there seems to be an event every

692
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,159
damn month now uh the go they set up a

693
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,440
tent do a little bit of research online

694
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:34,720
look what you're find out what you're

695
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:37,080
looking for find out what you should be

696
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,440
paying expect to pay about a 100 bucks

697
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:42,079
for a 10 pack of seeds honestly uh

698
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,240
between 60 and 120 but about a 100 bucks

699
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,439
for a 10 pack of seeds so uh before you

700
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,278
go to the events go and uh find out what

701
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,480
you want and then go there and see if

702
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,720
you can find those breeders and you'll

703
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,240
have a little shopping done it'll be a

704
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,159
little easier for you uh but those are

705
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,880
only viable options if you live in or if

706
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,200
you can travel to a legal State like

707
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,159
Colorado or Hempfest which is happening

708
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,399
right now it'll be over by the time you

709
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:05,840
hear this sorry uh that may not be an

710
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:07,639
option for most of you guys so in this

711
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,079

716

718
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,319
Nature's green remedies and I trust

719
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,240
everyone that I've done business with

720
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,798
involved with Nature's green remedies so

721
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,519
I strongly recommend Nature's green

722
00:25:27,798 --> 00:25:32,879
remedies.com for seeds in the US like I

723
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,879
said expect to pay around $100 for a 10

724
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,240
pack of seeds sometimes you get a 12pack

725
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,520
uh some brands are a little cheaper some

726
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,159
are slightly higher femini seeds often

727
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,319
run a little more expensive because

728
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:45,919
they're harder to produce you get way

729
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,720
less femin seeds out of a breeding

730
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,240
project than you do regular seeds it

731
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,720
takes more time it takes more space it

732
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,599
takes more energy so of course we want

733
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,640
more money for that I do not charge my

734
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:58,398
regular seeds my femin seeds are the

735
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,799
same price I charge same price all the

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,760
donations just to help out his cause

1023
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:27,118
because he couldn't smoke anymore and

1024
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,040
things like that so that's what it's

1025
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,160
about it really you know uh he gained

1026
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,559
weight throughout his entire treatment

1027
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:37,519
the only bad news we received was the

1028
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:39,719
original cancer so uh cannabis has done

1029
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:43,119
a lot for the man he's made sure he

have to buy some iy genetics products

1139
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:27,679
right now I think his email said he's in

1140

there good deal but he doesn't have to

1143
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,519
even buy I genetics products he can go

1144
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,640
buy some rare dankness or or some llata

1145

couple minutes to kill you guys got a

1188
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:12,799
topic you want to bring up um you had a

1189
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,440
couple topics earlier oh yeah bro

1190
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,440
Colorado Springs has banned the use of

1191
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,960
uh butane extraction yeah as far as I

1192
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:21,720
know you're going to celebrate the uh

1193
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,480
the Banning of butane extraction by

1194
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,279
taking a fat chunky dab is that what

1195
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:28,599
you're going to do I I asked honestly

1196
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,880
that's going to happen Okay um go for

1197
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:32,920
your thing Kevin there there's not a lot

1198
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:36,160
of details on it so there's not a lot to

1199
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,838
say about it however for those who

1200
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:42,399
haven't caught the message yet

1201
00:42:38,838 --> 00:42:45,558
um Colorado Springs has put a moratorium

1202
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,800
on butane extraction including in a Clos

1203
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:50,119
loop system and under all these new

1204
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,559
regulations that have been put on the

1205
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:54,318
extraction Labs can can you dump that

1206
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,400
down just a little bit like I don't I

1207
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:58,838
don't really so they're saying more

1208
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,480
blasting yeah pretty much exactly you

1209
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:02,039
can't do it open which are the new

1210
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,838
regulations you have to have closed loop

1211
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:07,000
system and a certain type of environment

1212
00:43:04,838 --> 00:43:10,759
um under certain code and things like

1213
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,280
that um but now they're outlawing even

1214
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:18,079
that uh in Colorado Springs and what

1215
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,800
apparently what it was is um some one

1216
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:23,960
one guy from I forget his name from the

1217
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:28,559
building some building department or

1218
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:30,960
something in Springs um kind of decided

1219
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:33,440
that you know these electrical codes and

1220
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,440
certain things were not sufficient to

1221
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,280
even have a closed loop um system in so

1222
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,599
here you know here the industry is

1223
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,960
there's a lot of people you know making

1224
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,920
new new rooms and everything under all

1225
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:47,000
these new

1226
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:49,720
codes um that follow all these

1227
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,960
guidelines and this guy just came in and

1228
00:43:49,719 --> 00:43:54,078
said that wasn't good enough and

1229
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,599
apparently this department has like

1230
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,079
final say over Fire Department and all

1231
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:01,640
this other stuff so if you guys hear

1232
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,039
that cough in the background that's Adam

1233
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,318
being a big

1234
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:08,199
[ __ ] so you know they're they're

1235
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:12,239
working to figure it out and you know I

1236
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:15,759
think the guy uh from what I understand

1237
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:18,000
is going to tell you know the industry

1238
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,400
what he wants as his regulations or

1239
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,079
whatever and um you know it may be like

1240
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,559
like the video I saw they said it may it

1241
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,920
it may be a week

1242
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,880
it may be a year before this is fixed

1243
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,200
you just never know what this stuff and

1244
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,440
it it's just happened yesterday

1245
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:39,598
afternoon so that's do you know how many

1246
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,400
extraction minimal uh so this is uh open

1247
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,880
blasting is actually technically illegal

1248
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,480
anyway this is only relating to

1249
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:47,960
dispensary uh OPC grows so State

1250
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:49,639
regulated me regulated grows that are

1251
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:51,039
blasting their it's not even blasting

1252
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:54,199
anymore at this point it's processing in

1253
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:57,318
a Clos loop system uh how many of those

1254
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:59,919
legal me regulated did mips OPC

1255
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:01,558
regulated blasting sites processing

1256
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,639
facilities I guess we'll call them how

1257
00:45:01,559 --> 00:45:06,760
many of those do you think or know of in

1258
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:09,358
Colorado Springs I I know of two for

1259
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,359
sure I know there's probably a couple

1260
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,960
more just uh cuz some of the you know

1261
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:17,078
dispensaries have their own um myips

1262
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,800
license and stuff that they can process

1263
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:23,359
under but I know two of for sure and

1264
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,559
one's fairly new to Colorado and that's

1265
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,639
kind of a

1266
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:30,960
bummer yeah they just spent a lot of

1267
00:45:27,639 --> 00:45:34,480
money building their for

1268
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,318
liing and it's getting shut down now

1269
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,920
which is you know that's they can still

1270
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,199
run their Garden but they can't they

1271
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,079
can't extract it with butane you can

1272
00:45:40,199 --> 00:45:46,159
still run CO2 you can still run um uh

1273
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,318
water but so can the garden that we're

1274
00:45:46,159 --> 00:45:50,879
talking about that okay a garden in

1275
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,318
springs that was actually being grown so

1276
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,680
what happens guys if you're listening

1277
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,719
from we've got a listener that listens

1278
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:58,239
in London MH like so we have to keep

1279
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:59,679
yeah thank you but we have to keep in

1280
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:01,399
mind that not everybody my mic sounds

1281
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:02,759
funny okay it's just the music we have

1282
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:06,079
to keep in mind that not everybody knows

1283
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:09,119
Colorado [ __ ] right uh these places grow

1284
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,920
a large garden like a thousand plants

1285
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,480
and they harvest the entire garden and

1286
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:15,559
then they run all of that through a a

1287
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:19,639
closed loop butane extraction machine

1288
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:22,200
and turn all of it into hash into BHO

1289
00:46:19,639 --> 00:46:25,199
dabs shatter processed marijuana

1290
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:27,598
concentrate yes and that sells for

1291
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:29,679
somewhere between depending on where and

1292
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,680
who between 30

1293
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:35,078
and and if you're getting into live

1294
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:38,358
resin it's $85 to $100 a gram right so

1295
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:40,839
these guys are making large portions and

1296
00:46:38,358 --> 00:46:42,719
uh portioning it up into grams and then

1297
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:44,759
they deliver it back to the dispensary

1298
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,558
and then the dispensary sells it or the

1299
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:48,440
dispensary takes their grow that they

1300
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,040
have leftovers of and sends it to the

1301
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:53,599
extraction company for them to blast or

1302
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,279
process and then they take all of that

1303
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,119
product back to the shop and sell it on

1304
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,000
the shelves so these guys are growing

1305
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:02,240
large large Gardens just for processing

1306
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,679
so what I see them doing you run your

1307
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,358
large garden you chop it you dry it you

1308
00:47:04,679 --> 00:47:07,919
drive it up to Denver to your processing

1309
00:47:06,358 --> 00:47:09,960
facility or down to Pueblo to your

1310
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,480
processing facility where it's legal and

1311
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,800
then you run it there and then you just

1312
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,920
have to drive

1313
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,280
twice um yeah pretty much so this is

1314
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,760
this forcing closed loop systems correct

1315
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:21,079
well closed Loops have been banned also

1316
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:23,000
in Colorado Springs as part of this

1317
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:24,599
moratorium but the Clos loop system is

1318
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,800
what the industry standard is now you

1319
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:29,039
cannot blast open that's what I'm saying

1320
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,000
is this not doing anything but like

1321
00:47:29,039 --> 00:47:33,480
upgrading the hash I mean it kind of

1322
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,199
sounds negative when it's coming from

1323
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:36,719
YouTube but to me it sounds like more

1324
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:37,960
people are going to be making unicorn

1325
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:39,838
hash and we're going to go away from the

1326
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,599
butane Nast they just banned you can't

1327
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,480
even make unicorn hash now which is a

1328
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,039
live resin you guys sorry just Colorado

1329
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,800
Springs yeah you can't do any of it in

1330
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:48,800
Colorado Springs and it's going to drive

1331
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,200
the black market hash off exactly now

1332
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,960
guys like like uh guys that are

1333
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:55,318

1336
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,559
people do that for me but I'm going to

1337
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,599
have to if I live in Colorado Springs I

1338
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:04,119
can't get it now cuz it's not being made

1339
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:06,599
I'm going to have to go in my backyard

1340

and open blast my own product which is

1341
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:10,240
right taking it back to where it was

1342
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,199
that caused a lot of the problems in the

1343
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,598
first place yep that's what but that's

1344
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:16,118
what prohibition does I mean goes back

1345
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:19,680
and forth yeah yeah they're just trying

1346
00:48:16,119 --> 00:48:21,280
to repr prohibit prohibition yeah

1347
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:22,799
Colorado Springs is kind of a strange

1348
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,440
city anyway for being such a big city

1349
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,318
they've banned all the recreational

1350
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,920
Cannabis now they're banning black

1351
00:48:26,318 --> 00:48:31,639
in yeah there a lot of military up there

1352
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,800
do you want to mention the uh the event

1353
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:35,239
being pushed back or yeah yeah oh yeah

1360
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,280
pushed the mountain region back I'm I'm

1361
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,760
sure it was a community decision to some

1362
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,079
extent wasn't just Big D going no I'm

1363
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:58,640
[ __ ] doing this that's just I know he

1364
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,519
feel like doing it tomorrow but no they

1365
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,598
they had just wrapped up the the East

1366
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:05,239
Coast um the Beast Coast Beast Coast

1367
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,240
shout out to Bobby nugs apparently that

1368
00:49:05,239 --> 00:49:09,598
was badass good job I watched the video

1369
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:11,358
on they they had some pretty high

1370
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:13,440
numbers and some pretty high so after

1371
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:16,318
that uh you know Secret Cup

1372
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,480
administrators decided that uh they

1373
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:20,838
needed to make Colorado the home state

1374
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,559
secret cup administrators yeah so Big D

1375
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:26,798
and Jeremy yeah okay as hey dude as

1376
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:29,680
badass as the the Beast Coast was you

1377
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:31,679
know and um they didn't feel like they

1378
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:34,480
could do that within like a week and a

1379
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:37,358
half and they've had several venue

1380
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,838
changes several issues with Denver um

1381
00:49:37,358 --> 00:49:40,798
yeah and the venues they could get

1382
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:42,199
locked down so they finally have a good

1383
00:49:40,798 --> 00:49:44,719
venue locked down and they're getting

1384
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:47,318
everything else uh squared away and they

1385
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:49,358
pushed it back to the end of September

1386
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:51,558
um and so it's still happening and they

1387
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:54,598
want to just make it badass and not half

1388
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:57,000
ass so uh good job on that decision for

1389
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:59,720
sure that leave more time for people to

1390
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,960
get ready also uh Big D offered to pay

1391
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:04,959
any expenses that were extra um incurred

1392
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:07,119
on people who had already had plane

1393
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:09,199
tickets uh that had to trade a man or

1394
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,480
anything like that like he had posted

1395
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:13,239
