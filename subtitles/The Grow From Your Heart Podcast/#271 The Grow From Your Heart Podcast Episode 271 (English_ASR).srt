Sicilian is actually the real word for

217
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,470
mushrooms and that they're growing under

218
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,360
like these giant interwebs under the

219
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,350
ground and that they feel everything and

220
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,730
like mushrooms are the birth of

221
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,220
everything and really 50%

222

my degree in business management in

363
00:17:55,789 --> 00:18:00,220
Pennsylvania

364
00:17:57,788 --> 00:18:01,778
I had my cosmetology license so I could

365
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,600
move out here and do that if I wanted to

366
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:07,148
but low-key I worked in a head shop in

367
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:08,498
the town that I lived in and it wasn't

368
00:18:07,148 --> 00:18:10,449
super progressive at all like the dude

369
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:13,239
didn't want to carry like whack stuff

370
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:16,179
but he was a hippie he was like a

371
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:25,479
legitimate like from the beginning my

372
00:18:16,179 --> 00:18:27,519
old boss and say not Adam no yeah

373
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,970
anyways it was a it's what I really I

374
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:30,479
loved

375
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:33,879
that's what I was always a part of so

376
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:37,690
yeah when I came out here I met Queen

377
00:18:33,878 --> 00:18:39,098
Rebecca and my life has been this ever

378
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:40,690
since you guys make a great team this is

379
00:18:39,098 --> 00:18:42,398
perfect I like the way that you set up

380
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,690
the store and then the dolls and the way

381
00:18:42,398 --> 00:18:45,848
that the dolls rep the store perfectly

382
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,349
the way you guys do all the social media

383
00:18:45,848 --> 00:18:52,418
stuff you're perfect but you know we

384
00:18:50,348 --> 00:18:55,979
gotta mention that there's also higher

385
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:59,019
elevations that's part of this fan yes

386
00:18:55,979 --> 00:19:02,139
you know before I came here before I met

387
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:04,058
Lydia I did get a rig repaired at higher

388
00:19:02,138 --> 00:19:06,519
elevation masterpiece productions

389
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:08,138
I googled who can fix my glass on the

390
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,940
Internet and that's the first place that

391
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:12,788
came up and I drove there and they told

392
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,739
me I needed to make a deposit and drop

393
00:19:12,788 --> 00:19:16,329
off the rig and if they fix my rig they

394
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:17,798
would charge me the other half of my

395
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:20,288
payment and if they didn't they would

396
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:21,878
give me a nice deal on a new purchase

397
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:23,589
from the store and I thought that that

398
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:24,848
was super fair and they called me in

399
00:19:23,589 --> 00:19:27,038
about ten days and they said hey bro

400
00:19:24,848 --> 00:19:29,259
come get your rig and the rig is

401
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:35,048
straighter now than it was when I got it

402
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:36,970
from the original artist I don't like it

403
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:38,499
when my dad nail points up at an angle

404
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:39,940
because you're putting hash on there it

405
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:41,858
needs to stay straight cuz I put a lot

406
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,239
of oil on a nail and the amount of oil I

407
00:19:41,858 --> 00:19:44,470
put on there if it's tilted at all it

408
00:19:43,239 --> 00:19:45,879
will run off so I need it straight up

409
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:47,440
and down and that rig was a little

410
00:19:45,878 --> 00:19:48,728
crooked before I broke it and now it's

411
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,590
perfectly straight up and out my oil

412
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:55,239
stays on there perfectly I did it

413
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:56,228
changed my life so it was perfect we

414
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,700
wouldn't be sitting here right now if

415
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,330
that didn't happen so I guess that was a

416
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,119
good thing

417
00:19:58,329 --> 00:20:03,098

418

turn it into something you can smoke

489
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:41,860
through in this room I'm sitting in I

490
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:43,269
can't even describe this properly

491
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:46,059
there are probably a hundred different

492
00:23:43,269 --> 00:23:47,889
styles of glass just within my view that

493
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,450
I can tell a hundred different artists

494
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,190
just twisted these up their way

495
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:52,630
everybody's gonna do it in their way

496
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:54,759
it's amazing that everything in front of

497
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:56,950

or wherever I wanted to teach them about

552
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:03,950
UV glass really quickly because UV is

553
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:05,119
kind of the new [ __ ] it's one of the

554
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:07,880
newest things that's popping up on the

[Music]

559
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:27,710
UV they put I don't know what they put

560
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:30,320
in the glass they put radioactive salt

561
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:31,730
in the guys and they make a glass pipe

562
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,490
with it and then you turn on your

563
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:36,289
blacklight and your glass gloves and it

564
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:43,819
is crazy looking it looks radioactive

565
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:45,289
you guys in the dark UV okay that makes

566
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:49,819
enough sense to me I do have something

567
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:51,589
to add let's hear it okay so my no okay

568
00:27:49,819 --> 00:27:56,750
no that's not what I'm adding my true

569
00:27:51,589 --> 00:28:00,559
obsession is because I grew up in the

570
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:04,609
90s and I did those damn fuzzy posters

571
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:07,190
that whoa under black light and I had

572
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:09,709
several backlight accessories in my

573
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:10,970
[ __ ] awesome bedroom when I grew up

574
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:13,100
what a cul-de-sac did it look like

575
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:16,279
Spencer's threw up in your bedroom no I

576
00:28:13,099 --> 00:28:18,379
wasn't that like kind of douchey like I

577
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,879
did I had like four lava lamps and I'm

578
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,600
really would like to start acquiring

579
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,930
them that's really awesome you do have a

580
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,750

lava lamp granny yes I have that it's

583
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,019
cute yeah so um that's why I like the UV

584
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:36,109
glass because it's like an ode

585
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:37,609
to the 90s like time that I grew up in

586
00:28:36,109 --> 00:28:39,079
because it's just like backlight and

587
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,279
it's dope and I'm smoking from it it's

588
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:42,679
getting me really stoned so it's like

589
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:44,750
putting together a bunch of parts of you

590
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,390
know the good stuff it's awesome it's a

591
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:51,190
nostalgia yeah right I know I'm still

592
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:51,190
like a child I was just about to say

593
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:56,489
[Music]

594
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,900
there's somebody from just about every

595
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:07,389
generation in this room right now

596
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:10,220
because of cannabis on the right track

597
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:11,090
these young people just amaze me don't

598
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,480

barefoot grower look at their stuff I'm

602
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,390
like holy [ __ ] those guys are killing it

603
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:30,920
and then they work with these young

604
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:33,380
extraction artists up in the canyon up

605
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,810
there and the medicine they make yeah

606
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,200
you know I like I say this Incredibles

607
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:43,190
is good stuff you buy that medicine from

608
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,779
the homies that is really good medicine

609
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:47,299
The Incredibles is made by somebody

610
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:49,339
younger than me really yeah that guy's

611
00:29:47,299 --> 00:29:50,750
younger than me Diaz yo prod certain

612
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:52,429
that Diaz a few years younger than me

613
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,859
well they're very proud of their girl

614
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:57,590
because any product you and I both know

615
00:29:54,859 --> 00:30:02,599
comes from the grow and they have a good

616
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:05,059
product the frozen monkey any of the

617
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:08,000
Raza frozen monkey I think it's funky

618
00:30:05,059 --> 00:30:11,869
monkey no it's fresh frozen okay that

619
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,130
that makes more sense to me than do you

620
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:14,779
want to talk a little bit about fresh

621
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:16,730
frozen and the difference between the

622
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,019
frozen and the not frozen since Becca

623
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,240
had a couple of questions about it and

624
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:21,440
these ladies questions well you be in

625
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,440
the big expert

626
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,680
I love today but I'm getting to know the

627
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:30,340
difference in the products I like and it

628
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:33,019
really seems like this fresh frozen

629
00:30:30,339 --> 00:30:35,089
keeps the Terps in as we've talked about

630
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:36,710
before we don't have any of our Turkmen

631
00:30:35,089 --> 00:30:38,689
here tonight the main difference is

632
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,100
we're cutting down the plants while

633
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:40,630
they're while they're still alive we cut

634
00:30:40,099 --> 00:30:42,039
them down

635
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,990
trim them up just a little bit take off

636
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,200
the big leaves throw those in a freezer

637
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:49,089
and freeze them up completely I'm gonna

638
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,890
tell the whole world what you just did

639
00:30:49,089 --> 00:30:52,839
so we freeze the plants completely and

640
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,610
then we put the frozen material into the

641
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:56,679
extraction tubes and extract it with the

642
00:30:54,609 --> 00:30:58,959
butane then it goes into the back of and

643
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:00,310
then it's properly purged that's the

644
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,049
main difference is that before we're

645
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:03,579
letting the herb dry yep hanging the

646
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:07,480
plants to dry and I think that the

647
00:31:03,579 --> 00:31:15,659
frozen we are certainly getting we're

648
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:23,079
getting way more flavor definitely it's

649

823
00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:11,818
a little soldier in uniform he must have

824
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:12,949
been about 25 came running up to me and

825
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:17,358
said

826
00:41:12,949 --> 00:41:18,379
I know you and I said oh you do and he

827
00:41:17,358 --> 00:41:20,328
said yeah let's get in the elevator

828
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:22,369
though so as soon as we got in the

829
00:41:20,329 --> 00:41:29,869
elevator he said can I have my picture

831
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:32,630
three or four times no there's no selfie

832
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:36,679
oh well that's because we always enjoy

833
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:38,690
each other's company and have a good

834
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:40,338
time if you take a selfie with Rasta

835

all right I'll try to bring this little

855
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,960
recorder I'll get it fixed because

856
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:25,250
everybody that listens to the show knows

857
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,650
that this thing gave us some issues and

858
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:29,300
I don't trust it I'll get it fixed

859
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,889

861
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:35,809
about the event live from the place

862
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:43,039
while we're there are you cold

863
00:42:35,809 --> 00:42:47,000
you're freezing I had to turn the air on

864
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:48,619
to get the cloud of dad's moving I was

865
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,480
trying to think of a sackful way to say

866
00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:53,269
that without busting you out on having

867
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:55,338
the front of the store nice and cloudy I

868
00:42:53,269 --> 00:42:57,800
think it is you and me shuttle to the

869
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:59,690
pizza guy the last time we hung out

870
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,920
together they had to open the back door

871
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:02,809
you know something happens when we get

872
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:06,019
together Grammy we seem to the back door

873
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:10,099
so the smoke alarms and the place didn't

874
00:43:06,019 --> 00:43:12,650
get shot down Shh let's uh let's talk

875
00:43:10,099 --> 00:43:14,630
about the recent change in the rules at

876
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:15,980
the cannabis clubs here in Colorado

877
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:20,119
Springs how do you feel about that

878
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:24,210
granny um you know what this podcast is

879
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:29,230
going to air before September 21st

880
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:31,559
September 21st I want a show of force at

881
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:34,329
the courthouse here in Colorado Springs

882
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:37,719
they're shutting down our cannabis clubs

883
00:43:34,329 --> 00:43:39,940
again now I want you to come out we're

884
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:43,059
not gonna speak we're just going to show

885
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:46,240
that we support them and I want you to

886
00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:49,019
come acting like adults I don't want no

887
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:51,069
silliness so if you can't come like

888
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:53,530
professional people in the cannabis

889
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:56,620
community please stay home but let's

890
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:58,330
show these clubs that no we support you

891
00:43:56,619 --> 00:44:01,029
and we're not gonna let the city shut

892
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:02,829
you down I'm upset it's frustrating

893
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:04,240
because you know the next step they're

894
00:44:02,829 --> 00:44:05,739
gonna shut them down there and then

895
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:07,899
they're gonna come after our grows us

896
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:09,369
our caregiver girls already doing that

897
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:10,720
here at Springs they've limited how many

898
00:44:09,369 --> 00:44:12,190
plants you can have and they've shut it

899
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:13,659
down to a number of plants where several

900
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,309
of my friends who are veterans and

901
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:17,259
patients are unable to grow the medicine

902
00:44:15,309 --> 00:44:19,989
that they need for themselves so their

903
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:21,250
option was to go possibly to these clubs

904
00:44:19,989 --> 00:44:22,750
and now they can't even go to these

905
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:23,860
clubs the clubs are know so you guys

906
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:26,230
what we're talking about is the clubs

907
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:28,660
you are no longer allowed to consume

908
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:32,139
cannabis in these cannabis social clubs

909
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:33,879
you are no longer allowed to reimburse

910
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:35,319
them for product that they may provide

911
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,570
for you they're trying to do away with

912
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,280
all of the social consumption clubs and

913
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,200
I don't think it's right I think that we

914
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,030
need these places I think that without

915
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:44,799
these places we have to go smoke in our

916
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,330
cars we have to go smoke in the park we

917
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,860
have to go smoke in the Holly we have to

918
00:44:46,329 --> 00:44:49,750
go park in front of somebody weirds

919
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:52,030
house they take a couple of dabs in our

920
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:53,230
car drive on to another weird house bark

921
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:54,519
in front of there take a couple of dabs

922
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:55,750
because it's hard as [ __ ] to drive and

923
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:57,909
dab in the city when you're on a lunch

924
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,199
break or do you think some of these guys

925
00:44:57,909 --> 00:45:00,779
are gonna go back hanging out in the

926
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,339
bars

927
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,610
well yeah that that's what a lot of

928
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:07,260
people do unfortunately and I myself if

929
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,670
I didn't have cannabis I would probably

930
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,230
drink alcohol and I am no good at

931
00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:11,940
alcohol I don't know if I'm no good at

932
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:15,619
it or if I'm really really good at it

933
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:18,420
I don't think anybody is good at it and

934
00:45:15,619 --> 00:45:20,309
when we were leaving that event in

935
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,320
Denver a few weeks ago when we drove

936
00:45:20,309 --> 00:45:23,699
through the bar by the bars in downtown

937
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:27,390
Denver oh yeah

938
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:30,899
first thing we saw was a drunken female

939
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:33,000
her boyfriend pushed her she was so

940
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,369
drunk she fell into the intersection

941
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,650
there was four or five other drunks

942
00:45:35,369 --> 00:45:40,619
shouting obscenities and I just thought

943
00:45:37,650 --> 00:45:42,930
I hate alcohol yeah I was at an event

944
00:45:40,619 --> 00:45:45,719
with people with cannabis that left

945
00:45:42,929 --> 00:45:46,919
their left smiling and hugging and

946
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:48,750
everybody was happy

947
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:50,010
high-fiving each other yeah good not

948
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:52,320
gonna be hungover tomorrow I'm not gonna

949
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:54,990
drive into stuff so why can't we have

950
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:57,720
ivorie why can't we have our places to

951
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:59,399
congregate I agree and the other thing

952
00:45:57,719 --> 00:46:02,339
we need to push for Jeff as you know

953
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,210
they're coming after our medical yeah

954
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,470
why are they trying to get rid of

955
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:06,059
medical that's not fair that's what

956
00:46:04,469 --> 00:46:08,099
started the whole thing we need medical

957
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:10,610
marijuana for the patients yes we do

958
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:13,110
because let's think about it we all want

959
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:15,300
legalized cannabis all of us do but

960
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:16,829
we're kind of being fooled watch the

961
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,810
right hand don't pay attention to the

962
00:46:16,829 --> 00:46:20,940
left hand we're gonna give you legalize

963
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,860
but we're and make it rec okay so what

964
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,679
if you're truly a patient that truly

965
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:29,490
truly needs medical more than likely you

966
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:31,259
are on a fixed income you have a hard

967
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:33,509
time affording your medicine to begin

968
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:37,560
with and so now we're gonna add a 47%

969
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:39,750
tax or more is that right no it's not

970
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,519
right at all and that's not what our

971
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:44,010
system here in Colorado was designed for

972
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:45,570
at all and it's not just Colorado I see

973
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:48,090
it happening first it happened in

974
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,370
Washington State now it's moving next

975
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:52,380
door to Oregon it's gonna happen here in

976
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:54,719
Colorado do you think eventually we will

977
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:57,869
have a nationwide cannabis program that

978
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,459
is run by one governing organization

979
00:46:57,869 --> 00:47:01,549
that takes care of all the marijuana I

980
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:03,929
think that's what I think that's what

981
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:06,300
governs I think that's what our

982
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:08,769
governing bodies want look how much

983
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,260
money can be made tons of

984
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:13,570
but that doesn't mean it's right I don't

985
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,520
you know what I see the cannabis

986
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:18,850
community going the way of the family

987
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:20,230
farm it's gonna go away and no one are

988
00:47:18,849 --> 00:47:21,880
you gonna have to choose from look here

989
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:25,059
Jeff we sit here we have all this great

990
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:27,400
medicine if it becomes what the

991
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:29,409
government is leading us to you'll have

992
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,019
a strain of indica maybe and a strain of

993
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:35,259
sativa Monsanto ran product and it will

994
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:36,489
be a key Walmart package very well be

995
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,920
your genetics

996
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:40,509
oh no no it'll be some GMO stuff you

997
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:43,930
will continue growing but then we're

998
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:45,850
back to breaking the law right so all I

999
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:47,739
can say is we keep pushing for what

1000
00:47:45,849 --> 00:47:49,059
we've been pushing for keep the medical

1001
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:50,199
in your if you have medical where you

1002
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:51,849
are don't get rid of it

1003
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:53,859
keep it medicals where it all started

1004
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:55,480
and like I always say in almost every

1005
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,460
episode when we talk about social clubs

1006
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:59,710
if you are writing legislation in your

1007
00:47:57,460 --> 00:48:01,269
area for cannabis use make sure you

1008
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,860
include some water to consume that

1009
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:04,960
cannabis make sure you include social

1010
00:48:02,860 --> 00:48:06,490
lounges or social clubs somewhere that

1011
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,900
you can purchase and consume cannabis

1012
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:10,059
with your friends like responsible

1013
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:12,490
adults because that's very much needed

1014
00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:15,340
when you do legalize cannabis in a new

1015
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:16,599
area learn from us here in Colorado we

1016
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,910
are you know we've always been

1017
00:48:16,599 --> 00:48:22,150
everybody's had eyes on Colorado as far

1018
00:48:18,909 --> 00:48:24,069
as the cannabis goes we are learning

1019
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,039
this was something they slept through

1020
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:28,780
and we just didn't pay it any attention

1021
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:30,759
so we thought you know okay we've got

1022
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:33,030
our clubs while we were walking kind of

1023
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,100
in a gray area and now the city is not

1024
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:37,960
liking us any longer for lack of a

1025
00:48:36,099 --> 00:48:40,569
better word I guess they want tax money

1026
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,820
yes it's all about tax money all right

1027
00:48:40,570 --> 00:48:44,200
we've been gone for 49 minutes and most

1028
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,330
people usually give up about one hour

1029
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:48,039
into a podcast so we should start saying

1030
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,599
goodbye to all of the lovely people that

1031

1032
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,909

00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:53,380

1098
00:51:54,980 --> 00:52:01,130
of the time I hear there will be a dab

1099
00:51:57,079 --> 00:52:03,259
bus that's the word what is that and

1100
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:05,150
hula hoop so it's gonna be cold and the

1101
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:09,020
black sheep won't allow us to consume

1102
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:12,619
inside so we're gonna have a bus parked

1103
00:52:09,019 --> 00:52:16,009
in the front so that we can dab safely

1104
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:18,380
and be warm and cozy because the bus is

1105
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:19,730
private property and is not involved

1106
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:22,519
with the black sheep or their liquor

1107
00:52:19,730 --> 00:52:24,590
license so the separation and the unity

1108
00:52:22,519 --> 00:52:25,969
worked perfect I like that happy

1205
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:09,990
emails and questions if people ask me a

1206
01:01:08,699 --> 01:01:11,578
lot of things about the commercial grow

1207
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:13,439
from there just wanted to be straight up

1208
01:01:11,579 --> 01:01:15,990
I am no longer a part of that alright

1209
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,608
moving forward what the hell am i doing

1210
01:01:15,989 --> 01:01:19,799
since I'm no longer there I'm working on

1211
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:21,119
my breeding projects you guys I have got

1212
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:22,560
some I've been talking about the show

1213
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,240
the breeding project here on the show

1214
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,789
recently I've got a breeding project it

1215
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:29,149
is about 50 days into flour at this

1216
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:32,159
point which means it's probably close to

1217
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:35,400
35 ish days since it has been pollinated

1218
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:37,199
which means in about seven to ten maybe

1219
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:39,150
fourteen days I'm keeping a real close

1220
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:40,980
eye on it I will be able to chop these

1221
01:01:39,150 --> 01:01:43,530
plants down and I will be able to

1222
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:45,809
harvest the seeds as soon as the plants

1223
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:47,280
dry up I'll pull the seeds out and then

1224
01:01:45,809 --> 01:01:49,349
I'll be able to let them dry a little

1225
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:50,910
bit and then I'll package them up and

1226
01:01:49,349 --> 01:01:53,519
I'll get them in a few of my friends

1227
01:01:50,909 --> 01:01:55,469
hands and we will see what our rise f2

1228
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:58,199
has done we'll see what comes from that

1229
01:01:55,469 --> 01:02:00,269
I've also got a grateful dog female

1230
01:01:58,199 --> 01:02:01,588
pollinated by the arize male I'm really

1231
01:02:00,269 --> 01:02:03,960
excited to see what that's gonna do

1232
01:02:01,588 --> 01:02:05,940
there's a lemon skunk pollinated by the

1233
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,559
arize and of course I did the golden

1234
01:02:05,940 --> 01:02:10,170
goat pollinated by the arise in there

1235
01:02:07,559 --> 01:02:11,969
those seeds will be done in like 15 days

1236
01:02:10,170 --> 01:02:13,650
you guys I'm really excited about it the

1237
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:15,959
seeds are getting chunky I've been

1238

1239
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:18,809
so far just to do investigation I have

1240
01:02:17,639 --> 01:02:20,429
to see what's going on and then I just

1241
01:02:18,809 --> 01:02:22,259
get a seed at a normal spot of the plant

1242
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:23,818
pull one seed out clean it up take a

1243
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:25,319

1260
01:02:54,059 --> 01:02:57,659
sweet dad rig with the Lion of Judah on

1261
01:02:55,650 --> 01:02:59,880
it I just took a fat dab kind of coffin

1262
01:02:57,659 --> 01:03:02,159
a little bit but it's a good thing what

1263
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:04,440
have I been doing on Monday night I got

1264
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:07,348
the honor to go see one of my favorite

1265
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:10,318
reggae artists the master sizzla Kalonji

1266
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:10,840
was at servantes masterpiece Ballroom in

1267
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,360
den

1268
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:15,340
that was a great show you know there was

1269
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,559
an opening act by the name of dub skin I

1270
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,300
have never I thought I had seen dub skin

1271
01:03:17,559 --> 01:03:21,489
before and didn't like them but I was

1272
01:03:19,300 --> 01:03:22,990
completely wrong you guys the band that

1273
01:03:21,489 --> 01:03:26,049
played that night that was called dub

1274
01:03:22,989 --> 01:03:27,909
skin was [ __ ] great their drummer was

1275
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:30,100
very charismatic and played very

1276
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:32,170
creative reggae beats in my opinion a

1277
01:03:30,099 --> 01:03:33,909
reggae drummer is either boring or

1278
01:03:32,170 --> 01:03:35,740
really good either

1279
01:03:33,909 --> 01:03:37,509
lock-in and he played reggae beats or

1280
01:03:35,739 --> 01:03:39,069
you kind of fill in and you do a lot of

1281
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:40,810
cool [ __ ] and he's one of those guys

1282
01:03:39,070 --> 01:03:43,390
that gets on top of it plays a lot of

1283
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:45,909
cool [ __ ] I really liked his sound I

1284
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:49,000
liked the way he played I shot at the

1285
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:52,389
dub skip they did a great set very uh

1286
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:54,039
very Colorado esque reggae is my best

1287
01:03:52,389 --> 01:03:55,809
way to describe that and of course is

1288
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,659
Luke Kalonji came on stage something

1289
01:03:55,809 --> 01:04:00,059
happened when the band switched when dub

1290
01:03:58,659 --> 01:04:02,170
skinned left and sizzla came on

1291
01:04:00,059 --> 01:04:04,509
something in the sound board happened

1292
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:06,250
and the drums sounded like [ __ ] when

1293
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:08,260
Sizzla came on and I don't know I'm not

1294
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:09,730
a sound guy but I I obviously run a

1295
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,100
podcast I've got a soundboard

1296
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:13,750
I'm a drummer I was really bummed out

1297
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:15,429
when the drums sounded like [ __ ] but I

1298
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:16,840
tried to get past it you guys tried to

1299
01:04:15,429 --> 01:04:18,099
look for the good I was seeing one of my

1300
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:20,970
favorite reggae artists he came from

1301
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:24,190
Jamaica I had to show appreciation I had

1302
01:04:20,969 --> 01:04:27,459
to get down Sizzla puts on an amazing

1303
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:29,349
show you guys that dude put on he used

1304
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:31,539
more energy in an hour and 30 minutes

1305
01:04:29,349 --> 01:04:34,029
set than most of us use it in our in our

1306
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:36,460
entire day he came out on stage and a

1307
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:38,260
long-sleeve button-up shirt I don't know

1308
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:39,909
how long his dreadlocks are but I assume

1309
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:42,310
they are quite long but he always keeps

1310
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:43,839
him tied up this dudes always got his

1311
01:04:42,309 --> 01:04:46,210
dreads and a turban on his head so he's

1312
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,400
got a turban filled with dreadlocks on

1313
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:50,260
his head and he's under the lights at

1314
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,090
the concert and he's running in place

1315
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:54,100
basically for an hour and a half and

1316
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:56,769
singing and not missing a beat while

1317
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:58,210
singing and this dude was covered in

1318
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:59,619
sweat it looks like he ran through the

1319
01:04:58,210 --> 01:05:02,019
sprinklers he was so sweaty

1320
01:04:59,619 --> 01:05:03,279
so that dude put out huge energy even

1321
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:05,259
though he was kind of frustrated with

1322
01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,420
the sound I could tell I'm a musician

1323
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:08,740
I've watched enough stage shows I've

1324
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:10,960
been involved I could tell that the

1325
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:12,459
drummer couldn't hear the monitor mix so

1326
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,409
he was falling off the beat a little bit

1327
01:05:12,460 --> 01:05:15,909
trying to listen to everything that was

1328
01:05:14,409 --> 01:05:17,980
[ __ ] up the singer and the singer was

1329
01:05:15,909 --> 01:05:19,690
getting mad and was kind of showing it a

1330
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:21,610
little bit but it was a great show you

1331

01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:42,019

1342
01:05:40,099 --> 01:05:44,089
received because I've been talking about

1343
01:05:42,019 --> 01:05:45,500
my stuff for too long let's get to it

1344
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:46,490
I'm opening up an email right now I'm

1345
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,239
unlocking the phone I've got a

1346
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:51,829
screenshot of a message I received I'll

1347
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:53,809
click clear my throat this message came

1348
01:05:51,829 --> 01:05:57,529
from a friend on Instagram he calls

1349
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:59,960
himself Terps only 710 and they said hey

1350
01:05:57,530 --> 01:06:01,850
Ross - Jeff just recently I was gifted

1351
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:03,470
some pure Terps the first time I've

1352
01:06:01,849 --> 01:06:07,219
encountered these before so I don't know

1353
01:06:03,469 --> 01:06:11,179
too much besides they taste great sorry

1354
01:06:07,219 --> 01:06:13,819
guys I'm trying so hard not to cough mic

1355
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:15,949
off here we go I get a small dab of some

1356
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:17,450
other concentrate and then drop a drip

1357
01:06:15,949 --> 01:06:20,029
of Terps on it and it comes out great

1358
01:06:17,449 --> 01:06:22,489
great and tastes amazing the thing is

1359
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:24,140
the Terps make the DAB sizzle a tiny bit

1360
01:06:22,489 --> 01:06:26,239
not like the fourth of July tan brain

1361
01:06:24,139 --> 01:06:28,460
status but definitely a small sizzle

1362
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,079
that wouldn't happen to the concentrate

1363
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:32,570
with the addict without the added Terps

1364
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:35,239
is this normal they ask and then they

1365
01:06:32,570 --> 01:06:36,080
also said any info any info would be

1366
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:38,000
great thank you

1367
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:40,190

1368
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:42,139

1369

1371
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:47,510
friends while we are if you've been

1372
01:06:46,579 --> 01:06:51,529
listening for that long

1373
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:54,740
we're friends I've been listening to

1374
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:56,240
Chris Hardwick The Nerdist I didn't fall

1375
01:06:54,739 --> 01:06:58,429
on Chris Hardwick basically since he was

1376
01:06:56,239 --> 01:06:59,809
on singled out in the early 90s and I've

1377
01:06:58,429 --> 01:07:01,639
seen Chris Hardwick spiral out of

1378
01:06:59,809 --> 01:07:03,559
control and ruin his career and then get

1379
01:07:01,639 --> 01:07:04,969
his [ __ ] back together and now Chris

1380
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:06,500
Hardwick is on top of his game and I

1381
01:07:04,969 --> 01:07:08,029
heard Chris Hardwick say several years

1382
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,460
ago that all he ever wanted to do was

1383
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:12,290
play Red Rocks and I got to see Chris

1384
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,090
Hardwick at the oddball Comedy Tour a

1385
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:16,429
couple of years ago play Red Rocks and

1386
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:18,230
it felt like I was watching one of my

1387
01:07:16,429 --> 01:07:19,609
friends reach his goals because I've

1388
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:21,110
been following him for so long and I

1389
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:22,880
listened to his podcast so I completely

1390
01:07:21,110 --> 01:07:24,800
know what you mean about us being

1391
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,329
friends and I agree if we ever meet if I

1392
01:07:24,800 --> 01:07:27,800
walk past you in an event if we're in

1393
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:29,239
the same area you better come see what's

1394
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,298
up and introduce yourself because we

1395
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:32,728
were friends now

1396
01:07:30,298 --> 01:07:34,559
all right let's get to the point uh you

1397
01:07:32,728 --> 01:07:35,879
said you've listened since episode

1398
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:37,349
number one Wow

1399
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:39,059
I'm embarrassed when I think about

1400
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:41,429
episode 1 but thank you I appreciate it

1401
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:43,769
thanks for sticking along so you asked

1402
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:45,389
about dab sizzle

1403
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:47,278
yeah that's understandable and that's

1404
01:07:45,389 --> 01:07:48,208
acceptable I think as long as it's not

1405
01:07:47,278 --> 01:07:49,438
going too crazy

1406
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:51,268
the first thing I'm gonna say is you

1407
01:07:49,438 --> 01:07:52,558
might have your nail just a little bit

1408
01:07:51,268 --> 01:07:53,818
too hot when you're dabbing you might

1409
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,349
want to let the nail cool if you're

1410
01:07:53,818 --> 01:07:56,369
using the email turn it down just a

1411
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:58,798
little bit if you're getting too much

1412
01:07:56,369 --> 01:08:00,479
sizzle but what's happening is I'm gonna

1413
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:02,518
pick up my little jar turps here what

1414
01:08:00,478 --> 01:08:04,438
these Terps talk me through this the

1415
01:08:02,518 --> 01:08:05,938
Turks are liquid at least my Terps are

1416
01:08:04,438 --> 01:08:07,438
completely liquid I'm holding them in a

1417
01:08:05,938 --> 01:08:09,928
jar I can pour them out of this little

1418
01:08:07,438 --> 01:08:12,208
vial if I wanted to they are completely

1419
01:08:09,929 --> 01:08:13,889
liquid so you're putting that liquid

1420
01:08:12,208 --> 01:08:15,629
onto your dab and also you might be

1421
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:17,939
using a little bit more than necessary

1422
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:19,920
if you're pouring it onto there and it's

1423
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:21,419
sizzling when you dab it you might be

1424
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,009
able to put about half of that and

1425
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:24,509
conserve your dad's a little bit make it

1426
01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:26,130
last twice as long and you're still

1427
01:08:24,509 --> 01:08:28,770
gonna get the flavor you're still gonna

1428
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:30,539
get everything I know how it is I'm

1429
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:32,250
excessive too I like to do big fat dads

1430
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:33,509
with way too much Terps but if it's

1431
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,289
sizzling that might be part of the thing

1432
01:08:33,509 --> 01:08:36,298
but what's happening

1433
01:08:34,289 --> 01:08:38,009
what's happening is you're just putting

1434
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:39,889
moisture on a hot nail and if you would

1435
01:08:38,009 --> 01:08:41,849
put water on a hot nail it would sizzle

1436
01:08:39,889 --> 01:08:44,159
sometimes in the summer when you get

1437
01:08:41,849 --> 01:08:45,389
sweaty and you have to manhandle your

1438
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:46,588
shatter with your fingers because

1439
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:48,239
there's no other way to pick it up or

1440
01:08:46,588 --> 01:08:49,500
whatever sometimes a DAB will sizzle

1441
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,058
from that too because it's got moisture

1442
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,099
from your fingers so all that's

1443
01:08:51,059 --> 01:08:55,739
happening is basically you're boiling

1444
01:08:53,099 --> 01:08:56,909
the turps on the hot nail so when they

1445
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:58,169
hit the nail it's just like you're

1446
01:08:56,908 --> 01:09:00,058
throwing some water in a skillet that's

1447
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:02,130

421 and he says greetings Rasta I have a

1478
01:09:58,229 --> 01:10:01,769
couple of questions for you I was hoping

1479
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,900
to hear your thoughts on question number

1480
01:10:01,770 --> 01:10:05,640
one I'm always reading and researching

1481
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:07,349
on cannabis cultivation for endless

1482
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:09,450
hours I was hoping you could list your

1483
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:11,789
top three books that you have found a

1484
01:10:09,449 --> 01:10:14,550
lot of good information from or have

1485
01:10:11,789 --> 01:10:17,550
heard good things about I really love

1486
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:18,930
this question I love going to the

1487
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:20,730
internet for answers but the problem

1488
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:22,260
with the Internet is that anybody can

1489
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:24,359
post anything and I find a lot of

1490
01:10:22,260 --> 01:10:26,699
[ __ ] posted on the internet and I

1491
01:10:24,359 --> 01:10:28,739
see people giving people advice that is

1492
01:10:26,699 --> 01:10:30,090
just going to lead to more problems and

1493
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:32,189
they're not getting to the root of the

1494
01:10:30,090 --> 01:10:33,420
evil they're like hey I've got this

1495
01:10:32,189 --> 01:10:34,979
problem and they're like well then do

1496
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:36,659
this and I'm like oh [ __ ] that's just

1497
01:10:34,979 --> 01:10:38,789
gonna make the problem you've got even

1498
01:10:36,659 --> 01:10:41,010
worse and cause three more problems down

1499
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:43,199
the line that you're not aware of so I

1500
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:45,210
try to teach new growers to avoid the

1501
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:46,800
internet a little bit because the

1502
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:49,649
Internet can be really full of [ __ ] so

1503
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:51,690
the way to go is trusted books from

1504
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:53,909
trusted authors if you want to know

1505
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:55,319
three books I would highly recommend the

1506
01:10:53,909 --> 01:10:58,800
first one I would recommend for

1507
01:10:55,319 --> 01:11:00,989
everybody is called marijuana botany an

1508
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,420
advanced study the propagation and

1509
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:06,090
breeding of distinctive cannabis I know

1510
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:08,460
that's a really long title but if you go

1511
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:11,460
to amazon.com and you search for

1512
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:14,640
marijuana botany by Robert Connell Clark

1513
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:17,399
you will find that book it's less than

1514
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,230
$20 with free shipping so that's the

1515
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:22,109
book I would start with marijuana botany

1516
01:11:19,229 --> 01:11:24,419
by Robert Connell Clark then I would go

1517
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:26,210
with another trusted classic I would go

1518
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,500
with the marijuana horticulture

1519
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:31,289
indoor/outdoor medical growers Bible

1520
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:33,779
from Jorge Cervantes Jorge is kind of

1521
01:11:31,289 --> 01:11:34,769
old-school actually both of the author's

1522
01:11:33,779 --> 01:11:35,909
I've told you about her kind of old

1523
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:37,050
school all three of the authors I'm

1524
01:11:35,909 --> 01:11:38,309
gonna tell you about are kind of old

1525
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:40,260
school they've started they started

1526
01:11:38,310 --> 01:11:41,760
growing cannabis and breeding cannabis

1527
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:43,199
probably before I was born

1528
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,060
so these guys have been doing it for a

1529
01:11:43,199 --> 01:11:47,340
long time a lot of their techniques are

1530
01:11:45,060 --> 01:11:50,010
very old and they seem a little outdated

1531
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:51,960
but this plant has been around forever

1532
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:54,180
and these guys were doing it right back

1533
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,899
then and this [ __ ] still works and it's

1534
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:56,690
like karate

1535
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:58,579
you gotta learn the basics

1536
01:11:56,689 --> 01:12:00,769
I started off as a white belt your goal

1537
01:11:58,579 --> 01:12:02,600
is to get that that crystally green belt

1538
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:04,100
so you guys started off as a white belt

1539
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,020
get these books get a good foundation

1540
01:12:04,100 --> 01:12:08,120
and then build on that from there so the

1541
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:10,340
first book again was marijuana botany by

1542
01:12:08,119 --> 01:12:11,750
Robert Connell Clark the second book is

1543
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,730

1544
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,560

1545
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:17,299
from or Hazzard vantes they keep

1546
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:20,390
updating that book I'm sure you can find

1547
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:21,739
it on Amazon for like 20 bucks the third

1548
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:23,989
book I would recommend is Edie

1549
01:12:21,738 --> 01:12:26,299
Rosenthal's marijuana growers handbook

1550

which is actually the Oaksterdam course

1551
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:31,100
guide it is the book that they use at

1552

1554
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:38,239

1555
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:41,030

1556

01:12:53,149 --> 01:12:58,039
is a great book it's an Rosenthal's

1564
01:12:55,488 --> 01:13:00,468
marijuana growers handbook and then it's

1565
01:12:58,039 --> 01:13:03,289
also known as your complete guide for

1566
01:13:00,469 --> 01:13:06,198
medical marijuana that one I'm looking

1567
01:13:03,289 --> 01:13:08,300
at it right now on Amazon for $23.99

1568
01:13:06,198 --> 01:13:09,529
with four dollars $8.99 said shipping

1569
01:13:08,300 --> 01:13:11,329
I'm sure if I shopped around a little

1570
01:13:09,529 --> 01:13:12,649
bit we could find it for cheaper those

1571
01:13:11,329 --> 01:13:14,750
are the first three books I would start

1572
01:13:12,649 --> 01:13:16,429
with then there's a book by soma that I

1573
01:13:14,750 --> 01:13:17,960
really like I do not have the book

1574
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:20,150
sitting next to me right now but it's a

1575
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,969
small thin paperback cannabis book from

1576
01:13:20,149 --> 01:13:24,738
soma then DJ sure also wrote a book by

1577
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:27,469
the same publisher that sohmas book is

1578
01:13:24,738 --> 01:13:29,988
out from then there's also a book called

1579
01:13:27,469 --> 01:13:32,300
let's grow a pound which is a very

1580
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:34,579
useful book at my opinion it's called

1581
01:13:32,300 --> 01:13:36,590
let's grow pound from Seymour buds I

1582
01:13:34,579 --> 01:13:39,050
think that book would do every grower

1583
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:41,449
some justice it goes from day one of the

1584
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:43,369
grow all the way up to harvest is a very

1585
01:13:41,448 --> 01:13:45,019
helpful guide and while I'm thinking

1586
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:47,180
about it let's throw in a book called

1587
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:48,590
secrets of the west coast masters by a

1588
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:50,510
dude named drew West that should be

1589
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:52,279
plenty of books to get you started you

1590

Wi-Fi cable reception do you know this

1607
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:25,609
to be true

1608
01:14:23,988 --> 01:14:27,500
have you heard you were alright as long

1609
01:14:25,609 --> 01:14:30,019
as they have something called an RF

1610
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:31,488
shield and then he says thanks again for

1611
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:33,530
the love on the show and keep dabbing

1612
01:14:31,488 --> 01:14:34,609
and sipping on that drink

1613
01:14:33,529 --> 01:14:36,229
that's funny cuz I said I need a little

1614
01:14:34,609 --> 01:14:37,549
sip one time I knew somebody who's gonna

1615
01:14:36,229 --> 01:14:39,289
give me [ __ ] about that thanks for

1616
01:14:37,550 --> 01:14:41,960
paying attention so let's talk about

1617
01:14:39,289 --> 01:14:44,560
digital ballasts that mess with and

1618
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:47,899
disrupt radio signals that is possible

1619
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:50,179
they do put off a frequency and if that

1620
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:51,559
frequency matches your TV or your radio

1621
01:14:50,179 --> 01:14:54,109
it could definitely cause interference

1622
01:14:51,560 --> 01:14:56,150
or be picked up by something the thing

1623
01:14:54,109 --> 01:14:59,868
is most digit most of the digital

1624
01:14:56,149 --> 01:15:02,269
ballasts available work any much higher

1625
01:14:59,868 --> 01:15:04,609
frequency than what most personal

1626
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:07,340
electronics would work at so most of

1627
01:15:04,609 --> 01:15:09,500
them are in the 200 range and most of

1628
01:15:07,340 --> 01:15:12,170
your personal appliances are in the 60

1629
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:14,270
range so you should not have any problem

1630
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:16,340
when it does happen you are usually

1631
01:15:14,270 --> 01:15:18,650
using a lot of ballasts like more than

1632
01:15:16,340 --> 01:15:20,060
15 or 20 that would take enough that

1633
01:15:18,649 --> 01:15:22,908
would be enough ballasts to disrupt some

1634
01:15:20,060 --> 01:15:24,469
signal or when you're getting imported

1635
01:15:22,908 --> 01:15:26,598
Chinese ballots that are poorly made

1636
01:15:24,469 --> 01:15:29,840
from other countries and they have a

1637
01:15:26,599 --> 01:15:32,659
lower frequency vibration and those will

1638
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,679
be more likely to cause a problem the

1639
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:35,448
thing that people are worried about is

1640
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,849
that they're putting off an RF frequency

1641
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:40,609
and that frequency is able to be picked

1642
01:15:37,849 --> 01:15:43,400
up by law enforcement so that makes a

1643
01:15:40,609 --> 01:15:45,319
lot of people paranoid most of the new

1644
01:15:43,399 --> 01:15:46,939
ballasts are made with an RF shield

1645
01:15:45,319 --> 01:15:49,789
inside of them and they're at such a

1646
01:15:46,939 --> 01:15:51,529
high frequency that it will not disrupt

1647
01:15:49,789 --> 01:15:53,599
your household appliances it will not

1648
01:15:51,529 --> 01:15:55,368
disrupt your Wi-Fi back in the day that

1649
01:15:53,599 --> 01:15:57,440
was a thing but they've kind of solved

1650
01:15:55,368 --> 01:15:59,750
that problem now so you should be cool

1651
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:00,979
an alternative to the the new digital

1652
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:02,420
ballasts you can go with your old

1653
01:16:00,979 --> 01:16:03,979
magnetic ballasts the problem with those

1654
01:16:02,420 --> 01:16:05,868
is it's hard to take good photography

1655
01:16:03,979 --> 01:16:07,578
they make your pictures look like [ __ ]

1656
01:16:05,868 --> 01:16:09,229
so that's your option you can either

1657
01:16:07,578 --> 01:16:11,118
have the digital's and you can be

1658
01:16:09,229 --> 01:16:13,218
paranoid about the RF frequency or you

1659
01:16:11,118 --> 01:16:14,899
can have those old magnetics and you can

1660
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:15,948
take shitty pictures but I really don't

1661
01:16:14,899 --> 01:16:17,539
think you have anything to worry about

1662
01:16:15,948 --> 01:16:20,689
most of the new ballasts you should be

1663
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:22,908
just fine in my opinion there's a huge

1664
01:16:20,689 --> 01:16:23,569
article on THC farmer about this if you

1665
01:16:22,908 --> 01:16:25,098
want to read a better

1666
01:16:23,569 --> 01:16:27,289
THC farmer that's where I did my

1667
01:16:25,099 --> 01:16:29,869
research a lot of those guys bicker

1668
01:16:27,289 --> 01:16:32,029
about it but from what I read I think

1669
01:16:29,868 --> 01:16:33,889
we'll all be ok with our digital

1670
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:35,090
ballasts all right did I truly

1671
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,539
appreciate your interaction and your

1672
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:36,980
emails

1673
01:16:35,539 --> 01:16:39,139
I'll keep dabbing and sipping on that

1674
01:16:36,979 --> 01:16:39,769
drink if you keep sending me good emails

1675
01:16:39,139 --> 01:16:44,359
like this

1676
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:45,770
I appreciate your message Mazhar 421 all

1677
01:16:44,359 --> 01:16:47,689
right I've got another email this one

1678
01:16:45,770 --> 01:16:49,250
comes from our friend Artie and he says

1679
01:16:47,689 --> 01:16:51,078
hey Rasta Jeff don't remember the

1680
01:16:49,250 --> 01:16:52,849
episode but you mentioned a female plant

1681
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:55,340
dying as soon as you put it in the room

1682
01:16:52,849 --> 01:16:57,889
with the girls well I had the same exact

1683
01:16:55,340 --> 01:17:00,139
thing happen except my damn killer male

1684
01:16:57,889 --> 01:17:02,389
plant shriveled up and died within 48

1685
01:17:00,139 --> 01:17:03,739
hours of entering the room any idea on

1686
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:05,900
either situation

1687
01:17:03,738 --> 01:17:09,408
thanks for the show again hope to see

1688
01:17:05,899 --> 01:17:12,500
that black cherry chem soon Artie ah so

1689
01:17:09,408 --> 01:17:15,618
a long time ago I did a breeding project

1690
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:18,679
where I had a reversed was I putting be

1691
01:17:15,618 --> 01:17:20,389
okay I had a reversed golden goat in the

1692
01:17:18,679 --> 01:17:20,899
room so I had a golden go that was a

1693
01:17:20,389 --> 01:17:23,510
female

1694
01:17:20,899 --> 01:17:25,368
I applied silver thiosulfate to it for

1695
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,170
about 14 days before I put it in the

1696
01:17:25,368 --> 01:17:29,539
flower I put it in the flower

1697
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:32,060
I continued applying silver Scio sulfate

1698
01:17:29,539 --> 01:17:35,179
to this plant this golden goat plant

1699
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:38,449
became a male that produced male pollen

1700
01:17:35,179 --> 01:17:41,420
this is how I make feminized seeds so I

1701
01:17:38,448 --> 01:17:43,039
put female plants in that room so that

1702
01:17:41,420 --> 01:17:44,539
they can receive that pollen and so that

1703
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,099
everybody so I put I time the plants

1704
01:17:44,539 --> 01:17:48,408
differently some plants go in early some

1705
01:17:46,099 --> 01:17:50,210
plants go in later for breeding so I put

1706
01:17:48,408 --> 01:17:53,359
the plants in most of the girls looked

1707
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:55,730
great I put a clone of headband in that

1708
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:58,488
room to flower it was a female and it

1709
01:17:55,729 --> 01:18:01,519
looked okay as soon as the pollen from

1710
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:04,698
that reversed golden goat plant hit that

1711
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:06,800
female headband planet that plant

1712
01:18:04,698 --> 01:18:08,569
shriveled up and died overnight and I do

1713
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,250
not know what causative because all of

1714
01:18:08,569 --> 01:18:12,049
the plants in that room got treated the

1715
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:14,569
same everything was the same the feed

1716
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:16,849
was the same the amount of water they

1717
01:18:14,569 --> 01:18:18,828
got was basically the same nobody was

1718
01:18:16,849 --> 01:18:21,440
overfed nobody was under fed nobody was

1719
01:18:18,828 --> 01:18:22,880
over or under watered everything seemed

1720
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,649
legit in there the temperature was cool

1721
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,719
there weren't bugs in there everything

1722
01:18:24,649 --> 01:18:28,279
was cooled but for some reason when the

1723
01:18:26,719 --> 01:18:30,349
pollen hit that plant the whole plant

1724
01:18:28,279 --> 01:18:31,639
[ __ ] died and I have no idea what

1725
01:18:30,349 --> 01:18:33,230
caused it I've talked to other breeders

1726
01:18:31,639 --> 01:18:34,699
about it and they all scratched their

1727
01:18:33,229 --> 01:18:35,839
heads and look at me like I'm crazy and

1728
01:18:34,698 --> 01:18:36,719
they're like I don't know something else

1729
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,069
was wrong

1730
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:40,170
and I something I don't know what

1731
01:18:38,069 --> 01:18:41,880
happened honestly so this guy said he

1732
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:43,890
had something similar happened he said

1733
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:46,590
his killer mail plant shriveled up and

1734
01:18:43,890 --> 01:18:50,730
died within 48 hours of entering the

1735
01:18:46,590 --> 01:18:52,619
room any idea on that um that's really

1736
01:18:50,729 --> 01:18:54,389
weird so you took a male plant from a

1737
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:56,279
veg room and then you put it into the

1738
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:58,440
flowering room to initiate flower and

1739
01:18:56,279 --> 01:19:01,170
within 48 hours it straight-up croaked

1740
01:18:58,439 --> 01:19:03,469
and died I do not know offhand what

1741
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:06,180
would cause that I've got a few guesses

1742
01:19:03,470 --> 01:19:09,060
first I would like to know was that

1743
01:19:06,180 --> 01:19:10,289
plant is this a soil or a hydro grow

1744
01:19:09,060 --> 01:19:13,980
that's something that I really am

1745
01:19:10,289 --> 01:19:16,800
curious about because soil is much more

1746
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:18,929
forgiving and hydro you have more option

1747
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:20,699
to damage the roots and everything

1748
01:19:18,930 --> 01:19:22,020
happens much more quickly in hydro so

1749
01:19:20,699 --> 01:19:25,949
that would explain a little bit more if

1750
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:27,990
it were hydro but my main questions did

1751
01:19:25,949 --> 01:19:29,670
it go from like a t5 light to right

1752
01:19:27,989 --> 01:19:32,069
underneath a thousand watt light cuz

1753
01:19:29,670 --> 01:19:34,350
that may have been a little bit much you

1754
01:19:32,069 --> 01:19:36,329
may have just [ __ ] microwaved at our

1755
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:37,950
barbeque - door broiled it however you

1756
01:19:36,329 --> 01:19:39,569
want to put it you may have just put

1757
01:19:37,949 --> 01:19:42,000
that little tiny plant that came from a

1758
01:19:39,569 --> 01:19:43,829
t5 or a little fluorescent if you moved

1759
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,869
it to a thousand and put a thousand too

1760
01:19:43,829 --> 01:19:47,819
close you might have roasted it you

1761
01:19:45,869 --> 01:19:49,289
might uh he might have just overpowered

1762
01:19:47,819 --> 01:19:51,989
it wasn't ready for all that you gave it

1763
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:53,340
too much energy and it died it may have

1764
01:19:51,989 --> 01:19:56,069
gotten too high may have had too little

1765
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:58,050
light also you may have gone from your

1766
01:19:56,069 --> 01:20:00,179
thousand watt in your bedroom where

1767
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:01,350
there was only that one plant you had

1768
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:03,390
all the space and then you put it near

1769
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:04,950
the room and it was not getting enough

1770
01:20:03,390 --> 01:20:06,750
light maybe that killed it maybe it was

1771
01:20:04,949 --> 01:20:08,159
overcrowded maybe you hit it between a

1772
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:11,039
bunch of girls and it didn't get enough

1773
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:14,399
air that's possible but maybe it got too

1774
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:16,050
hot maybe it got too cold maybe it got

1775
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:17,219
too wet before you carried it into the

1776
01:20:16,050 --> 01:20:18,770
flower room or when you put it in the

1777
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:20,730
flower room did you get excited and

1778
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:22,230
overwater it you're like this suckers

1779
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:25,019
gonna be a beast and the over-watering

1780
01:20:22,229 --> 01:20:27,449
or did you overfeed it or did it need

1781
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:29,070
nutrients I don't know your room if I

1782
01:20:27,449 --> 01:20:31,349
had if I could walk into your grow room

1783
01:20:29,069 --> 01:20:32,819
and look at the room and the other

1784
01:20:31,350 --> 01:20:35,340
plants that's another question I need to

1785
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:37,380
ask myself how did the other plants look

1786
01:20:35,340 --> 01:20:38,670
do you have other plants in that room do

1787
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:40,980
you have females in there that look

1788
01:20:38,670 --> 01:20:42,779
happy because if the females in the room

1789
01:20:40,979 --> 01:20:44,189
look happy then it's just this one plant

1790
01:20:42,779 --> 01:20:45,630
we got to figure out but if all the

1791
01:20:44,189 --> 01:20:48,299
plants are should be then it's the room

1792
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:49,710
we have to figure out so there are a lot

1793
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,300
of questions I wish I could walk into

1794
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:51,980
the room with

1795
01:20:50,300 --> 01:20:54,440
glance and see what's going on in there

1796
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:56,089
I wish I could just walk in take a quick

1797
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:57,558
look around the entire room look at your

1798
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:59,750
ducting look at your lighting look at

1799
01:20:57,559 --> 01:21:01,579
your source of fresh air look at how

1800
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:03,800
you're getting rid of the old air look

1801
01:21:01,578 --> 01:21:05,000
at how you're handling humidity there

1802
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,789
are a lot of things I would like to see

1803
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:09,198
in there that would help me answer this

1804
01:21:06,789 --> 01:21:11,118
unfortunately I'm not able to view your

1805
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,589
room through my brain yet in the [ __ ]

1806
01:21:11,118 --> 01:21:13,759
future that'll be so happy we can do

1807
01:21:12,590 --> 01:21:15,170
that I'll just teleport to your room

1808
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:17,659
I'll check it out right quick tell you

1809
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,889
what's going on but I can't do that so

1810
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:20,569
if you want to send me some pictures or

1811
01:21:18,889 --> 01:21:23,000
send me some follow-ups to all of the

1812
01:21:20,569 --> 01:21:24,679
stuff that I just said I will talk about

1813
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,939
it further on the show let me know

1814
01:21:24,679 --> 01:21:28,039
what's going on because it is really

1815
01:21:25,939 --> 01:21:30,618
strange that you put a plan into a room

1816
01:21:28,039 --> 01:21:32,118
and it died within 48 hours check out

1817
01:21:30,618 --> 01:21:33,649
all the things that I asked you probably

1818
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:35,179
check all that there's sound like an

1819
01:21:33,649 --> 01:21:36,679
experienced grower that was probably all

1820
01:21:35,179 --> 01:21:39,559
the stuff he went to right away but

1821
01:21:36,679 --> 01:21:40,969
check that out if it was hydro and you

1822
01:21:39,559 --> 01:21:42,469
moved it from another room to another

1823
01:21:40,969 --> 01:21:44,270
room I'm assuming there was some root

1824
01:21:42,469 --> 01:21:47,710
damage is what caused that plant to die

1825
01:21:44,270 --> 01:21:50,480
because last night I transplanted a

1826
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:54,408
medium amount of clones from an EZ

1827
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:55,939
cloner into Solo cups with soil and I

1828
01:21:54,408 --> 01:21:57,859
got kind of hasty and I was in a hurry

1829
01:21:55,939 --> 01:21:59,539
and I felt myself kind of [ __ ] up

1830
01:21:57,859 --> 01:22:00,948
when I pushed the soil down I felt it

1831
01:21:59,539 --> 01:22:02,988
press too hard and I've kind of felt the

1832
01:22:00,948 --> 01:22:04,879
roots crush today that plants all

1833
01:22:02,988 --> 01:22:07,189
drooped over it looks really pissed off

1834
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:09,139
it may pull through it may die I can

1835
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:11,738
spare that clone it's not a big deal I

1836
01:22:09,139 --> 01:22:15,529
like having a hundred percent success

1837
01:22:11,738 --> 01:22:17,750
because that [ __ ] but just a little

1838
01:22:15,529 --> 01:22:20,719
bit of root damage on a hydro plant is a

1839
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:22,158
huge difference in happiness compared to

1840
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,569
just a soil plant you can't mess up the

1841
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:25,638
roots as much on a soil plant is what

1842
01:22:23,569 --> 01:22:27,198
I'm getting at I guess the bottom line

1843
01:22:25,639 --> 01:22:28,460
is I really don't know what caused your

1844
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:30,678
plant to die I wish I had a better

1845
01:22:28,460 --> 01:22:32,929
answer for you I really hope you had a

1846
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:34,399
clone of that male plant if not you just

1847
01:22:32,929 --> 01:22:36,710
got to get some seeds and do some more

1848
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:38,179
Fino hunting when you email me back let

1849
01:22:36,710 --> 01:22:40,189
me know what strain you were working

1850
01:22:38,179 --> 01:22:42,380
with and how many seeds you went through

1851
01:22:40,189 --> 01:22:43,939
to find that bail I've got questions for

1852
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:46,940
you all so it will talk about this more

1853
01:22:43,939 --> 01:22:48,529
on a future episode all right Ari I want

1854
01:22:46,939 --> 01:22:51,348
to thank you once again for that email I

1855
01:22:48,529 --> 01:22:54,380
hope to hear back from you you guys I

1856
01:22:51,349 --> 01:22:57,020
received two emails one was about LEC

1857
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:59,179
that's light-emitting a ceramic lighting

1858
01:22:57,020 --> 01:23:01,969
of the new 315 seem to be really popular

1859
01:22:59,179 --> 01:23:03,710
the company that makes it 315 s just put

1860
01:23:01,969 --> 01:23:05,840
out a smaller version

1861
01:23:03,710 --> 01:23:07,340
lower wattage light I haven't paid too

1862
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:09,560
much attention to that I need to do some

1863
01:23:07,340 --> 01:23:12,050
research on it also I got an email about

1864
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:14,330
LED light emitting diode lighting

1865
01:23:12,050 --> 01:23:15,140
honestly you guys I've never grown with

1866
01:23:14,329 --> 01:23:17,359
an LED

1867
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:19,969
I have never drawn with an LEC I've used

1868
01:23:17,359 --> 01:23:21,679
some t fives it's thousand watt HBS's

1869
01:23:19,969 --> 01:23:24,170
and some thousand watt metal halides

1870
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:25,699
that's how I've grown I've done some

1871
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:28,940
fours and sixes but I mean I've never

1872
01:23:25,698 --> 01:23:31,428
done anything other than I intensity

1873
01:23:28,939 --> 01:23:34,309
discharge lighting so I'm going to find

1874
01:23:31,429 --> 01:23:35,539
the people that make the 315 you guys if

1875
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:37,400
you can put me in touch with the guy

1876
01:23:35,539 --> 01:23:39,500
that makes of 315 I'd love to get him on

1877
01:23:37,399 --> 01:23:40,939

1880
01:23:43,729 --> 01:23:47,928

1881
01:23:46,010 --> 01:23:50,390
would like to have somebody that

1882
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:52,279
represents manufacturers or works with

1883
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:54,440
an LED company or somebody that has

1884
01:23:52,279 --> 01:23:56,420
grown with LEDs a lot I'd like you to

1885
01:23:54,439 --> 01:23:58,309
come on the show and teach us about LEDs

1886
01:23:56,420 --> 01:24:01,130
and maybe run us through the differences

1887
01:23:58,310 --> 01:24:02,750
of LED lighting and HID lighting because

1888
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:03,440
I honestly don't have experience in that

1889
01:24:02,750 --> 01:24:04,760

by some friends let's just get right to

1988
01:29:52,619 --> 01:29:57,569
that part this one came to the Grove

1989
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:58,649
from your heart Facebook page this one I

1990
01:29:57,569 --> 01:30:00,659
don't know if she wants me to see her

1991
01:29:58,649 --> 01:30:02,099
name on the air but I am going to read

1992
01:30:00,659 --> 01:30:03,779
her message it goes like this do you

1993
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:06,150
have any opinion on trimming of machines

1994
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:07,800
we are home growers so we are looking

1995
01:30:06,149 --> 01:30:10,019
for something small like the trim inator

1996
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:12,060
mini dry trimmer or the smaller trim pal

1997
01:30:10,020 --> 01:30:14,280
but lots of folks are against trimming

1998
01:30:12,060 --> 01:30:17,670
machines so I just thought I would ask

1999
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:19,679
your expert opinion thanks for all the

2000
01:30:17,670 --> 01:30:21,180
info you share I love your show hey

2001
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:22,860
thanks for listening to the podcast I

2002
01:30:21,180 --> 01:30:24,150
appreciate when people send me messages

2003
01:30:22,859 --> 01:30:26,159
and I love it when people tell me that

2004
01:30:24,149 --> 01:30:29,069
they love the show it makes it all worth

2005
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:32,880
it big shout out I appreciate that so

2006
01:30:29,069 --> 01:30:35,309
let's talk about trim machines I there

2007
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,600
you're not gonna like my answer but

2008
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:38,850
there is not a trim machine that I like

2009
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:40,530
I really I'm a fan of hand trimmed

2010
01:30:38,850 --> 01:30:43,320
cannabis I think connoisseur grade

2011
01:30:40,529 --> 01:30:45,269
cannabis should be trimmed by hand if

2012
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:47,489
you're growing a whole bunch if you've

2013
01:30:45,270 --> 01:30:50,610
got a large outdoor I might see you

2014
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:52,109
using a trim machine but honestly I can

2015
01:30:50,609 --> 01:30:54,268
tell the difference between hand trimmed

2016
01:30:52,109 --> 01:30:56,248
and machine trimmed cannabis

2017
01:30:54,269 --> 01:30:58,380
and there's nothing like hand trim

2018
01:30:56,248 --> 01:31:00,389
cannabis why why this is my opinion why

2019
01:30:58,380 --> 01:31:02,909
grow your plants you're gonna have them

2020
01:31:00,389 --> 01:31:04,769
for what nine weeks in flower and then

2021
01:31:02,908 --> 01:31:06,420
probably four to six weeks maybe eight

2022
01:31:04,769 --> 01:31:08,039
weeks and veg maybe longer depending on

2023
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:10,949
how you do things so that's a lot of

2024
01:31:08,038 --> 01:31:12,719
weeks that's 13 weeks 14 15 16 weeks

2025
01:31:10,948 --> 01:31:14,759
you've got these plants right then

2026
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:16,859
you're gonna cut them down why not take

2027
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:18,570
the time to trim them by hand and love

2028
01:31:16,859 --> 01:31:21,748
them and I know it's tedious and it kind

2029
01:31:18,569 --> 01:31:22,590
of sucks sometimes but it's so worth it

2030
01:31:21,748 --> 01:31:25,618
in my opinion

2031
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:27,748
and then my big thing is when you use a

2032
01:31:25,618 --> 01:31:30,929
machine to trim your cannabis it turns

2033
01:31:27,748 --> 01:31:32,849
that trim into like a mulch and it just

2034
01:31:30,929 --> 01:31:34,380
makes it it cuts it at too many

2035
01:31:32,849 --> 01:31:36,599
different angles too many different

2036
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:38,400
times and it makes it it's basically a

2037
01:31:36,599 --> 01:31:39,840
mulch like when you mow the lawn and

2038
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:42,569
you've got that bag of clippings and it

2039
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,038
stinks real funky you've kind of mulched

2040
01:31:42,569 --> 01:31:45,868
up all of your cannabis leaves and

2041
01:31:44,038 --> 01:31:48,059
they're releasing too much moisture and

2042
01:31:45,868 --> 01:31:49,198
it's starting to there's a there's a

2043
01:31:48,059 --> 01:31:50,788
reaction that's happening in there

2044
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:52,229
because it's cut so many times and it's

2045
01:31:50,788 --> 01:31:54,238
stacked inside of there and you know how

2046
01:31:52,229 --> 01:31:56,549
the grass stinks real bad well your trim

2047
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:57,959
will start to do that also a lot of

2048
01:31:56,550 --> 01:32:00,809
times when you're getting shitty hash

2049
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:02,819
from the dispensary it was possibly made

2050
01:32:00,809 --> 01:32:04,590
I can't guarantee it but it was possibly

2051
01:32:02,819 --> 01:32:08,518
made by material that came from the trim

2052
01:32:04,590 --> 01:32:09,989
machine when I helped my buddy Kevin get

2053
01:32:08,519 --> 01:32:12,690
started making his little hash company I

2054
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:14,968
was a grower he was an extract guy I was

2055
01:32:12,689 --> 01:32:16,768
giving him material I used a trim

2056
01:32:14,969 --> 01:32:18,328
machine I used the kind that looks like

2057
01:32:16,769 --> 01:32:19,619
a giant salad bowl and it's got the

2058
01:32:18,328 --> 01:32:22,319
grill in the middle of it you put the

2059
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:24,420
top on it you spin it that worked it

2060
01:32:22,319 --> 01:32:26,788
trimmed the [ __ ] out of some of my but

2061
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:28,230
some of my buds are just mangled I grew

2062
01:32:26,788 --> 01:32:30,420
some cushion it was like rocks it

2063
01:32:28,229 --> 01:32:32,189
trimmed that okay I had some lemon skunk

2064
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:33,389
that had some fingery buds it just cut

2065
01:32:32,189 --> 01:32:36,359
the [ __ ] out of those they didn't like

2066
01:32:33,389 --> 01:32:39,210
that at all so one where I'm getting is

2067
01:32:36,359 --> 01:32:41,609
I gave the trim from that to my buddy

2068
01:32:39,210 --> 01:32:44,189
kevro and he ran and made hash out of it

2069
01:32:41,609 --> 01:32:45,538
and the hash was terrible and we

2070
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:47,279
couldn't figure out why and we took it

2071
01:32:45,538 --> 01:32:48,599
to Denver with us one time on a trip and

2072
01:32:47,279 --> 01:32:50,268
we showed a friend my buddy's like dude

2073
01:32:48,599 --> 01:32:52,889
did use a trim machine to make this hash

2074
01:32:50,269 --> 01:32:56,369
he called us out right away he knew and

2075
01:32:52,889 --> 01:32:59,038
so it made green shitty hash so that's

2076
01:32:56,368 --> 01:33:00,149
one major reason why I don't like a trim

2077
01:32:59,038 --> 01:33:01,529
machine I think it should be trimmed by

2078
01:33:00,149 --> 01:33:03,538
hand you can trim it by hand and then

2079
01:33:01,529 --> 01:33:05,368
you can use all of your fine trim to

2080
01:33:03,538 --> 01:33:06,960
actually make some product out of you

2081
01:33:05,368 --> 01:33:07,920
can make concentrates you can make

2082
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,929
edibles you can do it

2083
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,300
we want with it but if you use a machine

2084
01:33:09,929 --> 01:33:13,590
it's pretty much wasted and like I said

2085
01:33:12,300 --> 01:33:15,659
before if you're gonna put that much

2086
01:33:13,590 --> 01:33:17,579
time into growing it into drying and

2087
01:33:15,659 --> 01:33:19,069
curing it why not sit around the table

2088
01:33:17,579 --> 01:33:21,539
with whoever's gonna smoke it with you

2089
01:33:19,069 --> 01:33:23,670
you said we're growers I'm assuming

2090
01:33:21,539 --> 01:33:24,988
there's you and probably a spouse or a

2091
01:33:23,670 --> 01:33:27,600
partner or whatever you call it these

2092
01:33:24,988 --> 01:33:28,829
days and maybe a couple of friends maybe

2093
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,150
a roommate or something you guys should

2094
01:33:28,829 --> 01:33:32,519
all sit around the table and trim it up

2095
01:33:30,149 --> 01:33:33,960
talk have a good time experience that

2096
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,540
[ __ ] you probably have I'm sayin that's

2097
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,340
what should happen in my opinion I

2098
01:33:35,539 --> 01:33:39,659
understand it gets overwhelming there

2099
01:33:38,340 --> 01:33:40,739
are a lot of great trim machines but

2100
01:33:39,659 --> 01:33:43,079
there's not one that I can recommend

2101
01:33:40,738 --> 01:33:45,750
because I stay away from them and I hire

2102
01:33:43,079 --> 01:33:48,000
humans to trim so honestly that's my a

2103
01:33:45,750 --> 01:33:50,189
hundred percent honest guidance on trim

2104
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,289
machines if anybody out there has a trim

2105
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:54,359
machine that they think trims to the

2106
01:33:52,289 --> 01:33:57,060
quality of a hand trimmer of a person

2107
01:33:54,359 --> 01:33:58,889
send me a message send me a video I am

2108
01:33:57,060 --> 01:34:00,150
very open I want to know about these

2109
01:33:58,890 --> 01:34:01,110
things they're [ __ ] that I don't know

2110
01:34:00,149 --> 01:34:03,059
enlighten me

2111
01:34:01,109 --> 01:34:04,198
I'd like to be on the knowledge team so

2112
01:34:03,060 --> 01:34:05,910
let me know and then I can share that

2113
01:34:04,198 --> 01:34:07,109
information with the listeners let me

2114
01:34:05,909 --> 01:34:08,488
know what you think about trim machines

2115
01:34:07,109 --> 01:34:10,799
if you've got one they can compete with

2116
01:34:08,488 --> 01:34:12,750
my quality trim grow for me heart of

2117
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:16,679
hotmail.com all right that's the first

2118
01:34:12,750 --> 01:34:19,319
email let's get to another email this

2119
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:21,869
guy sent me like a multiple multi choice

2120
01:34:19,319 --> 01:34:26,130
email and it won't open but I'll make it

2121
01:34:21,869 --> 01:34:30,238
open but it won't do it hello email it's

2122
01:34:26,130 --> 01:34:32,789
broken this one just says podcast topic

2123
01:34:30,238 --> 01:34:34,649
the freedom of strains how do you feel

2124
01:34:32,789 --> 01:34:36,840
about training is it legal to ship

2125
01:34:34,649 --> 01:34:39,988
cuttings to legal states due to low THC

2126
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:42,420
content so how do I feel about trading

2127
01:34:39,988 --> 01:34:45,000
strains it's like if you've got a clone

2128
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:47,429
and I've got a clone and I want what

2129
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:50,039
you've gotten vice versa like baseball

2130
01:34:47,429 --> 01:34:52,289
cards yes I love trading strains I've

2131
01:34:50,039 --> 01:34:55,289
I've gotten some of my best strains by

2132
01:34:52,289 --> 01:34:56,519
trading stuff before it's like having a

2133
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:58,380
good baseball card you know what I mean

2134
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:00,179
that right that specific could be like

2135
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:01,980
that I'm not a baseball guy but I

2136
01:35:00,179 --> 01:35:03,449
listened enough Greg Proops to know that

2137
01:35:01,979 --> 01:35:05,369
like a Mickey Mantle card would be worth

2138
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:07,019
some [ __ ] you know if I had a sexual

2139
01:35:05,369 --> 01:35:08,789
paid baseball card I could probably

2140
01:35:07,020 --> 01:35:10,410
trade that for a bunch of other cards so

2141
01:35:08,789 --> 01:35:11,789
if I've got that one good cut like back

2142
01:35:10,409 --> 01:35:13,859
in the day if you had Girl Scout cookies

2143
01:35:11,789 --> 01:35:16,260
around here I could trade my girl scout

2144
01:35:13,859 --> 01:35:18,659
cookies forum cut for almost any cut

2145
01:35:16,260 --> 01:35:20,039
that anybody had the gorilla glue is

2146
01:35:18,659 --> 01:35:22,319
very similar

2147
01:35:20,039 --> 01:35:23,760
my grateful dog I will not let that out

2148
01:35:22,319 --> 01:35:26,009
to people people have offered me

2149
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:27,630
ridiculous trades for my mother plant of

2150
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:30,420
my grateful dog I won't let it go

2151
01:35:27,630 --> 01:35:33,989
however so yeah I totally love the

2152
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:35,730
freedom of trading strains you should

2153
01:35:33,988 --> 01:35:37,109
give strains away also there's nothing

2154
01:35:35,729 --> 01:35:38,429
wrong with that I give people clones I

2155
01:35:37,109 --> 01:35:39,988
had a friend started growing recently I

2156
01:35:38,430 --> 01:35:42,030
gave them [ __ ] tons of clones just to

2157
01:35:39,988 --> 01:35:44,579
get them started bits you should give

2158
01:35:42,029 --> 01:35:46,139
away and trade clones and seeds that

2159
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:48,329
should happen if you've got a pack of

2160
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:49,680
seeds if you've got twenty seeds and you

2161
01:35:48,329 --> 01:35:51,210
only want to run ten and your buddies

2162
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,920
got ten seeds of something else

2163
01:35:51,210 --> 01:35:55,529
trade do it get it on I think that's

2164
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:57,300
awesome so then he also said is it legal

2165
01:35:55,529 --> 01:36:00,569
to ship cuttings to legal states due to

2166
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:02,550
low THC content you know what I cannot

2167
01:36:00,569 --> 01:36:03,659
speak on shipping I do not know anything

2168
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:05,430
about shipping I don't know the

2169
01:36:03,659 --> 01:36:07,079
legalities of that I honestly avoid

2170
01:36:05,430 --> 01:36:09,170
shipping I don't like to put anything in

2171
01:36:07,079 --> 01:36:11,000
the mail

2172
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:13,819
kind of a paranoid old hippie on that

2173
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,689
part so I don't really put anything in

2174
01:36:13,819 --> 01:36:15,769
the mail unless it's absolutely

2175
01:36:14,689 --> 01:36:18,019
necessary

2176
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:20,480
so I can't speak too much on that I low

2177
01:36:18,020 --> 01:36:22,700
THC content I guess if you're shipping

2178
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:24,679
hemp plants from one legal state to

2179
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:27,229
another that's probably okay but isn't

2180
01:36:24,680 --> 01:36:28,850
the shipping system isn't that owned by

2181
01:36:27,229 --> 01:36:30,259
the government isn't that federal so

2182
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:32,120
you're probably [ __ ] up somehow I

2183
01:36:30,260 --> 01:36:35,119
would avoid that then your question

2184
01:36:32,119 --> 01:36:37,550
continues with people slash clubs buying

2185
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:39,979
and renaming genetics selling breeding

2186
01:36:37,550 --> 01:36:41,989
rights etc so let me touch on that one

2187
01:36:39,979 --> 01:36:44,929
people and clubs buying and renaming

2188
01:36:41,989 --> 01:36:47,269
genetics that sucks I really hate it

2189
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:48,950
when I give somebody a clone and they

2190
01:36:47,270 --> 01:36:50,810
grow that clone and then I know that

2191
01:36:48,949 --> 01:36:52,130
they harvested and then like a little

2192
01:36:50,810 --> 01:36:54,200
while later they've got a bag of

2193
01:36:52,130 --> 01:36:56,210
something that smells exactly like the

2194
01:36:54,199 --> 01:36:57,739
clone that I gave them tastes just like

2195
01:36:56,210 --> 01:36:59,210
it looks just like it they're calling it

2196
01:36:57,739 --> 01:37:00,710
some different [ __ ] because they want to

2197
01:36:59,210 --> 01:37:02,029
take some credit for it or they want to

2198
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:03,949
make some extra money off of it by

2199
01:37:02,029 --> 01:37:06,189
calling it something different that is

2200
01:37:03,949 --> 01:37:08,989
frustrating [ __ ] right there

2201
01:37:06,189 --> 01:37:11,689
call it what it is or the clubs will do

2202
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:14,840
it also the clubs the somebody else will

2203
01:37:11,689 --> 01:37:16,849
name something and then we have medical

2204
01:37:14,840 --> 01:37:18,860
marijuana here in Colorado and some

2205
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:20,900
people really like specific strains some

2206
01:37:18,859 --> 01:37:24,799
people really dislike other strains and

2207
01:37:20,899 --> 01:37:26,809
if you know that I'm gonna say Sour

2208
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,940
Diesel Sour Diesel works well for you

2209
01:37:26,810 --> 01:37:31,010
medicinally you want to go get Sour

2210
01:37:28,939 --> 01:37:32,809
Diesel and if somebody just named some

2211
01:37:31,010 --> 01:37:34,579
[ __ ] on the Shelf Sour Diesel and you go

2212
01:37:32,810 --> 01:37:35,900
spend your money on it and you get home

2213
01:37:34,579 --> 01:37:38,329
and you smoke in say you've got

2214
01:37:35,899 --> 01:37:39,469
Parkinson's and maybe sad this is just

2215
01:37:38,329 --> 01:37:42,590
hypothetical you've got Parkinson's

2216
01:37:39,470 --> 01:37:43,940
disease and Sour Diesel makes you quit

2217
01:37:42,590 --> 01:37:46,940
trembling so you just spent your

2218
01:37:43,939 --> 01:37:48,289
hard-earned money on this eighth or this

2219
01:37:46,939 --> 01:37:50,389
quarter of medicine and you went home

2220
01:37:48,289 --> 01:37:52,010
and you probably took all day to get

2221
01:37:50,390 --> 01:37:53,300
that bowl packs and you finally smoked

2222
01:37:52,010 --> 01:37:54,680
that [ __ ] and you thought you were

2223
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,090
gonna quit shaking but guess what some

2224
01:37:54,680 --> 01:37:57,590
ass will just mislabeled some weed

2225
01:37:56,090 --> 01:37:59,840
because it would sell if we're called

2226
01:37:57,590 --> 01:38:01,400
Sour Diesel and it's not gonna do what

2227
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:03,110
you need properly for your medicinal

2228
01:38:01,399 --> 01:38:04,729
effect and you just kind of wasted your

2229
01:38:03,109 --> 01:38:06,889
money now you're disappointed you

2230
01:38:04,729 --> 01:38:09,739
probably wasted an uber ride or it Drive

2231
01:38:06,890 --> 01:38:11,750
over to the dispensary that [ __ ] sucks

2232
01:38:09,739 --> 01:38:13,789
when people and clubs buy and rename

2233
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:15,949
genetics that's not really cool I think

2234
01:38:13,789 --> 01:38:17,869
that everything needs to be left into

2235
01:38:15,949 --> 01:38:19,939
proper name I've seen it done I try to

2236
01:38:17,869 --> 01:38:22,609
speak out against it I really dislike

2237
01:38:19,939 --> 01:38:24,829
when extract companies

2238
01:38:22,609 --> 01:38:26,689
take two different strains like right

2239
01:38:24,829 --> 01:38:28,519
now I'm not gonna call out the brand but

2240
01:38:26,689 --> 01:38:30,799
I'm gonna talk about what I've got I've

2241
01:38:28,520 --> 01:38:33,980
got some Curious George live resin in my

2242
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:35,480
hand there's I don't know of a stream

2243
01:38:33,979 --> 01:38:37,519
called Curious George but there's some

2244
01:38:35,479 --> 01:38:38,899
bananas and probably some gorilla glue

2245
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,130
or something you know what I mean so

2246
01:38:38,899 --> 01:38:41,719
they just blended those two strains

2247
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:43,760
together and called it Curious George

2248
01:38:41,719 --> 01:38:45,289
which I mean that's creative but they

2249
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,969
didn't breed that they they don't get to

2250
01:38:45,289 --> 01:38:48,439
name I guess they get to name that hash

2251
01:38:46,969 --> 01:38:50,389
blend but I think it would be better if

2252
01:38:48,439 --> 01:38:54,618
they put like what Terp X did on this

2253
01:38:50,389 --> 01:38:57,440
container Terp X printed taffy + Cascade

2254
01:38:54,618 --> 01:38:58,969
nug run shatter they didn't put an X to

2255
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:03,138
make you think it's crossed because if

2256
01:38:58,969 --> 01:39:05,118
you put taffy x cascade it makes it look

2257
01:39:03,139 --> 01:39:06,440
like it's a hybrid of that because

2258
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:09,229
that's how a breeder would do it

2259
01:39:06,439 --> 01:39:11,059
so Terp X does it taffy + cascade so I

2260
01:39:09,229 --> 01:39:13,939
know straight up what two screens are in

2261
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:15,710
this hash blend so maybe I've got a

2262
01:39:13,939 --> 01:39:17,089
friend who if she smokes too heavy of a

2263
01:39:15,710 --> 01:39:19,010
sativa she will have a panic attack

2264
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:21,529
right in front of you she might piss her

2265
01:39:19,010 --> 01:39:23,030
pants she'll cry she'll have to leave it

2266
01:39:21,529 --> 01:39:25,789
gets ridiculous if she smokes too much

2267
01:39:23,029 --> 01:39:27,590
the Teva that cascade in there that

2268
01:39:25,789 --> 01:39:29,569
would be too much for her head so she

2269
01:39:27,590 --> 01:39:31,039
knows straight up not to buy that this

2270
01:39:29,569 --> 01:39:32,210
other one it doesn't say what's in there

2271
01:39:31,039 --> 01:39:33,948
so she doesn't know if she can even

2272
01:39:32,210 --> 01:39:35,510
smoke that so she probably wouldn't even

2273
01:39:33,948 --> 01:39:38,658
waste her time buying it to tell you the

2274
01:39:35,510 --> 01:39:40,190
truth so yeah it's nice when people

2275
01:39:38,658 --> 01:39:42,559
rename stuff I think that we need to

2276
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:45,408
keep the names true I think that bud

2277
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:47,989
tenders or somebody in the dispensary I

2278
01:39:45,408 --> 01:39:49,789
think that the jars should say and let's

2279
01:39:47,988 --> 01:39:51,169
say maybe maybe maybe they have lemon

2280
01:39:49,789 --> 01:39:52,939
Jeffrey on the shelf I think it should

2281
01:39:51,170 --> 01:39:57,710
save lemon Jeffrey and then it should

2282
01:39:52,939 --> 01:39:59,658
have a lab test of THC CBD maybe CBN CBG

2283
01:39:57,710 --> 01:40:01,730
and THC a those need to be listed on

2284
01:39:59,658 --> 01:40:03,559
there and then underneath lemon Jeffrey

2285
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:05,569
it needs to tell you the genetics lemon

2286
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:07,880
skunk and golden goat it needs to let

2287
01:40:05,569 --> 01:40:09,859
you know that that's the parents I think

2288
01:40:07,880 --> 01:40:11,659
that would be really helpful and then it

2289
01:40:09,859 --> 01:40:13,880
also should have the sativa or indica or

2290
01:40:11,658 --> 01:40:15,349
hybrid marker which is a whole other

2291
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:16,880
conversation

2292
01:40:15,350 --> 01:40:18,410
because everything's pretty much a

2293
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:19,640
hybrid these days in my opinion but you

2294
01:40:18,409 --> 01:40:21,829
can have things that lean toward the

2295
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:23,900
indica in the city so that's what I

2296
01:40:21,829 --> 01:40:25,309
think about people renaming strains I

2297
01:40:23,899 --> 01:40:26,989
think it sucks I think if I give you

2298
01:40:25,310 --> 01:40:28,340
seeds or clones you better call it that

2299
01:40:26,989 --> 01:40:29,630
[ __ ] when you grow it just to keep it

2300
01:40:28,340 --> 01:40:31,730
true because what if somebody breeds

2301
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:33,140
with it then you're really [ __ ]

2302
01:40:31,729 --> 01:40:34,699
things up you're really throwing off the

2303
01:40:33,140 --> 01:40:36,230
family tree we got to keep the cannabis

2304
01:40:34,699 --> 01:40:38,659
family tree in line that's part of our

2305
01:40:36,229 --> 01:40:41,089
job myself as a breeder that's really

2306
01:40:38,659 --> 01:40:42,619
part of my job is to keep it true to

2307
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:44,810
where there's a history and a family

2308
01:40:42,619 --> 01:40:46,069
tree so we can look back when things get

2309
01:40:44,810 --> 01:40:47,390
different I don't know I just think

2310
01:40:46,069 --> 01:40:49,789
that's important I like to be kind of a

2311
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:52,130
preservationist I guess so your email

2312
01:40:49,789 --> 01:40:54,859
goes on to say more casts on genetics

2313
01:40:52,130 --> 01:40:56,810
and origins please I would like to talk

2314
01:40:54,859 --> 01:40:58,609
a lot more about genetics and origins

2315
01:40:56,810 --> 01:41:00,650
but the only things I would really feel

2316
01:40:58,609 --> 01:41:03,259
fully comfortable talking about would

2317
01:41:00,649 --> 01:41:04,429
probably be strains that I bred because

2318
01:41:03,260 --> 01:41:07,039
they're the only ones that I would know

2319
01:41:04,430 --> 01:41:08,690
the true origin of because unfortunately

2320
01:41:07,039 --> 01:41:11,479
a lot of the popular cuts there's a lot

2321
01:41:08,689 --> 01:41:14,899
of lies and misinformation and [ __ ]

2322
01:41:11,479 --> 01:41:16,729
based around the origins of those cuts

2323
01:41:14,899 --> 01:41:18,679
like we know where Gorilla Glue came

2324
01:41:16,729 --> 01:41:20,599
from because Josie Wales bred that and

2325
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:22,250
told us about it we know where golden

2326
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:24,050
goat came from because mr. tank bred

2327
01:41:22,250 --> 01:41:28,130
that and told us about it but there are

2328
01:41:24,050 --> 01:41:29,989
a lot of lies and rumors and untrue

2329
01:41:28,130 --> 01:41:33,350
stories about things like Girl Scout

2330
01:41:29,989 --> 01:41:34,550
cookies and of course the OG Kush I mean

2331
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:36,770
there are probably 20 different stories

2332
01:41:34,550 --> 01:41:38,180
about og cush that I've heard and I

2333
01:41:36,770 --> 01:41:40,550
don't want to talk about where I think

2334
01:41:38,180 --> 01:41:42,260
it came from too much because I feel

2335
01:41:40,550 --> 01:41:44,210
like I'm just diluting the true story

2336
01:41:42,260 --> 01:41:46,100
since I really wasn't there and I don't

2337
01:41:44,210 --> 01:41:48,199
know so I'd love to talk more about

2338
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:50,870
origins maybe one day I'll talk about

2339
01:41:48,199 --> 01:41:52,519
some of the strains that I created since

2340
01:41:50,869 --> 01:41:54,380
I can tell you where they came from and

2341
01:41:52,520 --> 01:41:57,920
I'm certain of those and I won't treat

2342
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:59,779
any [ __ ] stories about it so I made

2343
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,949
a note of that I will talk about that in

2344
01:41:59,779 --> 01:42:02,569
the future

2345
01:42:00,949 --> 01:42:03,979
you guys want to thank you once again

2346
01:42:02,569 --> 01:42:05,899

2347
01:42:03,979 --> 01:42:07,939
message came from a dude called that

2348
01:42:05,899 --> 01:42:09,679
heavy slim guy on Instagram big

2349
01:42:07,939 --> 01:42:11,869
shout-out to that heavy slim guy I

2350

01:42:20,060 --> 01:42:23,930
way to keep it organized it's the most

01:42:42,289 --> 01:42:45,260
from the listeners it lets me know that

2368
01:42:43,729 --> 01:42:46,369
I'm hitting my target audience it lets

2369

gives me good content so I appreciate

2372
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:54,590
that thank you guys now the start of the

2373
01:42:52,039 --> 01:42:57,220
show I did say I was going to talk about

2374
01:42:54,590 --> 01:42:59,720
the cannabis clubs in Colorado Springs

2375
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:01,490
receiving a cease and desist letter I'm

2376
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:03,829
pulling up a website now I'm pulling up

2377
01:43:01,489 --> 01:43:05,840
the Denver Post website I and this

2378
01:43:03,829 --> 01:43:06,350
article comes from the Colorado Springs

2379
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:10,130
Gazette

2380
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:11,840
they do not give an author name so we

2381
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:13,100
will get into the article I like to give

2382
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:14,510
credit but there's no one to give credit

2383
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:16,760
here besides the Denver Post and the

2384
01:43:14,510 --> 01:43:19,489
Springs Gazette so the article goes like

2385
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:21,199
this nine Colorado Springs cannabis

2386
01:43:19,489 --> 01:43:23,179
consumption clubs received cease and

2387
01:43:21,199 --> 01:43:25,309
desist letters from the City Clerk's

2388
01:43:23,180 --> 01:43:27,170
office last week in the first crack down

2389
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:30,250
under a ban on the clubs enacted by the

2390
01:43:27,170 --> 01:43:32,230
City Council on March 22nd

2391
01:43:30,250 --> 01:43:34,750
the club spring up after amendment 64

2392
01:43:32,229 --> 01:43:37,539
was passed in 2012 legalizing adult

2393
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:40,180
sales and use of recreational marijuana

2394
01:43:37,539 --> 01:43:41,979
but banning public consumption the clubs

2395
01:43:40,180 --> 01:43:44,860
gave people a place to use cannabis and

2396
01:43:41,979 --> 01:43:46,718
socialize in private Colorado Springs

2397
01:43:44,859 --> 01:43:48,759
outlawed sales of recreational marijuana

2398
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:50,890
in the city but the clubs got around the

2399
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:53,050
ban by providing pot to their patrons

2400
01:43:50,890 --> 01:43:54,910
for a reimbursement model they could

2401
01:43:53,050 --> 01:43:56,800
either trade cannabis for membership or

2402
01:43:54,909 --> 01:43:59,380
sign affidavits saying the club was

2403
01:43:56,800 --> 01:44:01,960
growing the customers legally allowed 6

2404
01:43:59,380 --> 01:44:03,069
marijuana plants for them alright now

2405
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:05,140
let me back up and talk about a couple

2406
01:44:03,069 --> 01:44:06,969
of things on here Colorado Springs

2407
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:09,520
outlawed sales of recreational marijuana

2408
01:44:06,969 --> 01:44:11,619
in the city of Colorado Springs when we

2409
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,180
did pass recreational marijuana counties

2410
01:44:11,619 --> 01:44:15,130
were allowed counties and cities were

2411
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:17,170
allowed to decide if they wanted

2412
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:19,690
recreational marijuana dispensaries in

2413
01:44:17,170 --> 01:44:22,569
their County or not and a lot of places

2414
01:44:19,689 --> 01:44:24,429
said no Denver has a lot of recreational

2415
01:44:22,569 --> 01:44:26,649
marijuana available Pueblo has

2416
01:44:24,430 --> 01:44:27,940
recreational cannabis available Colorado

2417
01:44:26,649 --> 01:44:30,039
Springs is right in the middle and they

2418
01:44:27,939 --> 01:44:31,689
banned it so the way that the city got

2419
01:44:30,039 --> 01:44:33,130
around it or the way that people got

2420
01:44:31,689 --> 01:44:34,869
around it was by opening up these

2421
01:44:33,130 --> 01:44:36,609
cannabis clubs and working on what they

2422
01:44:34,869 --> 01:44:39,279
called here the reimbursement model

2423
01:44:36,609 --> 01:44:40,869
which means you can sign a paper that

2424
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:42,909
says you remember you probably pay a

2425
01:44:40,869 --> 01:44:44,920
cover charge then you can walk into that

2426
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:46,809
club and if they've got some cannabis

2427
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:48,369
and you want to smoke it they won't sell

2428
01:44:46,810 --> 01:44:50,530
it to you they'll give it to you but

2429
01:44:48,369 --> 01:44:52,329
you've got to reimburse them for the

2430
01:44:50,529 --> 01:44:53,889
electricity that they spent and the time

2431
01:44:52,329 --> 01:44:55,569
that somebody spent trimming it and

2432
01:44:53,890 --> 01:44:57,699
whatever they feel the product is worth

2433
01:44:55,569 --> 01:45:00,159
you've got to reimburse them the way

2434
01:44:57,698 --> 01:45:02,829
that they made that legal was these

2435
01:45:00,159 --> 01:45:04,840
people would sign over their legal plant

2436
01:45:02,829 --> 01:45:07,180
count so in Colorado when you get a

2437
01:45:04,840 --> 01:45:10,869
medical marijuana card you were allowed

2438
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:12,369
six plants you can pay a larger fee or

2439
01:45:10,869 --> 01:45:13,960
you can talk to your doctor and he may

2440
01:45:12,369 --> 01:45:15,309
give you what's called an elevated plant

2441
01:45:13,960 --> 01:45:18,100
count where you can grow more plants

2442
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:20,980
they will offer up to 99 plants in some

2443
01:45:18,100 --> 01:45:22,840
cases but you'll take your medical

2444
01:45:20,979 --> 01:45:24,459
marijuana paperwork and there's a spot

2445
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:27,190
where you sign your provider and you

2446
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:29,710
will make whoever runs this a cannabis

2447
01:45:27,189 --> 01:45:33,729
club would now become your provider and

2448
01:45:29,710 --> 01:45:36,100
now that place is legally pseudo kind of

2449
01:45:33,729 --> 01:45:38,409
allowed to grow your six plants for you

2450
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:39,940
and when you go there you walk in and

2451
01:45:38,409 --> 01:45:41,738
you're already a member there they're

2452
01:45:39,939 --> 01:45:43,289
growing your plants so you're able to

2453
01:45:41,738 --> 01:45:44,849
consume products that are there

2454
01:45:43,289 --> 01:45:47,550
site this is how it was it's no longer

2455
01:45:44,850 --> 01:45:48,930
like this since they came and made these

2456
01:45:47,550 --> 01:45:50,400
new rules and sent this cease and desist

2457
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:52,680
letter but this is how it used to work

2458
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:54,809
so I'm gonna continue with the article

2459
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:56,730
it says although the city officials view

2460
01:45:54,810 --> 01:45:59,039
such actions as de facto sails the

2461
01:45:56,729 --> 01:46:00,779
practice has continued the ban passed in

2462
01:45:59,039 --> 01:46:04,439
March however says this clubs cannot

2463
01:46:00,779 --> 01:46:06,689
sell trade give distribute or allow the

2464
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:09,179
transfer of marijuana so they're

2465
01:46:06,689 --> 01:46:11,789
technically not allowed to be reimbursed

2466
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:14,550
or sell or trade cannabis in there they

2467
01:46:11,789 --> 01:46:15,869
cannot give cannabis away which is kind

2468
01:46:14,550 --> 01:46:19,770
of weird because what's a cannabis

2469
01:46:15,869 --> 01:46:21,329
social club without cannabis it doesn't

2470
01:46:19,770 --> 01:46:22,470
say that we can't consume it in there

2471
01:46:21,329 --> 01:46:24,269
right now but that was part of what they

2472
01:46:22,470 --> 01:46:26,039
part of the new rules was we couldn't

2473
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:27,510
consume in there so I'll continue the

2474
01:46:26,039 --> 01:46:30,600
article says the band gave clubs that

2475
01:46:27,510 --> 01:46:32,430
existed before September 23rd 2015 8

2476
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:34,079
years to phase out their businesses an

2477
01:46:32,430 --> 01:46:36,300
effort to help the owners protect their

2478
01:46:34,079 --> 01:46:38,220
investment but under the law every owner

2479
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:41,190
had to submit a consumption club

2480
01:46:38,220 --> 01:46:43,560
application and a $200 fee by April 29th

2481
01:46:41,189 --> 01:46:46,829
to get a one year renewable license for

2482
01:46:43,560 --> 01:46:48,810
$90 plus registration fees only five

2483
01:46:46,829 --> 01:46:51,000
clubs applied by the deadline one was

2484
01:46:48,810 --> 01:46:53,460
approved to or under consideration and

2485
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,470
two were denied the denied clubs along

2486
01:46:53,460 --> 01:46:57,420
with seven other identified clubs that

2487
01:46:55,470 --> 01:46:59,369
did not apply for licensing have been

2488
01:46:57,420 --> 01:47:03,090
ordered to closed because they are not

2489
01:46:59,369 --> 01:47:04,649
licensed as required hey guys I talked

2490
01:47:03,090 --> 01:47:06,480
about this a lot every time I talk about

2491
01:47:04,649 --> 01:47:08,699
cannabis consumption clubs we talk about

2492
01:47:06,479 --> 01:47:11,159
the canna Canyon or the dab lounge I

2493
01:47:08,699 --> 01:47:12,869
talk about this all the time when you

2494
01:47:11,159 --> 01:47:14,760
were writing legislation for your area

2495
01:47:12,869 --> 01:47:16,859
if your state or your locality is

2496
01:47:14,760 --> 01:47:18,449
inventing and writing and creating the

2497
01:47:16,859 --> 01:47:20,549
laws for medical or recreational

2498
01:47:18,449 --> 01:47:23,489
cannabis in your area or any type of

2499
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:27,029
cannabis use in your area please include

2500
01:47:23,489 --> 01:47:28,349
some type of safe smoking area you need

2501
01:47:27,029 --> 01:47:30,300
a consumption Club you need a place

2502
01:47:28,350 --> 01:47:32,400
where adults can go and congregate and

2503
01:47:30,300 --> 01:47:34,470
consume cannabis safely like adults

2504
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:36,149
there are people that come from all over

2505
01:47:34,470 --> 01:47:38,100
the world to Colorado

2506
01:47:36,149 --> 01:47:40,920
anybody 21 and over can drive to Denver

2507
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:42,870
or Pueblo and they can show an ID and if

2508
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:44,670
they've got some money they can buy some

2509
01:47:42,869 --> 01:47:47,460
cannabis now once they leave that

2510
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:48,869
dispensary there's nowhere safe for them

2511
01:47:47,460 --> 01:47:51,189
to consume that you can't smoke in your

2512
01:47:48,869 --> 01:47:53,170
car because you'll get a DUI

2513
01:47:51,189 --> 01:47:54,939
excuse me I'm coughing you can't smoke

2514
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:56,319
it at the park because that is illegal

2515
01:47:54,939 --> 01:47:58,448
you can't roll up a joint and walk down

2516
01:47:56,319 --> 01:48:00,189
the street and safely smoke in Colorado

2517
01:47:58,448 --> 01:48:02,529
that is frowned upon that's not what we

2518
01:48:00,189 --> 01:48:04,929
did here so there's no we're practically

2519
01:48:02,529 --> 01:48:05,889
or practical or safe to smoke the

2520
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:07,270
cannabis you just bought at the

2521
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:09,039
dispensary you can go to your hotel and

2522
01:48:07,270 --> 01:48:10,930
a lot of hotels make you sign a paper

2523
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:15,399
when you check in and it says that they

2524
01:48:10,930 --> 01:48:17,140
will charge you 250 to $500 for cleaning

2525
01:48:15,399 --> 01:48:18,189
your room if you smoke cannabis in there

2526
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:20,770
because they think you're gonna [ __ ]

2527
01:48:18,189 --> 01:48:23,049
that room up 250 to 500 dollars worth of

2528
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:25,270
stank you better have some good weed if

2529
01:48:23,050 --> 01:48:26,440
it cost $500 to get the smell out of

2530
01:48:25,270 --> 01:48:27,489
that hotel room so there's no more

2531
01:48:26,439 --> 01:48:29,409
practical to smoke

2532
01:48:27,488 --> 01:48:30,399
we need these consumption places you

2533
01:48:29,409 --> 01:48:32,469
guys so when you're writing this

2534
01:48:30,399 --> 01:48:33,939
legislation and writing the rules please

2535
01:48:32,469 --> 01:48:35,500
be sure to include that because that's

2536
01:48:33,939 --> 01:48:37,539
where we screwed up here in Colorado we

2537
01:48:35,500 --> 01:48:39,488
would have it pretty well pretty good if

2538
01:48:37,539 --> 01:48:41,488
we didn't know if we didn't skip that

2539
01:48:39,488 --> 01:48:43,599
part and what really sucks you guys is

2540
01:48:41,488 --> 01:48:44,769
I'm passionate about this because a

2541
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:46,660
couple of my friends own these

2542
01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:48,640
businesses but I feel for every owner

2543
01:48:46,659 --> 01:48:50,769
how are my friends that were promised

2544
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:52,600
eight years to continue doing business

2545
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:55,150
to recoup their assets or recoup their

2546
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:56,500
investments how how are they expected to

2547
01:48:55,149 --> 01:48:58,089
pay their bills now that they're not

2548
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:59,229
allowed to work on the business model

2549
01:48:58,090 --> 01:49:01,110
that they have designed and been

2550
01:48:59,229 --> 01:49:03,339
operating on they're not allowed to

2551
01:49:01,109 --> 01:49:04,359
reimburse for cannabis they're not

2552
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:05,650
allowed to give it away they're not

2553
01:49:04,359 --> 01:49:08,079
allowed to trade it there is no

2554
01:49:05,649 --> 01:49:10,479
transaction involved for cannabis which

2555
01:49:08,079 --> 01:49:12,219
honestly was a large portion of these

2556
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:14,109
people's revenue now how are they gonna

2557
01:49:12,219 --> 01:49:15,760
pay the rent as I'm recording the first

2558
01:49:14,109 --> 01:49:17,500
is creeping up on us and I know

2559
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:20,020
hopefully these businesses have more

2560
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:21,640
than one month of finances put aside but

2561
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:23,710
you never know this is the cannabis

2562
01:49:21,640 --> 01:49:25,510
industry they have to buy products they

2563
01:49:23,710 --> 01:49:27,520
have to pay vendors they have to keep

2564
01:49:25,510 --> 01:49:29,170
the lights on apparently some of them

2565
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,940
are growing products and more which cost

2566
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:32,079
money you have to pay to grow you have

2567
01:49:30,939 --> 01:49:34,479
to pay trimmers you have to pay

2568
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:35,969
electricity soil costs money everything

2569
01:49:34,479 --> 01:49:38,468
cost money when you're doing business

2570
01:49:35,969 --> 01:49:41,260
making money costs a [ __ ] ton of money

2571
01:49:38,469 --> 01:49:42,340
money is expensive how are these folks

2572
01:49:41,260 --> 01:49:44,920
how are my friends

2573
01:49:42,340 --> 01:49:46,449
how is our community gonna pay their

2574
01:49:44,920 --> 01:49:48,039
rent now that they are not allowed to

2575
01:49:46,448 --> 01:49:50,799
function under their business plan I do

2576
01:49:48,039 --> 01:49:52,420
not find it fair I hope that we can do

2577
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:54,130
something about this there wasn't I

2578
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:55,359
would rally you guys for a City Council

2579
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:57,190
meeting but it's already happened if you

2580
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:58,599
were in Colorado Springs please go to

2581
01:49:57,189 --> 01:49:59,829
the city council meetings and show

2582
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:01,600
support for the cannabis clubs are

2583
01:49:59,829 --> 01:50:03,429
something that we really need we're

2584
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:04,959
allowed to have bars on

2585
01:50:03,429 --> 01:50:07,239
the other corner where people can go and

2586
01:50:04,958 --> 01:50:09,099
drink whiskey and beer all day and get

2587
01:50:07,238 --> 01:50:10,988
[ __ ] and cause problems but we're not

2588
01:50:09,099 --> 01:50:12,909
allowed to have a place where people can

2589
01:50:10,988 --> 01:50:15,098
go consume some cannabis peacefully I

2590
01:50:12,908 --> 01:50:17,408
don't find it to be fair the Colorado

2591
01:50:15,099 --> 01:50:19,349
model says let's regulate cannabis like

2592
01:50:17,408 --> 01:50:21,819
alcohol so let's do that

2593
01:50:19,349 --> 01:50:23,078
[ __ ] if we're gonna do that how about

2594
01:50:21,819 --> 01:50:24,969
when we're at a baseball game or a

2595
01:50:23,078 --> 01:50:26,139
football game or a basketball game why

2596
01:50:24,969 --> 01:50:28,719
don't we have a medical marijuana

2597
01:50:26,139 --> 01:50:31,029
smoking section or a recreational

2598
01:50:28,719 --> 01:50:32,288
marijuana smoking section right next to

2599
01:50:31,029 --> 01:50:34,929
the smoking section if we're gonna

2600
01:50:32,288 --> 01:50:37,719
regulate like alcohol let's step up and

2601
01:50:34,929 --> 01:50:39,829
do it correctly all right guys I've been

2602
01:50:37,719 --> 01:50:41,600
renting for a long time

2603
01:50:39,829 --> 01:50:43,069
I really hope that you show some support

2604
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:44,990
for these cannabis clubs I want to give

2605
01:50:43,069 --> 01:50:46,369
a huge shout out to all of the cannabis

2606

2633
01:51:36,289 --> 01:51:40,159
was wondering if you have any favorite

2634
01:51:37,729 --> 01:51:42,259
pest management routines like products

2635
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:44,269
you use in applications and how often I

2636
01:51:42,260 --> 01:51:46,460
know having a clean grow and proper

2637
01:51:44,270 --> 01:51:48,610
environmental control play a key role in

2638
01:51:46,460 --> 01:51:51,020
keeping things healthy and happy also

2639
01:51:48,609 --> 01:51:52,969
maybe what would you do if an outbreak

2640
01:51:51,020 --> 01:51:57,140
occurs and how to stay positive and

2641
01:51:52,970 --> 01:51:59,510
overcome challenges in the CRO the first

2642
01:51:57,140 --> 01:52:01,130
part of that talking about pest

2643
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:03,530
management routines and the products

2644
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:05,720
that I use that'll be another episode I

2645
01:52:03,529 --> 01:52:07,519
am writing an episode I've got notes for

2646
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:08,510
it I've got a notebook filled with notes

2647
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:09,950
you guys a lot of people probably

2648
01:52:08,510 --> 01:52:12,050
wouldn't believe how many notes I've got

2649
01:52:09,949 --> 01:52:13,519
how many half shows I've got I've got a

2650
01:52:12,050 --> 01:52:17,600
lot of stuff prepared but I'm doing an

2651
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:19,850
episode on how to identify problems and

2652
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:22,250
how to treat for problems and how to

2653
01:52:19,850 --> 01:52:23,990
prevent problems on the list of things

2654
01:52:22,250 --> 01:52:26,090
that we're gonna talk about I've got

2655
01:52:23,989 --> 01:52:27,949
spider mites white flies fungus gnats

2656
01:52:26,090 --> 01:52:29,239
thrips so that's just the top of the

2657
01:52:27,949 --> 01:52:31,639
list we're gonna talk about how to

2658
01:52:29,239 --> 01:52:33,590
identify those on your plants well we'll

2659
01:52:31,640 --> 01:52:35,539
talk about all the pest management stuff

2660
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:40,010
but what I want to get to this part of

2661
01:52:35,539 --> 01:52:41,869
this message is how do you also maybe

2662
01:52:40,010 --> 01:52:43,970
what to do if an outbreak occurs and how

2663
01:52:41,869 --> 01:52:45,619
to stay positive and overcome challenges

2664
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:47,360
in your girl because that is super

2665
01:52:45,619 --> 01:52:48,920
important I see a lot of people have a

2666
01:52:47,359 --> 01:52:51,109
problem at the beginning of the grow

2667
01:52:48,920 --> 01:52:52,819
just not too far in and they get

2668
01:52:51,109 --> 01:52:53,389
completely frustrated and they feel

2669
01:52:52,819 --> 01:52:55,158
defeated

2670
01:52:53,389 --> 01:52:56,559
the very beginning and it feels like

2671
01:52:55,158 --> 01:52:58,638
they're fighting an uphill battle

2672
01:52:56,559 --> 01:53:01,369
cannabis is a plant that wants to

2673
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:04,159
survive cannabis is hard to kill you

2674
01:53:01,368 --> 01:53:06,828
have to almost try to kill cannabis so

2675
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:08,839
if you get a problem you have to first

2676
01:53:06,828 --> 01:53:10,549
identify the problem right that's what

2677
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:13,760
you have to do then you have to figure

2678
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:16,038
out how to solve that problem then you

2679
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:18,320
have to put that plan into action and

2680
01:53:16,038 --> 01:53:19,969
solve your problem and then your problem

2681
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:22,908
will be solved and then if you do it

2682
01:53:19,969 --> 01:53:25,578
right you have a stronger sense of pride

2683
01:53:22,908 --> 01:53:27,828
because you overcame something anybody

2684
01:53:25,578 --> 01:53:29,359
can put some plants and some soil pour

2685
01:53:27,828 --> 01:53:30,590
some nutrients and some water on them

2686
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:31,969
put it on it put them under some lights

2687
01:53:30,590 --> 01:53:34,458
and let them grow for nine or twelve

2688
01:53:31,969 --> 01:53:36,349
weeks and produce some cannabis it's

2689
01:53:34,458 --> 01:53:39,679
when you have a problem that you had to

2690
01:53:36,349 --> 01:53:41,328
overcome is when it's really it makes it

2691
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:43,309
more fun for a guy like myself I guess

2692
01:53:41,328 --> 01:53:45,590
maybe that's how I stay positive I enjoy

2693
01:53:43,309 --> 01:53:47,360
a challenge I don't like the mundane

2694
01:53:45,590 --> 01:53:49,219
boring life at all that's why I do what

2695
01:53:47,359 --> 01:53:52,848
I do that's why I live the way that I

2696
01:53:49,219 --> 01:53:54,889
live I honestly think that causing some

2697
01:53:52,849 --> 01:53:57,800
problems and screwing up makes you a

2698
01:53:54,889 --> 01:54:00,708
better grower you have to I mean you

2699
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:02,329
didn't learn how to walk until you fell

2700
01:54:00,708 --> 01:54:04,188
down a few times and then you didn't

2701
01:54:02,328 --> 01:54:05,779
learn how to run until you were good at

2702
01:54:04,189 --> 01:54:07,909
walking and then you [ __ ] up running a

2703
01:54:05,779 --> 01:54:09,618
few times and scraped up your knees like

2704
01:54:07,908 --> 01:54:11,118
so you gotta you have to kind of make

2705
01:54:09,618 --> 01:54:12,469
some mistakes and overcome them that's

2706
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:13,908
how I stay positive I know that I'm

2707
01:54:12,469 --> 01:54:15,889
learning something I know that there's

2708
01:54:13,908 --> 01:54:17,898
something gonna come out of that mistake

2709
01:54:15,889 --> 01:54:19,788
that I made so that's how I stay

2710
01:54:17,899 --> 01:54:22,429
positive and and also then you're

2711
01:54:19,788 --> 01:54:24,319
growing cannabis you can't get too upset

2712
01:54:22,429 --> 01:54:26,029
about what you did because you're

2713
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:28,569
growing cannabis if you've got a problem

2714
01:54:26,029 --> 01:54:30,978
maybe you got spider mites that happens

2715
01:54:28,569 --> 01:54:33,349
you first you have to accept it because

2716
01:54:30,979 --> 01:54:35,090
[ __ ] happens and you made a mistake

2717
01:54:33,349 --> 01:54:36,380
somewhere maybe there's a crack in the

2718
01:54:35,090 --> 01:54:37,639
wall that spider mites climb through it

2719
01:54:36,380 --> 01:54:38,809
might not even really be something you

2720
01:54:37,639 --> 01:54:41,389
could have thought about or could have

2721
01:54:38,809 --> 01:54:43,130

2738
01:55:12,198 --> 01:55:16,939
clean up the grow room and go back at it

2739
01:55:14,960 --> 01:55:19,880
harder than ever before and next time

2740
01:55:16,939 --> 01:55:21,529
when you see the very warning of spider

2741
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:22,670
mites in that room you're gonna know

2742
01:55:21,529 --> 01:55:24,019
exactly what to do

2743
01:55:22,670 --> 01:55:26,118
you're gonna identify it more quickly

2744
01:55:24,020 --> 01:55:27,619
you're just gonna be better at it I know

2745
01:55:26,118 --> 01:55:30,198
that part of me will always know that

2746
01:55:27,618 --> 01:55:32,118
I'm bigger than every bug and I can find

2747
01:55:30,198 --> 01:55:34,009
some sort of thing to destroy any insect

2748
01:55:32,118 --> 01:55:35,448
that gets into my room and I've got

2749
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:38,179
books that can show me how to get rid of

2750
01:55:35,448 --> 01:55:39,649
any sort of mold or anything so I'm just

2751
01:55:38,179 --> 01:55:41,270
confident that I can take down any

2752
01:55:39,649 --> 01:55:43,098
problem that I'm given in a grow room

2753
01:55:41,270 --> 01:55:44,869
I've had some crazy [ __ ] happen in grow

2754
01:55:43,099 --> 01:55:47,420
rooms before I've had fans fall and

2755
01:55:44,868 --> 01:55:49,609
chopped up plants and lights have come

2756
01:55:47,420 --> 01:55:50,868
undone and I've ran commercial grow so

2757
01:55:49,609 --> 01:55:55,039
there's a lot of stuff that can go wrong

2758
01:55:50,868 --> 01:55:56,299
I've had PVC pipes with oh I forgot how

2759
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:58,010
many gallons per minute this pump used

2760
01:55:56,300 --> 01:56:00,560
to push but way too many gallons water

2761
01:55:58,010 --> 01:56:04,280
this PVC pipe exploded water one

2762
01:56:00,560 --> 01:56:06,110
everywhere you just got a smile

2763
01:56:04,279 --> 01:56:07,698
you gotta put some reggae music on got

2764
01:56:06,109 --> 01:56:09,469
to turn up the headphones you got to

2765
01:56:07,698 --> 01:56:10,669
laugh maybe go take a couple dabs just

2766
01:56:09,469 --> 01:56:12,500
get in there and solve the problems just

2767
01:56:10,670 --> 01:56:14,389
like anything else in life anything else

2768
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:17,420
in life shit's gonna happen all the time

2769
01:56:14,389 --> 01:56:19,578
everyday life would be way too easy if

2770
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:21,349
[ __ ] went right all the time so I expect

2771
01:56:19,578 --> 01:56:23,929
problems in a grow room actually when I

2772
01:56:21,349 --> 01:56:25,969
ran the big grow and I was training new

2773
01:56:23,929 --> 01:56:26,960
people they would always say so what's

2774
01:56:25,969 --> 01:56:28,908
the first thing you got to do when you

2775
01:56:26,960 --> 01:56:30,500
get here and I would always say find the

2776
01:56:28,908 --> 01:56:32,118
surprise they'd be like what do you mean

2777
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:33,948
that's a big ass girl we've got a

2778
01:56:32,118 --> 01:56:36,348
hundred and something lights they got

2779
01:56:33,948 --> 01:56:39,019
like 50 fans there's a bunch of pumps

2780
01:56:36,349 --> 01:56:40,819
there's a bunch of PVC so we get to find

2781
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:42,619
what [ __ ] up overnight while we were

2782
01:56:40,819 --> 01:56:44,149
gone cuz it's been like 12 hours since

2783
01:56:42,618 --> 01:56:45,380
we've been here and so everybody just

2784
01:56:44,149 --> 01:56:47,089
laughed at first and they'd really

2785
01:56:45,380 --> 01:56:48,650
realize like oh yeah every day when we

2786
01:56:47,090 --> 01:56:50,810
get in here there's some weird [ __ ] that

2787
01:56:48,649 --> 01:56:52,250
we have to find we have to repair our

2788
01:56:50,810 --> 01:56:53,390
handle before we can even go about

02:14:33,529 --> 02:14:38,300
catch my exhale so that I could exhale

3047
02:14:35,630 --> 02:14:40,159
real slowly and just savor all of that

3048

garden cannabis creations this was a

3056
02:14:57,859 --> 02:15:02,809
caramel apple double karma edible this

3057
02:15:00,470 --> 02:15:05,210
had 200 milligrams of THC and 20

3058
02:15:02,810 --> 02:15:06,860
milligrams of CBD and in this little

3059
02:15:05,210 --> 02:15:10,220
package it's one of these uh like the

3060
02:15:06,859 --> 02:15:12,769
pop top pop it there you go on these pop

3061
02:15:10,220 --> 02:15:14,659
top containers there were two Tootsie

3062
02:15:12,770 --> 02:15:16,580
Roll size and shape products in there

3063
02:15:14,659 --> 02:15:19,579
wrapped in cellophane one of them was

3064
02:15:16,579 --> 02:15:21,350
Green it was the Apple the other one was

3065
02:15:19,579 --> 02:15:23,449
caramel colored and it was obviously the

3066
02:15:21,350 --> 02:15:25,370
caramel I took a little nibble off the

3067
02:15:23,449 --> 02:15:27,439
Apple it was [ __ ] delicious it's like

3068
02:15:25,369 --> 02:15:29,809
sour apple Jolly Ranchers

3069
02:15:27,439 --> 02:15:32,359
it tastes really good and then I nibble

3070
02:15:29,810 --> 02:15:34,610
off the caramel and it was good but not

3071
02:15:32,359 --> 02:15:36,439
my favorite kind of caramel ever it was

3072
02:15:34,609 --> 02:15:39,289
a little bit milky maybe might be the

3073
02:15:36,439 --> 02:15:40,639
description but then I pinched a little

3074
02:15:39,289 --> 02:15:42,199
of both off and threw them both in my

3075
02:15:40,640 --> 02:15:44,060
mouth though when you mix that Apple and

3076
02:15:42,199 --> 02:15:45,939
that caramel together I was [ __ ]

3077

delicious so this edible is really good

3078

200 milligrams of THC 20 milligrams of

3079
02:15:48,800 --> 02:15:53,180
CBD in a shop this probably would have

3080
02:15:51,020 --> 02:15:55,280
been a twenty dollar eighteen twenty

3081
02:15:53,180 --> 02:15:57,010

made for me there's a new thing let's

3156
02:19:21,689 --> 02:19:24,210
talk about this new thing and then we'll

3157
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:26,849
actually get to the main topic of this

3158
02:19:24,209 --> 02:19:28,529
podcast the new trend so I've been

3159
02:19:26,849 --> 02:19:31,200
talking about Turks here in Colorado a

3160
02:19:28,530 --> 02:19:33,630
whole bunch in my head I've got a half

3161
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:35,490
DRAM vial that's a small vial those

3162
02:19:33,629 --> 02:19:38,188
small vials with the screw on lid I've

3163
02:19:35,489 --> 02:19:41,728
got the shortie one ah it's some ghost

3164
02:19:38,189 --> 02:19:43,530
train Hays liquid turps my friend Tim

3165
02:19:41,728 --> 02:19:45,898
from New Mexico my friends Tim and

3166
02:19:43,530 --> 02:19:47,760
Charlie showed up from New Mexico with

3167
02:19:45,898 --> 02:19:50,039
this device that looked like a large

3168
02:19:47,760 --> 02:19:51,898
pipette it's real skinny on one end and

3169
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:54,210
it tapers and gets thicker at the other

3170
02:19:51,898 --> 02:19:56,909
end and it's got like a mouthpiece made

3171
02:19:54,209 --> 02:19:59,279
onto it and they were dunking it into

3172
02:19:56,909 --> 02:20:00,989
the Terps and then letting the excess

3173
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:04,110
drip off back into the container and

3174
02:20:00,989 --> 02:20:05,939
then without any fire you keep it tipped

3175
02:20:04,110 --> 02:20:08,280
down like you would have straw and you

3176
02:20:05,939 --> 02:20:10,350
just draw through they call it a Terp

3177
02:20:08,280 --> 02:20:12,060
straw just draw right through it with no

3178
02:20:10,350 --> 02:20:15,470
heat while it's cool you pull air

3179
02:20:12,059 --> 02:20:18,629
through it and you can taste the turps

3180
02:20:15,469 --> 02:20:20,760
incredibly strong and we were able to

3181
02:20:18,629 --> 02:20:23,938
put what I would normally dunk onto a

3182
02:20:20,760 --> 02:20:26,430
dab four people took two good draws off

3183
02:20:23,939 --> 02:20:27,989
of it before the flavor went away and I

3184
02:20:26,430 --> 02:20:29,760
don't know that I got any head change

3185
02:20:27,989 --> 02:20:32,639
cuz I was already high and we're smokin

3186
02:20:29,760 --> 02:20:34,500
rosin and stuff but it's an incredible

3187
02:20:32,639 --> 02:20:38,039
way to experience the flavor and the

3188
02:20:34,500 --> 02:20:39,689
essence of the terms without any fire or

3189
02:20:38,040 --> 02:20:42,590
without any waste I really thought it

3190
02:20:39,689 --> 02:20:44,670
was cool so I was talking about this to

3191
02:20:42,590 --> 02:20:46,439
bobo who is now learning how to blow

3192
02:20:44,670 --> 02:20:47,579

3196
02:20:50,010 --> 02:20:54,431

3197
02:20:52,110 --> 02:20:55,721

3198
02:20:54,431 --> 02:20:57,310

3199
02:20:55,720 --> 02:21:00,819

3200

it's a new product he's gonna modify it

3208
02:21:18,581 --> 02:21:22,121
perfected for me but he's making a

3209
02:21:20,530 --> 02:21:23,351
little modification that I requested but

3210

3214
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:35,069
gonna be something that will catch on

3215

3217
02:21:38,530 --> 02:21:42,730
I just had to say it slowly which is

3218
02:21:41,050 --> 02:21:44,140
funny because we'll talk about this but

3219
02:21:42,729 --> 02:21:45,189
shout it to cameron Reed glass well I'll

3220
02:21:44,140 --> 02:21:48,220
save that for another episode because

3221
02:21:45,190 --> 02:21:51,940
that's let's work on some of the main

3222
02:21:48,220 --> 02:21:55,899
topics of this podcast so let's quickly

3223
02:21:51,940 --> 02:21:57,671
go through the band names in Oregon they

3224
02:21:55,899 --> 02:22:00,880
have medical marijuana available and

3225
02:21:57,671 --> 02:22:03,101
they have recently banned some of the

3226
02:22:00,880 --> 02:22:06,421
names I've got a they legalized

3227
02:22:03,101 --> 02:22:06,421
marijuana for all adults

3228
02:22:06,870 --> 02:22:12,550
what a year to half ago and they're just

3229
02:22:10,479 --> 02:22:15,460
now getting through to implementing

3230
02:22:12,550 --> 02:22:17,081
regulations yeah they've had stores and

3231
02:22:15,460 --> 02:22:20,199
like zoning for a minute

3232
02:22:17,081 --> 02:22:22,360
and one of the new regulations is some

3233
02:22:20,200 --> 02:22:26,200
common strain names are going away in

3234
02:22:22,360 --> 02:22:27,911
the state of Oregon because the second

3235
02:22:26,200 --> 02:22:29,801
half the article is not even related to

3236
02:22:27,911 --> 02:22:31,120
anything involved in what this is they

3237
02:22:29,800 --> 02:22:33,279
just ramble on about some stuff this

3238
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:35,500
comes from The Oregonian and the

3239
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:37,661
headline says no more Girl Scout cookies

3240
02:22:35,501 --> 02:22:40,331
and other popular names on pot packaging

3241
02:22:37,661 --> 02:22:42,700
state says and this is by Noel Crombie

3242
02:22:40,331 --> 02:22:44,200
and the article goes like this popular

3243
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:45,730
names such as Girl Scout cookies in

3244
02:22:44,200 --> 02:22:47,440
Charlotte's Web won't be allowed on the

3245
02:22:45,729 --> 02:22:49,661
labeling and packaging of medical and

3246
02:22:47,440 --> 02:22:52,301
recreational marijuana in Oregon under

3247
02:22:49,661 --> 02:22:53,890
rules approved by the state Friday the

3248
02:22:52,300 --> 02:22:56,560
Oregon liquor Liquor Control Commission

3249
02:22:53,890 --> 02:22:58,511
said it had reviewed about 500 marijuana

3250
02:22:56,560 --> 02:23:00,341
strain names and identified about 20

3251
02:22:58,511 --> 02:23:02,711
that may appeal to children

3252
02:23:00,341 --> 02:23:04,450
commissioners saw the rule change after

3253
02:23:02,710 --> 02:23:05,789
hearing from members of the public who

3254
02:23:04,450 --> 02:23:07,200
objected to the

3255
02:23:05,790 --> 02:23:10,200
my old friendly names I'm gonna

3256
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:11,730
interject here um [ __ ] is a kid doing in

3257
02:23:10,200 --> 02:23:23,159
the dispensary anyway how's a kid gonna

3258
02:23:11,729 --> 02:23:31,439
see that on there Lindsay is the voice

3259
02:23:23,159 --> 02:23:33,119
of reason today people have really been

3260
02:23:31,440 --> 02:23:35,521
able to get legislators around the

3261
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:38,010
country to listen to and so when we get

3262
02:23:35,521 --> 02:23:39,720
to the Colorado rules in a minute the

3263
02:23:38,010 --> 02:23:41,909
reasons they were implemented are

3264
02:23:39,719 --> 02:23:43,679
essentially identical and I I agree we

3265
02:23:41,909 --> 02:23:48,899
need to keep cannabis products out of

3266
02:23:43,680 --> 02:23:51,630
the hands of children a medical

3267
02:23:48,899 --> 02:23:58,619
condition that they need it I just don't

3268
02:23:51,629 --> 02:24:01,709
want my kid taking my cannabis to my

3269
02:23:58,620 --> 02:24:05,510
shoe making this to school your kid and

3270
02:24:01,709 --> 02:24:05,509
your kid [ __ ] freaking out at school

3271
02:24:08,989 --> 02:24:12,610
[Music]

3272
02:24:23,120 --> 02:24:28,650
don't worry the strains themselves

3273
02:24:26,069 --> 02:24:30,479
haven't been right yeah yeah completely

3274
02:24:28,649 --> 02:24:32,279
there been some breather breeders have

3275
02:24:30,479 --> 02:24:34,079
been talking on Facebook forums and such

3276
02:24:32,280 --> 02:24:35,250
about this the article goes the rule

3277
02:24:34,079 --> 02:24:36,389
improved one day before the state

3278
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:39,271
licenses recreational marijuana

3279
02:24:36,389 --> 02:24:40,949
retailers prohibits words that refer to

3280
02:24:39,271 --> 02:24:43,560
products that are commonly associated

3281
02:24:40,950 --> 02:24:45,300
with minors or marketed by minors a

3282
02:24:43,559 --> 02:24:46,889
chairman of the Commission called the

3283
02:24:45,299 --> 02:24:48,929
new requirement a common-sense approach

3284
02:24:46,889 --> 02:24:51,329
if you walk through a toy store and you

3285
02:24:48,930 --> 02:24:52,620
can identify things that are straight

3286
02:24:51,329 --> 02:24:55,579
names those are probably inappropriate

3287
02:24:52,620 --> 02:24:57,960
he said it's also as simple as that

3288
02:24:55,579 --> 02:25:00,329
agency also won't allow streams that

3289
02:24:57,959 --> 02:25:03,599
refer to illicit drugs such as LSD and

3290
02:25:00,329 --> 02:25:05,190
blow LSD is just lemon Sour Diesel it's

3291
02:25:03,600 --> 02:25:06,989
just way easier to [ __ ] write and

3292
02:25:05,190 --> 02:25:08,970
blow is a stupid [ __ ] name for a

3293
02:25:06,989 --> 02:25:12,059
straight name so cool I'm gonna watering

3294
02:25:08,969 --> 02:25:15,510
track yeah we'll get to that list a list

and marijuana producers and processors

3303
02:25:29,209 --> 02:25:33,739
can use initials or some others

3304
02:25:31,640 --> 02:25:37,310
shorthand reference instead of the full

3305
02:25:33,739 --> 02:25:43,069
strain name okay doesn't have to get

3306
02:25:37,310 --> 02:25:45,500
renamed or anything yeah but it's pretty

3307
02:25:43,069 --> 02:25:47,390
gentle but it's also pretty silly it is

3308
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:50,271
kind of silly you can have Skywalker or

3309
02:25:47,390 --> 02:25:52,640
Jedi kook okay I don't know how they're

3310
02:25:50,271 --> 02:25:54,500
doing in Oregon but in Colorado it's

3311
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:56,449
blocked printed in black lettering

3312
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:58,250
that's how the screen name gets printed

3313
02:25:56,450 --> 02:26:00,920
on pretty much every product it leaves a

3314
02:25:58,250 --> 02:26:02,750
legal dispensary I mean it's never down

3315
02:26:00,920 --> 02:26:04,851
the front like the toys-r-us logos

3316
02:26:02,750 --> 02:26:05,719
different colors what's this you fought

3317
02:26:04,851 --> 02:26:08,950
for kids eyes

3318
02:26:05,719 --> 02:26:11,659
it's just computer printed on a

3319
02:26:08,950 --> 02:26:14,271
packaging label with a shitload other

3320
02:26:11,659 --> 02:26:16,700
information on it okay let me be the

3321
02:26:14,271 --> 02:26:21,141
voice of reason again

3322
02:26:16,700 --> 02:26:38,541
we are still able to legally buy weed in

3323
02:26:21,140 --> 02:26:41,479
the shop so is it that they in the

3324
02:26:38,540 --> 02:26:44,689
marijuana industry and community we have

3325
02:26:41,479 --> 02:26:46,909
such bigger battles to be fighting than

3326
02:26:44,690 --> 02:26:48,649
the fact that we can't use the name Girl

3327
02:26:46,909 --> 02:26:50,810
Scout cookies I'm not being mean I'm

3328
02:26:48,649 --> 02:26:53,060
just saying like to me it just feels

3329
02:26:50,810 --> 02:26:55,399
like we can all buy illegal weed like I

3330
02:26:53,060 --> 02:26:59,300
get it it's a bummer and it's a big deal

3331
02:26:55,399 --> 02:27:03,470
but at the end of the day it's not like

3332
02:26:59,300 --> 02:27:05,149
you have to rename the strain to be you

3333
02:27:03,470 --> 02:27:07,489
know something completely ridiculous

3334
02:27:05,149 --> 02:27:09,229
that that's nothing to do with cookies

3335
02:27:07,489 --> 02:27:11,690
you know what I'm saying like they're

3336
02:27:09,229 --> 02:27:13,850
not saying you can't use any cookie name

3337
02:27:11,690 --> 02:27:16,489
or any they took like 20 names out of

3338
02:27:13,851 --> 02:27:20,211
500 which in the grand scheme of things

3339
02:27:16,489 --> 02:27:34,521
is do you think Bounty Killer would make

3340
02:27:20,210 --> 02:27:37,159
this list the different ones we've care

3341
02:27:34,521 --> 02:27:39,110
I've had a shelf in front of me I've

3342
02:27:37,159 --> 02:27:46,851
been working the legal industry and I

3343
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:48,200
think about this list when I read the

3344
02:27:46,851 --> 02:27:52,271
list I was like well there's a bunch

3345
02:27:48,200 --> 02:27:52,271
missing like if this is the criteria

we're just gonna call that GSC and it

3355
02:28:22,700 --> 02:28:26,480
also says derivative strains you can't

3356
02:28:24,530 --> 02:28:28,761
use Platinum Girl Scouts or Thin Mints

3357
02:28:26,479 --> 02:28:30,020

fruit names I mean how many different

3361
02:28:41,090 --> 02:28:46,850
ones vaguely meet like an item a kid

3362
02:28:43,670 --> 02:28:48,020
might have for dessert also right sour

3363
02:28:46,850 --> 02:28:49,880
lemon sherbert

3364
02:28:48,020 --> 02:28:51,590
doctor who was taken because it's a

3365
02:28:49,879 --> 02:28:53,568
fictional character currently marketed

3366
02:28:51,590 --> 02:28:55,760
to children basically any fictional

3367
02:28:53,568 --> 02:28:57,528
character like I was when I first read

3368
02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:00,289
this I was like well some jackass made

3369
02:28:57,529 --> 02:29:03,979
an Obama crush like is that gone too

3370
02:29:00,289 --> 02:29:05,329
because kids know the president I mean

3371
02:29:03,978 --> 02:29:07,188
how far they go on with this particular

3372
02:29:05,328 --> 02:29:08,840
and that's why I have an issue with it

3373
02:29:07,189 --> 02:29:11,779
because as a regulation it's a little

3374
02:29:08,840 --> 02:29:14,299
bizarre right like you can ban cartoons

3375
02:29:11,779 --> 02:29:16,520
from the name or from the logo you can

3376
02:29:14,299 --> 02:29:18,429
do a lot of other things to make sure

3377
02:29:16,520 --> 02:29:21,229
that the products don't target children

3378
02:29:18,430 --> 02:29:22,850
but banning stuff that's gonna be like

3379
02:29:21,228 --> 02:29:23,959
just words in black print like some of

3380
02:29:22,850 --> 02:29:25,789
them makes a little bit of sense but

3381
02:29:23,959 --> 02:29:27,679
some of its it's just gonna be a

3382
02:29:25,789 --> 02:29:29,270
regulatory pain in the ass down the road

3383
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:30,800
for sure just more hoops to jump through

3384
02:29:29,270 --> 02:29:33,229
just just more bitching and complaining

3385
02:29:30,799 --> 02:29:34,129
for them to do about kids a lot of it's

3386
02:29:33,228 --> 02:29:35,929
subjective

3387
02:29:34,129 --> 02:29:39,349
yeah and that's what makes it a

3388
02:29:35,930 --> 02:29:40,939
regulatory issue in my mind any we'll

3389
02:29:39,350 --> 02:29:44,238
get to some Colorado rules here in just

3390
02:29:40,939 --> 02:29:45,859
a second it's not subjective let's jump

3391
02:29:44,238 --> 02:29:47,719
right to that then that's a good segue

3392
02:29:45,859 --> 02:29:49,699
Mike since we're like 27 minutes in

3393
02:29:47,719 --> 02:29:51,139
let's get to this about halfway through

3394
02:29:49,699 --> 02:29:53,180
the show it's a perfect time to move on

3395
02:29:51,139 --> 02:29:58,488
to my my favorite topic of the show

3396
02:29:53,180 --> 02:29:59,988
Colorado recently until the first I was

3397
02:29:58,488 --> 02:30:01,969
allowed to walk into a dispensary a

3398
02:29:59,988 --> 02:30:03,978
medical dispensary or recreational

3399
02:30:01,969 --> 02:30:06,858
dispensary and I was able to buy without

3400
02:30:03,978 --> 02:30:08,269
any special paperwork I think to the

3401
02:30:06,859 --> 02:30:10,309
best of my knowledge I was allowed to

3402
02:30:08,270 --> 02:30:11,869
buy two ounces of concentrates I mean I

3403
02:30:10,309 --> 02:30:16,939
could buy two ounces of shatters that

3404
02:30:11,869 --> 02:30:18,920
correct Lindsey says yes Mike yes in a

3405
02:30:16,939 --> 02:30:20,809
wreck shop just the one okay so in a

3406
02:30:18,920 --> 02:30:22,488
medical shop I could get my two ounces

3407
02:30:20,809 --> 02:30:24,109
I'm a medical patient and a recreational

3408
02:30:22,488 --> 02:30:26,779
shop I was allowed to buy one ounce

3409
02:30:24,109 --> 02:30:28,520
concentrate which is is it enough

3410
02:30:26,779 --> 02:30:30,289
concentrate that's that's not a lot of

3411
02:30:28,520 --> 02:30:32,779
concentrate I mean if you're me I mean

3412
02:30:30,289 --> 02:30:34,819
that there was [ __ ] two pounds of

3413
02:30:32,779 --> 02:30:39,761
[ __ ] rosin on this tables two couple

3414
02:30:34,818 --> 02:30:41,979
of days ago play announcer to is

3415
02:30:39,761 --> 02:30:43,810
substantial amount now the new rule is

3416
02:30:41,979 --> 02:30:46,149
no matter who you are no matter where

3417
02:30:43,810 --> 02:30:50,380
you're shopping 8 gram limit the

3418
02:30:46,149 --> 02:30:55,421
original I'm pretty sure that's on the

3419
02:30:50,380 --> 02:30:57,161
medical side too I'm pretty sure the

3420
02:30:55,421 --> 02:30:59,371
article that I read has misled me and

3421
02:30:57,161 --> 02:31:01,300
I'm glad you guys have corrected me um

3422
02:30:59,370 --> 02:31:03,850
recreational for a hundred percent sure

3423
02:31:01,300 --> 02:31:05,859
you can only buy 8 grams of concentrate

3424
02:31:03,851 --> 02:31:10,001
now and there are other rules for

3425
02:31:05,860 --> 02:31:11,740
edibles and think other items that are

3426
02:31:10,001 --> 02:31:15,310
sold by the milligram like edibles and

3427
02:31:11,740 --> 02:31:16,841
vape pen cartridges so if I'm not

3428
02:31:15,310 --> 02:31:20,399
mistaken I'm doing this from memory

3429
02:31:16,841 --> 02:31:20,399
everybody else is a fun out cheater

3430
02:31:21,540 --> 02:31:26,229
fact-checking like wow right now you

3431
02:31:23,501 --> 02:31:28,871
keep talking go slow uh edible and vape

3432
02:31:26,229 --> 02:31:33,911
pen limit is now 800 milligrams it used

3433
02:31:28,870 --> 02:31:37,200
to be 2800 and concentrate limits are

3434
02:31:33,911 --> 02:31:46,120
now what seven or eight eight eight

3435
02:31:37,200 --> 02:31:48,520
grams a concentrate I don't know these

3436
02:31:46,120 --> 02:31:50,680
are just recreational rules I think the

3437
02:31:48,521 --> 02:31:53,411
only thing that changed on the medical

3438
02:31:50,681 --> 02:31:59,640
side was compliance some edible

3439
02:31:53,411 --> 02:32:02,620
compliance labeling imprinting on bars

3440
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:04,240
so there are two different rule changes

3441
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:06,010
in cholera are three different rule

3442
02:32:04,240 --> 02:32:10,001
changes in Colorado one limits what

3443
02:32:06,011 --> 02:32:16,181
people can buy one limits the shape of

3444
02:32:10,001 --> 02:32:17,921
certain gummies animals period and but

3445
02:32:16,181 --> 02:32:21,360
mostly affecting gummies right now

3446
02:32:17,921 --> 02:32:24,310
market wide and then the last rule is

3447
02:32:21,360 --> 02:32:27,161
edibles in Colorado now the actual item

3448
02:32:24,310 --> 02:32:34,029
has to carry a stamp and I actually took

3449
02:32:27,161 --> 02:32:35,970
notes today post an interview with Larry

3450
02:32:34,030 --> 02:32:39,400
woke the head of the Department of

3451
02:32:35,970 --> 02:32:42,399
Colorado Health and Environment the CDP

3452
02:32:39,399 --> 02:32:45,841
AG and somebody from the top of the meed

3453
02:32:42,399 --> 02:32:45,841
the marijuana Enforcement Division

3454
02:32:46,418 --> 02:32:51,878
the edible symbols there's two

3455
02:32:50,260 --> 02:32:53,828
exceptions so like every piece of

3456
02:32:51,879 --> 02:32:56,800
chocolate has to carry a little if it's

3457
02:32:53,828 --> 02:32:59,078
recreational a yellow diamond with the

3458
02:32:56,799 --> 02:33:00,938
letters THC exclamation point in it in

3459
02:32:59,078 --> 02:33:10,809
the medical just as the M right for

3460
02:33:00,939 --> 02:33:13,238
medical oh they might have dropped the

3461
02:33:10,809 --> 02:33:14,559
color that was one of the original

3462
02:33:13,238 --> 02:33:16,748
things and people were like well how do

3463
02:33:14,559 --> 02:33:17,948
we make it yellow on a brownie without

3464
02:33:16,748 --> 02:33:19,689
frosting or somesuch

3465
02:33:17,949 --> 02:33:20,859
it took a while for some companies to

3466
02:33:19,689 --> 02:33:23,078
get this implemented I've seen one

3467
02:33:20,859 --> 02:33:24,699
company that they just made a disk out

3468
02:33:23,078 --> 02:33:27,609
of sugar so it's a hundred percent

3469
02:33:24,699 --> 02:33:28,840
edible but it has the logo on it and

3470
02:33:27,609 --> 02:33:30,068
then they've fixed it to the top of

3471
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:33,340
their product with like melted

3472
02:33:30,068 --> 02:33:36,908
marshmallow it is weird in practice but

3473
02:33:33,340 --> 02:33:39,010
it's pretty tasty but the only

3474
02:33:36,908 --> 02:33:42,788
exceptions to carrying that symbol are

3475
02:33:39,010 --> 02:33:45,039
liquids the liquids manufacturers

3476
02:33:42,789 --> 02:33:47,470
managed to get the legislature to see

3477
02:33:45,039 --> 02:33:50,890
reason and make a specific exception for

3478
02:33:47,469 --> 02:33:54,188
liquids so that you know you you can't

3479
02:33:50,889 --> 02:33:55,840
stamp a liquid and they were literally

3480
02:33:54,189 --> 02:33:57,459
tough for a while talking about making

3481
02:33:55,840 --> 02:34:01,418
it having gold style show longer

3482
02:33:57,459 --> 02:34:05,050
floaties this or somesuch

3483
02:34:01,418 --> 02:34:07,658
or only doing single serving packages of

3484
02:34:05,049 --> 02:34:09,608
liquids so it could only come in a 10

3485
02:34:07,658 --> 02:34:12,368
milligram serving recreationally which

3486
02:34:09,609 --> 02:34:15,578
would pretty much kill recreational

3487
02:34:12,369 --> 02:34:17,140
liquids but they carved out an exception

3488
02:34:15,578 --> 02:34:19,600
it can still be a hundred milligram

3489
02:34:17,139 --> 02:34:21,578
liquid container as long as the

3490
02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:24,818
measuring device is part of that

3491
02:34:21,578 --> 02:34:27,538
container um and stuff like granola now

3492
02:34:24,818 --> 02:34:29,738
has to come in single serving packages

3493
02:34:27,539 --> 02:34:31,180
anything like any edible that can't

3494
02:34:29,738 --> 02:34:33,760
carry the snap has to come in

3495
02:34:31,180 --> 02:34:36,010
individually individual serving size

3496
02:34:33,760 --> 02:34:39,219
packages with the label affixed to that

3497
02:34:36,010 --> 02:34:41,529
packaging so that you can't leave it on

3498
02:34:39,219 --> 02:34:44,889
a table and somebody come along and pick

3499
02:34:41,529 --> 02:34:48,399
it up which is a felony in its own right

3500
02:34:44,889 --> 02:34:50,918
before we came up with the label it's

3501
02:34:48,398 --> 02:34:52,599
still a felony with the label it's like

3502
02:34:50,918 --> 02:34:55,930
leaving a loaded gun on the table like

3503
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:57,110
it's it's wildly inappropriate adult

3504
02:34:55,930 --> 02:35:01,280
behavior

3505
02:34:57,110 --> 02:35:04,610
Wow yeah that's the basic edible rundown

3506
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:06,079
did you find yes the article I had to go

3507
02:35:04,610 --> 02:35:08,030
through three articles actually find the

3508
02:35:06,079 --> 02:35:10,340
truth medical marijuana will remain

3509
02:35:08,030 --> 02:35:12,590
unchanged only one article said that the

3510
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:14,600
first article that I was reading was

3511
02:35:12,590 --> 02:35:15,889
actually sponsored by a dispensaries so

3512
02:35:14,600 --> 02:35:17,479
they were trying to leave medical

3513
02:35:15,889 --> 02:35:18,799
marijuana out on purpose I think because

3514
02:35:17,479 --> 02:35:20,479
of the way that it was worded it totally

3515
02:35:18,799 --> 02:35:40,399
made it look like it was all over the

3516
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:42,680
board so I'm glad a lot of people are

3517
02:35:40,399 --> 02:35:45,409
sweating this because so far in Colorado

3518
02:35:42,680 --> 02:35:49,010
not a single licensed dispensary has

3519
02:35:45,409 --> 02:35:53,000
screwed up the purchase limit rule

3520
02:35:49,010 --> 02:35:55,819
no one's been cited or fined for selling

3521
02:35:53,000 --> 02:36:01,879
over the limit yet yeah I was only been

3522
02:35:55,819 --> 02:36:04,940
a couple days well no in Colorado no

3523
02:36:01,879 --> 02:36:06,500
shop has been cited for that and that's

3524
02:36:04,940 --> 02:36:09,890
sort of it's one of those little random

3525
02:36:06,500 --> 02:36:12,469
points of pride for a while our team our

3526
02:36:09,889 --> 02:36:14,090
teen ID checks things we were in ninety

3527
02:36:12,469 --> 02:36:16,129
nine percent which is unheard of in

3528
02:36:14,090 --> 02:36:17,569
liquor tobacco yeah and we were real

3529
02:36:16,129 --> 02:36:19,069
proud of that and then we had one bad

3530
02:36:17,569 --> 02:36:22,069
round and got knocked down to ninety two

3531
02:36:19,069 --> 02:36:24,229
just like alcohol and tobacco and that

3532
02:36:22,069 --> 02:36:27,139
hurt but they don't even check alcohol

3533
02:36:24,229 --> 02:36:29,569
tobacco um they do but it's not nearly

3534
02:36:27,139 --> 02:36:33,289
what they do with with marijuana they

3535
02:36:29,569 --> 02:36:34,940
were doing numb it was a real ID in the

3536
02:36:33,290 --> 02:36:37,460
person and the ID was wearing a hat and

3537
02:36:34,940 --> 02:36:40,489
the person checking the ID was supposed

3538
02:36:37,459 --> 02:36:42,289
to catch that that was the last ID sting

3539
02:36:40,489 --> 02:36:45,860
that I heard about performed on a

3540
02:36:42,290 --> 02:36:47,480
marijuana store that's sketchy trying to

3541
02:36:45,860 --> 02:36:49,370
[ __ ] with us I know that's checking

3542
02:36:47,479 --> 02:36:52,609
compliance to the nth degree

3543
02:36:49,370 --> 02:36:54,440
marijuana shops also face ten times the

3544
02:36:52,610 --> 02:36:57,440
fine that a tobacco or alcohol retailer

3545
02:36:54,440 --> 02:36:59,360
would of course um it's ten grand if you

3546
02:36:57,440 --> 02:37:01,159
ask so cigarettes or alcohol to somebody

3547
02:36:59,360 --> 02:37:03,290
underage is the possible fine let's

3548
02:37:01,159 --> 02:37:04,850
marijuana it's a hundred that could ruin

3549
02:37:03,290 --> 02:37:06,470
a business yeah I could just close you

3550
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:07,880
down no matter how big your dispensary

3551
02:37:06,469 --> 02:37:09,770
is a hundred thousand dollar fine cuz I

3552
02:37:07,879 --> 02:37:11,420
guess we could be careful

3553
02:37:09,771 --> 02:37:13,011
that's why one of the reasons that never

3554
02:37:11,421 --> 02:37:14,899
happen recreational shoppers can now

3555
02:37:13,011 --> 02:37:16,700
only buy eight grams yep

3556
02:37:14,899 --> 02:37:18,199
does that mean that people that come to

3557
02:37:16,700 --> 02:37:19,761
do that means the ounce Till's are gonna

3558
02:37:18,200 --> 02:37:21,801
go away at the REC shops no more cheap

3559
02:37:19,761 --> 02:37:27,681
ounce deals because you can't buy an

3560
02:37:21,800 --> 02:37:29,390
ounce because you'd see concentrate

3561
02:37:27,681 --> 02:37:31,370
deals like for twenty five hundred forty

3562
02:37:29,390 --> 02:37:34,369
pounds well and there's no end either

3563
02:37:31,370 --> 02:37:39,290
and so you can't get your your limit in

3564
02:37:34,370 --> 02:37:40,431
flour and your limit in hash it's been

3565
02:37:39,290 --> 02:37:42,080
going around this shows how the

3566
02:37:40,431 --> 02:37:43,881
breakdown is how many grams of hash

3567
02:37:42,079 --> 02:37:46,280
equals how many grams of flour how many

3568
02:37:43,880 --> 02:37:47,449
grams of milligrams of edibles equal how

3569
02:37:46,280 --> 02:37:49,190
many grams of flour I don't pay

3570
02:37:47,450 --> 02:37:51,351
attention to charters I'm not working in

3571
02:37:49,190 --> 02:37:53,721
a budtender station there was this great

3572
02:37:51,351 --> 02:37:55,489
like three month period where bud

3573
02:37:53,720 --> 02:37:58,220
tenders didn't have to do pointless math

3574
02:37:55,489 --> 02:38:00,501
in their head all day long like counting

3575
02:37:58,220 --> 02:38:02,300
to seven over and over in different

3576
02:38:00,501 --> 02:38:04,640
fractions depending on what the order

3577
02:38:02,300 --> 02:38:07,010
was or whatever we was just twenty eight

3578
02:38:04,640 --> 02:38:08,899
was the limit and it was real simple and

3579
02:38:07,011 --> 02:38:11,271
now there's this that they are we all

3580
02:38:08,899 --> 02:38:13,850
have to keep our heads it sucks just

3581
02:38:11,271 --> 02:38:15,051
more regulation to follow do you think

3582
02:38:13,851 --> 02:38:21,159
is just gonna make people go to more

3583
02:38:15,050 --> 02:38:23,539
stores people that are smurfing yeah but

3584
02:38:21,159 --> 02:38:24,829
this rule really isn't for them there

3585
02:38:23,540 --> 02:38:25,971
hasn't been a lot of that that's why

3586
02:38:24,829 --> 02:38:27,530
they just recently upped the

3587
02:38:25,970 --> 02:38:31,251
out-of-state purchase limit to announce

3588
02:38:27,530 --> 02:38:32,480
okay when this rule was originally

3589
02:38:31,251 --> 02:38:34,069
passed they were talking about out of

3590
02:38:32,479 --> 02:38:37,550
Staters can only buy one and a half

3591
02:38:34,069 --> 02:38:38,810
grams of hash I laughed the first time I

3592
02:38:37,550 --> 02:38:40,279
read it because I looked down at my case

3593
02:38:38,810 --> 02:38:43,610
and I was like everything comes in one

3594
02:38:40,280 --> 02:38:45,471
gram containers yeah you can buy one

3595
02:38:43,610 --> 02:38:46,881
gram or well we've got to talk to all

3596
02:38:45,470 --> 02:38:50,899
our distributors and see if they can do

3597
02:38:46,880 --> 02:38:52,369
I have video but they hammered it out

3598
02:38:50,899 --> 02:38:53,931
and then just recently a couple months

3599
02:38:52,370 --> 02:38:55,160
ago they up that limit someone I don't

3600
02:38:53,931 --> 02:38:57,079
think they're worried about smurfin

3601
02:38:55,159 --> 02:38:59,360
there's just so many in the legislature

3602
02:38:57,079 --> 02:39:04,370
was like wait we let people buy 28 grams

3603
02:38:59,360 --> 02:39:08,511
a hash or 208 was it 2,800 grams of

3604
02:39:04,370 --> 02:39:09,801
edibles it's 28 of the 280 of the most

3605
02:39:08,511 --> 02:39:13,370
potent edibles souls in a wreck shop

3606
02:39:09,800 --> 02:39:16,699
well has to shit-ton edibles yeah I've

3607
02:39:13,370 --> 02:39:30,461
seen people leave the spot with [ __ ]

3608
02:39:16,700 --> 02:39:32,990
bags but it happens from time to time

3609
02:39:30,460 --> 02:39:35,001
it's just one of those things and now

3610
02:39:32,989 --> 02:39:36,560
with these new limits it's just anybody

3611
02:39:35,001 --> 02:39:38,960
that's looking to do that's just gonna

3612
02:39:36,560 --> 02:39:40,789
make more stops but it's a weird set of

3613
02:39:38,960 --> 02:39:42,079
rules like you can tell it's not the

3614
02:39:40,790 --> 02:39:43,761
same group of people writing all of

3615
02:39:42,079 --> 02:39:45,261
these can I ask you a completely random

3616
02:39:43,761 --> 02:39:46,370
question that's off topic sure you guys

3617

3618
02:39:46,370 --> 02:39:49,700
plenty of experience behind the bud

3619
02:39:47,960 --> 02:39:51,979
counter and ringing people up what is

3620
02:39:49,700 --> 02:39:54,561
the largest ticket you have ever rung up

3621
02:39:51,979 --> 02:40:00,739
a single person for my largest person

3622
02:39:54,560 --> 02:40:04,671
yeah a wreck shop okay lenz do you

3623
02:40:00,739 --> 02:40:07,819
remember do you want to say it is it

3624
02:40:04,671 --> 02:40:11,200
beat Mike 1,700 and I'm pretty sure it's

3625
02:40:07,819 --> 02:40:19,520
a medical shop you can buy so much more

3626
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:22,610
do I know the purchaser that's true I

3627
02:40:19,521 --> 02:40:24,801
just work it basically am all of the

3628
02:40:22,610 --> 02:40:29,569
rules I follow other than the ID checks

3629
02:40:24,800 --> 02:40:31,159
she works in a medical shop she's gonna

3630
02:40:29,569 --> 02:40:33,671
write down a number she's gonna write it

3631
02:40:31,159 --> 02:40:36,220
down and we're gonna guess

3632
02:40:33,671 --> 02:40:48,700
she just kept typing zeros what the [ __ ]

3633
02:40:36,220 --> 02:40:58,390

3636
02:40:59,620 --> 02:41:09,189
[ __ ] tip that's weird

3637
02:41:07,960 --> 02:41:25,870
we didn't see Molly and just realize

3638
02:41:09,190 --> 02:41:27,371
that great time Mike did you get to

3639
02:41:25,870 --> 02:41:29,620
cover all of your edible stuff that you

3640
02:41:27,370 --> 02:41:31,810
wanted to talk about oh I think I hid

3641
02:41:29,620 --> 02:41:33,569
all the new rule changes we covered the

3642
02:41:31,810 --> 02:41:36,808
the purchase limit we covered that

3643
02:41:33,569 --> 02:41:36,808
[Music]

3644
02:41:37,021 --> 02:41:45,271
changing you can no longer do human

3645
02:41:41,200 --> 02:41:47,711
shapes animal shapes fruit shapes

3646
02:41:45,271 --> 02:41:49,450
anything that resembles a candy that's

3647
02:41:47,710 --> 02:41:52,930
on the show yeah or anything that's

3648
02:41:49,450 --> 02:41:56,081
identical to its non-medicated market

3649
02:41:52,931 --> 02:41:59,440
counterpart so all of your gummies are

3650
02:41:56,081 --> 02:42:00,761
now squares Oh which works out well cuz

3651
02:41:59,440 --> 02:42:04,450
it's really easy to imprint the new

3652
02:42:00,761 --> 02:42:07,479
symbol into a ruler you know what else

3653
02:42:04,450 --> 02:42:09,431
how are they handling the sodas you can

3654
02:42:07,479 --> 02:42:11,979
still do hundred milligram beverages in

3655
02:42:09,431 --> 02:42:17,621
the rec market the container has to

3656
02:42:11,979 --> 02:42:19,270
carry the new label and the dosing

3657
02:42:17,620 --> 02:42:22,149
instruments so it has to come with like

3658
02:42:19,271 --> 02:42:24,280
an equal medicine top okay so that you

3659
02:42:22,149 --> 02:42:26,470
can dose out your ten milligram dose

3660
02:42:24,280 --> 02:42:27,190
that's how they do weed shots with

3661
02:42:26,470 --> 02:42:28,720
friends

3662
02:42:27,190 --> 02:42:31,091
that's pretty little tagline when I was

3663
02:42:28,720 --> 02:42:32,890
selling those all day have you ever

3664
02:42:31,091 --> 02:42:33,851
drank like the can upon for the Keef

3665
02:42:32,890 --> 02:42:35,831
Cola oh yeah

3666
02:42:33,851 --> 02:42:39,751
do you feel like you get high more

3667
02:42:35,831 --> 02:42:39,751
quickly the liquids definitely

3668
02:42:40,851 --> 02:42:46,409
and your stomach doesn't have to break

3669
02:42:43,469 --> 02:42:48,479
down the brownie yeah right it's just

3670
02:42:46,409 --> 02:42:49,771
absorbable quicker it's like you drink

3671
02:42:48,479 --> 02:42:50,909
it and then you go to do whatever you're

3672
02:42:49,771 --> 02:42:54,210
doing and then you turn your head to one

3673
02:42:50,909 --> 02:42:57,389
way to look at something you go oh hi

3674
02:42:54,209 --> 02:42:59,969
with can a punch check the label there's

3675
02:42:57,389 --> 02:43:06,149
a range of THC in the can of punches I

3676
02:42:59,969 --> 02:43:11,189
do 200 the back of the label it might be

3677
02:43:06,149 --> 02:43:13,680
like to 30 in the rack market there's

3678
02:43:11,190 --> 02:43:22,170
like it's a 10 15 20 milligrams swing

3679
02:43:13,680 --> 02:43:28,229
that you can see on the back I was

3680
02:43:22,170 --> 02:43:32,310
really pumped to see that and I love to

3681
02:43:28,229 --> 02:43:34,260
see totally random everything will be

3682
02:43:32,310 --> 02:43:36,719
lab tested go ahead we had a customer

3683
02:43:34,260 --> 02:43:39,180
appreciation day at the shop and I -

3684
02:43:36,719 --> 02:43:41,069
Keith Cole a hundred milligram orange

3685
02:43:39,180 --> 02:43:53,819
soda before it not thinking like

3686
02:43:41,069 --> 02:43:55,920
anything of it a couple days before that

3687
02:43:53,819 --> 02:43:57,779
about how like drinks are sublingually

3688
02:43:55,920 --> 02:44:00,149
and they like hit you harder and I was

3689
02:43:57,780 --> 02:44:01,530
like wow you're an idiot Lindsey you

3690
02:44:00,149 --> 02:44:06,199
just chug that thing right before you

3691
02:44:01,530 --> 02:44:06,200
came in not even like didn't taste that

3692
02:44:06,229 --> 02:44:11,279
we got a bunch of 10 milligram samples

3693
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:13,889
at one point and I took the four flavour

3694
02:44:11,280 --> 02:44:15,239
samples we got home and without thinking

3695
02:44:13,889 --> 02:44:17,279
about it drank all four of them and

3696
02:44:15,239 --> 02:44:23,430
liked it jot it down a little flavor

3697
02:44:17,280 --> 02:44:27,420
review about each one and edible ruin to

3698
02:44:23,430 --> 02:44:29,489
an extent I think about 250 milligrams

3699
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:30,989
right now is just about perfect for me I

3700
02:44:29,489 --> 02:44:32,039
don't want to go too much farm pass

3701
02:44:30,989 --> 02:44:33,299
there because that's when I started

3702
02:44:32,040 --> 02:44:36,030
getting a little goofy story getting a

3703
02:44:33,299 --> 02:44:38,009
little hazy but I'm back on the edible

3704
02:44:36,030 --> 02:44:40,820
horse so when I see you I will not it

3705
02:44:38,010 --> 02:44:40,819

can get him to drive he lives about 130

3753
02:48:24,600 --> 02:48:28,110

3756
02:48:29,579 --> 02:48:33,478
do a quick episode about LED lighting

3757
02:48:31,319 --> 02:48:38,189
also I'm trying to get in touch with the

3758
02:48:33,478 --> 02:48:39,779
guy that makes the 315 s I think I

3759
02:48:38,189 --> 02:48:41,550
commented on one of his Facebook post he

3760
02:48:39,780 --> 02:48:43,380
did not reply I'm not even sure it's the

3761
02:48:41,549 --> 02:48:45,449
right dude so I'm gonna get in touch

3762
02:48:43,379 --> 02:48:47,399
with the dude that makes in 315 the Le

3763
02:48:45,450 --> 02:48:48,720
sees the white emitting ceramics we'll

3764
02:48:47,399 --> 02:48:50,208
get that guy on the podcast we'll talk

3765
02:48:48,719 --> 02:48:52,398
about those in the

3766
02:48:50,209 --> 02:48:54,709
also check this out you guys have asked

3767
02:48:52,398 --> 02:48:56,579
for an episode about cannabis and

3768
02:48:54,709 --> 02:48:59,070
pregnancy

3769
02:48:56,579 --> 02:49:01,649
I have done a lot of research there is

3770
02:48:59,069 --> 02:49:03,149
so much stuff out there I honestly am

3771
02:49:01,649 --> 02:49:05,039
not qualified to do an episode about

3772
02:49:03,149 --> 02:49:08,369
cannabis and pregnancy I'm not a doctor

3773
02:49:05,040 --> 02:49:09,750
I I'm not a woman and those are two

3774
02:49:08,370 --> 02:49:11,130
things that I feel like I should be at

3775
02:49:09,750 --> 02:49:14,909
least one of to do an episode about

3776
02:49:11,129 --> 02:49:18,060
pregnancy if you are either a doctor or

3777
02:49:14,909 --> 02:49:19,771
a woman or a woman doctor or if you've

3778
02:49:18,060 --> 02:49:20,879
got experience with cannabis and

3779
02:49:19,771 --> 02:49:21,930
pregnancy and you know more than I do

3780
02:49:20,879 --> 02:49:23,969
and you're more comfortable with the

3781
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:26,550
subject I'd love to get you on we could

3782
02:49:23,969 --> 02:49:28,139
talk all about it I do only thing I

3783
02:49:26,549 --> 02:49:29,939
could throw it on that topic is the

3784
02:49:28,139 --> 02:49:31,619
relevant laws you might be breaking and

3785
02:49:29,940 --> 02:49:35,399
look repercussions you might face

3786
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:38,970
legally and how that system works in

3787
02:49:35,399 --> 02:49:41,069
places like Colorado because I will know

3788
02:49:38,969 --> 02:49:43,049
I used to read this all the time and in

3789
02:49:41,069 --> 02:49:45,600
patients charts when I work with locked

3790
02:49:43,049 --> 02:49:46,979
up teens um so it's something that's

3791
02:49:45,600 --> 02:49:49,890
gonna follow your kid around for that

3792
02:49:46,979 --> 02:49:52,229
life oh man so um if the hospital

3793
02:49:49,889 --> 02:49:54,689
chooses to drug test you or your baby

3794
02:49:52,229 --> 02:49:57,359
during the delivery and if you've got

3795
02:49:54,690 --> 02:49:59,340
dreadlocks or if you look like me as

3796
02:49:57,360 --> 02:50:01,739
soon as it comes out for the most part

3797
02:49:59,340 --> 02:50:04,049
the system works it's just if anybody

3798
02:50:01,739 --> 02:50:07,680
involved in the birthing process like

3799
02:50:04,049 --> 02:50:09,859
that whole hospital stay decide so yeah

3800
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:13,021
let's drug test that mom and that baby

3801
02:50:09,860 --> 02:50:16,500
then it happens and it's just if anybody

3802
02:50:13,021 --> 02:50:19,260
happens to make that decision the local

3803
02:50:16,500 --> 02:50:21,420
anti pop group down here they're working

3804
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:23,399
with one of the hospitals and one

3805
02:50:21,420 --> 02:50:24,719
they've got one month worth of data and

3806
02:50:23,399 --> 02:50:28,319
they're like half the babies we tested

3807
02:50:24,719 --> 02:50:30,599
came back positive for THC and that's

3808
02:50:28,319 --> 02:50:32,579
the end of their statement if you dig a

3809
02:50:30,600 --> 02:50:34,079
little deeper ten babies were tested

3810
02:50:32,579 --> 02:50:36,271
during that period five of them came

3811
02:50:34,079 --> 02:50:40,530
back positive for THC doesn't tell you

3812
02:50:36,271 --> 02:50:41,730
what was up with the other five but it's

3813
02:50:40,530 --> 02:50:43,620
part of the National legalization

3814
02:50:41,729 --> 02:50:45,629
conversation like it could be a cool

3815
02:50:43,620 --> 02:50:48,690
episode we find the right people yeah

3816
02:50:45,629 --> 02:50:50,729
I don't have it's not my wheelhouse I

3817
02:50:48,690 --> 02:50:52,530
guess you know I literally just had to

3818
02:50:50,729 --> 02:50:53,909
look up all of these laws because like I

3819
02:50:52,530 --> 02:50:56,430
worked in the league or work in the

3820
02:50:53,909 --> 02:50:59,190
legal industry and had a kid while I did

3821
02:50:56,430 --> 02:51:00,720
that right what do you do both of you

3822
02:50:59,190 --> 02:51:02,100
have been boat owners Mike I don't know

3823
02:51:00,719 --> 02:51:03,810
if we should or no longer a budtender

3824
02:51:02,100 --> 02:51:05,430
you worry but tender Lindsay is about

3825
02:51:03,810 --> 02:51:06,719
tender what do you do if a pregnant

3826
02:51:05,430 --> 02:51:09,989
customer comes in and tries to buy

3827
02:51:06,719 --> 02:51:14,100
cannabis um it's perfectly legal to

3828
02:51:09,989 --> 02:51:16,170
purchase it because you it was like what

3829
02:51:14,101 --> 02:51:17,391
happened with us is the I don't are we

3830
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:19,260
gonna do this for this show

3831

there's just something you brought up

3832
02:51:19,260 --> 02:51:35,220
random way and all of a sudden this is

3833
02:51:20,489 --> 02:51:38,069
like a two-hour show now they serve turn

3834
02:51:35,220 --> 02:51:39,539
no issues when my wife was pregnant she

3835
02:51:38,069 --> 02:51:41,010
stopped at the gas station a couple of

3836
02:51:39,540 --> 02:51:42,630
times and bought me cigarettes like the

3837
02:51:41,010 --> 02:51:46,170
second time she's like if I could do

3838
02:51:42,629 --> 02:51:47,520

3839
02:51:46,170 --> 02:51:49,069
attention it's just something she's done

3840
02:51:47,521 --> 02:51:55,829
for forever

3841
02:51:49,069 --> 02:51:58,470
I was like there's a whole bunch of

3842
02:51:55,829 --> 02:52:00,181
stuff the doctor tells you you shouldn't

3843
02:51:58,470 --> 02:52:01,229
consumer do while you're pregnant in

3844
02:52:00,181 --> 02:52:04,230
it's all legal

3845
02:52:01,229 --> 02:52:07,140
well not all is like heroin and coke and

3846
02:52:04,229 --> 02:52:14,000
sugar on that one but like 99 percent of

3847
02:52:07,140 --> 02:52:14,000
its legal and it's just not advice so

3848
02:52:15,409 --> 02:52:19,771
please you know or even have more

3849
02:52:18,450 --> 02:52:21,181
education on it than I do and you're

3850
02:52:19,771 --> 02:52:21,450
more comfortable talking about it than I

3851
02:52:21,181 --> 02:52:24,181
am

3852
02:52:21,450 --> 02:52:26,159
I feel like that's more of a woman's

3853
02:52:24,181 --> 02:52:27,690
topic and I should have a woman involved

3854
02:52:26,159 --> 02:52:29,069
in this to help me through this so that

3855
02:52:27,690 --> 02:52:32,760
I don't sound like a sexist dude that's

3856
02:52:29,069 --> 02:52:34,440
uneducated so let's get a doctor or or a

3857
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:35,880
lady to come help me out this one I

3858
02:52:34,440 --> 02:52:36,899
would love to do this episode I'd love

3859
02:52:35,879 --> 02:52:38,759
to do it a lot of people have questions

3860
02:52:36,899 --> 02:52:40,020

3861
02:52:38,760 --> 02:52:41,940
emails on this probably three to five

3862
02:52:40,021 --> 02:52:43,500

3863
