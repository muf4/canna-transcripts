10
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:25,379
by letting you know what I'm smoking I

11
00:00:22,739 --> 00:00:27,179
just finished the last dab of the orange

12
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:29,038
skittles ambrosia that left a nice

13
00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:31,259
orange flavor in my mouth gave me a nice

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,210
head buzz I followed that up with the

15
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,340
last dab of the bubble Jack

16
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,140
full-spectrum extract from Fuego

17
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,600
extracts that was delicious

18
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,079
the combo made me super rambley and gave

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,760
me a lot of energy so this will be a fun

20
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,399

22
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,770
lessons if you haven't been following

23
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:54,628

26
00:00:56,909 --> 00:01:01,049
planning your grow and getting prepared

27
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,609
for your new grow if you've been

28
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:04,649
following along you know that we've

29
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,420
selected our space we've selected our

30
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:08,490
equipment we've done a lot of talk about

31
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,560
genetics and now this episode is going

32
00:01:08,489 --> 00:01:13,019
to be about sprouting our new seeds

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,189
let's not waste too much time let's jump

34
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:16,469
right into it

35
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:17,368
seeds can be expensive depending on who

36
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:19,140
you ordered them from

37
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:20,969
how many you bought what kind you

38
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,400
purchased you may have spent a lot of

39
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,530
money on seeds before you think about

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,049
germinating your new seeds I highly

41
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,960
recommend you have your veg area ready

42
00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,220
to rock before you even think about

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,228
starting your seeds

44
00:01:32,219 --> 00:01:35,728
you're gonna think oh I can just dremen

45
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,259
ate these seeds and then I'll build up

46
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,090
this veg room in the next couple of days

47
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:41,280
and then while they veg we'll work on

48
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,740
the flower room once you get plants

49
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,109
going you start time-traveling things go

50
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:48,118
so much more quickly than you anticipate

51
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:49,920
things pop up things get in your way

52
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:51,810
then you fall behind then those seeds

53
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,310
you just paid a bunch of money for start

54
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,200
growing funky they get out of control

55
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,728
and you've got shitty plants to start

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,210
with and you're frustrated from the

57
00:01:56,728 --> 00:02:00,359
beginning

58
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:03,298
so before you germinate your seeds have

59
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:05,129
your veg space prepared that is my very

60
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,170
first piece of advice to you that will

61
00:02:05,129 --> 00:02:09,389
save you a lot of frustration now my

62
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,520
second piece of advice is to start with

63
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,169
quality seed try to get your seeds from

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,930
a reputable vendor and all

65
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:17,280
from a reputable breeder don't fall for

66
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,920
hype when you're shopping for seeds

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,750
don't be sold try to find somebody with

68
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:23,818
a good reputation somebody that you have

69
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,068
heard of and also try to buy those seeds

70
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:27,539
from a vendor with the good reputation

71
00:02:26,068 --> 00:02:29,189
somebody that you have heard of somebody

72
00:02:27,539 --> 00:02:31,139
that has a good relationship with the

73
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:33,329
breeders and if you're going to buy

74
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:35,339
seeds online I recommend you buy from a

75
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,319
seed vendor in the United States that

76
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,659
way you don't have to risk customs of

77
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:40,259
course I recommend the hella Danks seed

78
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,989
company

79
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:45,389
I also recommend the seed Bazaar and I

80
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:47,789
can also vouch for Southern Oregon seeds

81
00:02:45,389 --> 00:02:49,559
those are three quality seed vendors

82
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:51,509
that I trust and respect and I work with

83
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,459
them personally so I know they will take

84
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:55,560
good care of you I'm not bashing any

85
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,930
other seed company I'm just saying I

86
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,370
rely on these three companies I have

87
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:01,830
worked with them I've got a relationship

88
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,590
with them and I know they are rock-solid

89
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:06,510
so I recommend you start with a quality

90
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,009
seed something you know what the parents

91
00:03:06,509 --> 00:03:10,139
of that seed were something you know

92
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:12,989
where it came from if you don't have

93
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,268
access to fancy labeled expensive seeds

94
00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:17,250
grow what you've got in an ideal world

95
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,870
we would all go to the store and we look

96
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,340
at the shelf and we'd say you've got

97
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:22,259
that strain that was the best I've ever

98
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:24,479
smoked I want seeds of that and I get

99
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:26,519
that that's everybody's fantasy that day

100
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,349
is coming unfortunately we are not there

101
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,269
yet for everybody some people are going

102
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:31,979
to have to be resourceful you may have

103
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:33,689
bought a bag of weed ten years ago at

104
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:35,009
some random place and it had seeds in it

105
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,719
now you're gonna have to grow those

106
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:38,310
seeds you never know what you're gonna

107
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:40,379
get out of those seeds you could find

108
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,930
duds you could find hermaphrodites you

109
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,849
may find the next magical strain in

110
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,469
there so grow what you've got no matter

111
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,579
where your seeds come from whether

112
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:49,650
they're regular whether they're

113
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,629
feminized seeds pay close attention to

114
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,310
them pay attention for males pay

115
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,049
attention for hermaphrodite um pay

116
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,489
attention for problems you will have to

117
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:58,829
keep an eye out when you're growing from

118
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,539
seed now if you've got a bag of seeds

119
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:02,250
lying around and you don't know what any

120
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:04,078
of them are it's just a perhaps a

121
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,818
sandwich bag or a little mason jar just

122
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,500
stuffed with random seeds from bags of

123
00:04:05,818 --> 00:04:10,048
cannabis you've gone through over time

124
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,969
and you can't decide what to grow I go

125
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:13,739
for the really healthy-looking seeds and

126
00:04:11,969 --> 00:04:16,319
by healthy I mean probably darker

127
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,030
probably bigger a lot of people like the

128
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,798
tiger stripes that's always a good sign

129
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:21,119
some seeds will not make tiger stripes

130
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:22,649
no matter how long they grow no matter

131
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,310
how mature no matter how healthy and

132
00:04:22,649 --> 00:04:25,109
strong they are

133
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,120
they just won't stripe up that's just a

134
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:28,310
genetic thing

135
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,780
I prefer the darker colored seeds the

136
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,430
harder seeds I give him a little press

137
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:32,959
on the table I hope they don't crack if

138
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,430
they don't crack that's probably a good

139
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,709
seed if it cracks it obviously isn't

140
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,540
gonna grow that's a dead seed a lot of

141
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:40,099
people like a larger cannabis seat but

142
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,370
I've noticed that a lot of strains

143
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,500
produce little tiny seeds so sometimes a

144
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,569
little tiny cannabis seed can produce a

145
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,790
seriously potent plant don't judge it

146
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:51,978
too much by the size judge it more by

147
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:54,319
the health of the seed a lot of the

148
00:04:51,978 --> 00:04:55,639
grayer light colored seeds will grow I

149
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,250
don't put those in my packs because

150
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,900
people freak out I grow those myself but

151
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,879
those lighter gray the paler colored

152
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:03,349
seeds those will grow the white seeds

153
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:05,389
those are more questionable I don't

154
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,340
think the white seeds do as well the

155
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:09,650
gray kind of silver shiny seeds those

156
00:05:07,339 --> 00:05:11,299
usually have a good take off the darker

157
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:13,009
ones those take off quite quickly

158
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,169
and then of course you get those bigger

159
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,939
harder tiger-stripe seeds those really

160
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:20,000
have a lot of vigor and they take off

161
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:22,069
really quickly for you so seed health is

162
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,959
important selecting healthy seeds if

163
00:05:22,069 --> 00:05:25,788
you've got a big bag of seeds try to

164
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,829
select the healthiest looking beans out

165
00:05:25,788 --> 00:05:29,569
of that bag maybe a couple of them just

166
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:31,279
call you maybe you've got a bag of a

167
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:33,019
thousand seeds and two of them risk oh

168
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:34,939
hey bro I'm the seeds you want to grow

169
00:05:33,019 --> 00:05:37,788
right now listen to that kind of stuff

170
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:39,589
that is usually accurate all right now

171
00:05:37,788 --> 00:05:41,269
we've got our veg space ready we know

172
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:43,638
what to look for in quality seeds we've

173
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:45,168
got some seeds on hand and it is time to

174
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,030
germinate our seeds what do I mean by

175
00:05:45,168 --> 00:05:49,490
germinate that's just a fancy word for

176
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:51,918
starting the seeds we need to give them

177
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,569
the proper conditions to make them start

178
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,529
we want to crack the seed open we don't

179
00:05:53,569 --> 00:05:56,389
want to do it we want it to happen

180
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,339
naturally we want the seed to crack

181
00:05:56,389 --> 00:06:00,139
itself open and we want a little tiny

182
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:03,348
tap root to come fish it out and that is

183
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:05,360
the start of life in nature those seeds

184
00:06:03,348 --> 00:06:07,310
would fall out of last year's but winter

185
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,530
would come it would knock those seeds at

186
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,329
those the buds would dry the wind and

187
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:13,069
the moisture would knock those seeds out

188
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,750
of those buds those buds would fall into

189
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:16,159
the ground winter would come and

190
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,620
everything would be frozen for a little

191
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,410
while as the spring came and the winter

192
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,879
frost or the winter moisture started

193
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,189
moistening down into the soil those

194
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:27,769
seeds would begin to receive moisture

195
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:29,779
and warmth from nature that would

196
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:31,069
trigger them to germinate then they

197
00:06:29,779 --> 00:06:32,478
would sprout up they would find their

198
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:34,098
way up dig it up out of the soil they'd

199
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,658
start seeing Sun and they'd go Here I am

200
00:06:34,098 --> 00:06:37,968
and then they would live and it would

201
00:06:35,658 --> 00:06:39,408
become little baby cannabis plants now

202
00:06:37,968 --> 00:06:41,269
human involvement will we

203
00:06:39,408 --> 00:06:43,759
done we have collected the seeds before

204
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:45,259
they fall out of the but when I breed I

205
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,059
let the plants get done and let the

206
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:48,889
seeds get finished I cut the plants down

207
00:06:47,059 --> 00:06:50,779
I let them hang they dry then I

208
00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:52,610
basically crumble up the buds and I

209
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:54,168
manually remove the Caesar or several

210
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,788
methods of doing that that's not

211
00:06:54,168 --> 00:06:57,709
important right now but that process

212
00:06:55,788 --> 00:06:59,658
happened then those seeds were passed on

213
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,649
to you now you have to play the role of

214
00:06:59,658 --> 00:07:02,658
Mother Nature

215
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:04,848
we have to give these seeds the proper

216
00:07:02,658 --> 00:07:07,550
environment to trigger them to start

217
00:07:04,848 --> 00:07:09,438
their life the two main things that are

218
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:12,559
going to start our seeds are water and

219
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,899
warmth the main thing being water warmth

220
00:07:12,559 --> 00:07:16,309
very secondary to that warmth will speed

221
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:19,249
up the process and make them much

222
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:21,709
happier now there are countless ways to

223
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:23,838
start new seeds I'm going to cover four

224
00:07:21,709 --> 00:07:25,879
or five methods here in this episode and

225
00:07:23,838 --> 00:07:28,069
I'm going to start with the method I use

226
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:31,099
personally I like the old school paper

227
00:07:28,069 --> 00:07:32,899
towel technique it is very simple I get

228
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:34,878
a plate out of the cupboard just a glass

229
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:37,728
plate like you serve a meal on or make a

230
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,800
sandwich I also get a paper towel just

231
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:42,889
like you'd use to clean up that meal or

232
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,110
that sandwich I fold the paper towel one

233
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:46,519
time then I fold it again now you've

234
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,639
just got a little rectangular paper

235
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:52,038
towel I set that paper towel on to the

236
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,459
glass plate and then I get a bottle of

237
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,558
water

238
00:07:52,459 --> 00:07:55,999
I prefer bottled water for this because

239
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:58,579
I don't want the chlorine or whatever

240
00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:00,649
else is in my tap water affecting my new

241
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:03,288
seedlings so I've got the folded paper

242
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:05,478
towel sitting on the plate I simply soak

243
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:09,348
that paper towel with water it will only

244
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:11,269
hold so much I simply saturate it then I

245
00:08:09,348 --> 00:08:13,038
tip the plate to the side to make sure

246
00:08:11,269 --> 00:08:15,019
all that excess water runs out of the

247
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,399
paper towel and off of that plate just

248
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:19,668
drain it right off into the sink that

249
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,709
water is gone so now you've got a soggy

250
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:23,959
paper towel in the middle of a plate I

251
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,179
place my seeds in the paper towel and

252
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:28,098
then I gently fold it one more time if

253
00:08:26,178 --> 00:08:29,418
you want to fold it another time you can

254
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:31,218
and make a little tiny square that's

255
00:08:29,418 --> 00:08:33,438
fine but I think that first fold will be

256
00:08:31,218 --> 00:08:35,000
just fine just fold it up to where those

257
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:36,408
seeds are in the middle and they're

258
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,418
getting wet and they're not getting any

259
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:40,308
light the way that that wet paper towel

260
00:08:38,418 --> 00:08:41,598
works it'll kind of seal itself up so

261
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:43,728
the seeds won't move around too much

262
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,290
there won't be any light in there so

263
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:47,000
you've got some seeds folded up in a wet

264
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:49,159
paper towel and those are sitting on a

265
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,250
plate now at this point you've got a

266
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,059
couple of options if you are able to pay

267
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,889
attention to those

268
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:58,159
seeds and be around them all the time

269
00:08:54,889 --> 00:09:00,259
and make sure they don't get dry you can

270
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,379
just leave them on that plate and leave

271
00:09:00,259 --> 00:09:05,600
them exposed if it's not too hot or not

272
00:09:03,379 --> 00:09:08,299
too cold in your area they will sprout

273
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,360
just fine just left sitting like that if

274
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:13,490
you want to slow down the amount of

275
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,440
moisture leaving that paper towel and

276
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,839
try to keep it moist a little bit longer

277
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,640
without having to pay so much attention

278
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:21,410
just set another plate over it flip the

279
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:23,088
plate upside down and set it on top of

280
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:24,379
the first plate just like you do if you

281
00:09:23,089 --> 00:09:26,120
had a sandwich in there and he didn't

282
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:28,159
want anything to get to the sandwich so

283
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,049
you just got two plates with your little

284
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:32,600
folded up paper towel in there you have

285
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:35,719
to keep it moist at all times do not let

286
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,149
it get dry if you feel like you're going

287
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,040
to get forgetful or if you need to go to

288
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:41,990
work for an extended period of time and

289
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,480
you cannot monitor the moisture of your

290
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:47,360
new seedlings you can always set them in

291
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,149
a baggie put your folded paper towel

292
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,339
with the moisture in it in a baggie this

293
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,809
will give the moisture nowhere to go it

294
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:55,880
will be trapped inside that little

295
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:57,439
environment just make sure you check on

296
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,200
them as soon as you get home from work

297
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,420
if you leave that wet paper towel folded

298
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,910
up in a baggie in a really warm spot for

299
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,889
too long you can create a mildew

300
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:09,199
situation so make sure you pop that open

301
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,939
get some fresh air in there and check on

302
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,700
that as soon as you get home from work

303
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,710
so it sounds really easy because it is

304
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,750
you are folding a paper towel into a

305
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,910
square you're moistening it you're

306
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,440
letting the excess moisture run off we

307
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:23,329
set the seeds onto that moist paper

308
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,250
towel and then we fold it to cover them

309
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:27,290
up and then if you need to place another

310
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,000
plate over it to slow down the dry time

311
00:10:27,289 --> 00:10:30,769
if you're really forgetful and you're

312
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,500
gonna be away for a while put it in a

313
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:36,620
baggie to retain that moisture then set

314
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,839
it somewhere semi warm most of the time

315
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,730
if you are comfortable in that area your

316
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:43,070
seedlings are probably comfortable as

317
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:45,589
well room temperature is acceptable for

318
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,260
seedlings a great spot for seedlings if

319
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:49,730
you do not forget them is on top of the

320
00:10:48,259 --> 00:10:51,139
refrigerator that temperature that

321
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:54,500
happens right on top of the refrigerator

322
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:56,059
is perfect for seedlings if you don't

323
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,860
forget them put them in a baggie

324
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:01,009
set them right on top they should be

325
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,230
ready in 12 to 24 maybe 36 hours if

326
00:11:01,009 --> 00:11:05,389
you've got one of those old big TVs

327
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,830
nobody's got those big old TVs anymore

328
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:08,929
they used to get warm on the

329
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:11,270
back that was a great spot to set

330
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:14,029
seedlings and a baggie was on the back

331
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,500
of the old Sony Trinitron 36 inch TV

332
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:17,449
where it got warm from playing video

333
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,029
games all day that would be the perfect

334
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,770
temp for seedlings other than those

335
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,600
subtle heat sources like the top of the

336
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:25,009
fridge or the back of the TV I really

337
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,050
don't recommend a heat mat for

338
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:28,549
germinating new seeds or for your clones

339
00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:31,309
I've seen more clones and seeds

340
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:33,199
destroyed roasted and barbecued than I

341
00:11:31,309 --> 00:11:34,939
have ever seen assisted by one of those

342
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,920
heat mats but I'm gonna talk about that

343
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,810
more later in the episode I think so

344
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:40,490
let's skip that for now and try to stay

345
00:11:38,809 --> 00:11:42,319
focused alright so we've got our

346
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,480
seedlings they are folded up in a paper

347
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,860
towel we're keeping them moist we don't

348
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,629
want them soggy we don't want them

349
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:50,060
dripping all the time we want to keep

350
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:51,379
them moist and comfortable so you've got

351
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,269
them folded in the paper towel and you

352
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:55,309
were checking on them every few hours if

353
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:56,720
you were able they're easy to check on

354
00:11:55,309 --> 00:11:58,309
just set your hand right on that paper

355
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,990
towel don't crush the seeds just set

356
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,639
your hand on there gently and if the

357
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:03,470
paper towel is kind of cold kind of

358
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,090
chilly they're probably wet enough if

359
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:06,769
you don't feel like it's wet enough

360
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,420
moisten it up a little bit get your

361
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,399
water bottle and just pour the water on

362
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:12,139
there gently and then tip the tear that

363
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,819
plate over toward the excess water runs

364
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:15,169
off into the sink and then you've got a

365
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,540
moistened up for the rest of the day

366
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:21,769
they should only be in this paper towel

367
00:12:17,539 --> 00:12:24,379
for 12 to 24 maybe 36 or 48 hours before

368
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,449
you see them starting to pop open it

369
00:12:24,379 --> 00:12:28,279
will pop open on one side and a little

370
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,070
white tail will start coming out that is

371
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:33,559
exactly what we are looking for that is

372
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:35,240
the start of life that is a taproot that

373
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:36,979
is the beginning of everything that

374
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,990
little root is gonna dig down into the

375
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:40,519
pot once we pot it and it's gonna dig

376
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:42,379
down and start finding nutrients and

377
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:44,149
that's gonna be the legs that's gonna be

378
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:46,129
the foundation and then it's gonna start

379
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:47,600
shooting that seedling straight upward

380
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:48,799
toward the light and then it's gonna

381
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,120
shoot little leaves out of there and

382
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:51,409
that little seedling will fall off and

383
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,450
then you've got a little plant so that

384
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:55,039
is the start of everything happening

385
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:56,360
right there and you get to see it

386
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,769
because you've just got it right there

387
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,899
in that paper towel it's not buried

388
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,639
under anything so you can check on them

389
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,350
check on them about twelve hours if you

390
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,779
don't see anything check on them in 24

391
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,580
hours if you don't see anything go 36

392
00:13:05,779 --> 00:13:08,990
you're gonna get impatient after 24

393
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,580
hours he'll be checking on them every 4

394
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,919
to 6 hours don't worry just keep

395
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,600
checking don't forget about them we only

396
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:16,549
need maybe an eighth of an inch maybe a

397
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,769
quarter of an inch of that tap root to

398
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:20,569
pop out before our seedlings are ready

399
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,699
to put into soil but

400
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,160
we'll get to that so I think I covered

401
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,530
how to germinate seeds in a paper towel

402
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:28,939
you fold it you wet it you drain it put

403
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,069
the seeds in there fold it again and

404
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:34,250
then you keep an eye on it and keep it

405
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,590
moist keep it slightly warm but don't

406
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,299
roast it if you think you might forget

407
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:40,250
about your seedlings place the paper

408
00:13:38,299 --> 00:13:42,559
towel set up in a baggie and that will

409
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,809
keep them moist until you open it once

410
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,939
again don't forget about them make sure

411
00:13:44,809 --> 00:13:48,319
you check on them then when you unfold

412
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,210
that paper towel and you've got little

413
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,670
tap roots sticking out that's when it's

414
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,139
time to get ready to put them into your

415
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:56,629
potting mix but we're gonna talk about

416
00:13:54,139 --> 00:13:58,970
that a little bit later the only thing

417
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:01,250
left to cover in this section is what if

418
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:02,899
those seeds don't pop open after 48

419
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,909
hours the only thing you can really do

420
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:06,919
is wait a little bit longer maybe

421
00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:08,689
increase the heat if you didn't already

422
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:10,039
set them on the fridge maybe set them up

423
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,940
there on top of the refrigerator where

424
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:12,769
it's a little warmer

425
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,570
maybe lessen the moisture maybe you've

426
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,909
got them a little too wet maybe just

427
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,050
keep that paper towel just damp maybe

428
00:14:16,909 --> 00:14:19,399
you've still got a little bit of a

429
00:14:18,049 --> 00:14:22,639
chance but if they haven't opened after

430
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:25,610
48 or 72 hours I would consider starting

431
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,230
a fresh batch of seeds at that point now

432
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:29,480
if it is really cold in your environment

433
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,399
it will take longer for your seeds to

434
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,110
germinate so expect that if you're

435
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,279
growing in the basement in Colorado

436
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,500
you've got them sitting right on a

437
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:38,750
concrete floor that's gonna take longer

438
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,789
consider your environment like I said

439
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:43,700
earlier the warmth will speed things up

440
00:14:40,789 --> 00:14:45,799
but that too can go wrong in excess so

441
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:48,230
try to stay in the right area try to be

442
00:14:45,799 --> 00:14:50,659
about 70 to 85 degrees ish and you

443
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:53,029
should be ok with rapid growth for your

444
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:55,610
seeds now let's talk about our next

445
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:57,620
method for sprouting our seeds our next

446
00:14:55,610 --> 00:14:59,480
method is using rapid rooters or route

447
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,879
riots or whatever type of plugs are

448
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:04,580
available in your area

449
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,039
although I am NOT including rock wool

450
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,780
cubes in this section I don't like rock

451
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,579
wool cubes for sprouting seeds they do

452
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:12,529
not work well for sprouting seeds I

453
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,230
would not recommend that if it's what

454
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:17,269
you've got do it similarly to what I

455
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,970
recommend here with the rapid rooters

456
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:22,129
but before you use your rock wool cubes

457
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,110
make sure you clean them out and make

458
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,149
sure you soak them in a pH balanced

459
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:28,039
solution rinse them very well to get

460
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,720
anything out of them then soak them

461
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:31,849
either in clean water or a light

462
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,990
nutrient solution that has been pH

463
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:37,180
around 6 you don't want to use rock wool

464
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,999
without rinsing them and adjusting the

465
00:15:37,179 --> 00:15:43,479
pH so this is all about rapid rooters or

466
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:45,879
root riot plugs when we start with these

467
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,949
plugs we need to soak them so I get a

468
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,749
container based on the amount of plugs

469
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:51,669
I'm going to use I'm generally using a

470
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:53,619
five-gallon bucket I think they're sold

471
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:56,198
in a 50 pack so most of the time I just

472
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:58,778
do all 50 and I either do 50 clones or

473
00:15:56,198 --> 00:16:00,938
50 ceilings I just use the whole package

474
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:02,889
you soak as many as you need what I do

475
00:16:00,938 --> 00:16:04,629
is I get a container it will fit enough

476
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:07,299
water to soak as many plugs as I'm gonna

477
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:10,990
use I adjust the pH to somewhere between

478
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:13,149
6 and 6 3 I usually place the rapid

479
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,649
Rooter plugs back into the rapid Rooter

480
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:15,789
tray if you're not using the tray that's

481
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:17,289
okay you don't need it but that's

482
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:20,318
usually what I do I put it right in the

483
00:16:17,289 --> 00:16:23,409
tray then I take a seed and I insert the

484
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:27,729
seed into the rapid Rooter plug that

485
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:30,068
seed goes pointy and down if you look at

486
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:32,170
your seeds it's got a round end and it's

487
00:16:30,068 --> 00:16:34,568
got a pointy end it will be obvious when

488
00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:36,219
you look at it the pointy end goes down

489
00:16:34,568 --> 00:16:39,219
this is important because of the way

490
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,290
that the seed grows pointy end down when

491
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,300
you are putting it into a rapid Rooter

492
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:45,639
or any sort of a cube or if you are

493
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:50,019
going directly in the soil pointy end

494
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,759
down also if you are going into a rapid

495
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,039
Rooter if you're going into a root Riot

496
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,839
cube if you're going into soil or if

497
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:57,549
you're going against my advice and

498
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,769
you're going directly into Rockwall it

499
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:02,558
is always suggested that you plant your

500
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:04,538
seeds about one knuckle deep just go

501
00:17:02,558 --> 00:17:06,699
just the tip of your finger just push it

502
00:17:04,538 --> 00:17:08,109
in until you press that first knuckle

503
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,850
right that first bend in your finger

504
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,408
that's far enough stop pushing that

505
00:17:09,849 --> 00:17:13,778
seedling is deep enough into the soil

506
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:15,189
it's deep enough into that cube it will

507
00:17:13,778 --> 00:17:16,750
live there it doesn't need to be buried

508
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:19,449
way down in there it stands a much

509
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,699
better chance if it's just about knuckle

510
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,259
deep is all you need to go so after I've

511
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,209
got all my seedlings planted and I've

512
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,619
got all my cubes labeled make sure you

513
00:17:25,209 --> 00:17:28,480
label each cube if you're planning

514
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,939
different strains make sure you've got a

515
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,798
way to label each cube so you know what

516
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,720
you've got also label if you're doing

517
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,339
more than one paper-towel of seeds make

518
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,990
sure you label that paper towel some way

519
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:39,490
most of you are just doing one pack of

520
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,620
seeds or one strain but if you're doing

521
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,990
multiple please carefully label things

522
00:17:41,619 --> 00:17:45,939
so we've got our seeds they are in our

523
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,888
rapid Rooter cubes they're carefully

524
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,430
labeled they are nice and moist they're

525
00:17:47,888 --> 00:17:50,469
about

526
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,470
deep down into the end of the cube now I

527
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:55,120
place them under a very light light you

528
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,390
don't need very powerful lighting for

529
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,149
sprouting seeds a really weak LED or a

530
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:03,280
t5 kind of high up is plenty of lighting

531
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,990
a compact fluorescent is probably just

532
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,389
enough light you don't need to go

533
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,920
extreme for a ceiling just enough to

534
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,080
encourage it to grow once it gets bigger

535
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,269
we do need light but right now we don't

536
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:15,220
need ridiculous lighting for a small

537
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:16,359
seedling so place it under a light that

538
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,519
will give it warmth and that will

539
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:20,500
encourage it to grow now in about two or

540
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:21,940
three days maybe four or five days at

541
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,069
the latest you should see a little

542
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,170
sprout pop out of your cube and you have

543
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:28,329
now got a little seedling now that

544
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:30,460
seedling can live in that little rapid

545
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:32,409
Rooter for several days but it's going

546
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,750
to need a forever home it's gonna need

547
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:37,450
to go into either some soil or a hydro

548
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,940
setup fairly soon while it's in that

549
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,890
rapid Rooter we need to keep it warm we

550
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,080
need to keep it somewhere between 70 and

551
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,870
85 degrees and we need to keep that root

552
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,879
tube moist at all times once it dries up

553
00:18:46,869 --> 00:18:51,129
that plant has no life source and it

554
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,260
will die so keep it moist and keep it

555
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:55,450
warm and keep it under a light and then

556
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:57,849
we need to think about getting it into a

557
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,850
good potting mix or into a hydro system

558
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:02,889
very soon so that it can thrive so that

559
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:05,319
is the basics of sprouting a seed in a

560
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:07,660
rapid Rooter or a root riot cube or

561
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:09,970
against my advice if you choose to use a

562
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:12,430
rock wool cube you would use a similar

563
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:15,339
method basically soak it with a proper

564
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:17,500
pH solution then press the ceiling in

565
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:19,629
pointy end down and only go about a

566
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,569
knuckle deep set it under a light and

567
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,850
leave it alone for two or three days you

568
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:27,159
should see a little sprout pop up if you

569
00:19:24,849 --> 00:19:28,740
don't see the sprout pop up look in the

570
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:31,509
little hole and see what you see

571
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,609
sometimes the seedling simply gets

572
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:36,009
caught and it's bent over and it can't

573
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:39,609
pop itself up out of the root cube that

574
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:42,839
happens you can carefully get a pair of

575
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:45,189
tweezers or a chopstick and very gently

576
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,169
encourage that plant to grow straight up

577
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:49,539
don't pull it out of the seed casing

578
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,730
don't pull it out of the cube maybe

579
00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:53,859
spread the whole of the cube open just a

580
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,480
little bit and encourage it to pop out

581
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,909
of there it just needs to bend up and

582
00:19:55,480 --> 00:20:00,610
come out you can probably guide it out

583
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:02,380
if you're gentle if it's close to doing

584
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:04,149
it on its own don't touch it just

585
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,710
let it struggle and it will come out if

586
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:07,660
you feel like it's been long enough and

587
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,240
you're getting impatient just give it a

588
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,950
little tug it may pop out for you keep

589
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,420
in mind you're risking killing this

590
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:15,400
ceiling if you get too rough you're

591
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,650
going to destroy it if you get too rough

592
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,630
but you've got a good chance just use

593
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:21,790
your thumbs and spread that Rapid Rooter

594
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:23,500
open just a little tiny bit and you may

595
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:25,539
open it just enough for that seed to

596
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:27,190
unbind itself and be able to pop

597
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:29,019
straight up it may just be stuck it's

598
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:30,490
trying to move up in the two leaves on

599
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:32,289
the top they just got stuck somewhere

600
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:34,180
that happens quite a bit and I'll just

601
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,710
have to break itself free so pay

602
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,170
attention to that if it doesn't pop up

603
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:39,610
in four or five days if the others have

604
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,470
popped up and you've got one that didn't

605
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:44,439
pop up look in there that could be the

606
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:46,120
issue with that one seedling now let's

607
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,920
kind of touch on another method that is

608
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,349
very similar to the rapid rooters and

609
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,600
the root Riot cubes but it is also very

610
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:54,939
different this next method you cannot

611
00:20:52,599 --> 00:20:57,159
put this into a hydro kit as simply as

612
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:59,110
you could a rapid Rooter or as simply as

613
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,460
you could a seed from a paper towel I'm

614
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:02,409
sure some people have done it I'm sure

615
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,480
some people do it but it's not as easy

616
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,330
it's much more challenging and it's not

617
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,150
as logical so let's talk about using

618
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:12,579
jiffy cubes jiffy cubes are great if

619
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:14,380
you're going to go into soil but like I

620
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:16,059
said you can't really use them going

621
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,380
into a hydro system I'm sure there's

622
00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:19,809
somebody doing it gonna tell me I'm

623
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:22,390
wrong but it's not common so a jiffy

624
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,009
cube they're very similar to the rapid

625
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,590
rooters but they start off really small

626
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:28,960
any moisten them and they expand to the

627
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:30,849
proper size so you moisten them they

628
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,190
puff up you squeeze the excess water out

629
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:36,069
of them then from there they work just

630
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:38,410
like the rapid rooters or the root riot

631
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:40,869
cubes you place your seeding and sealing

632
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,120
in there pointing in down you go about

633
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:46,659
knuckle deep and then you've got to keep

634
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:49,359
your jiffy cube moist just like you do

635
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,790
with your other cubes now if you're

636
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:53,829
using rapid rooters or root riots or

637
00:21:51,789 --> 00:21:55,599
jiffy cubes or if you're going against

638
00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:56,169
my advice still and using the rock wool

639
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,379
cubes

640
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:02,320
make sure not to get them too moist for

641
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,990
too long if they are too moist it will

642
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,589
simply rot your ceilings they will turn

643
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,539
green

644
00:22:05,589 --> 00:22:09,639
it will turn brown it will fall over and

645
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:11,680
die or they will not even germinate at

646
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:14,320
all there's a big difference between

647
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,570
being soaked and being wet and being

648
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,339
moist

649
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:18,839
want to soak them in the beginning put

650
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:22,230
the seeds in there when they are soaked

651
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,879
then just keep it wet from there you can

652
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,980
usually tell by looking at the rapid

653
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,600
Reuters how dry or wet they are when

654
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,430
they start getting that brown crusty

655
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,779
color they're too dry when they start

656
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:32,279
getting that Sheen to them they start

657
00:22:30,779 --> 00:22:34,289
showing a little silver a little light

658
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,119
reflection that's just right when

659
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:38,809
they're really really black that's when

660
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:42,239
they are soaked so learn how to identify

661
00:22:38,809 --> 00:22:44,250
soaked and saturated and wet and moist

662
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,990
and create a little scale for yourself I

663
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,759
did the 1 through 5 watering technique

664
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,740
maybe we need a similar thing for the

665
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,450
rapid rooters I kind of just did that if

666
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,609
they're totally soaked in black that's a

667
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:55,680
5 if they're dry and crispy that's a 1

668
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:57,149
we need to keep them about a 3 at all

669
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:59,400
times ladies and gentlemen so there we

670
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,740
go 1 through 5 tech on rapid rooters

671
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:03,690
just like we did on watering normal

672
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,789
plants so now we know how to germinate

673
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,920
seeds in paper towels we know how to

674
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:09,779
germinate seeds and rapid rooters we

675
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,060
kind of know how to do it in rock wool

676
00:23:09,779 --> 00:23:14,700
cubes we know how to germinate seeds and

677
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:16,619
jiffy cubes it is just like doing it in

678
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,630
the rapid rooters you guys you moisten

679
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,309
them they expand you squeeze the excess

680
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:23,160
water out of there then you treat it

681
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:25,819
just like a rapid Rooter from there our

682
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,320
next option is to plant our seedlings

683
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:29,939
directly into soil that's the way it

684
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,250
happens in nature why wouldn't we do

685
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,720
that in our personal garden so let's

686
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,599
talk a little bit about planting our

687
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,120
seeds directly into soil or the medium

688
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,549
we are going to use if you plan to start

689
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:44,519
your seedling in soil I highly recommend

690
00:23:41,549 --> 00:23:47,009
you use a very small container I would

691
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:50,039
recommend a beer cup or something that

692
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:53,129
size there's no reason to have a tiny

693
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:55,589
tiny plant in a large container of soil

694
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,380
so my first recommendation is a small

695
00:23:55,589 --> 00:24:00,329
container with plenty of drainage my

696
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:03,390
second recommendation will be a good

697
00:24:00,329 --> 00:24:05,669
soil for starter plants something with a

698
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,500
lot of aeration and something with not

699
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,779
too much nutrients added to it maybe

700
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:12,029
something with some mykos or maybe some

701
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:14,250
beneficial bacteria that's good but we

702
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:16,230
don't need a lot of boosts for our

703
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,259
little babies so start with a small

704
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:22,110
container of high-quality starter soil

705
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:24,690
so I've got my container and I've got my

706
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:26,729
starter soil now i'm oice in that soil

707
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:29,670
before I put my seedlings into there

708
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:31,710
just simply water that soil with the

709
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:34,890
pH adjusted solution you don't need

710
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:37,049
nutrients just water pH around 6-2 6-3

711
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:39,420
you should be just fine just water it on

712
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:41,399
in let it drain out once it's done

713
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,350
draining take your pointer finger and

714
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,180
just make a little tiny hole just

715
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:47,339
knuckle deep just like I keep saying in

716
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,320
the episode I may name the episode that

717
00:24:47,339 --> 00:24:51,539
just go about one knuckle deep into the

718
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,549
soil then take your seedling and just

719
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:55,680
set it right inside that hole then

720
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:57,149
gently press the dirt right over that

721
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,590
ceiling just real gently you don't need

722
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,600
to pack it down just cover up that

723
00:24:58,589 --> 00:25:05,189
seedling and then just let it rest and

724
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:07,109
then within 24 to 48 to 36 maybe 72

725
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:08,880
hours you should see a little baby plant

726
00:25:07,109 --> 00:25:10,289
just pop it up right out of there you'll

727
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,870
just see two little green leaves just

728
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:14,849
popping right up out of that topsoil I

729
00:25:12,869 --> 00:25:17,099
like to keep my little baby plants in

730
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:18,809
the beer cups under a t5 light I try to

731
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,980
keep the light kind of far out when

732
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,299
they're little and then as they get

733
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,339
bigger I move the light a little bit

734
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:25,049
closer I try not to let the seedlings

735
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:26,970
get too stretchy if they start getting a

736
00:25:25,049 --> 00:25:28,559
little leggy I move the light closer I

737
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:29,519
like to put a fan on them while they're

738
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,230
a little that gives them a little

739
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:33,000
strength makes them a little more robust

740
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,640
so there are advantages and

741
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,829
disadvantages to starting them in the

742
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,320
beer cup the advantage they're already

743
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:41,759
in their soil you don't have to up pot

744
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,470
them you don't have to transplant them

745
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,559
you don't have to do any damage to a

746
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,059
little seedling the disadvantage is

747
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:50,129
sometimes you just completely lose a

748
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:52,019
seedling and a beer cup filled with soil

749
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,970
sometimes they just totally disappear

750
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:56,129
sometimes they don't sprout at all and

751
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:58,950
sometimes you totally drown them by

752
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,870
trying to water so much soil so starting

753
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:03,509
them in beer cups and soil is a little

754
00:26:00,869 --> 00:26:05,489
trickier but it may be the only option

755
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:07,799
for some people not everybody is able to

756
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:10,200
order rapid rooters or root riot cubes

757
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:12,389
not everybody has access to a rock wool

758
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,430
cube and some people may just want to

759
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:16,860
try it because that's the way it happens

760
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:19,049
in nature so that is a rundown of my

761
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,240
basic methods of germinating seeds

762
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:23,549
hopefully one of those methods works for

763
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,799
you honestly I use the folded paper

764
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,839
towel method the most in a commercial

765
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,149
environment I may use the rapid Rooter

766
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:32,609
method next but I honestly do not start

767
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,590
seeds directly in soil anymore I found

768
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:37,049
that I can start a lot more in much less

769
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:38,459
space by using the rapid rooters imagine

770
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:41,579
the amount of space it takes to start

771
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:43,350
100 rapid rooters compared to 100 beer

772
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:44,879
cups it's a law

773
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:46,949
difference in the amount of space that

774
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,419
you need I honestly don't have any

775
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:50,130
experience with the jiffy cubes I've

776
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:52,380
never had to use those I've always had

777
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:53,730
access to the rapid rooters and honestly

778
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,160
I've just been sticking with the paper

779
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,980
towel method so that's what I'm doing

780
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:01,140
the most I encourage you to use the

781
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,690
method that works the best for you I

782
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,980
encourage you also to try different

783
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,990
methods if you think something works

784
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:08,548
great why not try another method if

785
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,160
you've got some seeds that you can spare

786
00:27:08,548 --> 00:27:13,679
why not try something you may find that

787
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,659
something works better for you all right

788
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,669
so now we've got our seeds germinated

789
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,559
we've either got some seeds folded into

790
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:21,990
a paper towel or we've got a rapid

791
00:27:19,558 --> 00:27:23,668
Rooter or a root riot or a rock wool

792
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,038
cube with roots hanging out of the

793
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:28,860
bottom of the root cube our next step is

794
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:33,538
to pot our new seedling into a pot of

795
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:36,119
soil or soilless mix in this episode I

796
00:27:33,538 --> 00:27:39,629
will cover how to pot the seeds

797
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:42,750
germinated from a paper towel into soil

798
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:45,179
but my next episode is going to be about

799
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:48,058
cutting clones then shortly after that

800
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,250
we will have to pop the clones into soil

801
00:27:48,058 --> 00:27:53,220
which means I'm going to do a combo

802
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,619
episode of planting our new seedlings in

803
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:58,409
the rapid rooters and planting clones

804
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:59,939
and rapid rooters into soil at the same

805
00:27:58,409 --> 00:28:02,190
time I'm just gonna knock that out in

806
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,798
one episode so that part will be coming

807
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,929
soon but for now let's talk about

808
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,940
planting our freshly germinated

809
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:11,220
seedlings that are just sitting in a wet

810
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,558
paper towel I like to catch these seeds

811
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:15,000
when the new tap roots are very sure I

812
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,069
don't like to get it too long and too

813
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,288
out of control because I feel like that

814
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:21,779
gives me too much opportunity to cause

815
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:23,730
it too much stress so as soon as I see

816
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,259
my seedlings crack open a little bit and

817
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,298
that little tap root is sticking out

818
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:30,058
just a little tiny bit I'm comfortable

819
00:28:27,298 --> 00:28:32,639
putting them into their soil or soilless

820
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:34,889
mix and I do that with a very similar

821
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,169
method as I did earlier when we talked

822
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:40,049
about planting seeds into the beer cups

823
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:42,840
I get a beer cup or a very small pot

824
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:45,000
with plenty of drainage I fill it with a

825
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:46,918
quality soil that is good for small

826
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,589
plants something with a lot of aeration

827
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,620
and plenty of drainage then I moisten

828
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:55,048
that soil with water pH around 6 to 6 3

829
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:56,678
then I do the same thing as we've been

830
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:58,839
doing the whole episode I make a

831
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:02,440
tiny hole about knuckle deep in that

832
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:06,099
soil then I simply place the germinated

833
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,749
seed in that little hole I do my best to

834
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:10,178
point it with that little white root

835
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:11,379
pointing straight down if your tap root

836
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:13,090
is nice and short

837
00:29:11,378 --> 00:29:14,859
don't worry about which direction your

838
00:29:13,089 --> 00:29:17,109
ceiling is facing when you place it into

839
00:29:14,859 --> 00:29:19,058
soil it should be just fine if it's

840
00:29:17,109 --> 00:29:20,979
really long you may want to make sure

841
00:29:19,058 --> 00:29:23,769
you point that root down and the seed is

842
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:26,288
going up so gently place your seedling

843
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:27,669
in the soil brush dirt over the top of

844
00:29:26,288 --> 00:29:30,038
it you don't need to bury it or pack it

845
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:31,869
down just cover it and then the tap root

846
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:33,999
will go down it'll start to spread out

847
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:35,949
and the little tiny plant will grow up

848
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:37,929
to the top and it'll push the seedling

849
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,669
with a little set of tiny tiny leaves

850
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:42,429
right through the top soil and you'll

851
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:44,080
have a little starter baby plant the

852
00:29:42,429 --> 00:29:46,629
main thing to worry about when potting

853
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:48,970
your new seedlings is to not damage that

854
00:29:46,628 --> 00:29:51,428
little white tap root sticking out of

855
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:54,308
the seedling do your best not to disrupt

856
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:56,679
stress or damage that little white tap

857
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:58,839
root they're very delicate so once I've

858
00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:00,429
got it potted I put it under a t5 light

859
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:02,709
I keep the light a little distance away

860
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:04,240
so that I don't shock the plant as the

861
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,038
plant gets bigger I bring the light a

862
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,868
little bit closer once I feel like the

863
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:10,148
plant is kind of taken off I put a fan

864
00:30:07,868 --> 00:30:12,398
on it and then once it gets its first

865
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:16,689
set of serrated leaves I start adding

866
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:18,998
very light doses of nutrients so that is

867
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,649
how I pop my seedling that was

868
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:23,079
germinated from a paper towel I

869
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:25,868
basically fill a beer cup with good dirt

870
00:30:23,079 --> 00:30:27,759
poke a hole in the bottom go knuckle

871
00:30:25,868 --> 00:30:29,470
deep in the soil on the top drop my

872
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,509
little germinated seedling in there and

873
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:33,759
cover it up and then put it under the

874
00:30:31,509 --> 00:30:36,249
light and wait for it to pop up and then

875
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:38,409
it grows and grows until I see a set of

876
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,690
leaves with serration and that is when I

877
00:30:38,409 --> 00:30:42,999
start feeding it a little bit of light

878
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:45,580
nutrients now let's talk about a couple

879
00:30:42,999 --> 00:30:48,970
of things that happen quite often when

880
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:51,428
we are working with seeds sometimes the

881
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,829
seed shell will get stuck to the seed

882
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:56,440
and hinder the seeds growth and threaten

883
00:30:53,829 --> 00:30:58,449
that seeds life that is not as scary as

884
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,038
it looks when it happens you'll know

885
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,319
what I'm talking about that seed hole

886
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:03,878
will just get stuck though the ceiling

887
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:05,769
will come up out of the dirt and you'll

888
00:31:03,878 --> 00:31:07,418
see that seed the leaves are trying to

889
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:08,740
open up it's trying to live and it's

890
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:10,490
just trying to open up but it can't

891
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,370
because that seed casing is just

892
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:16,220
to it that is really easy to solve I get

893
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:18,319
a spray bottle with water and I moisten

894
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,210
that ceiling really heavily just spray

895
00:31:18,319 --> 00:31:21,919
it with water just keep spraying it more

896
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:24,319
moisture more moisture more moisture

897
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,880
then see if you can just brush it off

898
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:28,759
with your finger it may just come right

899
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,890
off if not spray more water if that

900
00:31:28,759 --> 00:31:33,230
still doesn't work get some tweezers and

901
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:35,179
just do a gentle dissection if it is

902
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:37,099
really moist you should be able to get

903
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:39,590
that seed casing off it is supposed to

904
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:41,750
come off of there that plant opens up

905
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:43,250
the way the plant opens itself up the

906
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,869
way that that seed casing spreads in

907
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:46,730
half it should pop right off of there

908
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:49,069
just give it a little assistance a

909
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,539
little moisture little tweezers maybe a

910
00:31:49,069 --> 00:31:52,220
pair of chopsticks depending on how

911
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,200
skilled you are it shouldn't be too hard

912
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,750
to do don't be afraid to get in there

913
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,940
and pull that casing off earlier I

914
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:01,880
talked about not using heat mats I have

915
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:03,769
honestly seen people roast more seeds

916
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,990
with heat mat than I have ever seen

917
00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:08,839
success with a heat mat from a seedling

918
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,460
the only time I have ever needed a heat

919
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:12,859
mat was when I was growing in a

920
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,319
warehouse in Colorado and it was really

921
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:17,659
cold during the winter other times I

922
00:32:15,319 --> 00:32:20,119
don't use a heat mat for cloning or for

923
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:22,308
seedlings and I have great success if

924
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:24,259
you are comfortable in the area your

925
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:26,299
seedlings are probably comfortable in

926
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:28,579
that area also and I'm not talking about

927
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:30,049
some Colorado mountain boy who's outside

928
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,909
barefoot in the snow I'm talking about a

929
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:34,879
normal person room temperature is

930
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:36,320
acceptable for your seedlings now I've

931
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,730
got one more thing I want to touch on

932
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,129
before I start wrapping up the episode

933
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:43,069
and the note I wrote is called pre

934
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:45,050
soaked a lot of people like to pre-soak

935
00:32:43,069 --> 00:32:47,509
their seeds before the official

936
00:32:45,049 --> 00:32:48,769
germination if you've got older seeds

937
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:51,200
that have been sitting around for a

938
00:32:48,769 --> 00:32:53,990
longer I may may recommend you give them

939
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,120
a pre soaked it's really easy you simply

940
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,519
pre soak them in water before you

941
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:01,250
germinate them I recommend 12 hours

942
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,589
maybe 24 at the most never go more than

943
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:06,289
24 hours on a soak because that will

944
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:08,389
drown your seeds my theory behind the

945
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:10,460
pre soaked is some seeds just have a

946
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,800
hard outer coating and they don't want

947
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:15,319
to germinate very easily soaking them in

948
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,450
water for 24 hours will definitely

949
00:33:15,319 --> 00:33:19,700
soften that outer coating and encourage

950
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:21,169
easier germination so if you've got

951
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:23,350
older seeds that you've been having a

952
00:33:21,169 --> 00:33:25,360
problem getting to germinate maybe

953
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:27,308
soak them for 12 hours then give them

954
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:29,949
the paper towel method if that doesn't

955
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:31,720
work try soaking some for 24 hours then

956
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:33,490
giving them the paper towel method if

957
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,740
that doesn't work then we're going to

958
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:37,690
need to try more scientific approaches

959
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:39,700
there are chemicals we can add there are

960
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:41,769
tricks we can do but that is much more

961
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,110
advanced science than what we're

962
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:45,460
prepared for today so if you've got old

963
00:33:44,109 --> 00:33:47,168
seeds or if you feel like you've got

964
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:49,058
really hard seeds with a really thick

965
00:33:47,169 --> 00:33:52,120
coating don't be afraid to give them a

966
00:33:49,058 --> 00:33:53,889
pre-soak 12 to 24 hours never go more

967
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:54,519
than 24 hours I don't feel like that's a

968
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:56,440
good idea

969
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,418
all right you guys I feel like that is a

970
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,788
good lesson on how to germinate your

971
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:03,070
seeds I will not forget to teach you

972
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:04,869
guys how to pot those freshly sprouted

973
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:07,329
