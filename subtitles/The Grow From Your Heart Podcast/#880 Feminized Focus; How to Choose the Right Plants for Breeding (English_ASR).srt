00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,920
is all of the advertising here at the

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
start of the show. Let's work our way

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,879
into the question and answer portion of

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,478
today's podcast. At the top of the show,

39
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,879
I said I was going to give away free

40
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,959
seeds. How can you win free seeds? It is

41
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,599
very easy. I have a website. That

42
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,399
website is

43
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,640
iiegenetics.com. On the top of that

44
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,879
website, there's a row of tabs. One of

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,799
those tabs does say grow help or grow

46
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,640
questions. If you click on that tab,

47
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,280
guess what? You can send me a grow

48
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,280
question. If I read your question here

49
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,519
on the podcast, I will send you a coupon

50
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,960
code for a free pack of seeds off of

51
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:07,560
iredirect.com. Today's first question

52
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,598
came from the growhelp tab on

53
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,840
iieetics.com. This question came from

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:14,318
somebody who wants to be called JP. Big

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,759
shout out to my new friend JP. Hey JP,

56
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,519
make sure you check your inbox because

57
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,759
you've got a coupon code for a free pack

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,719
of seeds. Also, make sure you check your

59
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,039
spam because a lot of times your server

60
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,719
makes uh thinks that my email is

61
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,479
spamalama dingdong. All right, the

62
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,560
question goes a little bit like this. It

63
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,639
goes a lot like this. It says, "Hey,

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,000
Rasta Jeff. What's up, dude?" It says,

65
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:35,919
"Thanks for dropping all of the

66
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,840
knowledge about feminized seeds and

67
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:40,238
reversals lately." Uh, I'm glad you guys

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,759
noticed that. Thank you. Um, I make a

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,360
lot of fem seeds. I feel like I've

70
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,878
understood fem seeds and gotten it

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,560
figured out. So, it's great to share

72
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,159
that with you. There's a lot of myths

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,959
and misconceptions that come along with

74
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,878
fem seed. So, I'm happy uh to uh speak

75
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,039
knowledgeably about that subject. Thank

76
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:58,000
you for noticing. It says, "I have a

77
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:59,759
question about choosing a female for a

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,479
reversal." So, what this listener wants

79
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:04,079
to do is take a female plant and they

80
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,598
want to reverse it. What that means is

81
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,760
treat it with a product. There are a lot

82
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,759
of great products out there. Uh you can

83
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,919
make your own silver thioulfate or there

84
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,079
are a few uh ready-made products already

85
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,679
sold that you can use. Um, some of them

86
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
work, some of them I have not tried.

87
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,400
But, uh, they want to treat this female

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,000
plant with a product and put, uh, that

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
will make this plant, it's a female

90
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,598
plant. They want to treat it that will

91
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,759
make this female plant create anthers

92
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,158
that contain female pollen. Then they

93
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,359
will put that female pollen on another

94
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,519
plant. Let's read about and see what

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,120
they want to do with that. Uh, I have a

96
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,439
question about choosing a female for

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,039
reversal. So, they've got a female. They

98
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:41,439
want to know how to choose a female that

99
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:44,079
they're going to spray. Uh, from effects

100
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:46,799
to structure, there are probably a dozen

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,319
traits to consider. There are like 65

102
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,560
traits that I can think of off the top

103
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:52,399
of my head to consider. Uh, what are the

104
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,318
most important traits to consider when

105
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,680
making the choice? So, what are the most

106
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,438
important traits to consider when

107
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,680
selecting a female candidate for

108
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:01,359
reversal? That's a very great question.

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,239
Uh, then it goes on, it says, perhaps

110
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,480
you have two female keepers um from half

111
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,438
sibling crosses, one foxtails and the

112
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,759
other has spear top and dense colas.

113
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,359
Everything else aside, which one flower

114
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:16,399
structure would be better suited for

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,600
male flower production? All right, so

116
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:23,439
there is a lot to go on in this answer.

117
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,080
The main answer is um I wrote the plant

118
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,319
will tell you or no, the plant you like

119
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,639
uh the best or the plant that looks like

120
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:33,120
your goal is the plant to use. Then I

121
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,680
said the plant will tell you what to do.

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
Um so this person said they've got two

123
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,759
sibling plants, two half siblings. Which

124
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,439
one do they choose? Uh, you want to

125
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,720
reverse one and then what are you going

126
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,160
to do with that pollen? Are you going to

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
put it on a lot of things? Are you going

128
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
to put it on itself? Are you going to

129
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,959
put it on that other plant that is its

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,879
sibling? I kind of want to know what

131
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:53,680
you're going to do from there. But you

132
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,079
want to know what to select for uh this

133
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,400
candidate for reversal. In my opinion,

134
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,399
it's all about what is your goal. Do you

135
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,000
want to make tall, skinny plants? Do you

136
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,439
want to make short stout plants? Do you

137
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,680
want to make plants that grow wide and

138
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,839
bushy? Do you want to make plants with a

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,879
a giant apical top or something with a

140
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,319
smaller top and more equally sized

141
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,719
bottoms? What are you trying to make?

142
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,800
What do you like? What does what grows

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,720
best in your grow? What smokes best in

144
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,038
your bong? What sells best in your

145
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,360
circle? What works best for your medical

146
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,759
community? What suits your needs?

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,919
Because I like I like tall skinny plants

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,400
that take like 77 days and make a giant

149
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,639
top cola and can be trellised out. And I

150
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,478
like specific [ __ ] Maybe perhaps you

151
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,560
grow in a way different environment. I'm

152
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,639
sure that your brain chemistry and body

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,120
chemistry are not 100% the same as mine.

154
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,639
So, we enjoy smoking similar yet

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
different things. So, I can give you

156
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,439
advice on this, but it's all about what

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,120
do you want? What do you want your your

158
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,478
offspring to look like? How do you want

159
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,399
them to grow? How do you want them to

160
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,918
smoke? Uh what kind of buzz do you want

161
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,319
them? What kind of medical effect do you

162
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,719
want them to carry? That's a lot of this

163
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,639
to consider. The beautiful part about

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,880
using female plants that we're reversing

165
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,879
is we can smoke these plants and we know

166
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,159
exactly what this plant does. So, we

167
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,560
know what it's going to bring to the

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,080
mix. Um, these aren't my notes. I'm

169
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,079
going way off of my notes here. I kind

170
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,318
of think of breeding as like cheffing.

171
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,519
Um, if you put uh chocolate and

172
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
strawberry together, you're hoping to

173
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,318
get chocolate and strawberry, but if you

174
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,639
pour a little bit of vinegar in there,

175
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,720
that vinegar is going to overpower. Um,

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,319
if you want to make a chocolate flavored

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,800
outcome, you got to put chocolate

178
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,479
flavored products into that. If you put

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,840
garlic and eggs into your chocolate

180
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,279
thing, it's not going to have the right

181
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,159
flavor in the end. If you want to make a

182
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,918
savory dish, use your garlic. Uh that's

183
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,520
sort of that's where and breeding I

184
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,680
think works the same way. So what you

185
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:41,359
want to come out is what you put in. Uh

186
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,360
you said one of the plants has airier

187
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,680
buds and one has more dense buds. What

188
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,439
do you want? And don't worry about the

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,120
reversal. What it's going to look like,

190
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,800
what would be better for reversal. Let's

191
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
worry about what's going to be better uh

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,400
as offspring for breeding because

193
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,079
they're both going to reverse. They

194
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:58,079
should both reverse. There's rare cases

195
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,839
where [ __ ] doesn't reverse well. They're

196
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,439
both going to work. Especially for like

197
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,198
a personal breeding project. You're

198
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,240
going to get productivity. Uh you're

199
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,720
going to get pollen. You're going to

200
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,680
make seeds. So, uh you said one makes

201
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,960
foxtails, foxtails, one has a spear top

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,720
and dense colas. Which one do you like

203
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:17,359
better? Um if you're growing for flour,

204
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,319
a lot of people will prefer a nice dense

205
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
cola. A long time ago, Dr. Dre wpped

206
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,560
that rocks and hard buds were the way to

207
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,079
go. And now we all believe that. But if

208
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,240
you're making concentrates, if you're a

209
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,399
hashmaker and air your bud, a fluffier

210
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,879
bud is easier to work with. There's more

211
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:35,439
surface area. Imagine if I dunked my

212
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:37,839
fist in powdered sugar, I get this much

213
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,598
powdered sugar on the outside. If I open

214
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,519
my hand and moisten my hand and dunk

215
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,439
that in the powdered sugar, I get all

216
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:45,680
the area between my fingers and in my

217
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,598
palm, I get that much more surface area

218
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,160
for tricom. That's easier to wash and

219
00:07:47,598 --> 00:07:52,000
blast off if you're a hashmaker. So,

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,680
which one do you want? I know you're

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
asking me for my guidance and my advice,

222
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,680
but my advice is uh grow from your heart

223
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,800
and breed with love. Grow these plants

224
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,240
and see. Um and then you'll know. You're

225
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,000
just going to know. In my opinion, you

226
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,680
will know. A breeder knows. An artist

227
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,199
knows. A musician knows. You know what

228
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,360
note goes there. You know what color

229
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,199
goes there. You know which plant to use.

230
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,000
And if you can't decide what's to stop

231
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,199
you from using Oh god, not even going to

232
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,879
edit that. Excuse me. If you're not

233
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,560
going to if what's to stop you from

234
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,960
reversing both of them? Not at the same

235
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,800
time, of course, but run a crop. Reverse

236
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,719
this one. Use the pollen. Clean up.

237
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Start over. Reverse the other one. Do it

238
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,440
again. Then grow a bunch of the seeds

239
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,960
side by side. What is to stop you? Now,

240
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:32,639
I wouldn't be doing you any service if I

241
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:34,639
didn't give you some actual [ __ ] to

242
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,918
actually go over and actually look for

243
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:40,559
to select from. Um, what some traits to

244
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,360
consider. Structure and shape are

245
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,518
probably the first visual things you can

246
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,600
see. How is that plant shaped? How is

247
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,440
the structure? Like I said before, is it

248
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,600
tall? Is it skinny? Is it wide? Is it

249
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,920
stout? How are the branches? Can it hold

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,000
itself up? That's shape and structure.

251
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,439
What kind of frame does this plant have?

252
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,200
Uh, that's going to tell you a lot about

253
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,200
the plant anyway. How the buzz is going

254
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
to be, the flowering time, you can tell

255
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,278
that by looking at that shape and

256
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:08,240
structure and leaf shape of that plant.

257
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:10,240
Then the overall vigor. Uh, does the

258
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,959
plant grow super slow? Does it grow

259
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,278
really quickly? Uh, does it take off? Is

260
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,958
it [ __ ] wild? Does it go every which

261
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,958
direction? Let's think about that. So,

262
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,319
we got a shape and structure. Then I'm

263
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,518
going to think about how quickly it

264
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,920
grows, then does it handle my room and

265
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,080
my style. It could be the most amazing

266
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,919
plant on the planet, but if it doesn't

267
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,600
work in my grow environment, if it

268
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,000
doesn't get with my program, it's got to

269
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,000
[ __ ] go. It just doesn't work. Um,

270
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,480
that's just how it goes sometimes.

271
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,720
Sometimes I'll find a plant that um is

272
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,320
good, but it doesn't fit my style, my

273
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
room, and I'll breed it to something

274
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,200
that really suits my grow to try to make

275
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:49,278
the offspring more suited to my style.

276
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,519
But if a plant doesn't work in my grow,

277
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,200
it's got to [ __ ] go, dude. So, um,

278
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,360
does it handle my style? Do we get

279
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,959
along? It's like dating a girl. Uh, if

280
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,399
she doesn't like riding around in my car

281
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,000
and being in my house, we obviously

282
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,278
aren't going to [ __ ] work out, right?

283
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,720
If she wants to be at a different

284
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,000
environment than me all the time, then

285
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,040
it's not going to work. The plants are

286
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,600
the same way. Then I wrote down smoke.

287
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,278
How are the turpps? How's the buzz? Um,

288
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
the buzz to me is what matters. You

289
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,879
know, it doesn't matter what it looks

290
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,480
like, how it grows in the end. Um, we're

291
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,799
going to smoke it. That's what really

292
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,959
[ __ ] matters. Do people do I want to

293
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:22,399
consume this product is the most

294
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,278
important thing. So, the one that you

295
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,039
want to smoke, choose that one. Um, it's

296
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:29,519
got to fit my agenda. I wrote, what is

297
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,399
the goal? Am I making hash plants? Am I

298
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,200
making um fast flowering plants? Am I

299
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,440
doing it for sales? Do I want uh fast

300
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,759
flowering, long flowering? Is there a

301
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,600
specific turpp or a specific trait or a

302
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,519
specific metal medical benefit which I'm

303
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,759
after? So many of these things would

304
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,919
play into my breeding. And then also if

305
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,240
you are going outdoors or if you're in a

306
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:52,078
room that gets powdery mildew, maybe

307
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,320
think about plants. Uh one of the traits

308
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,559
would be the plants that uh show the

309
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,160
least powdery mildew. If you put 10

310
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,599
plant, this is just hypothetical. I

311
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,679
don't know your environment. We could do

312
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,240
other stressors as well. If you've got

313
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,879
any stressor, you got 10 plants, the one

314
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,360
that is most resistant to the stress in

315
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,439
your room, drought, heat, humidity,

316
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,440
powdery mildew, spidermitites, whatever

317
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,760
appears in your room, that one plant

318
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,040
that goes, I don't get that. Breed to

319
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,639
that [ __ ] plant. That's going to

320
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:22,159
continue that trait. Hopefully, the

321
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,600
offspring have that trait. Um, I said do

322
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,958
both. Now, um, I gave you a list of

323
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,120
things that I would choose from.

324
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,439
Structure, shape, vigor. It's got to

325
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,039
handle my room. It's got to smoke well.

326
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,040
It's got to smell good. It's got to fit

327
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,078
my agenda. It's got to be the kind of

328
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,879
plants that I want to make. Um, and then

329
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,799
why not do both of them? And also, let's

330
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,240
think about, we said resistance. I think

331
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,759
we covered most of the things, the

332
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
traits that I would think about. So,

333
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,439
part of your question was which one

334
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
would be best suited for male flower. I

335
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,399
wouldn't stress too much about the best

336
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,399
suited for male flower. Best pollen

337
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,039
donor with the best traits is what I

338
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,519
would more focus on. And depending on

339
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:05,519
how a lot of this is going to depend on

340
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:08,959
the dominance and uh co-ominance of the

341
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,639
genes of these plants um or the

342
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,239
recessive traits and the dominant traits

343
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,759
when you throw these. So think about you

344
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,360
have just a bunch of red marbles and a

345
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,200
bunch of blue marbles. One plant makes

346
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,800
red marbles, one p plant makes blue

347
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,320
marbles. You're going to throw them into

348
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:21,359
a bowl. You're going to shake them and

349
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,760
then you're going to scoop them up.

350
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,839
Whatever comes in that scoop is the

351
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,200
traits that come with that plant. I

352
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,880
should get the camera down like this,

353
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
right? whatever colors are in that

354
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,039
little scoop are the traits that come in

355
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,119
that plant. So, all the traits from the

356
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,719
mom plant and the dad plant or the

357
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,799
pollen donor in this case is still the

358
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,800
dad plant. Uh, all those traits have

359
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,000
been thrown into a bowl. Some of them

360
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,159
are dominant, some of them are

361
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,600
recessive, some of them are co-ominant.

362
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:50,559
Some traits from mom, the mom plants,

363
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,560
mom plant will pop up into this mix. And

364
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,559
some plants from the dad on both sides,

365
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,319
mom and dad on both sides. A couple of

366
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:57,759
those marbles got thrown into this mix.

367
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,120
Those are the purple marbles. Hopefully,

368
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,519
you can identify them when you grow it

369
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:06,078
out. But all that [ __ ] ended up in your

370
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,078
scoop. It depends on how the genes of

371
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,479
these plants interact on what you're

372
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:12,479
going to get. Sometimes, uh, you get

373
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,759
exactly what you want. You can see what

374
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,000
you're going to create by looking. You

375
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,439
like, I got red here, I got blue here.

376
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,639
When I mix these, it should come out

377
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,639
purple, right? That's what you would

378
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,120
hope for as a breeder. Sometimes you're

379
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,120
going to see this plant leans more red

380
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,039
or it leans more blue or it's really

381
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,560
purple, but sometimes you're going to

382
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,078
get a orange [ __ ] plant. You're going

383
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,759
to go, "What the [ __ ] happened here?"

384
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,000
That's just the way the genetics can

385
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,838
happen sometimes. Uh sometimes you get a

386
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
bunch of blue plants and then a couple

387
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,839
of purple plants out of the mix. That's

388
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,958
just the way the gen the genetics can

389
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,920
mix. So selection is fun. Selection is

390
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,000
great, but you're going to have to

391
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,159
realize also that that the genes are

392
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,360
going to do their thing. So, let me

393
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,480
recap here because I've been talking for

394
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,919
a long time on this. I want to make sure

395
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,839
I answer your question. I gave you my

396
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,919
theory. Um, that the plants will tell

397
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,600
you like just by looking at them,

398
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,679
something in one will go, I'm the one

399
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,519
you should reverse. And listen to that.

400
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,359
You're not crazy. That's intuition and

401
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,639
that's strong. Listen to your gut. Uh,

402
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,959
it will tell you. Um, a question about

403
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,320
choosing a reversal. Okay. I got it from

404
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,838
effective structure. Probably half a

405
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,480
dozen. I think I gave you half a dozen

406
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,040
trades to think about here. Um,

407
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,959
everything else aside. Okay. Yeah. Uh, I

408
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,958
would get away from the notion about

409
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,278
which one is the best male flower

410
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,039
candidate. That's a good idea. Um,

411
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,320
unless you're making thousands of seeds

412
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,319
for production, that's not going to

413
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,839
matter. Both plants should make you a

414
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,720
decent amount of pollen. You should make

415
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,480
uh fem seeds from that. Uh, pick the one

416
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,240
that you like the best. The one that you

417
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,079
enjoyed the best that looks like the

418
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,159
goal is the one that I would reverse.

419
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,319
And then I would pollinate the other one

420
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,319
and a clone of the one you reversed as

421
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,680
well. And do other plants as well while

422
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,600
you're at it. Put a few other in that

423
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:49,838
room. just hit them and then run all of

424
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,199
those seeds and see what you've made. If

425
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,360
you've been listening to the podcast,

426
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,599
you understand why. I want to see if you

427
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,440
take chocolate and you put it on lemon,

428
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,120
strawberry, banana, and grape, I'm going

429
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,959
to forget all those. But I want to see

430
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,799
what the outcome is. Because if they all

431
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,159
come out with the chocolate turpp, we

432
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,399
know that's coming from the chocolate

433
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:08,159
plant. But if only one or two of them,

434
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,360
uh, if one plant has a certain trait

435
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:10,639
that could have came from the mother

436
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,879
plant in the breeding, we want to find

437
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,278
the commonalities that that dude is

438
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,120
adding to the mix. If they all come out

439
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,198
with [ __ ] if they all glow in the

440
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,879
dark that came from the male. Any trait

441
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,319
that all of the progyny has came from

442
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,720
the male. Any of the other [ __ ] that

443
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,560
seems rare in the crosses that you can't

444
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,560
identify from other batches is what the

445
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,439
female is providing. So that's why I'd

446
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,439
say hit a bunch. Uh structure, vigor,

447
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,399
handles my [ __ ] smokes good, fits my

448
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,720
agenda. Um and then what's to stop you

449
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,159
from doing it both ways? My dude, you

450
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,920
got me rambling pretty good on this

this amazing cannabis cultivation

00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,439
content. All right, let's keep going.

462
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,480
I've got another page here. This one

463
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,320
also came from the growhel tab on

464
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,519
iieirect. ienetics.com. Two different

465
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:14,079
websites. I direct for the seeds, I

466
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,759
genetics for all of the other stuff.

467
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,159
This one came from a friend who wants to

468
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,919
be called bum clat. Uh, welcome to the

469
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:24,078
party, bro. Um, the question says, uh,

470
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:25,599
weird question about seeds that I just

471
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,758
don't understand. This is a good

472
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,360
question because, um, this tails right

473
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,360
off of the last question that we just

474
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,759
asked. This is going to work well. It

475
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,560
says, "I have a plant that's growing

476
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,720
small towers of callalaxes and foxtails,

477
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,159
and the other four are growing in their

478
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,600
own special ways, but my question is,"

479
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,600
and then a little drum roll happened in

480
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,600
my head just now. Did you hear it? A

481
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,079
little drum roll going on. Anyways, it

482
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,278
says, "Is every pack of feminized seeds

483
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,000
going to produce a wide range of

484
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:55,519
phenotypes?" It's a really good

485
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,039
question, and I can't explain this. I

486
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,919
can't answer if yes or no, but I have

487
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,919
some input. Uh, then what's the point of

488
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,278
listing strain information if you plant

489
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:04,959
five seeds and all of them have

490
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,439
different morphology, smell, and other

491
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,720
traits? That makes sense. I get your

492
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,400
frustration. It says, "Is this just

493
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,078
something that happens with big seed

494
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,839
companies versus smaller guys? That

495
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,759
shouldn't be an issue. Uh, this is just

496
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,599
a breeding thing." Uh, I'm just trying

497
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,919
to determine if this is the case with

498
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,399
all seeds or just lazy breeders. It's

499
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,160
not really a lot of times I would call

500
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,720
out a lazy breeding technique. This is

501
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,840
not lazy breeding. This is how feminized

502
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,319
seeds work. This is a moment ago I gave

503
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,079
my analogy of pouring. So you've got

504
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:35,439
plant A and plant B. You got colored

505
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:36,879
marbles. You fill a bucket with the

506
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,640
colored marbles. You mix them. You take

507
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,880
a scoop. That is what you made

508
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:45,679
genetically with those plants.

509
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,280
Um fem seeds are usually first filial

510
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,759
generation. It is the first time that

511
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:52,399
they are made. Uh is the first cross

512
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,160
which means there is no stabilization

513
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,400
happening. In the cannabis realm, the

514
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,960
word stabilization is used incorrectly a

515
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,440
lot of the times. Uh it can be used for

516
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,200
sexual stabilization, but uh most of the

517
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,200
time when we say stabilization, what

518
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,080
we're talking about is phenotypical

519
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,679
stabilization across homo homo gez, I

520
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,439
can't even try to say it now. We want

521
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,360
uniform looking plants across a

522
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,279
population. Homozygous is the word that

523
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,079
my brain would not spit out there. We

524
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,240
want them to all look the same. So that

525
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,000
would take you two, three, four, or five

526
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,038
generations of breeding to get that

527
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,359
plant to to look homozygous. All of the

528
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,079
same. But with fem seeds, most of these

529
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,359
are S1's or R1's. I was just having a

530
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:32,720
conversation with this. I wanted to

531
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:35,279
explain it, but I wanted to save it here

532
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,400
for the podcast. Um, most of these are

533
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,639
S1's or R1's. An S1 is if I take one

534
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,400
plant, I take two copies of it, and I

535
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,840
self it. I take that pollen from the

536
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,840
golden goat, put the pollen on the

537
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,480
golden goat, I have selfed it. golden

538
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,879
goat to golden goat itself. Nobody else.

539
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,759
If I pick put the golden goat pollen on

540
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,039
any other plant that is an R1, that is a

541
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,160
reversal. So that's the difference

542
00:18:55,038 --> 00:19:00,319
between an S and an R. The self stuff,

543
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,160
you're going to find more uniformity

544
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,480
because we're not adding as many

545
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,160
ingredients. It is all golden goat.

546
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,160
Golden goat to golden goat. You should

547
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,679
get golden goat, right? The magic part

548
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,000
about breeding, the magic part about

549
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,000
genetics is you're going to see. So

550
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,079
golden goats obviously got parents. We

551
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,640
started with two golden goat plants, but

552
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,720
that plant had parents. It had um island

553
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,080
sweet skunk, Hawaiian sativa, Romulan

554
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,480
and its background. And those plants

555
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,798
have parents as well. So all of those

556
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,558
genes are all in this mix, which means

557
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,480
when you run the golden goat to golden

558
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,399
goat, you could see some island sweet

559
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,640
skunk, Hawaiian sativa, Ramulan

560
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,880
phenotypes pop out. Those are going to

561
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,600
be the outliers. Most of your phenotypes

562
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,880
will look like golden goat, but some are

563
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,879
going to represent the mom, the dad, the

564
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,039
grandma, the grandpa. Those will pop

565
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,559
through from both sides. Uh that's just

566
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:51,440
the way it's going to work with self

567
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:53,119
seeds with the S1s. Now, with the RS,

568
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,798
we're taking two different plants and

569
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,759
we're putting them together. So, we've

570
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,759
got the opportunity to see

571
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:03,038
representations. We hope as a breeder to

572
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,200
get I usually hope for a 50/50 mix. So,

573
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:09,279
if I throw um I'm going to do the

574
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:11,919
marbles analogy again. If I throw 50% 64

575
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:13,918
red marbles and 64 blue marbles when mix

576
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,160
them up when I make my scoop, I'm hoping

577
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,320
to get a bunch of purple marbles, right?

578
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,558
64 purple marbles out of that is what I

579
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,240
would hope for. But it's not going to

580
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,678
work that way because sometimes I'm

581
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,839
going to get marbles that, like I said

582
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,519
before, lean a little bit more red.

583
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,959
There's going to be marbles that lean a

584
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,960
little bit more blue. That's just how

585
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,519
it's going to go because this is the

586
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,519
first filial generation of this cross.

587
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:39,038
Even though it is an R1, even though it

588
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:41,038
may be an S1, it is also an F1, which

589
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,359
means it's got that F1 vigor, but it's

590
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,919
also got that hybridization where it

591
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:48,519
could show filial or phenotypes,

592
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,960
phenotypical expression. Expression

593
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:53,759
said, I'm not even going to edit that

594
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,000
phenotypical expression from both sides

595
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,079
uh and from further generations. It can

596
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,960
show you a lot of those expressions. So

597
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:04,000
that's why you're seeing differences. Um

598
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,558
your question is it lazy breeders? No,

599
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,200
it is. Um that's what when we're making

600
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:11,038
F1s, S1's, R1's, that's how it works

601
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,120
because there's no uh we haven't done

602
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:15,038
any stabilization work to make them more

603
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,038
uniform. That would take another

604
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:20,079
generation, two more generations to make

605
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,000
them uniform and stable. F1 seeds work

606
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,399
the same way. If you buy a bunch of F1s

607
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,640
from people, I sell a lot of F1s and

608
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,240
many people enjoy that F1 because it has

609
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,559
a lot of vigor and they can find the

610
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,240
phenotype that they like. Um, you're

611
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:33,599
going to find the phenotypes you like.

612
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,960
So, you say, why make a strain

613
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,558
description? Because we've narrowed it

614
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,640
down that it is pretty close to that.

615
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,480
You're going to get within this range.

616
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
We can't be perfectly accurate with it,

617
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,319
but we get pretty close. You'll notice

618
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,158
my descriptions are pretty close. A lot

619
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,079
of those are F1s, and I'm still nailing

620
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:49,679
it. I've often described it like maybe

621
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,918
you've decided you want Italian food.

622
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,759
So, you go to a website, you find seeds

623
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,679
that maybe look like Italian food. Be

624
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,359
creative with me here. Uh, you found

625
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,038
your favorite. You found a plant that

626
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,558
says tastes like strawberries and

627
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,079
bananas. And when you smoke it, it makes

628
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:03,359
your [ __ ] hair fly backward. You're

629
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,918
like, that's exactly what the [ __ ] I

630
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,000
want. Right. So, we go to the restaurant

631
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,200
that drive that [ __ ] u tastes like

632
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,720
strawberries and bananas, makes your

633
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,640
hair fly backward. We're in the right

634
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,640
restaurant. We've given you the menu.

635
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
Now, the the phenotypical expression,

636
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,919
the variation you may get, in my

637
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
opinion, that's like once you've got the

638
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,480
menu, I can go over and decide if I want

639
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,798
noki, if I want [ __ ] pennet pasta, if

640
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,519
I want spaghetti, uh if I want some meat

641
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,798
sauce, um you that's So, I've driven you

642
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,400
to the restaurant. Now, you just got to

643
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:32,400
choose the one on the menu that works

644
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,919
best for you. And now, that's where we

645
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,720
go back to choosing the one that works

646
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,720
best for your grow, your bong, your

647
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,640
customers, your wallet, whatever you're

648
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,798
growing for. We got to find the one that

649
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,559
works best for that. So, it's not a

650
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,759
weird question. I understand where

651
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:47,200
you're coming from. When we put a

652
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,839
description on a pack of seeds, you want

653
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,159
it to come out like that. But keep in

654
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,558
mind, these are na nature's [ __ ]

655
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,320
little beans. It's nature. It's natural.

656
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,558
This is genetics. There's going to be

657
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,439
variation. Just like if your mom and dad

658
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,279
made 20 babies, um they're not all going

659
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,360
to look the same. If your mom's got blue

660
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:06,798
eyes, your dad's got brown eyes, some

661
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,798
there's I'm sure that one of those

662
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:10,240
dominant is dominant in the breeding. I

663
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,480
haven't researched which is dominant,

664
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,919
blue or brown eyes, but some of your

665
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,279
siblings are going to have brown eyes.

666
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,600
Some are going to have blue eyes. And

667
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,359
maybe uh one or two of them may have

668
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,119
green eyes because grandma or grandpa

669
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:23,279
somewhere on the line had green eyes.

670
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:24,719
It's going to work that way. Maybe one

671
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:27,038
of your brothers and sisters is super

672
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,038
[ __ ] tall and the other guys are 5'8.

673
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,720
Just a phenotypical outlier. That's the

674
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:32,640
way genetics work. We wish we could

675
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,558
control it and manipulate it to be

676
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,000
[ __ ] I put pollen here, I put pollen

677
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,158
here, and tada, these are all going to

678
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,159
come out like clones. That is not the

679
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,559
way that genetics work. That it takes a

680
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,280
lot more work. It's not lazy breeding.

681
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,839
It's just when so with fem seeds, the

682
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:50,798
first filial generations of fems in my

683
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:53,279
experience uh are the best. After that,

684
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:54,879
you start unlocking weird [ __ ] Uh you

685
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,599
can make weird plants, mutants, things

686
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:01,520
that don't grow right. So S1's are the

687
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:04,000
best. F1 uh R1s are the best um for the

688
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:06,079
uh for the fems because um like when you

689
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,679
breed with an F2, a normal F2 reggg

690
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,918
seed, that's when you unlock Pandora's

691
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,400
box of phenotypes. That S2 is where a

692
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,640
lot of weird [ __ ] also happens. So

693
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:17,919
that's why we're doing it that way. Uh

694
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,320
my dude, um was your name? Bum Clot. I I

695
