[Music]

4
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:28,599
mother. Welcome back, podcast world. I'm

5
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:31,679
your host, Rosta Jeff. This is episode

6
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,039
878 of the Grow from Your Heart podcast.

7
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,280
You know, I've got another fun episode

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,759
lined up for us. In today's show, I'm

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,439
going to give away free seeds. Hang out.

10
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,439
We'll talk more about those free seeds a

11
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,960
little bit later on in the show. Before

12
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:45,679
we get too far, I do want to wish

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,000
everybody a happy 420. That's right.

14
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:51,759
This episode will come out on 419. I

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,719
hope everybody has a safe and stony 420.

16
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,640
It would not be 420 without a 420 sale

17
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,439

18

everything will be acin infiniti. I am

35
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,200
slowly upgrading. I recommend acinfinity

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,759
gear. Make sure you check acinfinity.com

37

00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:48,959

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:51,520

a 20% discount at

47
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,639
acinfinity.com. All right, I think that

48
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:10,878
covers all of the news here at the start

49
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,039
of the show. Let's work our way into the

50
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,120
question and answer portion of today's

51
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,959
podcast. At the start of the show, I

52
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,920
said that I was going to give away free

53
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:23,640
seeds. This is how you win free seeds. I

54
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:25,439
have a website. That website is

55
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:27,598
iiegenetics.com. At the top of that

56
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:29,759
website, there is a row of tabs. One of

57
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,238
those tabs does say growl or grow

58
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:34,079
questions. If you click on that tab, you

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,640
are given the opportunity to send me a

60
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,319
grow question. If you send a good grow

61
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:40,799
question and I read that question here

62
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,479
on the podcast, I will send you a coupon

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,680
code for a free pack of seeds at ire

64
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:47,679
redirect.com. Today's first question

65
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,280
came from the growh help tab. It came

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,319
from my new friend who wants to be

67
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,479
called HDB. Shout out to my buddy HD

68
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:56,639
Ben. Ben, make sure you check your inbox

69
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,119
and check your spam because you have got

70
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,598
a coupon code for a free pack of seeds.

71
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
Ben's question goes just like this. It

72
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,759
says, "Yo, this is Ben. Uh, I've got a

73
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
great question from a new grower. All

74
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:10,959
right, I like this question a lot. It

75
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,878
says, "I have a tent, a light, a clip-on

76
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,120
fan, controller 69, and an exhaust fan.

77
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,518
I need a humidifier and a tent heater

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,759
and a few other small details. What

79
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
would you buy and in what order would

80
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,158
you buy them for a new grower?" This is

81
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,000
a really good question. He wraps it up

82
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,719
with, I appreciate the help and I

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
appreciate what you are doing for the

84
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,840
community. Yo, I'm thank I'm thankful

85
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,680
that you notice what I'm doing for the

86
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,598
community. Uh I'm grateful for the great

87
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,719
message and I'm glad that you trust me

88
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,639
to guide you through this. Um now you've

89
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,239
got a great setup here and of course

90
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,719
most of what I'm going to recommend is

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,560
going to be from AC Infiniti. Um you

92
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,799
cannot beat AC Infinity when it comes to

93
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,959
homegrow equipment. So yes, a lot of

94
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,480
this stuff is going to be uh blatantly

95
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,400
I'm going to recommend AC Infinity gear.

96
00:03:55,479 --> 00:04:00,479
Acinfinity.com coupon code IE army. Uh

97
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
that code is good on Amazon. That code

98
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,560
is good on Etsy. That code is good on

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,719
the AC Infinity store. That'll get you

100
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,878
10% off all the time. If you shop during

101
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,239
the sale, you will save 20%. I'm going

102
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:12,639
to say that a lot of times in this

103
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,920
episode, but um the things that I

104
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,679
recommend you should buy, you've got a

105
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:17,279
tent, so you've got the main enclosure.

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
That's a great thing to start with.

107
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,879
You've got a light. Is it a good light?

108
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,959
I would put a good light in there. The

109
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:24,560
best light that you can, uh the best

110
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,239
light you can afford, the best light you

111
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,000
can power, and the best light you can

112
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,840
cool. Those are three things to think

113
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,918
about. Can you afford the light? That's

114
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,000
the most uh biggest obstacle there. Can

115
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,519
you afford to run the light? Uh do you

116
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,120
have enough electricity in the house? Do

117
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,279
you have a breaker available for that

118
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,800
light? And can you cool it? Because that

119
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,559
light is going to create heat in your

120
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,879
environment. You need to cool that

121
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,439
light, that environment some way. So get

122
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:49,040
the best light that you can. Um you said

123
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,439
you have exhaust, so you're probably

124
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,680
exhausting that. Did you say that you

125
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,199
have a filter? I don't see the word

126
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,199
filter in here. I would recommend a

127
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,879
carbon filter. Since you've got the

128
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,639
exhaust, you probably have a carbon

129
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,319
filter on there, but I would recommend

130
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,160
that just for a little piece of mind, a

131
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,000
little safety. You've got a really and a

132
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,160
controller 69. So, I feel like you've

133
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,720
got a tent package. Uh you're off to a

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,360
really good start. You do uh indicate

135
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,600
that you do need a humidifier and a fan

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,199
heater or a tent heater, which uh

137
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,280
depending on where you live, I never

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
need um some things I don't need. I

139
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,038
don't need a dehumidifier because I live

140
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:25,120
in a dry space. It's going to be uh the

141
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,639
humidity. I like to keep the humidity.

142
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,160
So depending on where you are, you will

143
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,240
need certain things and won't need some

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,479
things. But yes, I can make some

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
recommendations to kind of upgrade your

146
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,399
grow experience. Um, you've got the

147
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,478
tent, the light, the exhaust, the

148
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,478
filter, the fans. We've got the AC

149
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,719
controller. Uh, maybe think about

150
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,639
upgrading to that AI controller might be

151
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,720
something else you want to upgrade to.

152
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,639
Uh, but something I would recommend, and

153
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,360
this is not anything that I am sponsored

154
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,199
by, but I like cameras in my grow

155
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,439
environment. You've got the ACI

156
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,879
controller 69. You can look on your

157
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,639
phone and you can see the temperature,

158
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,120
the VPD, you can read a lot of things

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,199
based on what gear you've got. If you've

160
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
got a camera in there, you can see the

161
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,680
plants. I like being able to look at the

162
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,199
plants. If I'm away and I'm like, man, I

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,879
kind of I'm having fun at this gathering

164
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,800
or playing music with friends or at a

165
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,079
drum circle, I know that the lights came

166
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,199
on. I kind of want to check on the

167
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,560
plants. Don't want to stop what I'm

168
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
doing, drive all the way home to go

169
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,478
check on plants. Uh, I can just open up

170
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,479
the controller or open up the uh the app

171
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:24,719
on my cameras and I can I can open up

172
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,240
the controller 69 and see the VPD, but

173
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,680
then I can open up the app and I can

174
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,000
look at the plants and see that they're

175
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,560
actually okay with my Wise cameras. I

176
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,560
use just basic Wise cameras for that. I

177
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,079
got a very good deal on Wise cameras on

178
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,319
Black Friday. I bought a three-pack

179
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,318
bundle. Um, I'm going to buy a lot more.

180
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,759
Those are great cameras. So, cameras in

181
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,560
the grow. They give me a lot of peace of

182
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,038
mind. Uh, they go very well with the uh

183
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,959
the AC Infinity Controller 69. and I can

184
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,240
see the temperature, the humidity. I can

185
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,159
see a lot of things and now I can

186
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,079
actually look at the plants. If you open

187
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
up my phone on the front page on the

188
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:57,680
bottom, those two apps are right there

189
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,839
because I open them up a lot. So,

190
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,918
cameras are something I would check out.

191
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,318
Uh, then something just to make the day

192
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:06,318
better in the grow, a Bluetooth speaker

193
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,280
or some AirPods. I've always got some

194
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:12,000
music, a podcast or the Discord crew in

195
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,079
my ear keeping me entertained. Another

196
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
thing I can recommend, uh, and these

197
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,719
next two things, three or four things

198
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,639
are very small items that are available

199
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,520
through

200
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,800
acfinity.com that you might not even

201
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,318
have thought about, but they will make

202
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,560
your grow experience a little bit

203
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,360
better, more enjoyable, and easier, and

204
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,918
more successful. AC Infiniti sells a

205
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,199
sprayer. It is a pesticide sprayer or a

206
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:37,038
folure feed sprayer. It plugs into a USB

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
and you can charge it up and then you

208
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,159
press the button and it sprays for you.

209
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,478
Um, I did not realize how obnoxious it

210
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,800
was pumping a sprayer all the time. This

211
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:48,079
bad dog, you plug it in and you f you

212
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,000
plug it in and you charge it. Then you

213
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,918
can unplug it and it's portable and that

214
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
bad dog [ __ ] sprays for you. It saves

215
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,519
your wrist. It saves whatever muscle you

216
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,199
were using. You don't have to do that

217
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:59,359
now. It's a little bit nicer and you get

218
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,960
the consistent spray all the time. You

219
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,560
don't get that. I pumped it 40 times.

220
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:05,439
It's good for a few. Got to pump it 40

221
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,399
more. It stays even all the time. So AC

222
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,399
Infiniti sells a pesticide sprayer or

223
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,198
any powered sprayer that you can find. I

224
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:16,878
do recommend that. Uh where are we now?

225
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,598
There is a leaf surface VPD gun

226
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,000
available from AC Infinity. I highly

227
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,959
recommend that. If you are running LED

228
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,800
lights, the temperature of the air in

229
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,799
the room and the leaf surface

230
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,720
temperature could be drastically

231
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
different. In my room, it varies as much

232
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,519
as 5 to nine degrees depending on the

233
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,278
day, the heat, the time of the year. But

234
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,560
the only way to find that out is to get

235
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:42,879
a leaf surface temperature gun that

236
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:45,039
measures VPD of the leaf surface

237
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:48,399
temperature as well. You can put that

238
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,000
data into your ACI controller 69 and

239
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,440
that will help you offset your leaf

240
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,278
surface temperature and give you more

241
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,519
accurate readings on what's going on in

242
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:59,039
your room. So, that little VPD gun is

243
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,879
very useful. Well, not only will it tell

244
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,319
you the temperature and the leave and

245
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,080
the VPD of your leave surface

246
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,920
temperature, but it helps you dial in

247
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,959
the room a little bit better by putting

248
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,278
that data into the controller 69.

249
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:15,278
Another thing you can add on would be a

250
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,360
pH meter and an EC meter uh or a ppm

251
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:19,120
meter. Um, that's all in one meter. If

252
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,680
you get it through acin infiniti.com,

253
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,039
they've got that one combo meter. I

254
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,519
recommend that you've got to adjust your

255
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,759
EC, you got to check your pH. Why not

256
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,320
use the ACI meter to go with everything

257
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,879
else we've got? Um, a heater, an air

258
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,720
conditioner. Do you need those devices?

259
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,958
I use a little rolling Solius 14,000 BTU

260
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,519
air conditioner. Uh, and it ducks out of

261
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:43,679
a window. Uh, unfortunately, I can't use

262
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,200
a window unit where my grow is because

263
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,519
it's in a basement. There's not a window

264
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,080
that would work. So, I use the Solius

265
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,039
rolling air conditioner. It's 14,000

266
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,879
BTUs. I don't cool just the tent. I cool

267
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,360
the entire room in which the tents are

268
00:09:54,879 --> 00:10:00,159
in and then duct that cool air into the

269
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,480
tent as needed. Uh just a little bit. Uh

270
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:04,240
I'm using a lung room essentially to

271
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,000
control the climate in the lung room. So

272
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,560
that's the way I'm doing that. Uh

273
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,919
humidifier and

274
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,399
dehumidifier. I don't necessarily need

275
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,479
either one of those. I live in Colorado.

276
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,480
It is quite dry here. We don't get a lot

277
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,839
of humidity problems. Uh and the way

278
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,240
that my room is set up, like I said,

279
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:22,399
I've got the tents and another room. So

280
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,399
the humidity gets ducted out of the tent

281
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,559
into the room and then when the room

282
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,399
reaches a certain humidity that actually

283
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,319
has another extraction that blows the

284
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,720
heat and humidity out of that room to

285
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,879
bring in fresh air. So I don't need the

286
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,800
dehumidifier or humidifier. I just use

287
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,399
the lung room to kind of make that work.

288
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,639
I use the moisture of the plants for my

289
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,519
humidity. But those are things that you

290
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,919
just might need. Um also those devices,

291
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,078
the air conditioner, the humidifier and

292
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:49,759
dehumidifier, those are going to be high

293
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,759
electricity items. So, make sure that

294
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,799
you're running enough uh electrical for

295
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:54,958
those. Make sure you have enough

296
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,958
breakers and amperage available for

297
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,679
those things. So, I think I covered a

298
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,359
lot of the gear. Um cameras. Uh I like

299
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,958
to see the room. Sprayers because I want

300
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,600
to spray my [ __ ] once a week, maybe

301
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,719
twice. VPD gun, I can get that VPD

302
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,800
dialed in. EC, PH, and PPM meter so I

303
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,320
can get the feed dialed in properly.

304
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,879
Heater, air conditioner, get the

305
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,879
environment dialed in. Be so [ __ ]

306
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:18,399
careful with the heater. Uh, grow room

307
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,320
heaters, always any kind of heater,

308
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,480
space heater, portable heater, that's

309
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,240
heat. That is a step away from fire.

310
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
That always makes me [ __ ] nervous. Be

311
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,000
careful with that. Humidifier,

312
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,159
dehumidifier, you understand what to do

313
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,639
with that. I said a growroom speaker. If

314
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,078
you got a JBL speaker, some AirPods,

315
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,278
something like that, that will always

316
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,958
make the grow more enjoyable. And if you

317
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:40,958
can get some sort of dedicated music

318
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,039
player for the grow, uh if you can just

319
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,439
leave some music on all the time, I

320
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:48,078
really think that the plants enjoy

321
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,320
music. Um they enjoy probably what you

322
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,239
enjoy, maybe. I'm not sure. But I think

323
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,399
plants feel the vibration of the music.

324
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,480
I like music. It makes me feel away.

325
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,278
Even if I don't like the music, it makes

326
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,879
me feel away. And that still counts. So

327
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:02,958
I think music in the grove is a good

328
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:06,639
thing. Um, a real simple thing you can

329
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:09,599
pick up a broom and a dustpan and a mop

330
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,278
and a bucket. Uh, clean that [ __ ] Uh,

331
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
clean growroom will make you proud. A

332
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,559
clean growroom will make you feel good.

333
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
You'll want to be in there more. Um,

334
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:18,078
organize that [ __ ] Get some shelves in

335
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,720
there. Clean that and organize it real

336
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,399
nice. Uh, and then a trash can. A trash

337
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,759
can with a lid on it. The kind that you

338
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,600
could step on it and the lid pops up and

339
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,838
you let go and it closes. That is the

340
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,120
kind of can that I would prefer. Then

341
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,560
some other things we could jump into

342
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,278
just to kind of bougie up the grow

343
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,879
space. Good measuring devices. How are

344
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,240
you measuring your nutrients? Are you

345
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,159
[ __ ] struggling or do you have it

346
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,919
figured out? Take a minute, research

347
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,439
what works best for you. Do you just

348
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:42,559
want to pour it into a measuring cup? Do

349
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,880
you Are you the guy that uses the

350
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,039
[ __ ] syringe type thing? What works

351
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,480
the best for you? Is your watering setup

352
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,639
the way that you want it to be? Are you

353
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,959
pouring into a 5gallon bucket then using

354
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,320
a pitcher? Are you auto watering? Now's

355
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,000
the time to think about how to make the

356
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,320
watering environment, the watering

357
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,839
situation the best you can for your

358
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,278
needs, your environment, your time, your

359
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:05,360
capabilities. Um, I'm a big dude and

360
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:07,519
getting to the back right corner of a

361
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,959
grow tent, uh, can be a pain in the ass.

362
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,480
That left corner, I can unzip the side

363
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,479
on the ACI. The right one, it's against

364
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,480
the wall, can't [ __ ] get back there.

365
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,079
That's hard to get to. So, do you need

366
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,278
to build an auto watering system? Is

367
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,838
there something you can improve with

368
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:23,838
that? That is something to think about.

369
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,760
What about proper nutrient and pesticide

370
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,720
storage? Do you have these products in a

371
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:30,319
safe storage area where uh maybe kids

372
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,920
can't get to it, your pets can't get to

373
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,200
it, they're not going to get spilled,

374
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,039
they're not going to get too hot, not

375
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,480
going to get too cold, the bottles are

376
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,799
not exposed to sunlight. That's

377
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
something people overlook. Um nutrient

378
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:43,039
and pesticide storage. Do you have

379
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,119
somewhere safe to store that stuff? How

380
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,039
about good personal protective

381
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,120
equipment? I know this is um just

382
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,958
details at this point, but get yourself

383
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,759
a couple of Tyveck suits. Get a couple

384
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,518
of good masks. Get some good goggles. If

385
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,958
you're working with pesticides and

386
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,360
nutrients, you might want some good

387
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,799
goggles. I recommend it. Um what kind of

388
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
hair situation do you have? I got

389
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:06,319
dreadlocks. Get some [ __ ] to tie up your

390
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:08,240
dreadlocks. Customize that situation. Um

391
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,480
then you got all the personal protective

392
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,839
equipment. Buy boxes and boxes of rubber

393
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,079
gloves. You're going to need the [ __ ]

394
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,920
out of those. Uh then what about

395
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,919
nutrients and pesticides? Do you have

396
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,439
all the the quality nutrients and

397
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,198
pesticides that you need? Do you have a

398
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,720
good base nutrient? Do you have a good

399
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,159
bloom booster? Do you have a good cow

400
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,800
mag? Do you have a good potassium

401
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:29,519
silicate? Uh what about maybe some amino

402
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:32,639
acids? What are you using for microbes?

403
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,120
What are you using for a tarp enhancer?

404
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,959
Um just what what's your nutrient mix?

405
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,639
Is that dialed in? Think about that

406
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:40,638
because that's your fuel. Your light and

407
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,240
your nutrients are a big part of how

408
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,560
your plants fuel themsel fuel

409
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,000
themselves. So, let's think about that.

410
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:50,479
Pesticides. Do you have a good pesticide

411
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,799
rotation? What about maybe um a dry

412
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,959
erase board or a notebook to write down

413
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,719
your nutrient mix and your pesticide

414
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,719
rotation? Maybe just use an app in your

415
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,040
phone, but write this [ __ ] down

416
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,278
somewhere also. So, good pesticides. Do

417
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,078
you have a decent pesticide rotation? Do

418
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,360
you have two or three three or four

419
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:09,838
pesticides that are that are based on

420
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,800
different uh base products which I'm

421
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,800
saying what I'm trying to say is

422
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,479
different modes of attack. Uh do you

423
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,479
have something that is a pythine base

424
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,959
and a hazideractinbased and then

425
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,199
possibly like a basillusbased product

426
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,119
and then um whatever else you want to

427
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,479
mix into there. I've got three or four

428
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,320
different products I mix through. I

429
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,399
rotate them. I spray once a week. That

430
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,639
means four products will last me most of

431
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,958
the time last one month long and then I

432
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:38,799
can just start the rotation over. Um, it

433
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:40,559
is Evergreen, Azamax, Botanagard, and

434
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,639
uh, Venerate. That's the That's the

435
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:46,719
process right there. Um,

436
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,560
Azamax, Evergreen, Venerate, and

437
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,639
Botanagard Max. Those are the four that

438
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,239
are generally in my rotation. I'll

439
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,399
switch some [ __ ] in and out once in a

440
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:57,919
while, but step up your pesticide game

441
00:15:54,399 --> 00:16:01,120
if you have not done that already. Um,

442
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,679
where are we? Oh, upgrade every room

443
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,519
slowly as you learn. When you're in the

444
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,278
room, what do you see? What could you

445
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,679
make? So, first of all, you know what

446
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:12,240
equipment you don't like? What sucks?

447
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,838
Fix that [ __ ] Slowly improve that.

448
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,839
Then, what do you want to make better?

449
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,360
This is like building a car. Uh, this is

450
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,560
like building a drum set. This is like

451
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,320
building a a [ __ ] AR-15. Um, it never

452
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,078
comes out of the box you way the way you

453
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,839
want it. You got to put accessories and

454
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,919
[ __ ] on it. The grow room is that way as

455
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,680
well. So, what do you want to customize?

456
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,679
What does your light suck? Does your

457
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,758
blower suck? If it's AC infinity, it

458
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,000
doesn't. But if it's not AC, what needs

459
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,240
to be upgraded? So, that's what I'm

460
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,799
talking about. Upgrade each room slowly

461
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,959
as you learn. And then I put a big star

462
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,719
here. It says, "Do not overlook the

463
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,319
importance of your veg and mother

464
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,639
areas." Everybody focuses on the flower

465
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,639
room. We want that [ __ ] rockstar

466
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,639
flower environment. The best lights, the

467
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,320
best blower, all your shit's in there.

468
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,159
Your meters are in there. You know

469
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,000
exactly what's going on at Auto Waters

470
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,000
at nine o'clock. Everything is [ __ ]

471
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,600
perfect, but your veg room looks like a

472
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,279
trailer park exploded and you took all

473
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,519
the leftover parts and made a grow room

474
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,838
out of it. Let's focus a little bit on

475
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,838
that grow on the veg and the mom

476
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,119
environment because the mom is where the

477
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,359
clones come from. If you don't have

478
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,798
healthy mother plants or clone donors,

479
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,519
what are you starting with? You need a

480
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:21,519
healthy mom plant or a clone donor or

481
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,759
somewhere to get those clones. Then we

482
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:25,519
need a healthy veg environment. This is

483
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,038
where we're starting everything. These

484
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:29,279
are the building blocks. This is step

485
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,960
one. If you [ __ ] up from day one, by the

486
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,440
time you get to day 120, you're going to

487
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,840
be really [ __ ] up. If you set yourself

488
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,080
up for success by having a healthy mom

489
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:40,079
environment, a perfect cloning

490
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,480
environment, a beautiful small veg

491
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,079
environment, a really tight large veg

492
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,160
environment, and then transition

493
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,038
smoothly into a really souped-up flower

494
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,519
room, everything will be real nice. So,

495
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:54,160
don't forget to upgrade that veg area,

496
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,639
the mom area, the clone area. Those

497
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,640
plants are just as important, if not

498
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,000
more important, than the flowering area.

499
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,759
That's what's coming up. That is the

500
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,119
future. That's the [ __ ] children.

501
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:06,400
That's what's going to be your next

502
00:18:03,119 --> 00:18:07,839
adult plant. So, love that room. And

503
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,600
once you've got everything all souped up

504
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,879
and all perfect, what else are we going

505
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,558
to buy? Do you have good scissors? Do

506
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,640
you have a way to clean those scissors?

507
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,480
Uh, do you have a trim bin? We'll get to

508
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,520
that. I'm jumping ahead of myself. What

509
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,279
about a clone machine? I prefer the easy

510
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,759
cloners. I think those work the best for

511
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,200
me, for what I'm trying to do. Do you

512
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,558
have an easy cloner? Maybe that's

513
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,279
something you want to try. That'll make

514
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,879
your clones uh much more robust. If that

515
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,759
works for the way you're growing, do

516
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,160
that research there. Um I said a veg

517
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,279
area. How is your veg area set up? Do

518
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,960
you have a good light? Do you have

519
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,519
plenty of fans in there? Do you have

520
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,880
your auto watering system in there? Um

521
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,798
do you have a tray on the floor in the

522
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,799
veg area like you do in the flower area

523
00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,639
or are you cheaping out in there? Soup

524
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,720
it up. Make it easy. Take as much pride

525
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,759
in there. the bloom area. We've already

526
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,440
talked about that. Uh harvest. Just a

527
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,400
second ago, I asked about a trim bin.

528
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,000
How is your harvest set up? Do you have

529
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, I'm going to say now, how about a

530
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,679
good camera? How about a good magnifying

531
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,038
glass? One of the kind of magnifiers

532
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,038
that hooks up to your computer so you

533
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,119
can see the tricoms. That's something to

534
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:10,960
think about. Uh but how's your harvest

535
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:12,558
setup? Do you have a comfortable chair?

536
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,798
Do you have a good light? Do you have a

537
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,918
trim bin? Um like I said a moment ago,

538
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:17,440
do you have a scope to check the

539
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
tricoms? Do you have a good camera to

540
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,880
take good photos of these buds? How is

541
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,559
your harvest area? Then the last step of

542
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,039
course, well, not there's one more after

543
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,960
this, but how is your dry and cure

544
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,798
environment? Do you have a good safe,

545
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,679
secure area that you can control the

546
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:35,599
environment for your dry and cure? Some

547
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,519
people are building grow tents with an

548
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,759
air conditioner in that grow tent just

549
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:42,160
for drying and curing their weed. How is

550
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:43,759
your dry and cure environment? Then how

551
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,200
is your storage? What are you storing

552
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,160
your dried and cured and finished

553
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,160
product in? Then once you've mastered

554
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,080
all of this, then you get to go buy

555
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,759
yourself how about a rosin press? I

556
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,678
didn't even write that [ __ ] down. How

557
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,279
about some bubble bags and a rosin

558
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,880
press? That's probably the next [ __ ] to

559
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,879
buy, right? You got to make some bubble

560
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,960
bags, whip out some good bubble. Then

561
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,880
you got to turn that into rosin. Then

562
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,240
here's where I was headed. Once you got

563
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,039
all this [ __ ] figured out, we get to

564
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,200
celebrate and go buy a really [ __ ]

565
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:15,359
nice rig, a banger, um a pillar, a carb

566
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,360
cap, and then depends on if you're a

567
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,639
caveman or not, you get to get a torch

568
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,558
or the dail torchless heating system. Um

569
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,919
but then you get a cool rig and a dab

570
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:24,798
right. You need a dab right so you're

571
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,919
taking your dabs at the right

572
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,279
temperature. Shout out to Dabbrite.

573
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,960
Dabight sponsor me, bro. Um, this

574
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,798
episode is not officially brought to you

575
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,720

576
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,240

577

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
products I use the most in my

586

consumption environment. Shout out to

587

00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,359

589
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:01,279
dabs, get some good con, make some good

590

00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:06,879
just got and enjoy that whole process.

592
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,880
Buy yourself a really cool rig and enjoy

593
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,400
that. My dude, you got me on a super

594
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,000
good ramble. We went from the beginning

595
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,240
to the end here from all the [ __ ] to buy

596
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,679
to the grow. Then we're pressing it and

597
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,120
then we're [ __ ] dabbing it. There's

598
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,120
no more left. Nothing left to do but

599
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,879
smile, smile, smile. After that, bro, go

600
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,719
outside, have some fun, get some

601
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,240
sunshine on your skin, go see some

602
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,600
music. All right, my dude. Uh HD Ben, I

603
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,720

604

question. Thank you for the great

605
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,519

610
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,120
keep this great momentum going. I've got

611
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,200
another question here in front of me.

612
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,158
This one also did come from the growhelp

613
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,120
tab on

614
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:50,960
eriegenetics.com. This one came from our

615
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,798
new friend Chris. Shout out to my buddy

616
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,558
Chris. Make sure you check your inbox

617
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,918
because you've got a coupon code for a

618
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:57,918
free pack of seeds at

619
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,519
iedirect.com. All right, this question

620
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,839
goes like this. It says, "When you see

621
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,798
strain information about the parents of

622
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,639
a strain and it has three parents, does

623
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,879
that mean they pollinated one female

624
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,559
with two males to get that strain?" No,

625
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
that's not what happened. It said, "Is

626
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,639
that even possible?" Yes, that is

627
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,079
possible. But you would have the seeds

628
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,520
wouldn't have two dads. It would be each

629
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,759
seed would have a different daddy and

630
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,279
the same mom is how that would go. Um,

631
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:24,558
it says, "I hope this is not a stupid

632
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:26,960
question." No, it's not at all. This has

633
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:29,279
actually come up a few times. Um, I love

634
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,519
your show uh and your seeds. I got some

635
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,519
fist bump and some table seeds, bro. I

636
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,679
plan to restock the table seeds for the

637
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,720
420 sale, by the way. So, make sure you

638
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,480
check for table seeds at ire

639
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,640
redirect.com. Uh, but it says, "I cannot

640
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,240
wait from your new friend, Chris."

641
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,120
Chris, thank you for the great question.

642
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,359
So, what Chris is asking or my

643
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,918
understanding of what Chris is asking. A

644
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,000
lot of times when we see a new strain,

645
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,880
I've got a good example of this right

646
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,038
now. You're going to see um so I've got

647
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,200
a label that says uh Cherry

648
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:05,519
Paloma X skunk one. That's in

649
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,000
parenthesis. Cherry Paloma to skunk

650
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:12,158
number one is in parenthesis. And then

651
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,919
that is X blueberry F5. So, what is

652
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,640
going on there? Why are there three

653
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,880
plants? Because what happened was the

654
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,120
cherry skunk or the that that's what it

655
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,120
became. But the cherry paloma to skunk

656
00:23:21,119 --> 00:23:25,199
number one, it didn't have an official

657
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,599
name for a little while. So, it just got

658
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,600
labeled uh whatever why I keep calling

659
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,119
it the cherry paloma to skunk number

660
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,279
one. That's what it was called for a

661
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,678
while. It didn't get an official name.

662
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,720
Not every plant gets an official name.

663
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,919
Not everything has um like like like

664
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,279
that's the best I could say it. Not

665
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,840
everything has an official name. So you

666
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,918
just list it as the cross. So before it

667
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,399
became Cherry skunk and got an official

668
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,600
name, it was just written as Cherry

669
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,159
Paloma X skunk one. That was what that

670
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,918
cross is before it got a name. Now when

671
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,720
you breed to that, you're going to put

672
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,320
an X. And here's a rule that I wish

673
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,200
everybody would follow. This is a

674
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:05,038
horicultural ind industry standard. When

675
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,798
it comes to botany, horiculture,

676
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,319
flowers, other industries that are not

677
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:14,119
cannabis, it is customary in a breeding

678
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:17,038
project to list ladies first. So

679
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:19,759
anytime, so I just said cherry paloma to

680
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,839
skunk one. There's no question to an

681
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:24,798
experienced cultivator that the cherry

682
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,959
paloma I said it first, that's the girl.

683
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,440
Skunk one, I said it second. That is the

684
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,120
boy. So cherry paloma to skunk one, we

685
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,200
know the girl to the boy. That's how

686
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,719
that usually goes. So, we're going to go

687
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,120
back to the cherry skunk. We got cherry

688
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,120
paloma skunk one in parenthesis. Now,

689
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,439
I'm going to put an X next to that and

690
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:43,359
I'm going to write blueberry. Now, what

691
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,159
the [ __ ] is going on here? What that

692
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:49,278
indicates is I took the what is now

693
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,880
called cherry skunk, the cherry paloma,

694
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,119
blueberry in parenthesis. The

695
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,799
parenthesis indicate that is one plant.

696
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,038
That's what the parenthesis the the

697
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,119
brackets there are for. And then we x

698
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,759
that the new thing on the other side of

699
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,759
that x should be the new male. So that

700
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,960
means I've now pollinated the cherry

701
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:08,720
skunk with the blueberry. So usually

702
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,240
that's how that's going to work in my

703
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,558
labeling. That's how that's going to

704
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,960
work. The reason that you saw three

705
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,798
plants there and depending on where your

706
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,319
parentheses are, whatever is in the

707
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:19,679
parenthesis that is I'm going to quit

708
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:22,319
saying that word because I hate the word

709
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,038
now. Whatever's in that box is one

710
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,480
plant. So you could put and this is

711
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:27,759
going to get convoluted. I might need to

712
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,880
get a pen and paper to make this [ __ ]

713
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:34,240
work in my brain. You could do uh Golden

714
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,200
Goat X Daybreaker in parenthesis and

715
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,480
then you could cross that. It would go X

716
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:44,798
to uh let's pick another strain, Jack

717
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,240
the Ripper X arise and that's the

718
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,158
convergence is what that is. And you

719
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,440
could cross those two things together

720
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,679
and that's going to make a whole new

721
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,679
thing. So that's two crosses, two two

722
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,519
crosses. kind of what the breeder is

723
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:57,120
doing there is letting you know a little

724
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,400
bit of pedigree, a little bit of

725
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:00,479
prominence, a little bit of history

726
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,640
about that plant is what they're trying

727
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
to do. Oftent times it just becomes

728
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,240
[ __ ] confusing for a new breeder, for

729
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,080
a new grower, for somebody reading these

730
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,038
labels. So what we're trying to do is

731
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:14,558
let you know what the parents are. Um,

732
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:17,440
now maybe you'll see a bracket and then

733
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:21,278
uh an equation in parenthesis. So, we'll

734
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:26,640
have bracket uh parentheses golden goat

735
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:29,759
times daybreaker parentheses x um lemon

736
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,759
Jeffrey bracket. That's all one [ __ ]

737
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,919
plant. That's all one plant because it's

738
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:35,200
in that bracket. That's all one plant.

739
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,278
But it was whatever was in the

740
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,679
parenthesis bred to the one outside of

741
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,759
it. That's one plant. And then there

742
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,960
would be an X to breed that to something

743
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,558
else. So, usually, and it depends on

744
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,000
where the guys are putting or and gals,

745
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:49,440
there are a lot of ladybreeders in the

746
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,558
game now. Welcome. It's good, great to

747
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,320
have you. There's a lot of people

748
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,240
putting the parenthesis in weird places,

749
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,678
and it just depends on where the

750
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,599
parenthesis and the X and the bracket

751
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:01,440
lies. So, you're going to have a female

752
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,918
plant to a male plant most of the time.

753
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,480
But how is that broken down? That's also

754
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,720
going to be female plant to male plant

755
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,960
and female plant to male plant. So, it's

756
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,558
kind of algebra, but it's not as

757
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,480
difficult as our brains want it to be

758
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:20,200
once we figure it out. Uh, just think of

759
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:23,759
it as boy girl times boy girl

760
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:25,679
or boy girl times boy because right you

761
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,558
could cross two plants that don't have a

762
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,080
name to a boy and then that could also

763
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,918
be crossed to a bunch of other [ __ ] on

764
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,839
the other side. So, once you understand

765
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,759
once it clicks in it'll all make sense.

766
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,959
It's not nearly as hard as we want it to

767
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,400
be. The boy should be first. The lady

768
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,600
should be first, girl should be second

769
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,960
every time. I'm not even going to edit

770
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:44,399
that. I'm just trying to catch up with

771
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,440
my own brain. I'm telling me where we

772
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,240
are now, not you. Uh, ladies first, male

773
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,840
second, and then that applies to

774
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,599
everything on this side of the X. That

775
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:55,759
was probably the lady, and on this side

776
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:58,079
is probably the boy. I'm just [ __ ]

777
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,200
confusing both of us at this point. So,

778
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,480
what how we're going to do it now is,

779
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,240
bro, just go get your free seeds and

780
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,159
have fun. Uh, Chris, thank you for the

781
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,798
great message. That one got me rambling.

782
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,120
Um, I hope I answered your question. The

783
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,319
way that I wrote it was plant A to plant

784
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,439
B in parenthesis is one plant times

785
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:18,240
pollen donor. Um, is how what you're

786
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,440
talking about probably goes. So, dude,

787
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,759
thank you for the great question. Thank

788
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,240
you for letting me confuse everybody. If

789
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,759
you need clarity on this, argue in the

790
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,720
comment section. I would love to see the

791
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:30,240
feedback in the comment section. All

792
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,159
right, ladies and gentlemen, boys,

793
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,240
girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes,

794
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,559
smokers, growers, clone cutters, pollen

795
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,399
chuckers, all of you amazing cannabis

796
00:28:36,558 --> 00:28:40,000
enthusiasts out there. Um, you could

797
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,000
tell I'm beginning to stutter. My brain
