you a coupon code for a free pack of

42
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,280
seeds from edirect tocom the first

43
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,798
question on today's podcast came from

44
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,920
somebody who wants to be called lucky

45
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,240
bow Packer shout out to my new friend

46
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,039
lucky Bowl Packer the question says this

47
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:05,879
is a two-part question I'm only going to

48
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,920
send you one prize but I will answer

49
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:11,400
both questions it does say how long can

50
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:13,719
you use your mail plants for that's one

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,200
and the second one is and or do you take

52
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:18,560
clones of him or just save the Paul in

53
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,399
this is a very good question uh my buddy

54
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,120
lucky bpack before I go too far make

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,080
sure you do check your inbox and check

56
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,560
your spam because you've got a coupon

57
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,120
code for a free pack of seeds at idirect

58
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,920
tocom now let's talk about keeping male

59
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,519
plants I am breeder I like to make seeds

60
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:35,039
uh if I have made some seeds that I know

61
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,000
are going to be successful or I think

62
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,639
will be successful uh it would be a

63
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,080
great opportunity for me to be able to

64
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,199
reproduce those seeds in the future so I

65
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,640
like to keep a clone of my male plant

66
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:46,560
the way that I do it I grow my maale

67
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,598
plant out just like I would any female

68
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,280
just like you would any female plant

69
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:52,439
then I take a couple of clones either

70
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,039
the top or two sides get a couple of

71
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:55,560
clones in the cloner and make sure to

72
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:57,919
keep that clone secure we're going to

73
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,239
talk more about that but how long do you

74
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,919
use your male plants for King Sol has

75
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,360
been around uh since about 2016 so King

76
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:08,318
Solomon is uh nearly 10 years old I've

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,560
had that plant for that's a male plant

78
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,318
that I've had for nearly 10 years the

79
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,280
thing is I have to keep uh normally I

80
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:17,318
say reming uh this I think is reaing

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,560
King Solomon so I've got a big bushy

82
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:21,359
King Solomon plant he grows uh

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,400
occasionally that plant will just uh

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
become stale and tired and exhausted

85
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,400
it's it's old it's only meant to be an

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:29,040
annual plant this plant should only be

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,760
around for a year I've had it for nearly

88
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,359
10 years I think eight years is the math

89
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:35,318
on that so every occasionally 3 six

90
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,640
maybe nine months I've got to do what I

91
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:40,359
call a reom or a Rea of King Solomon I

92
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,199
go take a bunch of clones off of that

93
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,080
plant I put all those clones in the

94
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:46,238
cloner and I wait for one or two of them

95
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,480
to root very solidly once I've got that

96
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,680
in a pot then it will chop down that big

97
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:53,039
old version and those two clones become

98
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:56,200
the new father's or mother plants if you

99
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:58,359
will of that King Solomon keeper so

100
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,318
technically I have kept that plant for

101
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,159
nearly 10 years but technically I'm only

102
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,359
keeping that plant for three to six

103
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:07,519
months at a time before I cut clones off

104
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,280
of it and regenerate it because trying

105
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
to keep a mother plant or a father plant

106
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,360
around I was having this conversation

107
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,119
with another friend keeping that plant

108
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,159
around for a very continued time it

109
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,680
seems like you should just be able to

110
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:19,159
lollipop it trim it prune it Bonsai it

111
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,680
it will get stale it'll start to get

112
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,040
Woody it'll get a little upset with you

113
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:24,160
it'll take a lot of training a lot of

114
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,120
pruning a lot of adjusting a lot of

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,240
manipulating it's easier in my opinion

116
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,639
my experience and it saves a lot of

117
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,519
space to just go make a new smaller Mom

118
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,360
it's mainly for genetic preservation I

119
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,639
don't intend to use King Solomon for a

120
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,960
year I don't have a project a plan he

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,439
doesn't have a date he's not going to

122
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:42,839
get laid for an entire year but I do

123
00:04:40,439 --> 00:04:44,600
want to keep him around so I keep him

124
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:46,478
I've got a mother plant or a male plant

125
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,360
of him I just keep that genetic

126
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,680
preservation by having that plant alive

127
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,160
in my garden at all times it does not go

128
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,680
anywhere so King Solomon is my example

129
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,800
here how long do you use your mail

130
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,600
plants for uh King Solomon has been

131
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,879
around for 10 years he's made a 100

132
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,240
crosses that's an estimate uh he's been

133
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:03,719
around for eight years and made 80

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,240
crosses that once again is another

135
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,520
estimate there could be hyperbole in

136
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,840
there I'm mostly serious when I say I've

137
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:11,680
made 80 different crosses with King

138
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,918
Solomon so how long do you use your

139
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,840
males 10 years six uh months at a time

140
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:18,959
then uh do you take clones of him or

141
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:21,478
just save the pollen I absolutely take

142
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,959
clones because I like a lot of pollen I

143
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,159
like to pollinate twice when I do a

144
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,918
pollination when the plants are ready I

145
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,560
hit them one good solid time then I'll

146
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:30,560
wait about a week and hit them one more

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,918
good solid time that way I'm certain

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,038
that those plants definitely got

149
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,839
pollinated the whole room is dusted

150
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:39,399
that's the way I do it I do save pollen

151
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,839
but I rarely use the stored pollen most

152
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:44,478
of the time that is uh just an emergency

153
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:47,000
backup Supply I prefer uh plant-to-plant

154
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:48,560
contact when it's my breeding projects I

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,759
don't use a lot of stored pollen I've

156
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,319
have tried that once or twice and the

157
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,800
results are minimal I get way more seeds

158
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,720
off of taking that reversed plant or the

159
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,280
male plant and putting it in the room

160
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,759
and just actually touching the female

161
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,679
plants with it rubbing it right up

162
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,800
against them than I did when I took

163
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:06,639
female pollen or reversed pollen and

164
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,038
went in the room and put it on the

165
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,960
plants uh manually or blew it on them I

166
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,399
got much more success uh touching the

167
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:15,279
plants with the actual pollen donor so

168
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,120
it's a two-part question uh how long do

169
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:19,399
you keep your male plants for and do you

170
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,720
take clones uh yes I prefer to keep a

171
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:23,758
clone keep a father plant and like I've

172
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,919
said King Solomon has been around for

173
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,280
eight years now the uh Jack the Ripper

174
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,959
male has been around for several years

175
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:32,598
uh the BC lemon skunk has been around

176
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,159
for a while there's a chalou mail um

177
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:36,680
yeah the mails stick around I just every

178
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,199
time I uh remon the entire room those

179
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:40,598
are just part of the process they just

180
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,879
get re fathered I guess is what you will

181

educational cannabis content this

215
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:50,359
question also did come from the growel

216
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,598
tab on my website this one came from my

217
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:55,400
new friend Aaron why Aaron why not

218
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:57,000
that's a bad joke I'm going to read the

219
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:59,878
question it goes a little bit like this

220
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,560
it says yo I was wondering uh since you

221
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,599
say you chop the dudes after you

222
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,720
pollinate can you keep the male plant

223
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,639
and rev them like females uh this is a

224
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,960
very good question so I was talking

225
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,918
about pollinating a room once I've used

226
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,399
that male plant twice or that reversed

227
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:17,000
female twice I'll apply that pollen to

228
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:18,719
the plants I'll wait a week I'll let it

229
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,240
uh develop more pollen then don't will

230
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,800
actually cut the tops and the branches

231
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,000
off the plant and walk around rub those

232
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,400
all over the room uh smack those on the

233
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,720
fan that way when you hit the fan the

234
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,959
pollen goes everywhere I will chop down

235
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,200
that mail plant and completely dispose

236
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,718
of him he is gone uh I've got the Clone

237
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,800
in the other room as a preserve but now

238
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,240
at that point that flowering male is

239
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,799
done he is chopped down he's been

240
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,038
murdered he is out of there uh he's done

241
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,000
he's in the graveyard he's in the

242
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,278
compost bin he's gone I don't know how

243
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,720
else to say it but uh this question is

244
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:50,958
can you rev them like females

245
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,360
unfortunately um it is a real pain in

246
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:56,479
the ass to rev a male ganja plant uh

247
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,320
just like you just like me once you

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,519
activate that process of setting off

249
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,278
that activity it it really wants to set

250
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,000
off that activity it takes a lot to cool

251
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:06,320
him down restart him get him back into

252
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,200
the veg mode it can happen but it takes

253
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,640
a long time generally uh probably twice

254
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,320
as long as it does a female plant if you

255
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,958
can get that clone and make that clone

256
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,760
uh be your preservation that's a much

257
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:20,199
more viable opportunity a viable

258
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,480
situation than trying to rev your mail

259
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,120
plants I've done it uh it takes a really

260
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,600
long time and it takes a lot of light it

261
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,278
takes a lot of attention um they're much

262
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,720
more it's much more difficult they just

263
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:31,679
real like I said before once you've

264
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,000
initiated the launch process that rocket

265
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,159
wants to go off you know exactly what I

266
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,240
mean so you can rev the mail but it

267
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,759
takes a lot of effort you're going to

268
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,959
have to put it into a bigger pot you're

269
00:09:38,759 --> 00:09:42,039
going to have to feed it a lot of

270
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:44,039
nitrogen um I would make sure it's not

271
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:46,799
root bound at all and give it a lot of

272
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:48,799
light probably 24 hours of light uh make

273
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:50,799
it so if you got a room full of plants

274
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,599
uh put the reveg plant the one directly

275
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,479
under that light source so it's getting

276
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,200
as much light as possible that's what's

277
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,159
going to contribute and encourage uh

278
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,320
that uh R is the light so so uh the

279
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:05,159
question is can you keep a male plant

280
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
and rev him like females you can but it

281
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:08,199
is a pain in the ass if you if you've

282
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,440
got another opportunity to keep that

283
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,480
male to preserve that male I would

284
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,480
strongly recommend using the other

285
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,120
option the other opportunity all right

286
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,360
podcast world we have some good energy

287
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,000

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,839
slow it down I do have another great

advice I just try to say be a good

327
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,839
person and don't stress over dumb [ __ ]

328
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:49,360
uh it's really all we can do just be

329

because of you I'm making my own seeds

341
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:14,599
and uh I am dealing with situations in

342
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:16,278
life better because of you this is

343
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,040

just got a tip you guys this was

351
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,480
uh let me keep going though it says big

352
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,399
up bro big up yourself I appreciate this

353
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,920
much love in this message now it does

354
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:41,559
say my question is this I have an ideal

355
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:44,198
controlled environment and a stable STS

356
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:46,399
recipe that I spray on nodes every 4

357
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,078
days I already see a problem here it

358
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,559
says I have successful reversals but

359
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:53,759
sometimes my pollen is sterile yes that

360
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:56,198
uh that does happen it says am I doing

361
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,559
something wrong and how long into flower

362
00:12:56,198 --> 00:13:00,919
should I spray a reversed plant um this

363
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:02,399
is a very good question I have done a

364
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,879
full episode on this but we could just

365
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,320
touch quickly on this and correct the

366
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,759
issue I've done an entire episode on

367
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,959
this called my STS mix where I talk

368
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:13,078
about how to make the STS then I talk

369
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,039
about application dilution rates I talk

370
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,319
about all of it but there's a couple

371
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,919
things that jumped out to me here um the

372
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:22,360
first thing you said was you spray on

373
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:24,879
the nodes every four days I spray every

374
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,759
3 days and I spray the entire plant I

375
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,159
spray the leaves the branches the nodes

376
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:32,559
I coat that entire plant plant in STS I

377
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:35,719
want as much silver in that plant as I

378
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,319
can get within reason so uh you're

379
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,120
saying you spray every 4 days on the

380
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,760
nodes I would do every 3 days and I

381
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,600
would do it on the entire plant so then

382
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,078
it says I have successful reversals but

383
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:48,399
sometimes my pollen is sterile um I

384
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:50,439
don't think you're doing anything wrong

385
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,519
there just needs to be adjustments so to

386
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,000
speak um I'm not sure the strength of

387
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,159
your STS solution is it too strong is it

388
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,360
too weak both of those things can cause

389
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:03,439
sterile pollen I know this is a struggle

390
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,039
the only way to do it is to adjust that

391
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,000
uh the STS in multiple ways and apply it

392
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:10,120
to different plants are the same plant

393
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,759
but multiple clones and see which one

394
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,720
works best is the best way to figure

395
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,278
this out you got a fenal hunt your STS

396
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,120
basically but I recommend and also I

397
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:20,039
think my recipe may be on Discord if

398
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,120
it's not on Discord I will put the STS

399
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,919
recipe up on my Discord server so you

400
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,720
guys can get some advice there the way

401
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,759
that I would do it though I would start

402
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,120
off with a uh 10% dilution of silver

403
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:32,440
thos sulfat so you're making your

404
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:34,000
solution uh you're putting the silver

405
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,720
you're putting the sodium in the

406
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,440
different containers you're mixing those

407
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,440
together I would do one part that and

408
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,399
nine Parts distilled water to start so

409
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:46,839
you're at uh 1 to n ratio it's a 10%

410
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,240
silver ratio to water um I would mix it

411
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:52,440
that way then here's how I would apply I

412
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:54,799
would spray one week before I put that

413
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:57,160
female plant into flour so give it a

414
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,559
good solid spray one week before you

415
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:07,639
intend to put it into flour then spray

416
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:10,000
it on day 1 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 and if you

417
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:12,440
have a longer flowering cultivar or a

418
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,879
stubborn cultivar spray it again on that

419
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,320
24th day if it's like a 12 or 13 we

420
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:20,159
flowering sativa give it one more just

421
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,040
to really remind it hey [ __ ] I need you

422
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:24,600
to reverse cuz those longer flowering

423
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:26,719
sativas uh if you stop spraying and let

424
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,199
this plant grow it will come out of the

425
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,240
reversal it will undo the reversal it

426
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:32,519
will go back into forward gear I don't

427
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,198
even know the word for that it will

428
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,159
unreversed some plants will all plants

429
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,639
will do that over time some more

430
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:42,159
stubborn plants will do that more

431
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:45,879
quickly so uh like I said I do 3 6 9 12

432
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,958
15 18 21 maybe 24 and if it's Congo

433
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:50,879
Ripper or a haze do that 27th and maybe

434
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,958
even day 30 but you don't need to go

435
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:57,399
that far with most cases up to day 24 21

436
00:15:53,958 --> 00:16:00,000
is enough um I think your dilution is

437
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:02,399
going to be very important get that 9:1

438
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
ratio um some plants want a little less

439
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,240
some plants want a little more some

440
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,120
plants want a seven uh 7 to3 ratio a 70%

441
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,839
water 30% uh silver thylo sulfate

442
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,639
solution uh dilution but it's all about

443
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,480
figuring out what each plant wants and

444
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,360
the best way like I said to do that is

445
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,240
get five clones and [ __ ] with them

446
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,959
different ways spray them with different

447
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,278
uh do 10 20 30 on different plants and

448
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,119
see how they reply but the the part I

449
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,759
can guarantee you to do uh that is

450
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,399
standard operating procedure is to spray

451
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:33,360
it one week before you put it into flow

452
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,679
wait and then on day one begin your new

453
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,519
flowering cycle and begin that new spray

454
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:42,439
regimen like I said 369 all the way up

455
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:46,240
to day 21 you should see pollen in most

456
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:48,839
cases uh between day 25 and day 32 if

457
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,039
you're not seeing pollen sacks uh within

458
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,759
a few weeks a couple weeks of spraying

459
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:56,439
uh something is going wrong uh I really

460
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:59,120
believe that the stero pollen is related

461
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,079
to over or under uh spraying with

462
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,759
dilution it's probably the amount of the

463
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:05,198
solution is what I think is contributing

464
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,439
to this the overall sop will make a huge

465
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,798
difference so uh mix it up right get a

466
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,439
10 a 20 and a 30 or just do a 10 and a

467
00:17:09,798 --> 00:17:15,918
30% and test two plants do a test run on

468
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,600
see which one reverses better uh then

469
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,160
whichever one works better do that every

470
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,119
time make that your new standard

471
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,640
operating procedure I know the Golden

472
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,159
Goat likes one thing the blueberry

473
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,880
cookies likes another thing we've got to

474
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,279
dial it in uh this is phenotype specific

475
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,720
so there are other products out there

476
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,480
that work with one application there are

477
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,360
other products out there that work with

478
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,599
multiple applications if you're going to

479
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:38,599
use the silver tho sulfate stick with my

480
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:40,959
uh standard operating procedure and let

481
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,000
me know what my adjustments do to your

482
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,319
recipe and if it does does not work I

483
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,200
will help you figure it out this is

484
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,639
something I've done a lot I do I

485
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:51,240
honestly just ordered yesterday ordered

486
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,038
more silver uh more sodium I ordered

487
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,120
more big beakers I got all brand new

488
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,119
mixing [ __ ] coming so I can make more

489
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,719
batches of STS because guess what we've

490
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,798
got more reversals coming that's right

491
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:03,319
I'm going to make some more feminized

492
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:04,359
seeds very soon here um do I want to

493
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:07,279
tell you what we're going to put in

494
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:09,639
there let's just say that the pollen

495
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,639
donor will be GMO we'll just start with

496
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,759
that stay tuned for more details on that

497
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,600
reversal project that's coming up my

498
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,480
dude budwin Jones I think I really

499
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,119
answered your question here uh we've got

500
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,759
to correct the solution uh to the right

501
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:24,158
dilution which I know just sounds like

502
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:25,679
I'm talking technical uh jargon here but

503
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:28,280
we do need the right dilution the right

504
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,280
ratio and then apply at the correct

505
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:32,038
interval which has soak the whole plant

506
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,000
you said the nodes I would hit the

507
00:18:32,038 --> 00:18:36,279
leaves the branches the intersections

508
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,798
get the entire plant uh every time you

509
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:40,119

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,319
one more good question this question

515
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,320
also came from that growel tab on IR

516
00:18:51,319 --> 00:18:54,319

519
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,159
goes just like this it says yo Rasta

520
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,038
Jeff am I harming my plants at all by

521
00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,799
sometimes turning the lights off an hour

522
00:19:12,038 --> 00:19:16,480
early during flower I run my house on

523
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,679
solar with a battery backup that's

524
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,480
[ __ ] Smart Bro then it says on a low

525
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,919
solar production day I will turn the

526
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,880
lights out early to avoid depleting my

527
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:28,520
batteries and having to buy power from

528
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,480
the grid so usually it's on 1212 but I

529
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:34,519
will will occasionally be on

530
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:38,400
1113 is this okay um I wrote one note on

531
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:40,558
my page I said pick one uh the plants uh

532
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
they they would prefer a more consistent

533
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,480
schedule you're not causing any damage

534
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,240
but I think consistency uh will really

535
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,720
help out with a lot of things with these

536
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,599
plants so I would say pick one my my

537
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,038
main my main I just right away pick one

538
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:54,279
bro just pick one you don't have to

539
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:56,839
dance back and forth you don't have to

540
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,119
do weird [ __ ] just pick one uh 1113 has

541
00:19:56,839 --> 00:20:01,639
its pros and cons 1212 has it pros and

542
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,038
cons uh it sounds like you may be

543
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,679
beneficial to do the 11113 save that

544
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:08,640
extra hour why not uh save that extra

545
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,840
hour and you will see what we notice

546
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,320
when we do the 1113 what I have noticed

547
00:20:10,839 --> 00:20:15,240
is I see more phenotypical expression so

548
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:16,918
if I'm growing from seed and I want to

549
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,640
see the differences how those plants

550
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:21,120
represent themselves in that room uh I

551
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,720
will see the different phenotypical

552
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,439
expression by reducing the light for

553
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,480
that one hour that extra hour of

554
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,240
darkness really just lets them show

555
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,400
their own character their own personal

556
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,200
traits so that is an advantage to the

557
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,400
11113 also you have to run your air

558
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,480
conditioner your fan your whatever else

559
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,960
is on during lights on time all of that

560
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:43,440
shuts off 1 hour earlier over the course

561
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,798
of a 65 day flowering cycle that is 65

562
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,919
hours of electricity that you're saving

563
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:49,759
so um yeah I would say just kick it off

564
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,600
that one extra hour I do preach the

565
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,038
extra lighting at the end of flower

566
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,839
because I think light is the number one

567
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,640
source of energy but uh this is cannabis

568
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,439
growing this is situational this is

569
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,840
adjustable and in this situation I think

570
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,240
it applies to go

571
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,918
1113 um don't ever be afraid to change

572
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,720
[ __ ] do [ __ ] differently make things

573
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,880
work for the environment the situation

574
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,038
the room the house the electrical grid

575
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,200
which you are in I think this is a very

576
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:16,400
good time very good reason to switch to

577
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,159
that 1113 also that way you don't have

578
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,880
to buy Power from Babylon Bro [ __ ]

579
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,200
Babylon [ __ ] paying for electricity I

580
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,120
like your style switch to the 11 switch

581
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,319
to that 1113 become self-sufficient and

582
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,000
don't give them your hard-earned money

583
