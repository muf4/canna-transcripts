21
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:49,829
by talking about what i'm smoking today

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,170
I've been taking little tiny dabs of

23
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,929
purple starburst live batter from Green

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:58,500
Dot labs this is a blend of purple punch

25
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,269
and skittles starburst OG the flavor on

26
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,789
the package is described as spun sugar

27
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,618
grape and shampoo we have talked about

28
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,010
this concentrate on the show before I

29
00:01:04,618 --> 00:01:10,019
really love that sweet sugary shampoo

30
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,390
flavor it kind of tastes like cotton

31
00:01:10,019 --> 00:01:13,560
candy shampoo and I really like it show

32
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,879
the camera there a little bit if you're

33
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,859
watching on YouTube you can see what the

34
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:19,199
batter looks like that started off as a

35
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,900
4 gram jar I have made a nice dent in

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,759
the jar a really quality concentrates I

37
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:25,560
really love the buzz and I really love

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,859
the flavor so big shout out to our

39
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,840
friend at Green Dot labs I'm sure some

40
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,450
of you noticed I said I was taking

41
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,150
little tiny dabs that was not a joke I

42
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,770
was not being facetious in any way I've

43
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,290
had a little bit of dental work done so

44
00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:41,938
I must stick with little tiny dabs so I

45
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,649
don't cause myself any problems if

46
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:45,059
you're watching on the video you may

47
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,769
notice that one side of my face is a

48
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,719
little bit puffy I feel like I'm

49
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:50,459
recovering quite well I'm ready to do a

50
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,679
show the only thing you're gonna notice

51
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,059
is this red puffiness and some words

52
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,829
don't come out right because I've had

53
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,560
dental work and I'm adjusting to the new

54
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:59,099
face but I think we will be okay bear

55
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,810

111

then we're done

112
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:49,049
let's move right forward to the breeding

113
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:51,670
update that's the next note on my list

114
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,730
I'd like to keep you guys updated on

115
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:56,199
what is happening in my Gardens I'm sure

116
00:03:54,729 --> 00:03:59,289
if you've been following along you know

117
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:02,048
that I found a Jack the Ripper mail and

118
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:04,989
I have recently pollinated if you select

119
00:04:02,049 --> 00:04:08,109
females in a small area with that Jack

120
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:09,849
the Ripper mail the pistols are brown

121
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:11,620
the pistols are curled up on all of the

122
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:14,680
females which indicates to me that I've

123
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:17,019
got a successful pollination I have made

124
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,079
Jack the Ripper f2s from two different

125
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:22,329
phenotypes of a female I've also made

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,949
excuse me I've also made a couple of

127
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:27,669
Jack the Ripper out crosses I have

128
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:29,709
pollinated a couple of very popular

129
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:33,280
genetics lines and Huayra genetics

130
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:35,709
crosses with the Jack the Ripper mail

131
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,509
pollen it looks like the pollen has

132
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:39,819
taken I said that the pistols have

133
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:41,829
curled in when you pollinate a plant the

134
00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:43,750
pistols the hairs you guys the main

135
00:04:41,829 --> 00:04:46,359
function of those hairs on the plant

136
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,709
those are to receive the pol and they're

137
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,360
sticking out there they're long and

138
00:04:47,709 --> 00:04:50,769
sticky they're nice and thick when you

139
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,270
got them nice and long and thick that's

140
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:53,919
when they really want pollen that's when

141
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:56,620
the plant is really heavily ovulating

142
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,540
the job of that hair is called a pistol

143
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,670
its job is to catch pollen and the

144
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,379
pollen slides down that hair into the

145
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,150
ovule and that is where the magic

146
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:05,829
happens that is where the seed is formed

147
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:06,279
that's where future generations come

148
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:08,620
from

149
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,149
so those pistols are brown and crinkled

150
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,009
up they've already been used up

151
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:13,719
basically the ovule inside of there

152
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:15,519
doesn't need pollination so that pistol

153
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,130
just curls up it tells me I've been

154
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:20,169
pollinated I've got a room filled a tent

155
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:22,089
filled with Brown pistols there are

156
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,310
going to be so many [Â __Â ] seeds in

157
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:26,529
that room I am excited they are all

158
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,629
brand new crosses I know that the

159
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:30,969
females I've used produce quality

160
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:33,370
offspring I know that the Jack the

161
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:36,280
Ripper is a quality cross but I do not

162
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:38,649
know how the male I selected will play

163
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,879
with the females I have pollinated so a

164
00:05:38,649 --> 00:05:41,560
lot of people right now are getting

165
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:43,029
excited going man I can't wait to get

166
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,300
some of those Jack the Ripper crosses

167
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:48,609
please be very very patient I've still

168
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:50,230
got 4 to 6 weeks to let the seeds grow

169
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,699
they've got to mature they've got a

170
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:53,259
hardened they've got to get fat they got

171
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:55,899
to get shells on them they got to finish

172
00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:58,149
up we got 4 to 6 weeks there that's a

173
00:05:55,899 --> 00:06:00,429
month and a half then I'll cut them down

174
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:02,560
then they will honestly hang for two

175
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:05,230
solid weeks before I do anything to them

176
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,800
when I harvest seeded plants I let them

177
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:10,569
dry crispy crispy dry then I shuck the

178
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,060
buds off the sticks into a container and

179
00:06:10,569 --> 00:06:14,529
I smash the buds up into small dust with

180
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,329
my hands I just kind of rolled the buds

181
00:06:14,529 --> 00:06:18,069
in my hands it's so dry that it crumbles

182
00:06:16,329 --> 00:06:19,629
and as it crumbles you just hear the

183
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:21,339
seeds rain out into the container ting

184
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,649
ting ting ting ting ting then I take

185
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:25,539
that container filled with crumbled up

186
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,679
bud it's just dry shaky but it looks

187
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,300
like you could just roll a bunch of

188
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,430
joints out of it I run that through a

189
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:32,560
machine that separates the material from

190
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,240
the seeds and then I've got seeds what

191
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,370
I'm saying is it's not going to be right

192
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,590
away before these seeds are available

193
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,329
I've got six weeks before they're

194
00:06:38,589 --> 00:06:41,259
harvested two weeks to let them dry

195
00:06:40,329 --> 00:06:42,969
another

196
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,709
to pull him out and get the seed sorted

197
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,300
separated labelled and counted because I

198
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:47,799
do count them all before they go

199
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,199
anywhere I like to know how many seeds I

200
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,660
made from each harvest then once I've

201
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:54,579
got them separated counted labeled all

202
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,100
that stuff that's when I can think about

203
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:58,659
testing them I will test them myself

204
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:01,150
I'll grow a batch of these seeds on my

205
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,890
own before anybody gets to see them I

206
00:07:01,149 --> 00:07:04,239
will make sure we get good germination

207
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:06,129
rate so I'll make sure that we don't

208
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,689
have any hermaphrodites any weird

209
00:07:06,129 --> 00:07:09,730
mutants I'll make sure that the females

210
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,829
that come out of this cross are worth

211
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:13,750
growing so there's a lot of work to be

212
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:15,370
done before I can give any out before I

213
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,620
can share any before I can sell any

214
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:20,290
before you can have them play with them

215
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,240
test them then once I have tested them

216
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:25,300
so you're looking at six weeks two weeks

217
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,389
and then another four or five week veg

218
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,370
nine week flower we're at like twenty

219
00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,620
two weeks by now somewhere around there

220
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,850
then you may be able to see some test

221
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,220
trees because I want to grow them myself

222
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,020
then I'll send testers out to people

223
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,520
then we're looking at [Â __Â ] eighteen

224
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:41,500
to twenty weeks before testers have

225
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,329
results and finishers and photos and

226
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:45,250
tests and all that [Â __Â ] back so we're

227
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:46,629
like 40-something weeks before anybody

228
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,449
is going to get to play with these seeds

229
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:52,269
you guys I do appreciate the enthusiasm

230
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:54,579
I love the excitement for new crosses

231
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:56,139
I'm just as excited as you are but when

232
00:07:54,579 --> 00:07:58,839
I start talking about it it's going to

233
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,899
be six months to a year before it is

234
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,699
released to the market if if it even

235
00:08:01,899 --> 00:08:06,129
makes it to the market there are crosses

236
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:07,509
that I've made it will not go to market

237
00:08:06,129 --> 00:08:09,639
I'll share them with friends and I'll

238
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:11,019
say hey this isn't the best for this

239
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,610
kind of environment but I know what you

240
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:14,349
do this may work well for you and I give

241
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,270
them a warning but there are some things

242
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:19,030
I make that are just not going to go out

243
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:20,680
to the general public I need experienced

244
00:08:19,029 --> 00:08:22,809
growers and veterans who can keep an eye

245
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:24,790
on some [Â __Â ] to grow some of these so if

246
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,519
they make it to the market it will be

247
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,590
what did I say 40 weeks ish 42 weeks

248
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,449
that's the better part of a year we're

249
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:33,819
cutting off ten weeks of a year there so

250
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,590
yeah give me a year or so six months to

251
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,599
a year before I get these testers out

252
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:39,519
let me get myself back on track the Jack

253
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,020
the Ripper pollinated it looks great in

254
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,519
there since you were so patient to

255
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,259
listen to my ramblings maybe I should be

256
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:46,449
nice enough to tell you about a couple

257
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:49,659
of the females that I've put in that

258
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,310
room um if you know me you already know

259
00:08:49,659 --> 00:08:52,509
that I put a female of one of my

260
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:55,069
favorite cuts in there

261
00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:57,319
I threw a rise number

262
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,720
or in that room so we will have a Jack

263
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,460
the Ripper mail pollinating a female

264
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,170
arrives number four number four is the

265
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:05,269
keeper that you guys see on social media

266
00:09:03,169 --> 00:09:06,740
there are others but number four is the

267
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:09,590
stellar champion that I've fallen in

268
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,840
love with so you'll have it's actually

269
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,040
going to be our Rhys xjt are because you

270
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,080
list the female first

271
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,480
so a Rhys cross to Jack the Ripper I

272
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:22,100
also whilst I put in there I can't even

273
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,440
remember now oh oh um there is a golden

274
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:26,120
goat female in there what there's a

275
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,670
golden goat female and they're about to

276
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,159
get pollinated or pollinated by Jack the

277
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:32,839
Ripper so we'll have go Ripper or Jack

278
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:35,419
the goat or somewhere around there I

279
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,710
don't know um send me a name idea for

280
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:38,269

281
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,530
golden go what else do we have in there

282
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:40,819
I'll tell you about one more just while

283
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:42,889
we're talking about it we got Jack the

284
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:45,320
Ripper F twos in there or f1 we're gonna

285
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,370
make F twos um I don't know how much I

286
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,920
want to share and how much I want to

287
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:50,389
keep secret but maybe there's a platinum

288
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:52,399
tangi in there also so we're gonna have

289
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:53,830
some really Orange Jack the Ripper Terps

290
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,209
that's gonna be [Â __Â ] awesome

291
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:58,160
anyways that's what's going on in the

292
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:00,710
breeding room another thing in the

293
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,509
breeding room I am using Canon LED

294
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:04,310
lighting from black sale market please

295
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:06,350
support black sale mark if they don't

296
00:10:04,309 --> 00:10:07,879
pay for advertising on the show I am

297
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:11,300
running their lights and I [Â __Â ]

298
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:12,439
approve you guys my plants look really

299
00:10:11,299 --> 00:10:15,109
healthy ah

300
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,480
they grew with good vigor they grew with

301
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:20,360
really thick and robust stalks the

302
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,950
leaves are really thick um they feel

303
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,750
thicker than normal they feel thicker

304
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:25,850
than before I don't know if it's because

305
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,860
of the VPD in that room or if it is

306
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:29,300
because of the actual light I think it

307
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,550
may be from the light I'm getting more

308
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,319
uh I think the better light is giving me

309
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:35,329
chloroplasts development which is the

310
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,620
building thicker stronger leaves I don't

311
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:39,290
know if that is accurate but it's my

312
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,639
assumption from what I'm seeing um I

313
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:42,169
feel like they went into flower more

314
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,360
quickly when I flipped these plants into

315
00:10:42,169 --> 00:10:46,129
flower under the LEDs they really took

316
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,019
off the mail was like oh you want pollen

317
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:49,730
watch this and he just took off he's

318
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,960
like I'll pollinate for you I'll flip

319
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:53,480
and the girls were like you want me to

320
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,009
flower I'll do that they had no problem

321
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,350
flipping into flower so I'm really

322
00:10:55,009 --> 00:10:59,210
impressed with the LEDs I don't have

323
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,800
enough input on this seed development

324
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,990
because seeds have not really gotten

325
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,589
chunky or fat yet but I'm excited to see

326
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:08,100
how the seeds develop under the LEDs I

327
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:09,540
really like the colors

328
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,950
being able to take photographs without

329
00:11:09,539 --> 00:11:13,259
having to turn off my lights when I'm

330
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:15,180
growing under HID lights I turn off all

331
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:16,740
the HID lighting to take photos or you

332
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:19,079
get those shitty yellow washed out

333
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,730
photos underneath the LEDs they're

334
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,400
putting out kick-ass bright white light

335
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:25,409
so I get really beautiful photos that

336
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,179
white light combined with a phone flash

337
00:11:25,409 --> 00:11:29,039
oh you can just kill it so I'm really

338
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:30,419
excited about the LEDs I'm really

339
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,490
excited about some Jack the Ripper

340
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:34,169
crosses they will be coming out that's

341
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:36,360
what's happening in my grow in my

342
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:38,159
breeding space I just like to keep you

343
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,009
guys updated I feel like I've gone on

344
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:43,350
long enough about that part where can we

345
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,970
go next let's jump into patreon

346
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:47,279
questions I have a lot of people

347
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,870
supporting the show on patreon now I say

348
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,939
that if you support the show on patreon

349
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,649
and you send a question those questions

350
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,870
get sent to the top of the list I just

351
00:11:52,649 --> 00:11:57,179
feel that patreon contributors should

352
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,669
get priority message reading so let's

353
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,319
start off with some patreon messages for

354
00:11:59,669 --> 00:12:02,370
the podcast like I said a moment ago if

355
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,810
you're not supporting the show on

356
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:07,350
patreon and you would like to do so

357
00:12:03,809 --> 00:12:09,599
simply visit w-w-w dot a tree on com

00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:59,340
this it says hey Rasta Jeff if you read

382
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,899
this on the podcast you can shout out my

383
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,759
name what's up Victor this one comes

384
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:04,620
from our friend Victor it says I've been

385
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,299
a patreon supporter for quite a while

386
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,129
now I've been listening to your podcast

387
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:09,870
for even longer thank you for the

388
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:11,460
support bro it goes on to say your

389
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:13,679
lessons have helped me as a grower and

390
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,050
reassured me on a lot of tips and advice

391
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:18,659
I've already come across you know

392
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:20,789
sometimes you just need reminders and

393
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:21,929
assurance and I like to remind people of

394
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:23,969
the basics so

395
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:25,199
I'm glad that my my lessons are matching

396
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,370
up with other [Â __Â ] that you have learned

397
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,129
and I'm glad you're finding it to be

398
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:30,600
accurate so it says I'm very thankful

399
00:13:29,129 --> 00:13:32,340
for you sharing your knowledge and

400
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,620
improving the quality of so many growers

401
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:37,320
medicine especially those that need this

402
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,060
plant to have a better quality of life

403
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,740
that's what it's all about we need to

404
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:42,179
use cannabis to improve the quality of

405
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,190
our life it's mentally if it's

406
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:46,859
physically if it's spiritually as long

407
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:48,780
as your life is better go for it now it

408
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,879
gets to the question part it says my

409
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:53,339
question for you is about alternating

410
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,990
nodes I have a few grows under my belt

411
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,700
now and I've always noticed the plants

412
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:58,889
tend to alternate nodes when they begin

413
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,470
to flower which seems normal from what I

414
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:03,389
can tell but I also noticed that my

415
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:05,550
clones after a certain amount of growth

416
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:08,069
began the same pattern of alternating

417
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:11,099
their nodes alright so what I think he's

418
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:12,570
talking about is when you grow a lot of

419
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,430
times when you grow from seed the plant

420
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:16,410
will go straight up and it will spit out

421
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:18,089
a branch on the left and the right and

422
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:20,490
they'll be parallel a couple inches

423
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:21,899
later you'll get a branch from the its

424
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,250
left and right I guess we're gonna say

425
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:25,590
the up and down if you're looking at the

426
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,049
plant from above it's a plus sign you

427
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:29,820
got north south east and west so most of

428
00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:31,559
the time it'll shoot out and east and

429
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,040
west and then after that it'll shoot out

430
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:33,479
none

431
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:35,309
it's not gonna be east and west first

432
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,779
I'm being hypothetical but you'll get an

433
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:38,429
East and a West and then at north and a

434
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,959
south and east and west and a north and

435
00:14:38,429 --> 00:14:41,909
a south so if you look at the plant

436
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:44,730
straight from above it looks like you're

437
00:14:41,909 --> 00:14:47,429
looking at a plus sign so I think that's

438
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,980
what he means by alternating nodes now

439
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:52,679
when he grow from clone you will notice

440
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,320
that sometimes the nodes will go the

441
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,819
east node and then it will grow a little

442
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,170
bit and then the West node and then

443
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,140
it'll go up and then you get your north

444
00:14:58,169 --> 00:15:03,000
and then a little space and then a south

445
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:05,699
I'm not exactly sure what that caught

446
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,129
what causes that in my brain I'm seeing

447
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,440
the apical meristem of a plant from the

448
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,629
main stalk of a plant that one grows the

449
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:15,060
parallel branches the branches that grow

450
00:15:12,629 --> 00:15:18,179
off grow shoots and I think what you are

451
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,039
seeing is alternating shoots I'm not

452
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:21,569
exactly sure that that's what I'm seeing

453
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:23,399
from your interpret interpreting from

454
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,680
your question but that's what I think

455
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:28,199
you are experiencing the shoots are

456
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:30,389
alternating the branches will grow side

457
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,890
by side but you said that that starts to

458
00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:33,689
happen with the clone after a while yes

459
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:35,519
I have noticed that and I do not know

460
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:37,950
what causes that phenomenon so it's

461
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,629
the north/south you get a little gap I'm

462
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,959
not sure what does that the golden go

463
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:45,028
makes ah six spins instead of

464
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,649
north-south east-west it's got they're

465
00:15:45,028 --> 00:15:48,480
off kilter and there's another set in

466
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:50,399
there so if you had north south east and

467
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,209
west you'd have one that went south east

468
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,309
in there

469
00:15:51,208 --> 00:15:55,349
south west like yeah I would go diagonal

470
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:56,759
across and it just spins all the way up

471
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:59,129
so it makes kind of a spiral staircase

472
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,708
looking thing if you get it really happy

473
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:03,028
so I'm not sure what causes that but

474
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:05,039
there's more to the question it says due

475
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:07,169
to space limitations I keep my clones

476
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,120
and Solo cups until they reach about one

477
00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:10,649
to one-and-a-half feet tall now you're

478
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,899
giving me hints of what's going on and

479
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:15,028
then I clone them again to keep them

480
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:16,769
small could it be that the small Solo

481
00:16:15,028 --> 00:16:19,289
cups are triggering the clones to auto

482
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,629
flour or is it alternating nodes on

483
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:23,819
clones or is the alternating clock nodes

484
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:25,708
on clones a normal occurrence I haven't

485
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,720
been cloning for long this is my second

486
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:30,028
set of clones totaling six clone strains

487
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,490
and it's been fairly consistent trend in

488
00:16:30,028 --> 00:16:34,409
my tent I'm also running my lights 20

489
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:36,750
hours on and for off as suggested in one

490
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:39,028
of your episodes to combat autoflowering

491
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,950
tendencies and strains thanks again for

492
00:16:39,028 --> 00:16:43,078
all you do take care and stay healthy

493
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:45,390
signed from Victor Victor this is a good

494
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,129
question I think I understand what

495
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:48,838
you're talking about here and the second

496
00:16:47,129 --> 00:16:50,549
part I'm you're letting the plants get

497
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,100
too big in those Solo cups dude they are

498
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:54,809
angry they want to flower if they are

499
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,730
too tight in those cups they will begin

500
00:16:54,809 --> 00:17:00,359
to flower you're kind of taking clones

501
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:01,889
from plants that may have hormones that

502
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,180
are ready to start flowering the

503
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:05,220
hormones and those plants are a little

504
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:07,019
bit pissed off freaked out they're going

505
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,670
dude we've been in a solo cup for way

506
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:10,019
too long their shoes are way too tight

507
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:11,730
they're getting angry about it

508
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:13,679
so they may be trying to flower on you

509
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,568
because of that um man I would

510
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,679
definitely you can keep them in the cups

511
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:18,449
if that's what you want to do but I

512
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:19,949
would give them a bigger root zone you

513
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,019
can keep them small you can keep them

514
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:23,130
sure by topping them and training them

515
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:25,650
and pruning them you don't have to

516
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:27,329
punish them by keeping them in cups get

517
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,580
them out of the cups you'll see much

518
00:17:27,328 --> 00:17:30,599
instead of just tall lanky skinny plants

519
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:32,220
if you get him out of the cups they'll

520
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,399
branch out a little bit they won't go up

521
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,470
so hard if you give them some space um I

522
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,720
know that doesn't sound logical but it

523
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:42,269
is real if you give them more space a

524
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,460
bigger pot they'll Bush out more I kind

525
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:48,329
of think that a plant kind of works like

526
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,038
this um if you only have

527
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:51,359
let's think about a person if you're

528
00:17:50,038 --> 00:17:52,980
real tall and skinny and you got your

529
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,048
feet together and I push you you're

530
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,390
gonna wobble because your gravity is all

531
00:17:55,048 --> 00:17:57,960
[Â __Â ] up if you spread your feet and I

532
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,850
push you

533
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,308
you've got more a chance of not falling

534
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:04,019
over I think the plant doesn't want to

535
00:18:02,308 --> 00:18:06,148
get too wide because it doesn't have a

536
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,009
big wide root base if it gets too tall

537
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:09,750
too wide up top it's gonna topple over

538
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:11,308
and it knows that it's like yeah my

539
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,259
roots are only this [Â __Â ] big

540
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:15,418
I better not branch out too far let's go

541
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,919
up let's just keep going up and so

542
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,960
you're kind of punishing the plant

543
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,700
you're not giving yourself as much

544
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,590
success as you could get you're kind of

545
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,319
limiting your options by having big tall

546
00:18:22,589 --> 00:18:27,808
lanky stretchy plants so I really think

547
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:29,038
you should up pot them sooner I don't

548
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:30,690
know your environment I don't know your

549
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,730
space I may be talking completely

550
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,460
irrational [Â __Â ] right now but that

551
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,399
is what I would suggest so I do think

552
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:41,130
that maybe having those plants in those

553
00:18:38,398 --> 00:18:42,509
cups for too long maybe leading to a lot

554
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:47,190
of your questionable plant performance

555
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:49,288
um that's pretty much my diagnosis there

556
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:50,820
put them in bigger pots earlier and then

557
00:18:49,288 --> 00:18:52,349
I think that the hormones and the plants

558
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:55,470
won't be trying to switch over to flower

559
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:58,048
so quickly so they're in the part about

560
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:01,110
24 hours 20 hours on in four hours off

561
00:18:58,048 --> 00:19:03,690
yes that will help the plants not auto

562
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:05,729
flower but it's not going to stop them

563
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,380
if they are in too small of a pot

564
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,778
they'll still get mad at you and they

565
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,000
will still flower so there is a follow

566
00:19:09,778 --> 00:19:14,159
up to this Viktor did send a second

567
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,638
email and it goes oh also regarding

568
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:17,220
clones

569
00:19:14,638 --> 00:19:18,990
I had one clone grow all weird with only

570
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,048
sets of 3 fingers on the leaves and

571
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:23,548
super bushy and it flowered it kept

572
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:25,288
growing in the same pattern and was a

573
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:27,778
mess to keep under control due to the

574
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:28,440
insane amount of small branches growing

575
00:19:27,778 --> 00:19:30,929
everywhere

576
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,490
I took the clone during veg but it looks

577
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:34,110
like what I've heard described as

578
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,460
Monster cropping what happened to my

579
00:19:34,109 --> 00:19:38,129
clone thank you again

580
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:40,950
Rasta Jeff you are the best all right

581
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:44,399
Victor this message gives me even more

582
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:46,980
clues that your rootbound clones are

583
00:19:44,398 --> 00:19:48,178
going into flower they're mad enough

584
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,528
about being rootbound that they're

585
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:51,870
triggering the hormones and themselves

586
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:54,000
to go into flower but I think your light

587
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:56,398
cycle is barely keeping them from

588
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,589
flowering so you took a clone from one

589
00:19:56,398 --> 00:20:00,839
of these plants was it was on the verge

590
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:01,990
of flipping into flower and it rooted

591
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:04,240
and it made

592
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:06,250
but it had already told itself hey I'm

593
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,599
[Â __Â ] flowering and you didn't stop it

594
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,919
you couldn't stop it wasn't anything

595
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,959
well it was stuff you did but I mean it

596
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,659
was doing that so then he floured it and

597
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,548
you basically did flour a monster

598
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:16,899
cropped clone the hormones were going

599
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,519
crazy the plant was trying to figure out

600
00:20:16,898 --> 00:20:21,250
life that's why you got weird shoots

601
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,538
crazy super branching it wasn't sure

602
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:25,628
what to do with life it was simply

603
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:27,519
trying to survive so that does kind of

604
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:29,469
support my idea that your plants are

605
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,298
getting frustrated at you for keeping

606
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,610
them in too small of a pot and I think

607
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:36,308
you could solve this issue by simply

608
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:38,740
either the first issue is - or the first

609
00:20:36,308 --> 00:20:40,720
solution is to go to bigger pots maybe

610
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,819
you need to reduce the amount of plants

611
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,350
you have to create more space they

612
00:20:42,819 --> 00:20:46,089
aren't going to get super tall as

613
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:47,378
quickly if you give them a bigger pot

614
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:48,939
like I said earlier that doesn't sound

615
00:20:47,378 --> 00:20:51,038
like it makes sense but it really will

616
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:52,389
help it'll slow down the stretch they

617
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,700
won't get as tall they'll start going

618
00:20:52,388 --> 00:20:56,619
wider and wider plants are always ideal

619
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,538
we do a lot of work to make them wider

620
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:01,329
we really try to strain them to give

621
00:20:58,538 --> 00:21:03,190
them whiter bushes alright I'm gonna

622
00:21:01,329 --> 00:21:05,319
take a drink here I got to minimize my

623
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:06,909
consumption of dabs and drinks I don't

624
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:08,079
wanna mess up the dental work but my

625
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:09,039
throat's burning out so let's take a

626
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,759
quick drink and we'll get back to

627
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,759
another message

628
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:21,490
all right you guys thank you for dealing

629
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:23,259
with me ah well I've got a puffy face

630
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,940
and a messed up voice I just feel like

631
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:26,740
the show must go on and I was hanging

632
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:29,080
out and it's up had the night to myself

633
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,849
the house is free felt silly sitting

634
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,679
here watching cartoons thought maybe I

635
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:35,439
should do a podcast I watched that uh

636
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:36,700
the toys that made us that was kind of

637
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,259
cool man i watch the Ninja Turtle

638
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,299
episode since you know put out the ninja

639
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:42,670
troll line that show brought back some

640
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:45,159
super memories made me super nostalgic I

641
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:47,140
remembered where I was and what grade I

642
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,580
was in and where I bought my set at

643
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,259
Ninja Turtle toys like I got all four

644
00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:51,669
turtles once is like a I did good in

645
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:53,500
school so I got all four of the turtles

646
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:56,380
I remember where I bought him I remember

647
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,309
how excited I was at school like I get

648
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,360
to go home and play with my Ninja

649
00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:00,009
Turtles after school is all I could

650
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:02,459
think about you guys I'm way off track

651
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:05,319
um let's get back into these patreon

652
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,329
messages this one says hey Rasta Jeff

653
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,829
I've been a longtime listener and I

654
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:10,809
really appreciate what you do for the

655
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,490
growing community thank you that means a

656
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:14,019
lot to me it says I'm happy to be a

657
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,210
supporter of the show and I look forward

658
00:22:14,019 --> 00:22:18,789
to every episode you're gonna love this

659
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,829
one because I am reading your message it

660
00:22:18,789 --> 00:22:23,049
goes on to say I have got a light leak

661
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:24,339
question I've been growing autos for a

662
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:26,379
little over a year and I would like to

663
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:28,899
try my hand at some of your regular

664
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,360
seeds for next season so this person has

665
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:33,280
been growing auto flower seeds which I

666
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,139
have nothing against but I do recommend

667
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,549
trying some regular seeds just to see

668
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,100
what it's like you get to control the

669
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:40,690
veg phase you get to top pop twist

670
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:42,339
lollipop you get to do all kinds of

671
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,100
different [Â __Â ] that we don't do with

672
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:47,049
autos so I think you will have fun it

673
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:49,119
goes on to say I have read and I have

674
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:50,829
heard from a few sources that it's

675
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,509
really important to prevent any light

676
00:22:50,829 --> 00:22:55,059
from getting into the grow during lights

677
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:57,430
out while growing regulars I think

678
00:22:55,059 --> 00:22:59,679
that's also important when growing autos

679
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:01,450
but I don't know if it's equally a sport

680
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,009
as important it goes on to say I

681
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,080
realized that keeping light out can

682
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:07,210
prevent messing up your plants but to

683
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,829
what extent do they really have to go

684
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,019
I've had people tell me that they go as

685
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:13,809
far as to cover the LED on the power bar

686
00:23:11,019 --> 00:23:15,910
and go to big lengths to make sure zero

687
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:18,549
light never gets in during lights out

688
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,410
how important is this plants they grow

689
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:22,450
outside don't get messed up from lights

690
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:24,130
with a full moon and a friend's outdoor

691
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,840
backyard grill wasn't ruined by car

692
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:27,669
headlights that drove by once in a

693
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,499
that's a very good point I've got a very

694
00:23:27,669 --> 00:23:30,940
good supporting argument for that it

695
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:32,229
says I fully understand what can happen

696
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:34,179
with lighting up your plants during

697
00:23:32,229 --> 00:23:37,179
lights out but where's the line between

698
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:39,759
good prevention and paranoia you can use

699
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:40,570
my name as Darrin W if this makes it on

700
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,489
to the show

701
00:23:40,569 --> 00:23:44,558
what up Darrin W thank you for the great

702
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:46,929
question let's dig in

703
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,898
to this one um they want to know how

704
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:53,559
important is total darkness during the

705
00:23:49,898 --> 00:23:56,439
night cycle in a flowering phase in my

706
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:59,168
opinion in an indoor environment the

707
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:02,169
dark cycle is very critical to not be

708
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:05,288
interrupted interruption of dark cycles

709
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:08,139
or light leaks are the number one cause

710
00:24:05,288 --> 00:24:10,898
to trigger a hermaphroditic or intersex

711
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:12,968
trait in a cannabis plant light leaks

712
00:24:10,898 --> 00:24:15,128
are the number one cause for

713
00:24:12,969 --> 00:24:17,440
hermaphrodites you guys that is the

714
00:24:15,128 --> 00:24:20,978
number one trigger for a problem in a

715
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:23,859
grow so in my opinion any white is a

716
00:24:20,979 --> 00:24:26,710
problem a speck of light for 30 seconds

717
00:24:23,858 --> 00:24:29,558
may be a problem I don't want any light

718
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:31,598
in there when I put my hand over my eyes

719
00:24:29,558 --> 00:24:33,278
I want that much darkness in my grow

720
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:35,229
room I want it to feel like somebody's

721
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,048
got me [Â __Â ] blindfolded I want to

722
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:39,669
feel like I'm lost in there I don't feel

723
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:42,038
like like I just want to feel like it's

724
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:44,200
total pitch-black darkness almost scary

725
00:24:42,038 --> 00:24:45,638
darkness in that grow room when the

726
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,619
lights are off no matter what it looks

727
00:24:45,638 --> 00:24:49,778
like outside even if it is sunshiny

728
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:51,278
outside I better not have any light

729
00:24:49,778 --> 00:24:53,409
shining through whatever I've chosen to

730
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,148
block off the window no light shining

731
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,950
through any gaps no lights coming from

732
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:58,898
underneath the door I don't want any

733
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,879
lights in my grow room during the night

734
00:24:58,898 --> 00:25:02,888
phase like I said that will lead to

735
00:25:00,878 --> 00:25:04,898
issues sometimes if you've got light

736
00:25:02,888 --> 00:25:07,238
leaks the plants will not even flower I

737
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:09,008
did a consultation for a guy he called

738
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:10,329
me up he's like hey bro my plants aren't

739
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:11,588
flowering I've been in flower for like

740
00:25:10,329 --> 00:25:12,759
six weeks they don't look like they're

741
00:25:11,588 --> 00:25:14,710
doing anything cuz like well this is

742
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:15,700
weird and I went over to the grow and I

743
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:17,619
looked at the grow and I liked your

744
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,940
plants are fully and veg what do you

745
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:21,038
mean you're not in flower he's like my

746
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,389
lights on 12 12 and I was like can you

747
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,618
prove that he's like well I mean I got a

748
00:25:22,388 --> 00:25:24,819
timer and it says they go off at this

749
00:25:23,618 --> 00:25:26,199
time and I've been in here when they go

750
00:25:24,819 --> 00:25:28,538
off and I leave and I come back the next

751
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,179
day and they're on I'm like okay timer

752
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:33,489
cycles I go it's daytime right now

753
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:35,589
outside the lights are on do me a favor

754
00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:37,119
close the door turn off the lights you

755
00:25:35,588 --> 00:25:39,579
turned off the lights close the door

756
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:41,740
there was [Â __Â ] sunshine

757
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:43,419
lasting through not just through the

758
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:45,279
wall the thing he put up on the wall to

759
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:46,900
cover the windows but also through all

760
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,849
of the ducting that he ran through the

761
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,830
lights he had vented hoods and there was

762
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:52,569
light coming through the duct sunshine

763
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:54,129
coming through the duct through the

764
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:55,210
light shining right onto the plants it

765
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:57,730
looked like you had the grow lights on

766
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:59,170
so his plants were never getting a dark

767
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:01,329
cycle because he was running that dark

768
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:03,160
cycle at like 5:00 p.m. so at 5:00 p.m.

769
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:04,809
it's still [Â __Â ] light outside the

770
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:06,430
lights went off they were still getting

771
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:08,049
plenty of light it was summertime I

772
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:09,730
think we stay see his lights about nine

773
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:10,990
o'clock he was getting four extra hours

774
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:13,000
of light he didn't even know about those

775
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:16,390
plants were not going to flower until it

776
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,950
got dark outside a little earlier so my

777
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:19,600
buddy was not getting flowering plants

778
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:22,150
my client was not getting flowering

779
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,039
plants because of a light leak it was a

780
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,930
major light leak but it is why they did

781
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:28,210
not flower light is what controls the

782
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:30,940
plants now you're gonna ask the next

783
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,819
thing you ask is why don't they [Â __Â ] up

784
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,070
outdoors that is a wonderful question

785
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:37,179
and I've got a really good answer I've

786
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:39,250
got to think about it cuz I didn't

787
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,160
research this I wasn't prepared but here

788
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,789
goes my brain as the Sun sets it puts

789
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:46,930
off a spectrum known as far-red

790
00:26:44,789 --> 00:26:48,639
something in the sky the reflection in

791
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:52,390
the sky turns that light too far read

792
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,970
that far red light triggers a response

793
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:57,100
in the plant a phytochrome response in

794
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:58,839
the plant that tells the plant hey the

795
00:26:57,099 --> 00:27:01,059
sun's going down you should go to sleep

796
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,379
so that basically tucks the plant in

797
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:04,029
it's like giving the plants a little bit

798
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,370
of nyquil or pulling the off switch for

799
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:08,379
the plants that phytochrome red makes

800
00:27:06,369 --> 00:27:11,469
him go to sleep so they are much more

801
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:12,880
put to sleep than they are up without

802
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,529
that phytochrome red they're kind of

803
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,910
tucked in they've got a little blanket

804
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:17,950
over and they got a couple ambien in

805
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:20,230
them they're doing just fine in a grow

806
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:22,600
room indoors we don't get phytochrome

807
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:25,870
red we don't have that some people are

808
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,339
installing far red lights in their

809
00:27:25,869 --> 00:27:28,359
lighting setups now I can't remember the

810
00:27:27,339 --> 00:27:30,039
name of the company and they didn't pay

811
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,929
me anyway but there are companies who

812
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,809
are including far red lights in there

813
00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:38,140
LED setups those plants will go to sleep

814
00:27:34,809 --> 00:27:39,460
more quickly they will be so a lot of

815
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,530
times we see the Sun go down

816
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:43,180
and we've get we get 14 hours of

817
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:44,829
daylight but our plants go into flower

818
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,299
that is because as they are setting as

819
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:48,519
the Sun sets that last couple hours

820
00:27:46,299 --> 00:27:50,289
we're getting phytochrome red we're

821
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:53,230
getting far red the plants are going to

822
00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:55,609
sleep so outside they're tucked in

823
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,680
indoors they're not tucked in if you

824
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:00,139
interrupt them indoors it is the same

825
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,850
similar intensity of light it gets to

826
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,950
those plants as they got during the day

827
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:05,929
during their day they can't tell the

828
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:08,420
difference they go Oh light bulb light

829
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,160
bulb I should wake up outdoors our

830
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,360
plants got phytochrome red they got a

831
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,380
couple of ambien in them they had a

832
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,119
couple of drinks they're [Â __Â ]

833
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:16,820
sleeping hard if you shine a flashlight

834
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:18,769
on them they go ah bro add the Sun all

835
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:21,049
day that ain't [Â __Â ] the Sun is the

836
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:23,000
biggest light you could ever imagine we

837
00:28:21,049 --> 00:28:24,649
cannot replicate it it is the biggest

838
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,539
ball of energy that there is that I am

839
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:28,640
aware of but I think anybody else is

840
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:30,170
[Â __Â ] aware if we cannot copy back all

841
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,940
day long and we're making grow lights

842
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:33,650
we're trying to mimic the power of the

843
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:35,750
Sun we cannot do it no matter how good

844
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,480
your grow lights are you can't copy the

845
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:40,250
Sun so the Sun shines on those plants

846
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,430
all day it's getting the perfect

847
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:45,049
spectrum the most you Mol's lumens watts

848
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,370
but it's not getting watts but it's

849
00:28:45,049 --> 00:28:48,169
getting all of the measurements of light

850
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:50,119
that you can imagine it's getting soaked

851
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:52,460
in them and it is getting the perfect

852
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:54,019
perfect spectrum because it is nature it

853
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,819
is the Sun whatever you believe in

854
00:28:54,019 --> 00:28:57,079
whatever God you believe in the Sun

855
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:59,329
should be high on the list of things you

856
00:28:57,079 --> 00:29:01,369
appreciate because the Sun is the source

857
00:28:59,329 --> 00:29:02,599
of life Sun and water without those I

858
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:05,029
think everything else probably just fall

859
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:06,799
apart so the Sun is out there the plants

860
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:08,509
are getting hit by Sun all day when you

861
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,669
shine some car lights on there the Sun

862
00:29:08,509 --> 00:29:12,230
goes now you got a flashlight good job

863
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,000
buddy I've been in the [Â __Â ] Sun all

864
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,349
day and I got a bunch of ambien and a

865
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,569
bunch of drinks in me I'm [Â __Â ]

866
00:29:15,349 --> 00:29:20,179
flashlight i canna wake me up so that is

867
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:22,730
why the plants don't freak out outdoors

868
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:25,250
when you get light interruptions now

869
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:27,470
sometimes the plants may freak out

870
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,539
outdoors if you get small light

871
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:30,769
interruptions but they've got to be they

872
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:32,240
probably got to be bigger than like a

873
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,859
flashlight maybe if you've got a

874
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,569
streetlight above your house in your

875
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:37,549
backyard or maybe if you got some sort

876
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:39,740
of lighting above you maybe a security

877
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:41,720
light that sort of stuff can disrupt

878
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:43,730
your outdoor plants but it's got to be

879
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:46,339
close and it's got to be intense but

880
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:49,490
that far red light is why we don't have

881
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:50,839
as many light leak issues outdoors and

882
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:53,299
the Sun and the moon

883
00:29:50,839 --> 00:29:55,309
ah that's nature bro the plants know

884
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:57,950
that that moon is something good they

885
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:59,240
don't freak out about that um they're

886
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:01,850
they're sleeping from the phytochrome

887
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,440
and the far-red so I think I explained

888
00:30:01,849 --> 00:30:05,299
that I think I rambled on quite a bit

889
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,410
about that I want to thank my friend

890
00:30:05,299 --> 00:30:08,569
Darren Debbie

891
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:10,190
for the great message I have got one

892
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:11,929
more patreon message I want to try to

893
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,480
read in this episode before my voice

894
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:16,700
burns out completely this one comes from

895
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,230
our friend in northern Terps no North

896
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,450
North chirps sorry didn't mean to [Â __Â ]

897
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:22,549
that up it goes like this

898
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,890
hey Rasta Jeff just want to start by

899
00:30:22,549 --> 00:30:26,629
saying thank you so much for all you do

900
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,550
and your show and I just want to give

901
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:30,710
you a big shout out I appreciate all the

902
00:30:28,549 --> 00:30:33,399
information I get from you with that

903
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:35,900
being said I was wondering about my

904
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:38,269
recirculating deep water culture system

905
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:40,070
um then honestly there are a couple of

906
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:41,900
typos here and I can't figure out

907
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:44,029
exactly what it says but it goes on to

908
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,350
say can I start my ceilings out the

909
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:48,589
first couple of weeks of their life

910
00:30:45,349 --> 00:30:49,849
using half ro and half tap water we've

911
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:52,609
talked about this in a previous episode

912
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:55,159
I don't know why you would mix ro and

913
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:57,589
tap water if you're using ro use ro if

914
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,630
you're using tap use tap that's like

915
00:30:57,589 --> 00:31:02,240
cleaning the floor and pissing on half

916
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,560
of it maybe that's extreme but I don't

917
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,750
know why you would clean water

918
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:07,549
completely clean and then add not clean

919
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,960
water back to it just use the dirty

920
00:31:07,549 --> 00:31:11,419
water don't waste the time and energy

921
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,600
halfway cleaning it or use the [Â __Â ]

922
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:16,400
clean water you got it use it um you can

923
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:18,349
use half and half maybe maybe it's

924
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,480
easier to I've got an idea maybe it's a

925
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:22,879
little bit easier to buffer solutions if

926
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,190
you mix that non pH or that non RO water

927
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,930
in there just use tap water if that's

928
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:28,549
the route you're gonna go and then it

929
00:31:26,930 --> 00:31:31,490
says what do you suggest when

930
00:31:28,549 --> 00:31:34,369
transplanting my ceilings for my router

931
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:36,109
two cubes and rockwool cubes see I think

932
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:38,750
you had fat fingers and I think you

933
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:40,219
mistyped that one there but you're

934
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:44,599
trying to go from rockwool cubes to

935
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,579
hydrogen media in the system um so you

936
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:48,139
can just take that rockwool cube fill

937
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:50,000
your you probably have a basket that

938
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,950
sits it hangs in the bucket just fill

939
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,839
that basket with your hydroton and just

940
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:55,069
set that cube right inside there deep

941
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:56,389
enough to where you know it's getting

942
00:31:55,069 --> 00:31:58,369
wet it should start getting some roots

943
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:00,740
hanging out of the bottom honestly a

944
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:02,599
deep water culture is not my thing I'm

945
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:04,640
not an expert I don't know a lot about

946
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:06,049
it but you've got that Rockwell cube in

947
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,550
a clone it's got some ah

948
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,139
a clone in the cube it's got some roots

949
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:11,029
hanging out of the bottom when you put

950
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,620
that in your basket with the hydrogen

951
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:14,240
clay pellets just make sure it's low

952
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:16,399
enough in there that the water is

953
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,930
misting and contacting the bottom of

954
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:20,000
those roots the bottom of that cube I

955
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,440
think it will be okay

956
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,470
I'm not exactly sure what your question

957
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,750
was because um man I got nothing but

958
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,089
love and respect but you kind of I think

959
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:30,319
autocorrect ruined your day on this one

960
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:31,579
buddy but thank you for the great

961
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,349
message it says I'm running general

962
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:35,259
hydroponics and I have a full line of gh

963
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:37,759
products as well as some great white

964
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:39,619
bacteria I think you'll have great

965
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,599
success with those products and with the

966
00:32:39,619 --> 00:32:43,099
great white just be very careful make

967
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:45,589
sure your pH stays in line

968
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:47,990
check your PPM's often keep in mind that

969
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:50,299
in a deep water culture system water

970
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,430
will evaporate as the water evaporates

971
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:55,099
your pH will change and your EC will

972
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,700
change the nutrients are not going to

973
00:32:55,099 --> 00:32:57,799
evaporate

974
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,690
they are solids their salts they're

975
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:01,639
heavy the water will evaporate the

976
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:04,279
nutrients will stay in there your pH

977
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:06,320
will change and your PPM's will rise as

978
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:08,690
the water evaporates make sure to check

979
00:33:06,319 --> 00:33:09,349
that on a daily basis right down the

980
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,870
PPM's

981
00:33:09,349 --> 00:33:13,669
write down the pH every day if you can

982
00:33:11,869 --> 00:33:15,109
check it every 12 hours check it when

983
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:16,519
you wake up check it when you get home

984
00:33:15,109 --> 00:33:18,349
from work or whatever you do all day

985
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:20,930
just check on it make sure that [Â __Â ] is

986
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:23,299
in line because very small mistakes and

987
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,970
deep water culture can lead to very big

988
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:27,829
disasters and they change rapidly if

989
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,579
it's a warm day got a lot of bubbles

990
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:30,439
going on

991
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:33,349
you can bubble off a couple of cups of

992
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,390
water no problem in that bubbling system

993
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:36,559
all that air in there really creates a

994
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,180
nice mist it creates a lot of

995
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,099
evaporation you'll get some loss

996
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,990
especially in a hot dry room it'll be

997
00:33:40,099 --> 00:33:44,209
humid all your water from your buckets

998
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:46,490
is now up in the air make sure you check

999
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:47,630
on that keep the humidity in line but it

1000
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,190
sounds like you're off to a good start

1001
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,110
you were worrying about getting that

1002
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,330
little baby into the cubes or into the

1003
00:33:51,109 --> 00:33:55,189
pellets I think you could just kind of

1004
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:57,230
get the basket put a small layer maybe

1005
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:59,090
one layer a hydroton then put the clone

1006
00:33:57,230 --> 00:34:00,500
in there and then just fill it up you're

1007
00:33:59,089 --> 00:34:02,059
gonna kind of cover the stock but make

1008
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,589
sure the plants sticking out you won't

1009
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,450
drown it you won't smother it cuz the

1010
00:34:03,589 --> 00:34:07,699
pellets have plenty of space in there

1011
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:09,409
and then eventually that thing will just

1012
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:12,230
start to fill up that whole section with

1013
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,730
roots it'll be one big basket and a

1014
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:15,590
bucket filled with roots it'll be

1015
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,090
[Â __Â ] awesome all right I hope I

1016
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,440
answered your question there were some

1017
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:20,750
typos in there it was a little bit hard

1018
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:22,878
to read I do speak stoner I speak

1019

davines and Turpin EES so sometimes I

1020
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,599
can decipher your code if there is more

1021
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:28,878
to that that I need to decipher and

1022
