115
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,039
all right so i did say i was going to

116
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:19,679
jump into the second half of the

117
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:21,840
questions

118
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,040
from our friend uh billy podunk from the

119
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,598
last episode

120
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,280
in the last episode billy did ask why a

121
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:28,639
golden goat bat cross and i took a

122
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,719
little bit of time to explain

123
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,479
why a golden goat back cross i got a lot

124
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,359
of great feedback on that one

125
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:35,840
um then we asked why the story of golden

126
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,519
goat

127
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,759
i talked a little bit about the story of

128
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,280
golden goat then the next question is

129
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,359
can you tell the story of

130
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,120
daybreaker and that does segue into can

131
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,879
you talk about the story of arise

132
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,680
because of course arise

133
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,518
is golden goat and daybreaker so let's

134
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,480
talk a little bit about daybreaker

135
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
daybreaker

136
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,518
uh is another strain that once again i

137
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:57,119
acquired from

138
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,599
another source the golden goat was a

139
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
gift from my friend pineapple express

140
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,719

141
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,640
hope you're well brother uh

142
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,080
the daybreaker was a gift from our

143
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,639
friends at gage green

144
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
genetics gage green genetics is another

145
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,639

146
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,518
things

147
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:14,958
um they actually inspired so i was given

148
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
the daybreaker

149
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
they inspired a lot of my naming schemes

150
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,758
they had

151
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,960
a lot of strain names with one

152
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,639
word inspirational or motivational type

153
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,359
words or words that they were using for

154
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,840
a little while

155
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,280
they had a strain name called devotion

156
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,239
and i just felt like

157
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,359
when i used their strain that i should

158
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,519
put their name

159
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,120
into the works into the name of the

160
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,159
cross to kind of honor the name of the

161
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,720
plant which is why

162
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,759
a rise uh daybreaker to golden go got a

163
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,080
one word

inspirational motivational uplifting

165

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,120
from

171
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,639
uh gage green genetics very uh

172
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,519
innovative folks in the cannabis

173
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,439
business

174
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,120
uh gauge green genetics not the other

175
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,839
gauge there's a lot of other fake gauges

176
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,759
out there

177
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,279
uh they are gauge green genetics has

178
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,639
been around for a long time that's the

179
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:14,079
og gage

180
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,800
uh so daybreaker daybreaker is a chem

181
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:17,839
d female we got the chem dog d female

182
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,520
pollinated by a

183
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:23,839
joseph og male i do not know the entire

184
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,439
story of the joseph og mail that was not

185
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,918
my og mail plant

186
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,918
to the best of my knowledge that was an

187
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,839
og mail gifted to

188
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,279
the gauge green genetics group or the

189
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,159
gage green group

190
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,038
there's mainly a couple of guys mike and

191
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,199
key play

192
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,639
that are mainly gauge green genetics and

193
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,919
i'm just speaking to the best of my

194
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,360
knowledge i could be wrong about

195
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:44,639
anything with gage green that's not my

196
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,120
company just people that i've worked

197
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
with

198
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,959
uh people in the industry so uh gauge

199
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
green is mainly

200
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:53,758
mic and key play and they run gage green

201
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,079
i got off topic of where i was going

202
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,520
there

203
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:59,038
anyway i acquired the uh so they got the

204
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,560
joseph og that's where i was they got

205
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,959
the joseph og mail

206
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,240
to the best of my knowledge joseph og

207
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,439
came from their friend

208
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,280
joseph who unfortunately passed away uh

209
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,918
is the story that i was told

210
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,839
all of that is cannabis legend and story

211
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,439
i don't have any verification of that

212
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:16,959
that's the best of what i know i like to

213
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,519
tell you the story behind a strain in a

214
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,839
plant

215
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,000
so there was joseph who gave the joseph

216
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:22,560
og to our friends at the gage green

217
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,959
group

218
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,038
gage green group then used the joseph og

219
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,918
to pollinate a chem d the chem d

220
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:31,759
of course uh sought out or uh searched

221
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:33,758
out chem dog strain from

222
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,199
uh chem dog and the legend of the 13

223
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,960
beans if you have not done the research

224
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,520
on chem dog and the legend of the 13

225
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,198
beans

226
00:06:37,519 --> 00:06:40,639
i definitely recommend that story it's

227
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,439
all over the internet somewhere that

228
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,280
stuff you should know if you're

229
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,918
interested in cannabis

230
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,559
so our folks at gage green group took

231
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:49,680
the

232
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,598
joseph og that's probably an og they

233
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
call it og that's an og kush then they

234
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:56,719
pollinated that

235
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,800
to the chem d that made daybreaker seeds

236
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,240
uh daybreaker was a great cross why did

237
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,560
i love the daybreaker

238
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,478
why did i personally love the daybreaker

239
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,478
i had a couple of female phenotypes and

240
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:07,680
of course i had a male which i used for

241
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:08,959
breeding which we'll talk about in a

242
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,160
little bit

243
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:15,359
the female phenotypes had a

244
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,759
uh gassy um like a

245
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,199
fresh rubber burnt tennis ball kind of a

246
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,879
smell if you open up a can of tennis

247
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,720
balls there's a very distinct

248
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,159
smell that kind of comes out distinct

249
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,599
right it's got stink in it

250
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,840
uh this smell comes out and it just

251
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,478
smells really it's a pungent

252
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,239
uh rubbery dry but pungent smell it's

253
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,879
almost got a gassiness sort of a thing

254
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,439
to it

255
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,918
sometimes when i buy new stickers uh if

256
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,160
i get

257
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,318
bulk stickers from a sticker printer

258
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
sometimes they have a skunky

259
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,520
chemically sort of a smell to it and

260
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,000
that's kind of what a lot of these uh

261
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,560
daybreaker phenotypes were smelling like

262
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
it was gassy it was funky i describe it

263
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
as cushy and diesely which makes sense

264
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
because there's kush

265
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,598
and chem in there it's got those flavors

266
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
but if you don't know what kush and kim

267
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,159
smell like then you've got to make those

268
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,319
up as well

269
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,599
so it's like chemicals and burnt plastic

270
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,160
and tennis balls and all kinds of

271
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,878
wonderful

272
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,319
terrible smells come from their swampy

273
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,039
foot aromas dirty

274
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,800
armpit aromas body odors a lot of that

275
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,159
sort of stuff the leaves on these plants

276
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,439
were gigantic

277
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,520
the leaves that were coming from the

278
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,439
daybreaker seeds the plants were

279
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,639
gigantic you could serve [ __ ] dinner

280
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,598
on the sides of these leaves they were

281
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,439
dinner plates

282
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:23,120
which leads into later on why i chose to

283
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,759
use this plant for breeding

284
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,280
i would make beautiful purple colors but

285
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,520
it did have like a

286
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,638
a stretchy sort of a structure just that

287
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,478
og kush

288
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,879
sort of a thing that og kush does it

289
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
doesn't menora out like some of your uh

290
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,799
more

291
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,399
uh sought after just stretchy kind of

292
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,598
shaped plants the sought after shape is

293
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,719
what i was trying to say my brain is

294
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,919
really ahead of me today

295
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,920
i know what i'm trying to say my [ __ ]

296
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,000
mouth can't keep up it makes more of a

297
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,759
lanky stretchy sort of a thing

298
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,519
but it's worth it because the quality of

299
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,080
the buds that it puts out are so

300
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,159
pungent and so delicious it's got like

301
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,080
burnt rubber and mothballs and chocolate

302
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,079
and all that chemically stuff going on

303
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,240
but then they're just little dense golf

304
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
balls that are so hard and so coated in

305
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,639
resin

306
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:06,000
that when you put them in a bag like two

307
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:07,199
little nugs there's an eighth and people

308
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,639
are like that's not eighth row and they

309
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,839
put it on the scale in a ways four and

310
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:11,759
they're like holy [ __ ]

311
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,920
like i just it was just such good herb

312
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,679
and for the era when i found it and

313
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:16,240
discovered it that's when the kush and

314
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,838
the

315
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,919
rock buds and the tight dense [ __ ]

316
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,240
that's when that was super popular so

317
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,000
the daybreaker was great for that og

318
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,680
stank funk stuff

319
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,879
so that is the daybreaker let's talk a

320
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:28,319
little bit about daybreaker was the

321
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:29,439
first question the story of the

322
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,839
daybreaker

323
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,279
i don't know the inspiration behind

324
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,160
breeding that i don't know that that

325
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,320
wasn't my work

326
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,639
i acquired a package of seeds i was a

327
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,000
tester for the gage green group for a

328
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,879
really long time

329
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,399
uh they sent me the starlet cush i used

330
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,159
the starlet kush

331
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,679
i was a tester of that one and i

332
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,360
actually took photos of that and sent

333
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:50,799
those to gage and they put that they

334
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
didn't put them on there they submitted

335
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,599
them to skunk magazine

349
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,000
i was a tester for gage um i tested a

350
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:19,200
lot of stuff for gage a lot

351
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,639
of winners some things that i wouldn't

352
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,920
have told him to put out and he listened

353
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,559
he took good advice they took good

354
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,958
advice

355
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:26,799
uh they took my my word um they used

356
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,639
what i had to say as an input

357
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,479
um they didn't just discredit me so

358
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:31,679
after testing for them for a long time

359
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,959
they just started sending me stuff

360
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:34,159
randomly and then i got to pack a

361
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,199
daybreaker and thought i'm going to grow

362
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,240
the [ __ ] out of these because i liked

363
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
the description

364
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,000
i grew it and found a couple of great

365
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,439
females that stuck around for a little

366
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,639
bit i grew them i worked with them i

367
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,800
smoked them i played with them

368
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,720
i shared clones of those but i found a

369
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,719
male that

370
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
was just amazing most of what i'm known

371
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,120
for breeding

372
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:54,799
is very sativa heavy it's got that panic

373
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,480
attack it's got the longer skinny leaves

374
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:58,479
it grows tall and skinny

375
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,079
and i was kind of breeding myself into a

376
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,759
box with a lot of that stuff i was

377
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,919
just reading the same thing the lemon

378
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,838
jeffrey the golden goat crosses

379
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:07,439
a lot of golden goat crosses so it's all

380
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,720
coming out kind of kind of go in the

381
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
same direction

382
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,399
and i wanted to try something new also i

383
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,078
had in mind of making

384
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
a couple of back crosses and other

385
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,319
things so i saw this

386
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,240
daybreaker male with these big wide fan

387
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,920
leaves and these purple colors

388
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,680
and it didn't want to drink the

389
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,159
daybreaker just doesn't want water you

390
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:26,559
can

391
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:28,240
not feed that [ __ ] for twice as long as

392
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,879
all the other plants not water her and

393
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,278
she will be

394
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,799
just fine uh when you do water her the

395
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:33,838
leaves stay droopy because the leaves

396
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:35,278
were so big

397
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,959
that when you water her the leaves would

398
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,399
just stay there and she looked angry

399
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,159
when you'd water her that plant wanted

400
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,078
it really really dry and that's a good

401
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,679
trait because that buys me time that

402
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:45,439
means the offspring later

403
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,039
possibly won't need as much water i can

404
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,800
water and then actually go for

405
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,480
a couple of days without having to water

406
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,319
those plants i can go take a break go on

407
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,278
vacation maybe go see fish maybe go do

408
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,839
some stuff

409
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,519
so ah i saw this daybreaker plant i saw

410
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,680
this male plant and this male plant that

411
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,560
was coming out when i would rub the stem

412
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:03,439
it smelled disgusting it had the most

413
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:05,359
pungent

414
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,360
disgusting aromas coming out of it and i

415
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
thought this is a breeder plant i need

416
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,440
to breed with this it was making purple

417
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,600
colors i was making trichomes add a

418
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,800
beautiful shape a beautiful structure

419
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,320
it was just as a breeder i knew this

420
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,078
dude right here needs to do

421
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,560
some [ __ ] pollen chucking in this

422
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,679
room so i put him in a room

423
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,239
with several females a lot of the stuff

424
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,078
never got put out the daybreaker crosses

425
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,079
uh there were probably when i make a

426
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,120
cross i don't just put one female in the

427
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,159
room that's not

428
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,839
like that that's cool you're gonna make

429
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,120
a new cross but why not put seven or

430
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,880
eight females in there whatever your

431
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,000
legal limit whatever your space limit is

432
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,679
something like that

433
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,120
put a lot in there make a lot of seeds

434
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,879
if you're gonna do it do it

435
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,560
so i had a lot of females in the room at

436
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,200
the time there was

437
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:51,199
um a girl scout cookies plant in the in

438
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,600
the room that one got called coffee cake

439
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,920
the girl scout cookies to daybreaker

440
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,200
um there was there were a lot in there i

441
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,599
can't even remember all of them right

442
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,480
now

443
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,240
um floata daybreaker there's a bunch of

444
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,839
good [ __ ] in there there was a lot of

445
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,720
good [ __ ] in there i still have a lot of

446
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,440
it also

447
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
um now my inbox is gonna blow up but uh

448
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
coffee cake you guys

449
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,199
anyway so i thought i'm going to put the

450
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,920
golden goat in there because

451
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,519
golden goat my selections on breeding um

452
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:18,399
are very important in my opinion

453
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,720
selection is

454
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,559
key it was very important that i chose

455
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,360
good breeding plants i put golden goat

456
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,000
in there

457
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,919
because golden goat was so completely

458
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
different from this daybreaker plant why

459
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,360
would i want to make

460
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,240
daybreaker to daybreaker why would i

461
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
want to put

462
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,639
chocolate mothballs gas and funk to more

463
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,078
chocolate moth balls gas and funk that's

464
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,399
going to come out the same thing

465
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,599
or or the breeding is going to be so

466
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,679
weird that those two

467
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,440
all those powerful traits the gas

468
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:47,278
mothballs funk chocolate

469
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,160
tennis balls all those terps are going

470
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,278
to meet in the middle and they're going

471
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,719
to cancel each other out and it's going

472
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:51,360
to come out smelling like raspberries or

473
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,879
something

474
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,480
like weird [ __ ] like that happens in

475
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,799
breeding what i would rather do

476
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,320
is take this chocolate funk and mix it

477
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:59,838
into other things like

478
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,760
the strawberry starburst you get

479
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,360
strawberry chocolate funk the girl's got

480
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,480
cookies it was kind of similar there but

481
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,600
you know you got to cross everything to

482
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,000
the [ __ ] cookies

483
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,600
uh the platinum tangy because then you

484
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,039
get the orange to the chocolate funk

485
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
that's kind of my idea when i'm breeding

486
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,078
to the lemon skunk there is actually

487
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:15,439
daybreaker to lemon skunk those seeds

488
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:17,599
really do exist

489
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
but things like that so that i can make

490
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,639
new [ __ ] i don't want to just

491
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,839
replicate and duplicate all the terps

492
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,480
that are already happening there's

493
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,000
enough

494
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,079
uh dessert and gas and [ __ ] kush

495
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
kind of smells like there's already cake

496
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,439
and [ __ ] twinkies and terps

497
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
that's already happening everywhere so i

498
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,880
want to make some new [ __ ] i try to

499
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,360
open up my breeding not bottle my

500
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,958
bottleneck myself into one direction so

501
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,120
selecting this golden goat to the

502
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:42,958
daybreaker i knew there was going to be

503
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,799
some amazing [ __ ] coming out of that the

504
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,559
golden goat we've talked about her

505
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:47,838
high potency everything i breed to the

506
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,239
golden goat comes out

507
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,240
highly potent uh golden goat to itself

508
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,959
golden goat as a male golden goat as a

509
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,879
female

510
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,119
anything i breed with the golden goat it

511
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,159
comes out magical so

512
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,440
uh i took the daybreaker male

513
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,838
uh beautiful structure stank ass aroma

514
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,880
making purple colors purple trichomes

515
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,800
the leaves were purple

516
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,320
big giant leaves the leaves would turn

517
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,599
black and start crinkling up toward the

518
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
end of the flowering phase

519
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,879
i took this male and i put them in a

520
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:16,639
room with all these other girls and in

521
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,000
that room was the golden goat so we did

522
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,159
some pollen chucking

523
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,320
now we have got a golden goat female

524
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:25,838
pollinated by that daybreaker male

525
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,440
that made a rise what a rise one of my

526
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,240
flagship strains one of my most popular

527
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,320
strains

528
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,600
arise tested at i don't even want to

529
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,879
save the numbers without pulling it up

530
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,879
somewhere because nobody ever believes

531
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,600
me it was 35.84

532
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,000
thca it was grown by our friends at

533
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,320
organica in albuquerque new mexico i

534
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
think

535

way i know miles touched it and it was

537
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,120

guys

545
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:03,120
um where the hell was i arise arise uh

546
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,639
daybreaker and golden goat cross right

547
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,799
um our rise was golden goat and

548
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,198
daybreaker i knew that it was going to

549
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,758
be a champion i grew a bunch of seeds

550
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,120
out of that

551
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,039
out immediately and very early on they

552
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,600
were just taking off they was going

553
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:19,198
most of the other seeds um i buy seeds

554
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,120
from other breeders i pop a lot of other

555
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:23,198
seeds i've bred a lot of other seeds

556
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,440
other seeds in that room were just not

557
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,439
doing what a ryze was doing a rise was

558
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,880
a rising to the occasion she was [ __ ]

559
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,079
taken off he was taken off there were

560
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,919
boys and girls in there

561
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,599
they were all exploding with growth and

562
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,078
i was like think i'm on to something

563
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,600
here

564
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,719
and i watched a few of the other crosses

565
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,320
in the room and they were growing they

566
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,639
were doing their thing but that arise

567
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,440
just kept going and going

568
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,919
every phenotype i grew of that was a

569
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,320
winner

570
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:47,278
i couldn't find one from that batch of a

571
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,079
rise that

572
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,120
i didn't want to keep uh those the first

573
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,239
batch was labeled

574
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,759
a b c d e uh all the way up to g

575
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,600
i think uh a and e were kept around for

576
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,278
a very very long time

577
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,160
f was around for quite a while i've

578
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:06,798
crossed i've made f2s of a and e

579
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,319
and f on possibly a couple others that i

580
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,879
don't talk about as much

581
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,519
uh then from another batch i discovered

582
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,919
um

583
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,240
number four and number eight and these

584
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,880
are females these were all female

585
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,078
arise crosses a rise f1s that i was

586
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,079
keeping around

587
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:26,078
um i've made f2s with the the same male

588
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,198
uh the solomon male the male that's been

589
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,079
dubbed solomon

590
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,679
but i kept him around um i made f twos

591
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,159
of the number eight the number four the

592
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,679
number

593
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,519
seven e a f possibly g that sounds like

594
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,038
a [ __ ] guitar chord right there e a f

595
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,160
g sounds like a [ __ ] guitar structure

596
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,480
chord structure

597
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,000
uh but i made f twos of a lot of those

598
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,599
uh there were so many good

599
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,919
phenotypes around that i just couldn't

600
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:49,599
there were subtle differences but like

601
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,120
so many similarities some were kind of

602
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:52,079
more golden goats some were kind of more

603
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,079
og kush

604
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,519
and if you smoke og kush or kemdog you

605
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,879
get [ __ ] high as [ __ ] from those if

606
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,359
you smoke golden goat you get high as

607
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,440
[ __ ]

608
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,479
so either buzz was completely desirable

609
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,679
sometimes i'm sit on

610
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,679
would end up sitting on the couch

611
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,200
sometimes i'd end up [ __ ] saying i'm

612
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,798
gonna go sit down and watch tv and i'd

613
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,240
end up in the kitchen cooking food and

614
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:09,200
cleaning the basement all the same

615
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,880
[ __ ] time

616
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,720
so it was like it was just tremendous

617
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,760
herb every phenotype had something to

618
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,319
offer

619
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,720
the smells were like sweet kush how can

620
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:21,439
you go wrong with sweetness and kush so

621
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,759
that was a rise uh then we'll talk about

622
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,720
the

623
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:26,000
arise male who was known as king solomon

624
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,400
i found a boy

625
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,359
in that batch of seeds i actually fino

626
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,880
hunted a boy

627
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:32,479
out of that batch of seeds i went

628
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,559
through several seeds looking for the

629
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,640
perfect male because i knew

630
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,639
i just knew there was a male in that

631
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,240
batch of seeds that was going to pass on

632
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,640
the magic that i saw

633
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,038
in that original cross when i first grew

634
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,000
that first batch of f1 or rye seeds i

635
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:47,759
saw them

636
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,519
like they didn't come out of the soil

637
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,000
they [ __ ] kicked the soil out of the

638
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,839
way

639
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,519
and they came out screaming like we're

640
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,319
[ __ ] here and we're gonna grow and

641
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:56,079
you cannot

642
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:57,359
stop us and i was like holy [ __ ] these

643
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:58,720
plants are onto something

644
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:00,240
i thought they were all boys because

645
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,360
usually male plants grow with that kind

646
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,279
of vigor but these

647
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,599
female and male plants were all just

648
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,558
taken off so i wanted to make that vigor

649
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,959
continue

650
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,480
so i found a few of my favorite female

651
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,919
plants of course that's how i do it like

652
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,200
i said before if i'm gonna pollinate

653
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,640
something i'm gonna pollinate a whole

654
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,480
bunch of [ __ ] somethings

655
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,000
so i found my daybreaker mail and i put

656
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,000
a bunch of ladies in the room

657
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,558
and i just started pollinating things

658
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,519
and here we are today i've got probably

659
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,359
i want to say that king solomon um is

660
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:31,519
probably responsible

661
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:33,918
for nearly a hundred crosses probably

662
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,679
uh 50 of them have been released

663
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,480
probably maybe close to that i don't

664
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,640
know but

665
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,839
that day breaker pollinated the golden

666
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,038
goat made

667
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,720
a rise a rise was i selected a male

668
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:46,319
he has been called solomon if you read

669
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,839
about king solomon uh

670
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,359
ladies were his weakness he could have

671
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,159
had anything he wanted he wanted a lot

672
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:52,319
of ladies

673
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,919
i thought my male plant should be named

674
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,678
solomon because he's got a lot of kids

675
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,520
everywhere just like solomon did

676
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,840
um that's some rasta [ __ ] right there

677
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,879
for you a peek into into my little rasta

678
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,359
brain

679
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,280
anyway that is the story you guys of

680
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,000
daybreaker daybreaker is not really my

681
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:07,599
story to tell

682
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,038
that's another breeder's story i gave

683
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,480
you my uh my

684
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:12,319
experience with it i know that it came

685
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,919
from the gage green group uh

686
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:15,599
came from mike and key play i got the

687
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,759
seeds because i used to be a tester

688
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,439
i did not test the daybreaker i would

689
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,440
not have bred with it had i tested it it

690
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,798
was already out it was given as a gift

691
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,919
free reign on breeding with that one i

692
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:24,798
don't think you should breed with the

693
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:26,960
tester

694
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,558
that's uh just another thing so i got

695
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,079
that one i grew it i

696
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,599
[ __ ] saw great potential in it

697
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,439
there's just something about

698
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,119
i'm like a cannabis matchmaker when i

699

of cheating at this point i know that my

715
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,120

some of the most elite female plants on

725
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:23,119
the planet i've got access to a lot of

726
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
stuff i've got friends that will acquire

727
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,839

whatever i want you guys

730
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,960
and people return me clones of things if

731
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,319
i breed something and they grow it and

732
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,400
they find something stellar a lot of

733
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,000
times people offer to return me a clone

734
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,519
i've been taking more people up on those

735
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,519
offers so that i could do some more

736
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,519
uh reversals and some different projects

737
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,240
but so i've got female clones female

738
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,480
plants that

739
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,359
have been tried true tested they've been

740
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,279
through the wringer

741
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,399
i also have a lot of experience in the

742
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,879
commercial uh

743
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,159
cultivation uh what is it industry here

744
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,520
in colorado so i've been to a lot of

745
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,080
commercial growers and i went to a lot

746
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,839
of them

747
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:57,119
for extended periods of time i would go

748
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:59,279
to this one place for

749
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:00,158
maybe a four to eight maybe a 12 16 week

750
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,000
contract

751
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,600
uh maybe a two harvest full complete

752
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,279
harvest contract and i get to see their

753
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,839
plants for two full harvests

754
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,319
once or twice a week um by then you

755
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,079
learn

756
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,079
that plant sucks that plant's awesome

757
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,759
that plant sucks that plant's awesome

758
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,839
that one right there talks to me that

759
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,119
plant right there says something

760
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,959
can i get a clone of that and then

761
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,719
somehow we managed to get me a clone

762
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,000
i get it in my [ __ ] personal grow we

763
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,200
get rid of all the problems that

764
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,038
came with that clone because it came

765
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,679
from that dispensary grow

766
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,119
clean it up breed to it and voila we've

767
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,159
got another magic ingredient to make

768
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:31,839
more magic

769
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,840
my plants have been vetted and tested i

770
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,439
am kind of cheating but i know that i've

771
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:36,240
got successful breeding plants because

772
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,360
of that

773
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:41,519
so that is the story of a rise she tests

774
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,798
super high there's a full podcast about

775
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:44,400
arise

776
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,400
but i do enjoy kind of revisiting

777
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,320
because it's been years since i did that

778
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,840
podcast that episode definitely wasn't a

779
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,319
video podcast

780
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,359
ah a ryze eats very heavy her rise gets

781
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,038
pretty tall

782
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,879
she takes well to defoliation she can

783
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,640
handle high temperatures

784
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
uh right now it's probably kind of hard

785
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,320
to get a rise there are not a lot of

786
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,840
seeds left especially after this episode

787
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,079
airs they will sell out everywhere if

788
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,599
it's not already sold out

strains that i'm putting out

795

time and it's it's honestly just me i

813
