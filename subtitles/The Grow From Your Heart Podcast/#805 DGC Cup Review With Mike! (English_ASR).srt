stressful up there but the drive wasn't

77
00:02:43,378 --> 00:02:47,579
the most relaxing drive we could have

78
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,318
asked for two near-death experiences it

79
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,700
was raining it was wild so once we got

80

81
00:02:50,699 --> 00:02:54,780

00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,720
redder than uh the growth from your

166
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,400
heart logo that's probably down there in

167
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,860
the corner my eyes were redder than that

168
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:43,620
little red spot uh I felt like I had

169
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,300
drank a mouthful of sand in my sleep it

170
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,160
took me about an hour to get my life

171
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,840
back together I want to shake off that

172
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,960
buzz I'm not complaining but wow that

173
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,159
was a a fuzzy night yeah put ourselves

174
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:55,379
through some stuff I woke up in the

175
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,240
middle of the night my voice still isn't

176
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,459
right you felt like my throat was just

177
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,780
PVC I had to go drink hot water until I

178
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,538
could breathe you're drinking hot water

179
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:06,119
yep just got the top hot started just

180
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,620
splashes the hot water on the thing I

181
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,060
could breathe again man drinking hot

182
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,620
water to breathe again just is the

183
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,000
opposite of what I do it's crazy how we

184
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,160
handle things differently that made my

185
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,019
body feel weird I know tea is hot chick

186
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,000
it's the secret man if you get a sore

187
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:19,799
throat or Smoker's throat a little warm

188
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,060
water see I fired up the shower and got

189
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,620
that steam in there that's what David

190
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,899
for me so if you're right and that's hot

191
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,819
water bro but you were fighting dabs and

192
00:06:24,899 --> 00:06:28,620
Paul and I was fighting dabs that's true

193
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,939

194
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,620
left anyway

195
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:33,360
um we woke up quite crispy in separate

196
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,918
hotel rooms we're gonna add uh quite

197
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,419
crispy yeah it was uh I don't want to

198
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,219
listen to this dude snore it's funny if

199
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:40,019
they put us several rooms away from each

200
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,880
other at the hotel but it still worked

201
00:06:40,019 --> 00:06:44,639
out yeah I got a quarter room it was so

202
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:46,500
quiet as soon you left the room you

203
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,418
could hear people in the hotel but in my

204
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,339
room it was perfect silence yeah my room

205
00:06:48,418 --> 00:06:53,339
sounded pretty busy was facing a parking

206

with my window halfway open at the hotel

211
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,680

that people were looking for me I was

245
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:04,379

so many times like don't meet people you

256
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:27,839
bet on the internet in real life and

257
00:08:24,899 --> 00:08:28,978
that was such a blast oh yeah sometimes

258
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:30,899
you need to go meet some internet

259
00:08:28,978 --> 00:08:32,158
friends and have a real good weekend we

260

261
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:35,580
internet friends so that's just a

262
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:37,620
pre-party guys oh that was just Friday

263
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,000
night eventually the dude came and he

264
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,620
turned on the lights and turned off the

265
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,719
lights and made us all pack up and go

266
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,500
home boo to the dude no I'm just joking

267
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,879
bro

268
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,139
um he said it was because of the city of

269
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,299
Laporte we know it's because the dude

270
00:08:46,139 --> 00:08:50,580
was tired uh he came and shut down the

271
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:52,620
party made everybody go home

272
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:54,540
um dude I love you bro I'm just picking

273
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:56,039
on you so uh we all went back to the

274
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,719
hotel some people went out and partied

275
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,939
and stuff I realized it was probably the

276
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,740
best move to go hydrate and go get some

277
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,180
rest because not everybody else was a

278
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,620
vendor they were all competitors and

279
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:07,019
chilling so they all went to breakfast

280
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,659
the next day and stumbled in hours later

281
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:11,039
yeah uh we were there uh for all the

282
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,600
vendors we showed up kind of toward the

283
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,219
middle of the vendor arrival we weren't

284
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,440
first we weren't last but it took us a

285
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:18,120
little bit to get set up because we kind

286
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,120
of had one of the more elaborate extra

287
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:23,700
extravagant boots I felt like yeah the

288
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,919
that nice heavy Banner takes a second to

289
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:28,080
set up looks really really good but uh

290
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,539
the folks with a little cloth Banner

291
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,820
like I understand those advantages that

292
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,319
look really light oh yeah I've got a

293
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,700
I've got a couple people on my team

294
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,379

295

296
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:40,259

carry [ __ ] too yeah everybody threw it

298
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,100
it's it's such an awesome little

299
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:46,980
community and for the dgc cup it's all

300
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,600
family people it's not a huge open to

301
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,159
everyone event so

302
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,659
that's just like a whole bunch of

303
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,039
brothers and sisters and uncles and

304
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:55,679
cousins helping out with everything it's

305
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,019
awesome I think there were 320 tickets

306
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:00,059
sold plus whatever VIPs and vendor

307
00:09:58,019 --> 00:10:03,600
passes and whatever I guess there was

308
00:10:00,059 --> 00:10:05,639
about 350 people there at most times at

309
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,259
times it felt like way more but it it

310
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:09,838
always felt like the right amount of

311
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:11,580
people it was perfect yeah they were

312
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,839
talking about if they want to expand it

313
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,759
or if they want to keep it the way that

314
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,800
it is and my vote you guys dude uh

315
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,299
Scotty if it matters at all uh keep it

316
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,639
the size it was it was perfect if you

317
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:22,199
make it any larger you have to add more

318
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:24,360
infrastructure which will mean that you

319
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,278
have to add too many more people to it

320
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,959
to keep the vibe that it's got to make

321
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,820
it to add more infrastructure is going

322
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:31,919
to cost enough money to offset that cost

323
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,420
you got to add too many more people keep

324
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,979
it the way that it is that's my vote but

325
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,899
it's your event dude I'll keep coming

the cup if you're unfamiliar uh entries

501
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,019
were what one big fat jar nugs I'm sure

502
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,278
they lose a specific weight I think it

503
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:33,539
was either an ounce or two ounces you

504
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:35,159
had to enter probably and I was

505
00:16:33,539 --> 00:16:36,659
announced yeah enter one ounce I had a

506
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:39,480
conversation with somebody one everybody

507
00:16:36,659 --> 00:16:41,519
had a nice fat jar to enter and then uh

508
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,800
each jar was randomly assigned a number

509
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,959
the jars are sort of lined up with a bun

510
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,000
tender in front of each one helping

511

super excited because this was my friend

550
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,079
Project's very first year entering in

551
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:12,298
any sort of competition he's never

552
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,639
entered his cannabis his grow into any

553
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:15,839
sort of uh event before he's uh said

554
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,160
that he's never been proud enough to

555
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,859
think it was good enough he entered into

on the button but there were supposed to

561
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,558
be 50 competitors and they sold out so

562
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,779
there should have been at least 47 or

563
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,119
50. they sold out of competitor slots

564
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:41,759

565
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:45,239

631
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,339
frustrating month with social media

632
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,019
social media keeps messing with her

633
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:59,399
taking down accounts

634
00:20:58,019 --> 00:21:00,599
um so that's that drives you nuts when

635
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,640
you're trying to build a brand and get

636
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,439
things going she wasn't going to come to

637
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,940
the cup and I gave her a weird pep talk

638
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Rasta Jeff style I said just because you

639
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:09,360
don't have social media doesn't mean you

640
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,340
can't come to a Cannabis Cup in order to

641
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,439
a Grower's cup and win and guess what

642
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:14,639
she did not need any social media she

643
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,200
won the cup it would have been awesome

644
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,600
to share that on social media but it's

645
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,279
really just it's social media she still

646
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,558

764
00:25:20,579 --> 00:25:25,319
just continuously one one person after

767
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:31,380
consumption and then pizzas arrived out

768
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,759
of nowhere rasufa came by and he said

769
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:34,620
roster Jeff what kind of pizza White

770
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:36,839
Mike what kind of pizza and we thought

771
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:38,278
that pizza line is is quite long it'll

772
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,220
be a little while and we'll have pizzas

773
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:43,679
dude suddenly it wasn't that long

774
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,919
suddenly pizzas appeared and they were

775
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,419
freaking delicious I don't I'm not

776
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,740
doubting the quality of that pizza it

777
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,200
might have been half because I was

778
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,000
starving like a [ __ ] hostage but also

779
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:55,620
that [ __ ] was so good right like you

780
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,659
have to take into account that we were

781
00:25:55,619 --> 00:26:00,418
at a Cannabis Cup and for the hour

782
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,700
before we were able to eat we definitely

783
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,038
wanted to eat and the wind had changed

784
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,640
so that the smell of the pizza ovens oh

785
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,379
yes drifting across us so by the time

786
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,320
the pizza showed up we were definitely

787
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,179
ready for the pizza but that was a 10. I

788
00:26:13,319 --> 00:26:16,619

789
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:19,440

830
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,038
looking seeds uh they're just ugly

831
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,139
they're not as big and round and colored

832
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,879
as uh those seeds are that I think are a

833
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:40,380
grade so I couldn't sell them as a grade

834
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,720
C's like that's what I call some B

835
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:45,000
grades they still grow amazing plants

836
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,798
they just they're ugly seeds

837
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,240
um but ugly seeds make pretty plants

838
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,679

about kangaroo some uh beautiful smart

847
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,538
ass I love this joke somebody told his

848
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:12,240
friend that the password was

849
00:28:09,538 --> 00:28:14,579
hippopotamus so this nice kind gentleman

850
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,000
unsuspecting gentleman walked up three

851
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:19,918
unsuspected before the guy came up and

852
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,240
owned his joke they said with confidence

853
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,740
they'd walk up to us and say

854
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,339
hippopotamus

855
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,500
yeah

856
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:26,879
I just laughed and gave them seeds

857
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:28,558
because I knew what had happened I was

858
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,679
like hey you're you're close bro you're

859
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:33,480
close but first person that came up to

860
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,340
me and said hippopotamus I walked him

861
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,839
through until they got kangaroo and the

862
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,178
second person I was just like oh man

863
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,558
it's a trend now the third one I I knew

864
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:42,298
what had happened immediately I was like

865
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:45,658
somebody told somebody the password but

866
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:47,759
they did it like they got telephone and

867
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:50,159
eventually that kangaroo became

868
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,079
hippopotamus which hey whatever I'll

869

903
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,058
want to tell the people about here on

904
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,200
the podcast that you remember from the

905
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:54,798
cup

906
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:56,700
um well there was the one of my favorite

907
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,918
Cannabis Cup

908
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,200
moments there's always little cup magic

909
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:02,399
there's

910
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,480
serendipitous little moments that can't

911
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:08,459
be explained with rational anything and

912
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,278
there was a moment with

913
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,919
Tardis and a gentleman by the name of

914
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:17,298
John I believe yes

915
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,820
um who are from a different state

916
00:30:17,298 --> 00:30:22,740
and uh John walked up to the booth and

917
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,178
said hey Jeff sorry I missed you last

918
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,819
year

919
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:29,460
um check this jar of Vortex that I have

920
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:31,398
out you've got to smell it and that's

921
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,899
just sort of how the high Jeff

922
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:35,639
conversation went at this at the VIP

923
00:30:33,898 --> 00:30:38,939
party

924
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:40,799
um Jeff laughs and goes Vortex huh if by

925
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,380
Body Tardis shows up you're gonna have

926
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:46,079
to show them this and then Jeff sniffs

927
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,179
the jar and says that's awesome hands it

928
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:49,558
back and gets distracted by something

929
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,159
next to us

930
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:56,398
as he gets distracted Tardis appears out

931
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:59,460
of the [ __ ] Vapor there's like he was

932
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:01,558
summoned he was goes hey guys what's

933
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:03,600
going on and we all kind of laugh and

934
00:31:01,558 --> 00:31:06,839
I'm like no way we literally just said

935
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,759
your name you gotta smell this and he

936
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:11,398
looks at John who's holding a jar of

937
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:14,519
Vortex and they look at each other funny

938
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:17,278
and he smells the jar of Vortex and gets

939
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,398
excited and it happens to be his

940
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:22,259
favorite Fino of the vortex and they're

941
00:31:20,398 --> 00:31:25,019
giggling like school girls and then it

942
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:28,079
Dawns on them that they know each other

943
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:31,379
from home because they were accosted in

944
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:33,240
public by a crazy person together as

945
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,700
strange they're strangers they both

946
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,659
happen to be on a street together and a

947
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:42,480
crazy woman accosted them

948
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:44,278
and it happened insanely enough that

949
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,558
they registered like oh I looked at you

950
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,898
and I remember you from that and here

951
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:52,200
they are a whole other state away at a

952
00:31:48,898 --> 00:31:55,079
cannabis a cup a highest giraffe [ __ ]

953
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,919
and one of them has the other's favorite

954
00:31:55,079 --> 00:32:01,798
herb and Jeff summoned the moment out of

955
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:03,720
the vapor like it was beautiful everyone

956
00:32:01,798 --> 00:32:05,398

about my buddy uh Tardis ate one of

975
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:39,778

977

978

979
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,278
him Terps warned everybody eat this when

980
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:49,559
you go home and go to bed but Tardis is

981

1014
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,980
Terps disagreed with you dude when it

1015

hit my tongue I had to blow it out and

1016

then uh it was still burning in the

1017
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,480
one-hitter so I just shot off this

1018

smoking that I had to stomp it out I

1021
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,859

um they can't all be winners but

1023
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:12,598
everything I tried was phenomenal I can

1024
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:14,099
admit that I did not try them all I

1025
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:16,740
could not try them all I think I tried

1026
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:19,080
about 40 out of the 50. I definitely

1027
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:20,939
knew I said number 30 I was like this

1028
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:22,739
one stands out to me so tray K's herb

1029

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,560
that event

1032
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:31,139
um we're talking about cup moments uh

1033
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,878
man the whole thing I feel like this

1034
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,300
year

1035
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,980
um I was able to connect better with the

1036
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,300
people that sounds so weird to say it

1037
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,059
that way but the people that come to the

1038
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:43,919
booth uh the irie Army the customers the

1039
00:34:42,059 --> 00:34:46,079
fans the new people the old people the

1040
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:47,579
Friends The Returning friends uh the

1041
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,739
internet strangers that I just met in

1042
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:53,279
person I feel like at this cup I was

1043
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:54,779
much uh more present more able to

1044
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,240
um of course I was smoking and there was

1045
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,740
some of that barrier sometimes but

1046
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:00,239
um I feel like I was more able to look

1047
00:34:58,739 --> 00:35:01,919
people in the eye and meet them and make

1048
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,618
an actual connection with people at this

1049
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,619
event it was really cool the the length

1050
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:09,900
of the event and the the size of the

1051
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:11,338
event population wise worked really well

1052
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:13,380
together

1053
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:17,039
um a nice long VIP party Friday night

1054
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:20,280
and then a good cup Saturday was just

1055
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:23,460
enough time for 350 people to group up

1056
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:26,519
how they wanted to and really socialize

1057
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,559
not just yeah hi how are you awesome

1058
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:32,099

1059
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:34,679
that at big events but this event was

1060
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:36,960

00:35:38,338 --> 00:35:42,719
there was plenty of time to chill and

1064
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,640
chat and I don't think I felt like we

1065
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,980
had to rush anybody no that's three yeah

1066

00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,420
pizza smell was going right over us that

1081
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:20,098

with themselves they still had a good

1092
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:46,380
time they entered and they were proud

1093
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:47,819
about it there was one dude who stopped

1094
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:51,180
by a couple of times you actually gave

1095
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,039

mood like hustling to get ready carrying

1179

a heavy box with one hand smoking a

1180

us offering to help us carry [ __ ] from

1187
00:39:57,539 --> 00:40:00,599
the very beginning of the event it was

1188
00:39:59,219 --> 00:40:02,299
high the guy that won the Cannabis Cup

1189
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:04,680
right

1190
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:06,480
the winner of the cup was like hey can I

1191
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:07,739
help you carry stuff in before the event

1192
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,240

1193
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,858
winner the champion the guy had the best

1194
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:12,659
weed was trying to help us carry stuff

1195
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:14,219

1196
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:15,480
carry [ __ ] if they saw stuff like give

1197
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:18,059
me part of that give me part of that it

1198
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,219
was kind of cool so uh it felt like a

1199
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:23,119
fish festival or some sort of like I got

1200
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:25,799
those like you cannabis festivals

1201
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:27,240
yeah we do bro yeah we do it was such a

1202
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,640
great time

1203
00:40:27,239 --> 00:40:30,838
um it was one of the one of the things I

1204
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:33,420
loved is

1205
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:35,940
when we started setting up we realized

1206
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:37,940
that our organization and our prep might

1207
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:40,019
have not been as organization is

1208
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:42,900
organized and prepped as we might have

1209
00:40:40,019 --> 00:40:46,440
liked so we had to you know rearrange

1210
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:48,780
and reorganize and part of that

1211
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,480
if I was working a different kind of

1212
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:55,260
event would have meant a security risk

1213
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,079
oh yeah just having that much Pro or

1214
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:01,920
merchandise on a table at one time

1215
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:04,260
within Arm's Reach of 350 people

1216
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,380
um who are some degree of intoxicated

1217
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,260
and it was not a problem the whole day

1218
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:12,599
yeah seeds of bins just opened and I

1219
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:13,680
never saw a hand go near them never yeah

1220
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,838
people aren't going to do that there so

1221
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,179
that that is Magic it was just everybody

1222
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:20,219
took care literally I didn't see anybody

1223
00:41:18,179 --> 00:41:21,960
having a bad time like nobody was bummed

1224
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:24,659
they had to wait in the line nobody was

1225
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:26,460
bummed that you know people were rude or

1226
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:28,980
whatever everybody was helpful everybody

1227
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,900
was cheery everybody was jamming and

1228
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:33,420
having a good time I mean there was a

1229
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:34,500
little you know too much Supply in the

1230
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:36,000
mix but you know I was just gonna

1231
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,800
actually always is I was gonna

1232
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,480
compliment them that the music wasn't so

1233
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:41,339
loud we couldn't talk there was Sublime

1234
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,679
but it sounded like Sublime that was

1235
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:45,299
over there and that was perfect you had

1236
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:47,759
to sing along in your head a little bit

1237
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,460
with the music rather then shout over it

1238
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,740
which is very nice if you guys ever

1239
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,179
throw an event as a vendor as a host as

1240
00:41:52,739 --> 00:41:55,439
a sponsor whatever

1241
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,819
um and you're responsible for the music

1242
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,800
remember I'm trying to sell [ __ ] over

1243
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,359
there and I paid to come have a booth

1244
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,160
don't make me yell over the music like

1245
00:42:00,358 --> 00:42:03,960
we're already talking all day yeah we

1246
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:05,279
want to get down but also the customers

1247
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,420

1248
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,980
like to hear us we're all paying money

1249
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,760
let's uh let's turn it down just a

1250
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:10,800
little bit I don't want to sound like an

1251
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:13,079
old guy but I also don't want to sound

1252
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,060
like an old guy all right Mike I

1253
