thanks again for letting me have a good

292
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,240
time uh I did mention I got a little

293
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,600
cold I guess I got some sniffles bro I

294
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,039
just sniffled right into the mic to do

295
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,839
that that was rude but uh it was -6 Dees

296
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,879
one night and you got to go from the car

297
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,120
into the concert venue in Theus 16 and

298
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,039
then in the concert I just I took off

299
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:57,679
all my jackets and I had my t-shirt and

300
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,120
my pants on and my shoes and my hat and

301
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:02,399
I was sweating my ass off

302
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,278
so you got to try to negotiate the cold

303
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,679
and then the super hot heat and then

304
00:10:04,278 --> 00:10:08,120
back to the car again and then let the

305
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,958
car warm up and get to the hotel so uh I

306
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,120
think all the climate changes uh I may

307
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:14,319
have got a little cold here and also I

308
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,639
smoked like 45 joints over three nights

309
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,040
at these concerts I rolled a bunch of

310
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,958
joints I smok like 45 joints with

311
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,159
strangers and I'm wondering if maybe I

312
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:24,278
got a little bit of String Cheese

313
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:26,078

317
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,958

uh and if my girlfriend didn't have to

332

367
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,399
beginning of the show that I said

368
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,039
welcome to the igro culture podcast I'm

369
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:16,240
doing my best to roll out the new

370
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:18,399
name um I'm doing it slowly so I don't

371
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,879
lose people so if it looks confusing for

372
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,799
a little bit I'm sure you guys are aware

373
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:23,198
what's going on if you're listening but

374
00:12:21,799 --> 00:12:24,879
we are in the process of changing the

375
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,039
name from I gr culture to grow from your

376
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:30,439
heart bear with me um I still could use

377
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:31,759
more logos uh somebody sent me one logo

378
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,240
but I I asked for a couple of

379
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:35,078
adjustments it just it didn't fit the

380
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,720
way I needed it to fit to make uh

381
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:38,799
squares out of it I need a square logo

382
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,680
so if you can send me a 1400

383
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:45,719
x400 uh pixel image with the grow from

384
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,559
your heart podcast I would love that um

385
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,800
I also need a song if you guys want to

386
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,198
if anybody out there is an artist and

387
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,759
you want to make a grow from your heart

388
00:12:50,198 --> 00:12:55,319
podcast theme song I will compensate you

389
00:12:52,759 --> 00:12:57,198
in the future that' be really cool so

390
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,278
I'm starting to change the title in

391
00:12:57,198 --> 00:13:00,879
social media places also I'm waiting on

392
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,519
a couple artists to submit some logos

393
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,198
that I've commissioned and once I've got

394
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,879
all the artwork I can fully roll out the

395
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:08,719
new title and start switching everything

396
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:10,159
over um I'm hoping by episode 50 that we

397
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,560
can actually just call this the grow

398
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,078
from your heart podcast and everything

399
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:16,359
will be switched right

400
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:18,078
over let's see also here's something

401
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,680
that I've been considering this is just

402
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:24,159
a personal thing for myself that I've

403
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:26,759
considering doing I may cancel the

404
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:30,519
Instagram for the podcast there is an

405
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:33,679
igro culture podcast inag stagram that I

406
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:36,440
haven't posted anything to in several

407
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,879
weeks honestly it kind of it's just a

408
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,639
distraction there's not a lot it's a

409
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:41,278
podcast and some of my guests don't want

410
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,079
me to take their picture Jesse doesn't

411
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,639
want his face on um Adam is cool with it

412
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:48,000
Mike is cool with it but some people do

413
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:50,600
not want to be seen and I feel like I'm

414
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,639
just going to overdo my Instagram

415
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:54,278
Presence by having the IR genetics and

416
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,759
the IG gr culture or the grow from your

417
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:59,480
heart podcast so I'm thinking about just

418
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,720
combining the two into one entity and

419
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,560
maybe I'll start posting a few things

420
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,360
from the grow from your heart podcast on

421
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:08,159
the I genetics Instagram so if you're

422
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,680
not already following iy genetics on

423
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:12,919
Instagram go there and follow that

424
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:15,159
because I'm really considering taking

425
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,559
down the Instagram for the podcast it's

426
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,198
just a distraction it's one more thing

427
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,919
to worry about um I'm also considering

428
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:24,039
and I'm not committing to this but it's

429
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,799
highly likely somebody had a talk with

430
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:27,679
me and it got me thinking but I'm

431
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,319
considering canceling my YouTube account

432
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:31,599
for the Agro culture grow from your

433
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,320
heart podcast you'd say why would you do

434
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,759
that people are listening they are but

435
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,079
not as many and I'm not I appreciate the

436
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,800
people that are listening but it takes

437
00:14:39,078 --> 00:14:44,198
me a long time uh to get those episodes

438
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,639
up there I feel if I cancel that I feel

439
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:46,919
I can focus more on the show and if I

440
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:49,079
didn't have to create as many different

441
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,479
types of media I could make better

442
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:52,719
content uh just for the audio podcast

443
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,399
I'd rather spend the time creating

444
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,360
content instead of editing video and

445
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,639
setting up a camera and lighting uh and

446
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,079
editing the video again and then

447
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,720
rendering the video for YouTube it it

448
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:04,399
takes a few it's just a few more steps

449
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
but all of those steps matter I could

450
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,759
spend that much time preparing for this

451
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,320
show and making the show that much

452
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,278
better having that many more details

453
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,040
being that much more prepared getting

454
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:18,439
that much better of a guest on so the

455
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,639
Instagram and the YouTube may go away

456
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,160
and that's just personal things I'm

457
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:23,519
trying to free up more time to take what

458
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:25,600
I'm really passionate about to the next

459
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,639
level I don't want to drag my feet on

460
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,480
things that are not fulfilling me

461
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,720
honestly so May eliminate those and I do

462
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,680
appreciate the guys that watch me on

463
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:36,800
YouTube I've only gotten like 17 or 18

464
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:38,278
maybe 20 videos up on YouTube because

465
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,559
like I said it takes me an hour to make

466
00:15:38,278 --> 00:15:42,240
each one and I feel like I could I'm

467
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:44,679
repeating myself I could just spend that

468
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,360
time doing stuff so I may take them down

469
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,919
I don't I don't want to abandon people

470
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,519
but if you are watching on YouTube you

471
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,559
should be able to find it on the igro

472
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,519
culture or the iy genetics website every

473
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,838
podcast is there and if you've got a

474
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:59,480
browser it works the same and there's

475
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,720
not you're not missing anything visually

476
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,800
really so those are mostly distractions

477
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,759
I feel like I'm going to stop

478
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:08,559
contributing to those just so that I can

479
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:09,600
improve the audio part of the show so

480
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:11,599
feel like I've been talking about that

481
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,440
for a long time I need to move on let's

482
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,600
see I appreciate all the emails I've

483
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
gotten holy crap you guys uh we're going

484
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,480
to continue to use the AGR culture

485

Agro culture at hotman mail.com email

491
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,958
address I did change the Twitter it's

492

and I'm scrolling through the computer

500
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:52,559
and looking at a piece of paper trying

501
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:55,600

516
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,279
culture but pretty soon it's going to be

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,798
up on all of the uh stuff I had to

521
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,600
remind you of and talk about so now I

522
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,480
think it's time to uh read a couple of

523
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:40,439
news articles that I picked out for the

524
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,400
day uh this one says Colorado seeks

525
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Federal okay for state colleges to grow

526
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,320
pot a lot of people from out of state

527
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,679
are going what but it'll make sense this

528
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,399
article is from The Denver Post it's

529
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:54,280
written by John inold it says Colorado

530
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,038
has made an unusual plea to Federal

531
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:58,399
authorities let our colleges grow pot in

532
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,359
a letter sent last month the state

533
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,080
attorney General's office asks federal

534
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:04,158
health and education officials for

535
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,158
permission on Colorado's colleges and

536
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,039
universities to obtain marijuana from

537
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:11,559
non-federal government resources for

538
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:13,119
research purposes uh the letter isn't

539
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:15,960
more specific on how the state's higher

540
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,959
education institutions might score weed

541
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:21,159
but it was sent pursuant to a law passed

542
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:23,400
in 2014 requiring State officials to ask

543
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:25,440
that Colorado colleges and universities

544
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,960
be allowed to cultivate marijuana and

545
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,279
its component

546
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,079
parts current research is riddled with

547
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,798
bias or insufficiencies and often

548
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:34,798
conflict with and often conflict with

549
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:37,119
one another reads the letter written by

550
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,918
Deputy Attorney General David Blake it

551
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,158
is critical that we be allowed to fill

552
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,640
the void of scientific research and this

553
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,480
may only be done with your assistance

554
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,759
and cooperation either request is lot

555
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,839
not a long shot while marijuana is with

556
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,879
qualifications legal in Colorado it

557
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,480
remains illegal under federal law and

558
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,799
getting permission to conduct research

559
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,079
on cannabis requires clearing a set of

560
00:18:55,798 --> 00:19:00,000
high hurdles approval from multiple

561
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,759
federal agents and strict requirements

562
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,038
on how marijuana must be handled and

563
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,599
stored researchers that work without the

564
00:19:04,038 --> 00:19:07,879
federal government's blessing risk

565
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:11,000
losing crucial Federal funding for their

566
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:13,520
institutions not to mention possible

567
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,759
imprisonment an inter an international

568
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,519
treaty that the United States signed in

569
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,359
signed in signed on to sorry I'm

570
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,720
stumbling I'm high uh signed on to

571
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,479
requires the federal government to

572
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,038
designate only one place in the country

573
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,000
that can legally grow marijuana for

574
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:29,440
research since 1968 that place has been

575
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,880
the University of Mississippi's National

576
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,159
care for Natural Products Research which

577
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,880
cultivates cannabis on a 12 acre plot

578
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:39,080
and sends it to approved researchers

579
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,320
guys that uh 12 acre plot is rumored to

580
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:43,558
be where the G13 came from many years

581
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:44,798
ago out of University of Mississippi so

582
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,480
if you know anything about that send me

583
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:49,480
some info I'd like to know about it all

584
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,120
right the article goes on to say

585
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,400
coincidentally the

586
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,199
national the National Institute on drug

587
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,759
abuse recently put the government's Pot

588
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,960
Farm contract up for rebid applicants

589
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:02,839
need to have 12 Acres of secured and

590
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,038
video monitored outdoor space and 1,000

591
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:07,439
ft of indoor space to grow marijuana to

592
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,000
be able to make marijuana extractions

593
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,558
test for potency and prepare preferably

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,558
by hand rolling a small batch of

595
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:16,119
marijuana cigarettes according to the

596
00:20:13,558 --> 00:20:18,440
official solicitation the contract's

597
00:20:16,119 --> 00:20:20,599
winner is expected to be announced uh in

598
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,519
the next couple of months a spokeswoman

599
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,119
for the National Institute of drug abuse

600
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:26,000
would not say how many institutions

601
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:28,798
applied for the contract or where they

602
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,759
are were sorry

603
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,759
spokesman for the University of Colorado

604
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:34,960
and Colorado State University said their

605
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:37,440
schools did not apply The Drug

606
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,319
Enforcement Administration in 2014

607
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,038
massively increased the amount of pot

608
00:20:39,319 --> 00:20:46,038
the government's official supplier can

609
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:47,919
grow from 21 kilos to 650 kilos the

610
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:49,558
increase was the result of a boom in

611
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,720
marijuana research interest and the

612
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,558
University of Mississippi has pledged to

613
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:56,159
grow new strains of marijuana to give

614
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:57,798
research more options for their studies

615
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,480
as a long time ago there was a video out

616
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,918
a movie I cannot recall the name of the

617
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:03,279
movie it may it was something like the

618
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:06,159
union it may have been in the Union uh

619
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,000
it may have been um how the how weed won

620
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,880
the West maybe I can't remember the name

621
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,278
of which movie it was but they actually

622
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,600
showed us inside of this facility in

623
00:21:12,278 --> 00:21:17,679
Mississippi where they grow this

624
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:19,839
cannabis and it was terrible um they

625
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,880
weren't growing high-grade cannabis I

626
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,720
[ __ ] about the weed at the dispensaries

627
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,559
and I would rather smoke the weed at the

628
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,360
dispensaries than the [ __ ] that I

629
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:31,000
saw being grown at University of

630
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:32,038
Mississippi that's stuff was terrible so

631
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,960
it's not really cool that they're doing

632
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:35,599
the research with that I hope they get I

633
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,278
hope since then they've gotten a real

634
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,639
grower and they've gotten some genetics

635
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:41,480
and they've learned a few things is what

636
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,840
I saw was [ __ ] we'll continue with the

637
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,120
article it says still the Colorado

638
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:45,798
attorney general's letter says the

639
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:47,839
federal government falls short of being

640
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,200
able to supply researchers with the

641
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,038
kinds of products available in

642
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,360
Colorado's commercial commercial

643
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:56,679
marijuana Market State Health officials

644
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,879
have just approved up to $8.4 million in

645
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:00,798
Grants for marijuana studies some of

646
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,720
which will examine Colorado specific

647
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,400
products but the Attorney General's

648
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,440
office says more needs to be done we

649
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,278
need to support or we need the support

650
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,558
of our federal Partners to overcome the

651
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:13,599
inertia that continues to complicate

652
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:16,240
state state efforts in this area the

653
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,839
letter States so it seems like they

654
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,720
caught on uh they know that we've got

655
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:23,038
the Dank here in Colorado they need they

656
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,919
know that they need toest excuse me they

657
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,000
know they need to examine Colorado

658
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:28,240
specific products so maybe they are

659
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,720
catching on maybe they know that that

660
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,159
stuff that they're growing out there at

661
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,798
that University as a bunch of mids uh

662
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
speaking of mids shout out to my buddy

663
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:37,798
Vigor lover I hope you're doing well bro

664
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
so what this says this article I want to

665
00:22:37,798 --> 00:22:43,200
talk about this a minute we are actually

666
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:45,679
asking the federal government to let the

667
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,159
state of the state colleges or higher

668
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,600
educational centers in Colorado to grow

669
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:57,278
cannabis they want to grow pot uh that

670
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:59,798
means there will be courses or a class

671
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:01,759
that is accredited to a College where

672
00:22:59,798 --> 00:23:04,158
somebody is growing weed it's probably

673
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:06,558
going to be a chemistry class or a

674
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,960
biology class it probably won't be a

675
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:09,558
horiculture class because they're not

676
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:13,200
worried about growing it they're more

677
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:14,240
worried about the effects and Science

678
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,200
and they know how to grow it that's

679
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,640
Horticulture that's already done these

680
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,558
guys are going to probably have some

681
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,400
students doing making extracts testing

682
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:23,960
the

683
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,000
extracts uh I'm not even sure what

684
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,519
they're going to do but I'm impressed

685
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,079
and I'm excited I hope this works

686
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,119
because I would love to see cannabis

687
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:33,359
grown in a university and tested here in

688
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,639
Colorado where we're not scared and

689
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:38,719
trying to lie about all of the results

690
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,480
and to see possibly some of my friends

691
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,880
that are college students able to study

692
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,519
cannabis in this way in a college and

693
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,559
actually get college credit and build a

694
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:49,759
future for themselves I really like this

695
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:53,038
I really love that cannabis has kind of

696
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,839
opened doors and gone from us hiding to

697
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:57,119
letting us kind of make a living for

698
00:23:54,839 --> 00:24:00,199
ourselves this demographic this age

699
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,879
group of 25 to 40-year-old males and

700
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,720
there are females in there too but I'm

701
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,000
honestly the majority is males we were

702
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,278
struggling we were broke and now the 25

703
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,359
to 40y Old demographic has something to

704
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,798
do with ourselves we can grow great

705
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,639
cannabis and get in the industry it's

706
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,879

attention it says Hey cannabis why would

740
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,839
someone name a strain of weed after a

741
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:29,079
bioweapon that killed thousands of

742
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:31,000
people uh and they signed the letter put

743
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:33,240
off pot

744
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,480
so this guy is asking why would somebody

745
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,720
name a strain a weed after a bioweapon

746
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,919
that killed thousands of people and the

747
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,880
Cannabis replies you must be talking

748
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:42,600
about agent orange huh I hear your

749
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,840
concern strain names can mean one thing

750
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,398
to a potential customer and something

751
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:48,359
else to a plant breeder naming the

752
00:25:46,398 --> 00:25:50,879
strain while agent orange is not a

753
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:52,918
peaceful happy or euphoric name if you

754
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,840
view it in historical context there is

755
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:58,640
the other view that the name suggests an

756
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,759
orange scent and the potency is the bomb

757
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,720
the article says I chatted with Adam

758
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:04,240
Dunn host of the Adam Dunn show shout

759
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,759
out to the Adam dun show what's up Mitch

760
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,558
what's up Adam what's up everybody on

761
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,319
the show crunchy bike hope you guys are

762
00:26:07,558 --> 00:26:11,200
all doing well uh but Adam is the

763
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,200
founder of the Amsterdam based Seed

764
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,880
Company th seeds and he says having

765
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,679
owned a seed company myself for 21 years

766
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,720
I can attest that many cannabis seed

767
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,759
companies are run by people who have a

768
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,480
bit more of a juvenile attitude

769
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,240
especially when it comes to name to the

770
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:28,519
names game dun says names like agent

771
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,919
orange AK-47

772
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,000
crack and wheelchair weed though quite

773
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:35,278
distasteful conjure up images of

774
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,640
something really strong and devastating

775
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:38,200
I doubt the people who named agent

776
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,640
orange really considered this was a

777
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,519
bioweapon that killed thousands of

778
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:45,200
people and destroyed lives of countless

779
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,119
more often strain names are creative uh

780
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,880
often strains are creative combinations

781
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,759
of the names that make up the genetic

782
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,278
lineage or other plant attributes Adam

783
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,679
dun says having been there at the naming

784
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,919
of AK-47 and my own MK Ultra I am guilty

785
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:01,640
of joining the hype dun says

786
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:04,679
I was dead wrong back in 1993 when I

787
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:08,200
said AK-47 was a terrible name it was

788
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:09,919
named for flowering on 47 days and AK-47

789
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,558
went on to become one of the most famous

790
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,759
strains in history uh with the start of

791
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,798
the legal adult use Market this year the

792
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:18,919
reactions of consumers to strain names

793
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,038
is a recent development in marijuana

794
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:24,200
marketing dun points out dun points out

795
00:27:22,038 --> 00:27:26,000
that the Cannabis industry is very young

796
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,240
and will go through many

797
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,720
changes so uh I am guilty of this this

798
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:33,679
is why it got me attention I've got a

799
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,960
stram called Bounty Killer and I had a

800
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,360
friend named Nancy tell me that she

801
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,840
didn't really like the name and she was

802
00:27:36,359 --> 00:27:40,158
reluctant to grow it because it was

803
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,599
called Bounty Killer um I called it

804
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,080
Bounty Killer honestly it's named after

805
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:47,719
one of my favorite reae artists is named

806
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,038
Bounty Killer uh he I like the way he

807
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,880
does things and I wanted to kind of

808
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,079
honor him I've got the ceton which is

809
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,919
also named after a reggae artist and

810
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,960
I've got the kangi Kush which is also

811
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,840
named after a reggae artist and the

812
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,440
Night Nurse is named after a ree song so

813
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:04,480
the reason I called Bounty Killer Bounty

814
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:06,600
Killer after the ree artist is cuz it

815
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,159
grows killer weed it is killer it'll

816
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:11,278
kick your ass and it grows huge colas

817
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:13,278
and huge harvests so that's the Bounty

818
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,798
there and it's the Bounty Killer so if

819
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,240
you don't know about reg it sounds like

820
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:19,240
you're reaping the Bounty you're killing

821
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,599
that huge Harvest or if you know ree you

822
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,159
know that it's the Bounty Killer and

823
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:24,599
it's kind of aggressive and kind of loud

824
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,519
and it's got a groovy beat to it and

825
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:28,398
that's why I call it the Bounty Killer

826
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:30,120
uh I want to talk about why I Nam Ste

827
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,119
things the way I name them and why uh

828
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:34,678
strains I've created have the names they

829
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:37,759
have uh I'm A Grateful Dead fan I'm a

830
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:39,038
dead head uh I'm kind of a into like the

831
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:40,679
whole spiritual side of life I'm

832
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,440
definitely a Rastafarian that's why my

833
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:46,360
company is called iy genetics uh I try

834
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,640
to honor the parents uh the parent

835
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:50,079
plants that I'm using when I create a

836
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,919
new strain but sometimes that just gets

837
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:56,079
redundant and you can't be creative so I

838
00:28:52,919 --> 00:28:59,159
like to draw from rosta culture Grateful

839
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:00,359
Dead culture and like positive loving

840
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,200
hippie culture that's why I've got a

841
00:29:00,359 --> 00:29:04,959
string called Heart of Gold uh it's the

842
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,120
Golden Goat cross to the Grateful Dog it

843
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:09,360
almost got called horn dog but that

844
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:11,678
didn't sound as good for the vibe I'm

845
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,439
trying to promote Heart of Gold when you

846
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,519
smoke that weed and you meditate your

847
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,600
heart is calm your heart is filled with

848
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,759
love what's better than a heart of gold

849
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,319
right you got a big heart of gold that's

850
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:22,879
just pumping love and positive energy

851
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:26,319
and it's got Golden Goat in it so it's

852
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,440
Heart of Gold uh lemon Jeffrey is Golden

853
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:32,960
Goat crossed to The Lemon Skunk uh so

854
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:35,399
there's lemon obviously the lemon right

855
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,000
and my name is Jeff and I wanted

856
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:39,798
something like uh you got aran's Hayes

857
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,440
and there's Neville's Hayes why not have

858
00:29:39,798 --> 00:29:43,200
a lemon Jeffrey that's named after me

859
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,679
the guy that made it that was kind of my

860
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,880
little stingy move on the Cannabis World

861
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,159
there um these guys are talking about

862
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,640
agent orange I know who made agent

863
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:52,480
orange that was subcool it's orange

864
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,880
velvet it's an orange velvet to Jack the

865
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,278
Ripper cross and I think agent orange

866
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,360
was a perfect name and then I just said

867
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:00,240
another name Jack the Ripper uh it's

868
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:02,119
Jack herrer cross to other stuff

869
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,278
basically and subcool didn't want to use

870
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:06,199
the name Jack herrer so it's Jack the

871
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:09,119
Ripper I just that's how these names

872
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,278
come up uh I've got a strain that uh I

873
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,158
wanted to call it the Golden Road it's a

874
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,278
Golden Goat cross and of course that's a

875
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:17,960
Grateful Dead song so my names come from

876
00:30:16,278 --> 00:30:21,278
trying to honor the parent

877
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:22,399
strains and uh so I did get creative I

878
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,359
I'm going to say this name here on the

879
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:28,439
show that it's not out yet but I've this

880
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:31,038
is my cross uh Gorilla Glue number four

881
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,038
crossed to the Grateful Dog is called

882
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,240
grip tape and that's for my skateboard

883
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:35,278
friends you know what grip tape is on

884
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,480
your skateboard it's that [ __ ] that

885
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,759
makes your feet stick to the board a

886
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,278
little bit uh I call it grip tape

887
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:42,919
because it is sticky uh it would be

888
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:44,519
called fly paper but fly paper is

889
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:46,559
already taken and grip tape kind of

890
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,200
honors my skateboard friends so that's

891
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,480
where the names come from We're Not Just

892
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,120
spouting out random [ __ ] some guys

893
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,319
are one of my best sellers lately has

894
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:55,918
actually been a strain that's called

895
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,638
blue healer that was named by our good

896
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:59,880
buddy Spence from the garden of Weeden

897
00:30:57,638 --> 00:31:02,000
it's actually blue dream cross to the

898
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,080
Grateful Dog so grateful dog gives you a

899
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,880
dog name the blue blue healer uh it's

900
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:09,199
named after a dog to keep the Grateful

901
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,559
Dog reference and it's also got the word

902
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,120
healer in there because it's going to

903
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,398
make you feel better so it's just me

904
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,239
trying to be silly and trying to be

905
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:18,239
creative and honor the parents and you

906
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,638
have to name it something you know you

907
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,759
can't just call it X5 maybe you can but

908
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:23,558
that would be boring right that's not

909
00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:25,839
good

910
00:31:23,558 --> 00:31:27,079
marketing all right so that's enough of

911
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,720
that article I just wanted to talk about

912
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:31,278

915
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,639
