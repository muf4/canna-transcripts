rosin today big shout out to a local

90
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,159
grower who would rather remain anonymous

91
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,280
he doesn't want people to know what he's

92
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,439
doing around here

93
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,598
which is kind of smart but my friend

94
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,519
made he grew he got some seeds of a rise

95
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,959
from me he grew the arise he selected a

96
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,439
phenotype that he thought would press

97
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,080
well

98
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:51,759
he squished it into rosin i'm usually

99
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,959
not a big fan of the rosin but you know

100
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,159
what you guys are getting better at

101
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,680
making the rosin

102
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:59,519
and this [ __ ] was hot fire he watched my

103
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,080
face really carefully as i took the dab

104
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,840
because

105
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,440
my face gives me away sometimes i'll try

106
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,319
to say yeah that dab was tasty that dab

107
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:05,840
was really good

108
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:07,439
but then my cheeks and my eyes and my

109
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,039
lips will say man this dab tastes like

110
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,800
[ __ ] [ __ ] and i want to throw up from

111
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,079
hitting it but my buddy was watching me

112
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,439
the whole time he's like bro you seem to

113
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,840
like that and i was like dude this dab

114
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:17,359
tastes

115
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,759
so good uh it did not taste what a rise

116
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,959
was familiar to taste like to me that

117
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,318
sentence came out oddly but it didn't

118
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,759
taste what i'm familiar

119
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:25,518
with the rice tasting like that

120
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,399
concentrate made it taste a little bit

121
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,560
different

122
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,719
and i liked it i actually did enjoy it

123
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,039
the high was completely different than

124
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,400
what i'm used to from any phenotype i've

125
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,239
ever smoked a rise

126
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,680
of arise sorry i'm going fast and i'm

127
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,759
excited but

128
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
i've never gotten that buzz from a rise

129
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,759
i've smoked a lot of arise

130
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,080
smoked several phenotypes i've smoked it

131
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:48,399
in concentrate form flower form

132
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,640
uh i've smoked it in uh now i've smoked

133
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,200
it in rosin and solventless concentrate

134
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,719
form

135
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:54,158
and usually it gets my head moving it

136
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:55,519
makes me kind of thinky it makes me want

137
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,560
to like talk a lot it makes me want to

138
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,560
get on the microphone

139
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,640
when i exhaled that dab i wanted to like

140
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,799
sit down i was like oh

141
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,639
oh and i just kept i said i was melting

142
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,400
i was like bro i'm melting i'm [ __ ]

143
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,839
becoming part of this chair remember

144
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,519
that commercial back in the day

145
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,680
when the girl did drugs and she became

146
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
the chair that was almost working for me

147
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,480
and if you've got that weed that makes

148
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,160
you become the chair i'll take a quarter

149
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,159
i'll take a i'll take an ounce

150
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,759
ah but that's just a joke youtube don't

151
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
get at me um

152
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,120
but where was i that that concentrate

153
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
made me melt it was great it was

154
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
delicious but it was it caught me off

155
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,120
guard because it was a completely the

156
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,959
first thing i noticed was oh that's a

157
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,199
totally different flavor

158
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,399
usually the arise has a cushiness with a

159
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,680
sweetness to it

160
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:38,719
this one had almost a tropical

161
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,160
spiciness i'm gonna say mango habanero

162
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
and that's the closest thing i can get

163
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,000
to i've had mango habanero salsa

164
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,918
and it reminded me of that in a very

165
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,079
good way it had a spicy thing

166
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:49,918
but it had that sweet mango to it and

167
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,758

only products i pitch you are products i

218
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:14,399

219
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,600
hey we'll give you money if you

220
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,399
advertise this that's not the way it

221
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,240
works with me

222
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,159
if i use a product and i like it i say

223
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
buy this i don't get paid for

224
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,960
advertising

225
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,240
but i don't come on here i don't shove a

226
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,159
bunch of products down your throat i

227
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
don't beg you for a bunch of stuff

228
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,360
so let's get more people watching the

229
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,800
show is my point that way more people

230
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
can grow better cannabis

231
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,520
if all of the growers are watching

232
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,960
they're all learning we're all gonna

233
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:36,639
step up our game that means every time

234
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,239
you go somewhere to smoke there will be

235
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,199
better herb there if we're all growing

236
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,038
better herb

237
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,639
also we'll all help to legalize cannabis

238
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,159
we'll all get in the same mindset

239
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,400
we're all gonna legalize this planet

240
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,160
together it'll be a big unification

241
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,079
cannabis is the healing of the nation

242
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,520
the great uniter the unifier

243

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,319
um we've gone almost almost 10 minutes

295
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,719
let's get into the

296
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,560
podcast portion of the podcast let's

297
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,759
talk about growing cannabis here

298
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:30,879
um somebody asked me recently

299
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,080
uh what do i need to grow three plants

300
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,360
how big of a space

301
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,120
do i need to grow three plants

302
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,479
and that's a that's a great question

303
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,679
like if you want to grow three plants

304
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,879
somebody's got the idea hey i want to

305
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,559
grow weed

306
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,000
in colorado we're allowed to grow six

307
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,278
plants you can have three and veg three

308
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
in flower

309
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:48,559
this person doesn't want to design two

310
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,278
spaces so they wanna grow

311
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,559
three plants and when they said how much

312
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,240
space do i need to grow

313
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,838
three plants a lot of things went off in

314
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,120
my head i thought well

315
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:01,040
you could grow three plants in a little

316
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,639
computer tower remember those old school

317
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,120
computer towers they're about a foot

318
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,159
tall

319
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,159
they're about a foot wide they're

320
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:08,559
probably six or eight or about foot tall

321
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,159
foot deep and six or eight inches wide

322
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,919
that's enough space to hang a small

323
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,759
light and you can grow three plants in

324
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,679
there of course your plants are gonna be

325
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:17,919
uh six inches tall they'll probably be

326
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,519
in a solo cup will be their source

327
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,159
but they're gonna be little tiny plants

328
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,200
or you can have gigantic plants that you

329
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,958
have veget

330
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,800
you can start vegging plants today and

331
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,719
not put them outside until next

332
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,799
year if you choose to do so if you have

333
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,759
the proper care and equipment for them

334
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,399
so three plants uh could be anywhere

335
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,519
from

336
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,080
a six inch by six inch space to five

337
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,600
acres

338
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,200
honestly it just depends on what you

339
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,800
wanna do with these plants how you care

340
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,160
for them and what your goal is so let's

341
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,599
talk a little bit about that what do i

342
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,000
need for three plants

343
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,240
how big are the plants what is your goal

344
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
i talk about your goal all the time

345
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,278
if you don't have a goal how do you

346
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,879
succeed you've got to

347
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,320
set yourself up for success that's a

348
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,039
phrase i use a lot i learned it from a

349
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,040
teacher

350
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,079
in seventh grade and i will never forget

351
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,159
it set yourself

352
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,519
up for success shout out to miss dodson

353
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,838
i hope you're still around

354
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,200
um but set yourself up for success you

355
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,040
can [ __ ] try

356
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
you can hope you can hope things come

357
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:11,120
out well you could pray for [ __ ] to go

358
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,159
right or

359
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,919
you can do some work and set yourself up

360
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,519
for success the way to set yourself up

361
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,919
for success is to know

362
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,959
your goal what is the end outcome

363
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:22,799
desired goal

364
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,039
when you look down the road and you say

365
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,399
i want to do this what is the goal there

366
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:27,278
at the end what do you really want to

367
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,480
accomplish then

368
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,799
you're going to say i want to grow some

369
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,639
weed yep that's a logical [ __ ] step

370
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,120
right there but how much wheat how often

371
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,278
weed

372
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,959
what kind of weed like realistically how

373
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,958
much space do you have how much time can

374
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,838
you commit to this what's in the budget

375
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,599
what does my electrical load in my house

376
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,120
or wherever i'm choosing to grow what is

377
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,120
that going to support so

378
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,159
what is your goal your realistic goal

379
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,159
find a goal

380
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,600
is the main objective to starting any

381
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,199
project so

382
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,639
how big your plant's going to be how

383
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,399
much space are you going to use how much

384
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:57,120
herb do you want to produce how often do

385
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,320
you want to be

386
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,078
i've said this before do you want to

387
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,360
produce an ounce for yourself every two

388
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,359
months

389
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,639
or do you want to be pablo escobar and

390
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,480
[ __ ] supply

391
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,078
all of north america you can do either

392
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,399
one you're just gonna have to set goals

393
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,399
and have a strategy to do this so

394
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,240
um how big are your plants do you want

395
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,600
to produce a bunch of product do you

396
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,879
want to produce a little bit of product

397
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,720
that's one of the first things to

398
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:20,480
start thinking about we all want to

399
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,320
produce as much product as we can i want

400
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,920
to pull out seven pounds a week

401
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,600
yeah but you got to be realistic think

402
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:27,519
about electrical limitations think about

403
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,278
space think about time

404
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,879
are you entering a criminal element by

405
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,759
growing so much herb are you ready for

406
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:33,600
this so

407
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,120
uh it's all about your abilities your

408
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,839
goals your skills so

409
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,360
um are you growing auto plant autoflower

410
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,279
plants are you growing regular photo

411
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,720
period plants if you're growing autos

412
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,078
they're going to start to flower when

413
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,839
they become a certain size you'll have

414
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,120
to build a certain size room for the

415
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,200
autoflower plants they're going to

416
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,039
flower out around 18 inches tall

417
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
they'll finish out about two maybe three

418
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,078
feet tall you've got to build a space

419
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,000
that will support that

420
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:57,759
now if you're running auto or not autos

421
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,399
excuse me if you're running photo period

422
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,720
plants

423
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
you control when they flower so you can

424
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,600
veg them to be

425
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,519
two inches tall and then put them into

426
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,278
flour and you can pull off a gram and a

427
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,879
half per plant now people say why would

428
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:12,879
you do that

429
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:16,078
if you're gonna do that you can cram 120

430
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:18,399
rockwool cubes onto a 6x6 tray you could

431
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:21,039
do 64 you could do 120

432
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,679
it's up to you how you want to do it or

433
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,719
you can put

434
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,958
one big plant under one led or

435
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,320
under one hps light or you could put one

436
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,879
plant and trellis it out and put it

437
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,040
under four

438
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,320
1000 watt hbs lights if you really know

439
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:34,799
how to do the work

440
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,639
it's all about your goal your style and

441
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,000
your needs what do you want to do how

442
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,039
much space do you have how much

443
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,320
electricity do you have available so a

444
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,799
lot of it is based on

445
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,079
your veg time and your space you can put

446
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:47,919
like i've said before

447
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,919
you can take seedlings that are just

448
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,039
sprouting from seed in a rock wool cube

449
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:52,479
and flower them out

450
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,919
they'll flower if you start flowering

451
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,959
when they're just two inches tall

452
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:56,559
they'll end up being

453
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:58,719
maybe six inches tall by the time you're

454
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:01,278
done they'll produce a gram or two

455
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,759
if you grow a hundred of them 112 of

456
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:03,360
them

457
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,039
you'll grow somewhere between a quarter

458
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,800
and a half a pound of weed

459
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,559
a quarter pound and a half a pound of

460
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,078
weed from plants this tall

461
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,159
now why don't people just go throwing

462
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,159
out 200 little tiny plants

463
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,919
because plant count is what gets you in

464
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,078
trouble in colorado we're allowed six

465
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,199
plants recreationally six plants

466
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,199
medically so i can have

467
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,399
six plants in any household that is an

468
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,440
adult household if you've got a house

469
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,360
you're an adult

470
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,639
in most cases i would assume if you're

471
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
an adult you can have

472
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,120
six plants in colorado then if you have

473
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,399
a medical marijuana recommendation from

474
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,600
your doctor that's been approved and

475
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,120
certified and registered with the

476
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,920
colorado department of public health and

477
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,759
environment

478
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,639
and the marijuana enforcement division

479
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,919
at that point i don't know if you have

480
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,278
to get the med involved in that one it's

481
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,479
the colorado department of public health

482
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,600
and environment has to have

483
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,120
a colorado registry on file for you

484
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,879
then you can have six more plants in

485
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,278
your home which allows you a maximum of

486
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,360
12

487
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,958
plants beyond that you are now illegal

488
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,320
you are committing a crime you now have

489
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:55,518
an illegal grow

490
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,839
the cops are going to come you're going

491
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,240
to get busted it happens a lot around

492
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,959
here

493
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,720
so plant count is why we change numbers

494
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,759
that's why i don't just go throwing out

495
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,040
64 plants in a 6x6 tray and run them

496
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,319
really quick to see what i've got and

497
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:09,759
keep the keepers that's why i've got to

498
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,639
keep my numbers down i would love to

499
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,559
play with

500
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,639
a bunch of little tiny plants on big

501
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,239
trays under a thousand watt lights would

502
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,278
be the way to do it but

503
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,440
limitations because of legalities

504
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:22,320
so since i'm limited by plant counts i

505
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,760
grow my plants

506
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,440
really big they don't tell me that i

507
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,799
can't have gigantic [ __ ] plants they

508
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,320
say i can have six of them

509
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,240
so i grow six of them the size of

510
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,680
[ __ ] volkswagens why not do it that

511
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,120
way it's still six plants

512
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,479
they're not counting branches they're

513
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,519
counting plants they're counting pots

514
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,039
and root zones

515
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,799
i've got six of them but they just

516
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:41,838
happen to look like [ __ ]

517
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,479
buses driving down the street so um you

518
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,560
can put

519
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
for three plants um honestly you could

520
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,319
grow them in

521
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,799
a you could make a clandestine grow kit

522
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,480
out of like a computer box or a little

523
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,559
like a nightstand that you keep by the

524
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,839
bed you could make that a grow space

525
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:59,039
what you need is a an environment which

526
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,199
you can control

527
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,799
the uh lights you have to have a

528
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,278
controllable dark period where you can

529
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,639
get 100 complete darkness

530
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,480
you need an environment where you can

531
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,799
control the temperature and the humidity

532
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,639
the

533
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,159
vapor pressure deficit is what that's

534
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,320
called the vpd

535
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,159
is very crucial especially in a small

536
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,600
space when you go to water these little

537
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,799
plants they start letting off water

538
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,720
there's water in the pot

539
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:22,479
it can get really humid in these little

540
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,639
spaces so you're going to need

541
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,519
a way to control that vpd and that small

542
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,039
space though

543
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,639
also it's really advantageous because

544
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,480
you can really dump the air out and

545
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,560
replace the air super quickly in a small

546
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,720
space with something like a computer fan

547
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,319
or a four inch inline fan so that's

548
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
really easy to do but it's critical that

549
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,720
it is done

550
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,720
then you need a light up top just

551
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,480
something to keep those plants going

552
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,240
as strong as you can get in there that

553
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,759
doesn't create too much heat

554
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,600
that heat is going to get really high in

555
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,278
a little container so you can build just

556
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,360
a little box out of a dresser

557
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,198
out of a nightstand anything that will

558
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,800
seal up and keep the light out basically

559
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,078
that you can move some air in and out of

560
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,919
and control the environment in there

561
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,000
that is what you really need

562
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,198
uh cleanliness is ideal if you can get a

563
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,799
good clean spot

564
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,319
and then airflow i keep talking about

565
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,359
that airflow

566
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,040
no matter how big or small your grow is

567
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
you have to have airflow people often

568
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,000
overlook the idea of airflow

569
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,439
like i did the lights i did all this

570
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,958
stuff and i'm like cool how are you

571
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,000
going to replace that stagnant air how

572
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,518
are you going to get air moving through

573
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,919
the canopy i'm like i never thought of

574
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,759
that

575
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,439
think about that part you have to move

576
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,079
air around in that grow space so what

577
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,199
you really

578
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:28,159
need for three plants is in an area

579
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:29,599
is an area you can seal from light we

580
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,198
don't need any light interruptions in

581
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,240
the flowering phase we need an area we

582
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,319
can control

583
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,399
the vpd the temperature and the humidity

584
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
is what that boils down to somewhere we

585
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,720
can

586
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
evacuate the air and replace the air

587
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
somewhere we get some airflow in there

588
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
and then something we can put lights in

589
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
and not burn our plants and melt our

590
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,838
environment

591
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,560
if you're going to build a little tiny

592
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,199
grow space please be safe i've seen

593
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,679
people

594
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,359
uh build little dressers and light [ __ ]

595
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:54,399
on fire because they put too much light

596
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,320
inside of there

597
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,440
don't put too much light in your grow

598
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,360
space be careful

599
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,199
and that mylar if it touches the light

600
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,919
eventually that [ __ ] will catch on fire

601
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,599
and burn

602
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,119
so make sure the mylar is stuck to the

603
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,078
wall as well i don't even like mylar i

604
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,438
use panda film

605
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,678
that shouldn't melt if it touches the

606
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,160
light so be very careful with that stuff

607
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,038
but um what you need for three plants is

608
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,519
basically

609
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,240
up to your goal most people probably

610
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,078
have room for a three by three or a 5x5

611
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,519
grow tent in their home

612
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:26,159
i would highly recommend a 3x3 or a 5x5

613
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,558
grow tent with canon led lighting

614
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,919
keith doesn't pay me to say that i've

615
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,279
got canon leds

616
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,880
i've got canon leds and a 3x3

617
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:36,720
gorilla grow tint that is where i keep

618
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,640
my small veg stuff sometimes it's where

619
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,600
i honestly keep my male plants most of

620
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,559
the time

621
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,038
those plants excuse me those plants in

622
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,359
that 3x3 with that one canon led

623
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,359
are extremely happy anybody can get that

624
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:52,079
grow going it's a three by three tent

625
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,918
a canon led i've got a carbon filter

626
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,918
i've got a is it a four or a six inch

627
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,679
blower i've got a small blower in there

628
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,440
sucking the stagnant air out and then

629
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,280
that just ducks out of a window because

630
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,279
oftentimes i put a male plant in there

631
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,599
and i want that carbon filter and that

632
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,519
exhaust going directly out so there's no

633
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,038
pollen contamination the pollen's going

634
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,558
directly away i'm sorry if you grow in

635
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,440
my backyard you're gonna get pollinated

636
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,160
possibly

637
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,960
um let me catch up on my notes and see

638
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
where we are

639
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
here uh it's all about how big of a

640
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,319
plant you want if you veg them for two

641
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,240
weeks they'll be this tall if you veg

642
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:22,960
them for six months they'll be gigantic

643
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,798
plants

644
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,160
so you can build a gigantic enclosure

645
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,079
for three plants or you can have a

646
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,679
little teeny tiny space

647
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,439
for three plants it's all about your

648
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,240
goal your desires what you're trying to

649
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,480
do

650
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
um i was talking about putting 100 or

651
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,720
120 rockwool cubes

652
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,720
under one led then all you have to do is

653
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,360
veg those for like a week or like

654
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,720
10 days or so and they're this tall ish

655
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,439
ish and then you flour them and you

656
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,440
could pull

657
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,840
7 to 12 grams per plant and if you do

658
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,480
100 plants times 7 to 12 grams

659
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,558
you're getting 700 to 1200 grams of herb

660
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,640
at the end right if you do it correctly

661
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,960
that works out pretty well in my opinion

662
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,840
but that many plants is illegal so we go

663
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
bigger plants

664
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,519
trellis them out spread them out

665
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,038
maximize our space um

666
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:06,480
it's all about maximizing the space

667
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:07,519
you've got and having a goal so i don't

668
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,279
know how much space

669
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,038
you need for your three plants what's

670
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,879
your goal i'm gonna start by

671
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,319
recommending that 3x3

672
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,160
uh grow tent with a canon led a carbon

673
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,079
filter and a blower and put a fan

674
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,400
inside of there and that should have you

675
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,240
set up to rock pretty good for a starter

676
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,360
kit maybe go five by five with two or

677
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,359
three cannons

678
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,199
then expand as time goes on add more

679
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,439
tents out of veg tent have a flower

680
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,720
have one in veg one in flower or two in

681
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,000
flower all the time

682
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,679
that's a way to expand on that but um

683
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,038
yeah three plants it's all about your

684
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,960
goal i wish i could give you

685
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,720
a direct uh do this do this but i would

686
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,160
say get that three by three tent put the

687
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,519
cannon led in there

688
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,919
get that set up and learn to grow that

689
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,200
way then expand anything smaller it's

690
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,679
gonna be kind of hard to

691
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,360
uh control the vpd constantly also you

692
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,559
need a hygrometer and a thermometer

693
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,240
something that will tell you

694
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,519
the temperature and humidity in that

695
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,640
space you can look at it all the time

696
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,319
and see what's going on in there make

697
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
adjustments as necessary

698
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,599
so what do i need to grow three plants

699
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,120
you need a sealable environment

700
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,599
you can seal the light you can control

701
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,199
the uh air flow you can control the

702
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,639
vapor pressure deficit you can control

703
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,798
who goes in and out of there

704
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,000
uh secure area somewhere that's clean

705
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,319
somewhere that you can

706
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,240
control the bugs and the predators and

707
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,200
the insects i said that with bugs with

708
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,880
the uh the

709
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,640
little rodents and [ __ ] animal

710
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,320
traffic something you can control all of

711
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
that is mainly what you need a clean

712
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,960
workspace

713
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,159
anything else you can turn it into a

714
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,440
grow environment

715
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,360
uh it's all up to you everything is

716
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,558
adjustable depending on your goals

717
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,199
that's one of the best parts about

718
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,158
growing

719
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,840
there are no real uh you've got to do it

720
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,360
this way kind of rules people

721
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,879
will say you'll see it in groups you

722
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,158
need to top that plant now or you need

723
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,200
to do this now and i always say

724
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
why explain why give me a paragraph of

725
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,240
why that needs to happen

726
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:49,678
you can do it however you want as long

727
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,798
as you are happy with the way the plants

728
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,798
come out in the end

729
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,480
uh you're doing it right you're always

730
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,519
going to find room for improvement

731
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,240
if you get raided or kill the plants or

732
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,599
flood the room

733
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,000
you might have done something wrong but

734
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:02,319
we can recover from most of that all

735
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,440
right

736
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,399
i think i answered that one i think it

737
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:09,200
rambled on for quite a bit um

738
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,000
another note that i wrote was don't let

739
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,880
anybody

740
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,400
else mess up your goal and your strategy

741
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,039
if you want to grow your three plants

742
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,759
your way

743
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,599
you grow your three plants your way some

744
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,158
people just have to learn by doing [ __ ]

745
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:21,839
the way

746
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,440
they do [ __ ] if you did it the wrong way

747
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,599
you're gonna find out if you did it the

748
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,840
right way you're going to find out

749
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,359
then the first time you grow you'll say

750
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,199
i my idea was

751
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:32,879
just not [ __ ] right this was a

752
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,159
half-cooked idea and now i see why

753
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,840
everybody on the internet said that i

754
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,559
was goofy for trying this but guess what

755
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,558
you learned

756
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,240
and you got to see it so don't let

757
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:41,759
anybody mess up your strategy or your

758
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,960
goals or your ideas

759
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:47,200
even me uh i'm an experienced grower

760
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,079
but you might have an idea that i've

761
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,240
never thought of

762
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,319
i learn from everybody i can learn

763
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,919
something from everybody from a grower

764
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,599
who's doing his first day

765
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,440
to a grower who's been there for a

766
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,959
hundred years i can learn something from

767
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,400
everybody i learned that in the music

768
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,000
industry i can learn something from

769
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,400
everybody on a drum kit

770
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,599
same thing goes for the grow room so

771
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,919
don't let me mess up

772
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,639
your plans your ideas and your goals let

773
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,280
my

774
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,759
knowledge and my experience and my info

775
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:13,599
uh

776
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,279
have some effect on your ideas but don't

777
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,038
let me make decisions for you you know

778
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,960
what i mean like use my input as

779
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,400
data and then weigh your options with

780
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,960
the data that you've been given but

781
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
don't

782
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,159
don't you don't have to follow me as

783
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,439
gospel sometimes i don't know

784
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,200
a lot of times i don't know what is

785
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
happening in your grow i don't know the

786
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,960
exact specific environment the

787
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:35,678
situation the thing so uh maybe

788
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,000
maybe i'm wrong and a lot of my ideas

789
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,320
are

790
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,480
expensive and people say to solve that

791
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,639
problem you just gave me a 500

792
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,400
solution and sometimes that's what's

793
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,559
going to fix it our grow rooms

794
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,759
and our plants are they require certain

795
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:49,678
things and if you want to cheap out and

796
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,960
do [ __ ] the cheap way you really can but

797
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,080
you're going to get the cheap

798
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,319
outcome i run my grows like

799
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,279
a business when there's a harvest there

800
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,918
is a profit

801
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,359
obviously and then that profit goes into

802
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,960
the bank because it's ran like a

803
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:03,678
business and then a portion of that

804
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,679
profit

805
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,919
is put back into the business you've got

806
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,600
to buy a new carbon filter you've got to

807
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,480
buy new lights you've got to buy

808
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,399
maybe a new ph pen you definitely need

809
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,159
more nutrients new soil

810
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,679
probably some new pots you got to pay

811
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,120
somebody to help you packaging you got

812
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
to pay somebody if you trim it

813
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,239
they're going to get paid for trimming

814
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,120
it so it all gets invested back into the

815
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,200
business

816
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,439
then as a seed maker i buy seed

817
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,960
packaging uh there's a lot of components

818
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,159
to my seed packaging then there are

819
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,519
shipping components

820
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,840
a lot of that stuff so it all gets

821
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,918
reinvested back into the business so

822
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,678
don't be afraid to invest in your

823
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,120
business you're growing a product that's

824
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,278
going to give you

825
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,399
a reward whether it's medically whether

826
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,400
it's recreationally

827
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,320
whether it's financially there will be a

828
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,159
reward this is a business you've got to

829
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,119
put something into it to get something

830
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,720
out of it or

831
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:52,479
you don't get [ __ ] out of it it will

832
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,640
show you everything you put

833
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,079
into your grow will come back to you if

834
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,600
you put in laziness

835
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,359
your end product your photos on

836
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,759
instagram will show

837
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,359
they will convey laziness if you put

838
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,519
love effort energy

839
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,439
pride passion into your grow your

840
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:09,038
flowers and your photos will show that

841
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,320
even if you're not growing the most

842
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:13,119
amazing product

843
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:15,038
the [ __ ] 32 percent that everybody's

844
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:15,439
wanting to snap pictures of you'll still

845
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,919
feel

846
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,120
still feel pride in that product and

847
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,960
you'll learn how to improve it because

848
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,119
your ego's not in the way you're growing

849
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,880
from your heart not from your wallet not

850
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,558
from knowing about the profit

851
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,400
but put some pride into your garden

852
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,720
reinvest in the garden understand that

853
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,080
you've got to reinvest in this business

854
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,839
and it will keep reinvesting

855
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,558
in you when you smoke that pro you want

856
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,918
it to be not stressful you want it to be

857
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:41,918
enjoyable and something i've noticed is

858
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,200
uh when i worked it i use guitar center

859
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,640
as a reference a lot but this will make

860
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,960
a lot of sense

861
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,880
when i would sell a little kid a shitty

862
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,240
guitar or a shitty drum set

863
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,919
he'd come back in a couple of weeks

864
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,679
looking for something to add to it to

865
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,919
make it fun again because he ran out of

866
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,919
fun because the guitar or the drums

867
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,440
no matter how well you play them and

868
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,000
tune them they're going to sound like

869
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,080
[ __ ] because

870
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,599
they are cheap shitty quality

871
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,079
instruments they're not going to sound

872
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:06,240
good

873
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,759
they were just made to sell to get money

874
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,839
in the bank to make it look like a

875
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,440
guitar to take little kid money

876
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,798
if that little kid would have invested i

877
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,480
know it's his parents i'm not blaming

878
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,158
anybody but this is how it goes

879
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,240
if the parent would have invested in a

880
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,000
high quality instrument in the beginning

881
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,159
they would have gone home and had a

882
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,159
chance to sound good you're never gonna

883
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,760
some some pro musicians are gonna grab

884
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,960
some [ __ ] gear and say watch this bro

885
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,558
cause i can do it i'll make a shitty

886
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,200
drum set sound good but i've got skills

887
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:30,639
now

888
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,400
a beginner drummer is never going to

889
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,000
make a shitty drum set sound like a rock

890
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,880
star drum set you got to get them a

891
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,640
good drum set to sound good i feel the

892
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,559
same way with grow gear if you buy

893
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,480
the cheapest light you can get the

894
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:44,240
cheapest soil you can find

895
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,519
the cheapest genetics you can get you're

896
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,120
not going to have a good grow because

897
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:47,519
you've got a bunch of cheap [ __ ] to work

898
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:49,519
with

899
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:51,200
and it's always going to be a struggle

900
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,798
something is going to be wrong

901
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,319
the plants aren't getting enough light

902
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,079
they're not getting the right spectrum

903
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,599
so they're going to grow wonky then you

904
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:58,960
got shitty soil in there so they don't

905
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,558
even have a chance to develop healthy

906
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,600
roots they're going this soil sucks i

907
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,278
don't know what to do

908
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,879
and then you're you got shady genetics

909
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,159
to begin with and they're never going to

910
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,080
perform that's like buying a shitty

911
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,520
guitar it's never going to sound good

912
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,879
no matter how many [ __ ] pedals you

913
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,319
run it through no matter how much

914
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,919
compression you put on it no matter how

915
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:15,119
many books you read how many youtube

916
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,400
videos you watch

917
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,719
that shitty laguna guitar is always

918
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,720
gonna sound like a shitty laguna guitar

919
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,240
that the [ __ ] neck is gonna bend it's

920
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,038
never going to work right and that's how

921
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,359
it's going to be

922
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,278
if you buy shitty gear for the garden so

923
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,879
invest in yourself invest in your garden

924
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,400
and have a good time in there make it

925
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,760
fun make it enjoyable

926
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,278
and people are saying roster jeff i

927
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:36,240
don't have the money to do that maybe

928
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:37,679
not yet

929
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,519
maybe you can't do that on your first

930
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,360
grow your second grow but

931
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,960
if you're growing now you're saving

932
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,479
money buying from the plug or the

933
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,840
dispensary that's that much money you're

934
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,640
not spending there

935
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,319
um then you've got that extra fundage

936
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,159
you're not spending the money or

937
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:53,918
maybe you are putting it out on the

938
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
black market and making a profit

939
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,720
therefore you should be

940
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,319
reinvesting in the grow because if

941
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,000
you're growing black market it's a

942
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:01,839
competitive market you've got to keep

943
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,079
up you want to be top shelf you want to

944
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,558
be the best grower with the best product

945
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,759
and the most of it readily available so

946
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:08,960
that's when you're going to want to step

947
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:10,400
up your game if you're going black

948
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,200
market you definitely need to get the

949
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,120
best you can

950
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,960
as quick as possible because the guy

951
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,399
down the block is working too and he's

952
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,759
watching my show also and he's going

953
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,320
that [ __ ] i got to get better

954
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,398
than him

955
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:22,079
so you guys are competing step your [ __ ]

956
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:23,918
up put some passion into it

957
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,759
reinvest that cheap [ __ ] is gonna break

958
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,120
you guys in the middle of the grow that

959
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,119
cheap led is gonna start going

960
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,159
and then you're gonna walk in there and

961
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:33,440
it's gonna be flickering and flashing

962
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,000
you're gonna go what is wrong with my

963
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,360
light

964
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,119
and you're gonna call the company and

965
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,839
they're gonna be in china and nobody's

966
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,038
gonna answer

967
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,480
and now you don't have a grow light you

968
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:41,359
gotta buy a new one but guess what if

969
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,798
you're in america

970
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,000
and you bought a good grow light from

971
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:45,278
i'm not saying that all the chinese

972
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,240
companies are bad but if you got a good

973
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:47,839
company that was

974
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,359
locally based in america you call them

975
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,398
up say i got problems i'll either talk

976
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:52,319
you through it or help you get a

977
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:55,119
replacement you're not [ __ ] out of luck

978
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,558
so buy good gear cheap [ __ ] brakes uh i

979
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,079
often see people asking

980
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:02,480
what is the best cheap ph pen i can buy

981
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:04,480
um those two words are never gonna be

982
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,798
together best and cheap there's a reason

983
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,960
why

984
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,079
best is the best and cheap is the cheap

985
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,000
those two things

986
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:11,519
don't ever fall together the best isn't

987
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,960
the cheapest the cheapest isn't the best

988
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:14,558
that's there's

989
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,640
[ __ ] economy and logic there's a

990
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,398
reason why but if you need a ph pen i

991
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:20,159
always recommend getting a blue lab or

992
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,319
something better than a blue lab i like

993
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,720
the blue lab three in one combo meters

994
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,720
get the blue lab stuff because it works

995
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,720
all the other meters that i've tried

996
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,960
they don't hold the calibration long

997
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,798
they die they basically i just say they

998
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,840
suck bro get the blue labs that's what i

999
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:37,038
recommend but

1000
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,319
cheap and best will never be the same

1001
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:39,679

1002

1003
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,000
have to skip some of this stuff

1004
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,120

1005

1007
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:49,759
and then complain that it didn't work as

1008
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,278

1009
