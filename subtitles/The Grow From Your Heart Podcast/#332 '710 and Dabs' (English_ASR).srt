54
00:01:58,269 --> 00:02:04,269
let's get right into this episode and

55
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:07,060
talk about 710 why does 710 represent

56
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:10,659
dabbing well if you turn the number 710

57
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:14,110
upside down it says oil and what better

58
00:02:10,659 --> 00:02:15,818
time to smoke some oil than 710 now you

59
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:17,590
might say who came up with that

60
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:19,389
I know who came up with that it was our

61
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,069
friend task rock from highly educated

62
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:22,449
big shout out to task for being a part

63
00:02:21,068 --> 00:02:24,369
of the oil movement since the beginning

64
00:02:22,449 --> 00:02:25,929
task and a few other folks were on a

65
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:28,060
conference call they were talking about

66
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:31,299
the new movement what the future was and

67
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,699
tasks coined the phrase 7:10 on that

68
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:36,370
call so bigshot it's a task and his crew

69
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:39,188
for coining the phrase 7:10 and starting

70
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:41,650
this oil movement alright so now we know

71
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:44,078
where 7:10 came from and what 7:10 means

72
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,539
let's talk a little bit about dabs and

73
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:49,840
dabbing and actually participating in

74
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:50,949
some 710 activities and I didn't write

75
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,718
this part down because I didn't think

76
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:54,638
about it but it just dawned on me some

77
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:56,829
people may not be real familiar with

78
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,209
dabbing some people mean maybe like

79
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:59,829
what's he talking about dad's and

80
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:02,889
dabbing so let's start from the very

81
00:02:59,829 --> 00:03:05,500
beginning a dab is when you take a small

82
00:03:02,889 --> 00:03:08,319
portion of a cannabis concentrate

83
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,639
usually some oil or some shatter or we

84
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:10,780
moved on to different types of

85
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,849
concentrates we're gonna talk about

86
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:15,009
those later in the episode but you take

87
00:03:12,848 --> 00:03:17,018
a small very small portion of a

88
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:19,688
concentrate just to dab just a little

89
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:22,359
tiny piece like a crumb like a big piece

90
00:03:19,688 --> 00:03:24,459
of kosher salt like a small seed just a

91
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,709
tiny piece just a dab and you put that

92
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,019
little dab on a dabber and then you heat

93
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:30,848
another piece either a banger or a nail

94
00:03:29,019 --> 00:03:32,949
or a bucket we'll talk about that in the

95
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:35,948
future also you heat up your piece of in

96
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:38,049
you push that dab onto the hot piece

97
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:40,209
which is attached to your rig and then

98
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:42,400
you smoke through the rig and you inhale

99
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,620
that cannabis concentrate you just need

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,269
a little tiny bit so that's what a dab

101
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,370
is you smoke it just like you would

102
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:50,319
smoke anything else except you eat the

103
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,090
piece and then push the concentrate into

104
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:53,560
it instead of putting the concentrate

105
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,479
into it and then applying the heat you

106
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,549
just do it backwards so what I'm talking

107
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:58,780
about dabbing or taking a dab that's all

108
00:03:57,549 --> 00:04:00,280
I'm talking about just getting a small

109
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,769
piece of cannabis concentrate and

110
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,750
putting it into a nail and smoking it

111
00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:06,819
through a rig inhale exhale that's

112
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,859
dabbing it's nothing crazy you're not

113
00:04:06,818 --> 00:04:11,018
doing anything fancy you're just smoking

114
00:04:08,859 --> 00:04:13,629
inhale exhale that's all it is so that's

115
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,519
taken a dab now the next obvious

116
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:18,009
question is what happens to me when I

117
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,959
take that dab taking a dab depending on

118
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,489
the size of the dab and the heat of the

119
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,930
nail sometimes the nail is too hot you

120
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:23,978
coffer a little bit from that sometimes

121
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,228
it'll cause you to cough sometimes

122
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:28,930
people just cough from smoking a dab

123
00:04:26,228 --> 00:04:29,800
expect to cough on your first dab don't

124
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,598
be afraid to coffee

125
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,770
to turn red you may make a little snot

126
00:04:31,598 --> 00:04:34,689
you're just gonna cough harder than

127
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:36,279
you've ever coughed before that's okay

128
00:04:34,689 --> 00:04:37,689
we're gonna laugh at you the first time

129
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,459
we've all done it any experienced

130
00:04:37,689 --> 00:04:41,469
stabber knows that you're gonna cough

131
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:43,149
that's gonna be okay expect that on your

132
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,220
first stab now here's the part that you

133
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:47,019
got to be prepared for depending on your

134
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,090
tolerance how often you smoke how

135
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:51,068
familiar you are with being high how

136
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:53,560
much you've eaten today your blood sugar

137
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:55,720
your surroundings how big your dab is

138
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,500
how long you hold it how hard you hit it

139
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:01,569
you may get pretty high off of a DAB if

140
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:03,250
you take them a medium sized ad for your

141
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:06,400
first dab you're gonna go skyrocketing

142
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:08,949
high these concentrates are in the low

143
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,810
70s to high 80s percent I've seen them

144
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:13,360
some of the concentrates I buy are in

145
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,120
the high 90s of THC a concentrations

146
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,310
when you're smoking flowers those are in

147
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:20,649
the high 20s so these are four and five

148
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:22,269
times stronger so that one hit that you

149
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:24,668
take off of a joint that doesn't get you

150
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:26,918
high this is like taking five hits off

151
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:29,079
of a joint at one time it's almost kind

152
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:32,769
of like smoking a whole joint at one

153
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:34,060
time is what it feels like sometimes now

154
00:05:32,769 --> 00:05:36,698
you might say cool I want to smoke a

155
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:39,129
whole joint in one hit you might but

156
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:41,740
it's gonna come on so quickly that you

157
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:43,269
get so high so fast that sometimes it's

158
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:45,250
uncomfortable sometimes it makes people

159
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:47,079
paranoid sometimes people freak out a

160
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,629
little bit you haven't been this high

161
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:52,120
that quickly until you smoked a DAB it

162
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:54,668
takes a lot to get you there a big fat

163
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,680
bong hit won't do it a little medium dab

164
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:59,198
that'll put you in a new place so the

165
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:02,709
first time you take a dab be prepared to

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,090
get super high now the benefit to

167
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:06,098
dabbing is if you're smoking for

168
00:06:04,089 --> 00:06:08,288
medicinal purposes it affects you

169
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:09,908
immediately by the time you're blowing

170
00:06:08,288 --> 00:06:12,218
that dab out some of your medical

171
00:06:09,908 --> 00:06:13,598
ailments will be eased you won't feel

172
00:06:12,218 --> 00:06:15,519
them your pain will be gone your

173
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:15,848
suffering will be limited you will feel

174
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,649
better

175
00:06:15,848 --> 00:06:19,478
almost immediately that's why

176
00:06:17,649 --> 00:06:21,788
concentrates are important that's why

177
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:24,098
it's so popular so the first time you

178
00:06:21,788 --> 00:06:25,870
take a dab be prepared be sitting down

179
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:27,519
be with friend and if you've never

180
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:29,259
smoked flour if you've never smoked

181
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:31,359
cannabis or marijuana whatever you want

182
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:33,819
to call it I highly recommend starting

183
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,038
off by smoking some weed start off like

184
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:37,569
most of us did it's kind of intense just

185
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:39,370
to go straight to dabbing I would assume

186
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,740
I smoked weed for a long time before I

187
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:43,269
smoked to dab so that that is a good

188
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:47,620
segue let's talk about the first

189
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:50,409
I smoked dabs I smoked plenty of crappy

190
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:52,300
Mel hash and weird hash and all kinds of

191
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,430
[ __ ] hash up until this point and

192
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:56,710
then one day a friend of mine we did a

193
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,120
little uh I got some some flowers from

194
00:06:56,709 --> 00:06:59,589
him and he gave me this little parchment

195
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,060
paper folded in half and he was hey bro

196
00:06:59,589 --> 00:07:02,739
when you get home put that on top of a

197
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,480
bowl and just give that a little hit and

198
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,460
I was like oh man I've heard of this

199
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:10,300
this is that BHO butter stuff people

200
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:11,529
were talking about so I get home and I

201
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,790
take a shower and I get ready to go out

202
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:14,019
for the night and I'm like I'm gonna go

203
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:15,280
out to the weekend I'm gonna go do some

204
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,689
[ __ ] and I've got plans with some

205
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,069
friends and I'm like oh I wanna get

206
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:19,870
stoned before I go out for the night

207
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:21,579
and I remember he gave me that little

208
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,750
parchment with that stuff in it I've got

209
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:24,189
a brand new pipe over there on the

210
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,259
drawer so I get it get that pipe out of

211
00:07:24,189 --> 00:07:27,459
the drawer and I put a little bit of bud

212
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,599
in there just enough to make sure that

213
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:29,979
[ __ ] doesn't fall through the hole and I

214
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,390
put that little bit of wax in there was

215
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:33,250
just it was more like shattered but it

216
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:34,689
was kind of it was like melted shatter

217
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,310
since I'd had it for so long it kind of

218
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:38,170
got funky so I just put that it was

219
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,449
shatter I put it on top of the bowl and

220
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:43,300
then I just melted it in with my lighter

221
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:45,789
and I took one fat hit of it and I blew

222
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,639
it out and by the time I was done

223
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,710
blowing that smoke out I was wandering

224
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,870
to the bed with my eyes crossed and half

225
00:07:50,709 --> 00:07:53,379
closed and I just laid facedown in the

226
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,780
bed

227
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:58,300
I wasn't like in a comfortable position

228
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,879
I just got to where I was in the bed

229
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,379
face down and I closed my eyes and I

230
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,180
went to sleep for about an hour and

231
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:07,509
twenty minutes and I woke up and I was

232
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,410
like oh my god I was still high I had to

233
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:10,300
get my [ __ ] together

234
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,830
and then go out and I went places people

235
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,360
were like dude how high are you and I

236
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:15,909
was a cry smoke this [ __ ] it [ __ ] me

237
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,189
up so that wasn't even a dab that was

238
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:22,780
just smoking a little bit of concentrate

239
00:08:18,189 --> 00:08:25,689
off of a bowl my first real dab was from

240
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:28,419
a guy known as Big D mr. Daniel Desai

241
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:31,269
from top-shelf extracts he had a booth

242
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:33,370
at the first cannabis cup in Denver

243
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:36,370
before it was recreational we had a

244
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,310
medical cannabis Cup at the Expo event

245
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:41,379
center and Big D had a booth with

246
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:44,619
Broadway Wellness and he had a decent

247
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:46,450
line and he was offering dabs and I got

248
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,980
in line in the my date got in line in

249
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,960
front of me I let her take a dad and

250
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:52,210
when she took her first dad I had to

251
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,860
catch her she almost fell over she got

252
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,940
wobbly and shaky I had to put my arms

253
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,019
around her and hold her up I was like

254
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,899
you alright she goes that [ __ ] hits

255
00:08:57,019 --> 00:09:01,669
and I was like I can't [ __ ] wait and

256
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,259
I get up next in line in this big dude

257
00:09:01,669 --> 00:09:04,939
with the shaved head he goes are you a

258
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:07,669
heavy smoker or you knew and I go Bryce

259
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:10,339
smoke he goes ok and he gave me a decent

260
00:09:07,669 --> 00:09:13,039
sized dab off of a swingarm skillet on a

261
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:16,430
dub tube we'll talk more about that in

262
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,110
the future that dab [ __ ] me up so bad

263
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:20,448
I don't think I smoked for the rest of

264
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:22,579
the day I was so high and I coughed for

265
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:25,128
10 minutes but it was a great thing I

266
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:27,948
went back later that day and bought that

267
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:30,199
dub tube and one of those skillets so

268
00:09:27,948 --> 00:09:33,438
that I could smoke those dad's all the

269
00:09:30,198 --> 00:09:35,059
time after that so then I came home from

270
00:09:33,438 --> 00:09:37,789
that cannabis cup and I called up all

271
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:39,679
the friends the next day I had Kevin

272
00:09:37,789 --> 00:09:41,929
over I had pops over pops I miss you

273
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,559
brother pops past a few months ago and I

274
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,328
miss you pops

275
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,789
but I had Kevin over I had pops over

276
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:48,458
Mike was over pretty sure Tony was over

277
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:50,990
and I don't remember who else was there

278
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:52,578
but we all gathered at my house and I

279
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,079
showed everybody this new device this

280
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:56,659
new apparatus and like that's [ __ ]

281
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,578
crazy and it was a swing arm skillet so

282
00:09:56,659 --> 00:10:01,759
it looked like you took a bowl that went

283
00:09:58,578 --> 00:10:03,979
on your bong like just a bowl that would

284
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,870
fit into the bong but then you took a

285
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:07,370
longer stem and bent it so that it was

286
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:08,990
upside down so that it looks like you'd

287
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,839
pack an upside-down bowl is what it

288
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:14,959
looked like but then they affixed a

289
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,660
piece of aluminum wire around it that

290
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:20,088
had a titanium disc at the end of it

291
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:22,009
like a coin a coin of titanium and it

292
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,720
would swing to where that titanium coin

293
00:10:22,009 --> 00:10:27,278
would lined up line up underneath the

294
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:29,300
bottom of that the bell of the bowl

295
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,120
basically you would heat up that

296
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:33,948
titanium pad that coin swinging

297
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,399
underneath there then drop your dab on

298
00:10:33,948 --> 00:10:39,409
that titanium pad and that that nail

299
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,688
that skillet would actually fit on to

300
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:43,490
your bong or your rig with a joint like

301
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:44,778
your normal bong Bowl would so then that

302
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,459
would be attached to your pipe or your

303
00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:47,600
bong or your bubble or whatever so they

304
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,849
need to put the dab on you'd heat up the

305
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,319
titanium swing the piece under then it

306
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,240
would be underneath the wide mouth of

307
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,649
that bowl then you would put the dab on

308
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:55,850
there and need smoke and since it was

309
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:57,558
like that bell shape it would suck the

310
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,589
dab smoke right up into there through

311
00:10:57,558 --> 00:11:02,208
your pipe and then into your lungs so I

312
00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:04,189
called the crew over we all gathered in

313
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,568
the basement we all sat around and we

314
00:11:04,188 --> 00:11:07,009
all looked at it like wow that's crazy

315
00:11:05,568 --> 00:11:08,389
and I heated it up and back then you

316
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:09,889
guys we were heating the [ __ ] out of it

317
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:10,289
we thought we had to eat these things so

318
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:12,359
they were

319
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:13,618
and glowing that's not necessary we're

320
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:15,600
gonna talk about dab heat in a minute

321
00:11:13,619 --> 00:11:18,028
also I would heat it up and then we all

322
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,889
took one or two dabs we all caught for

323
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:21,389
like five or ten minutes I think we hung

324
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,220
out for like thirty minutes total after

325
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:24,539
that and then we all said our goodbyes

326
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,160
everybody's like well bruh I'm gonna go

327
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,988
home I got to go do the rest of my day

328
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:30,478
I didn't hear [ __ ] from anybody in that

329
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:32,459
group until about six hours later we all

330
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:34,049
started texting each other like hey bruh

331
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,698
I just woke up from a killer nap what

332
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:37,438
the [ __ ] are you doing like I just woke

333
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:39,688
up that [ __ ] was amazing I just woke up

334
00:11:37,438 --> 00:11:41,278
starving to death man I thought it was

335
00:11:39,688 --> 00:11:42,629
hilarious everybody that was here had to

336
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:44,668
go home and take a little nap I didn't

337
00:11:42,629 --> 00:11:46,438
hear from him for at least four to six

338
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:49,558
hours each person so that was our first

339
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:52,498
dab experience that was how I acquired

340
00:11:49,558 --> 00:11:53,969
my first dab so I took my first dad dabs

341
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:56,009
were available in the dispensaries by

342
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,509
this point I was able to get them from

343
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:00,509
my friend who had introduced it to me

344
00:11:57,509 --> 00:12:02,100
also I worked in a local dispensary so

345
00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:03,479
people were coming in and offering us

346
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,249
product all the time I was picking up

347
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,929
concentrates from them plus I was

348
00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:08,399
driving to Denver and finding

349
00:12:06,928 --> 00:12:10,978
concentrates all over the place at

350
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,089
dispensaries plus everybody around here

351
00:12:10,979 --> 00:12:13,889
was learning how to make their own

352
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:17,339
concentrates so that's a good way to

353
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:21,778
segue into the evolution of the actual

354
00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:24,569
dabs today I would be embarrassed to

355
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:26,879
show you the dabs that we thought were

356
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:30,358
the best hottest fire [ __ ]

357
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,918
four or five years ago then I guess the

358
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:34,079
word would be mortified I would be

359
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:36,389
mortified to share with you dabs that we

360
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,808
thought were good dabs six or seven

361
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:42,239
years ago concentrates have come a long

362
00:12:39,808 --> 00:12:44,428
way of course there was always decent

363
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:47,999
like water hash and bubble hash but I'm

364
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:49,698
talking about BHO waxes shatters things

365
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:52,619
like that so when it first started

366
00:12:49,698 --> 00:12:55,198
people were making crap

367
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:57,509
we called it poop soup it was black it

368
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,548
smelled like hell it wasn't properly

369
00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:01,288
purged it's still you could tell it

370
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:03,808
still had residual butane in it you

371
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:06,379
could tell something was wrong so when

372
00:13:03,808 --> 00:13:08,850
you're making BHO you should use I

373
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:11,129
prefer a glass tube some people will use

374
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,528
stainless steel I've seen people use

375
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:16,678
aircraft aluminum tubes but you need

376
00:13:13,528 --> 00:13:20,038
metal or glass and I've seen people use

377
00:13:16,678 --> 00:13:21,688
PVC tubes now you're running a solvent

378
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:23,818
through this tube

379
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:24,469
I would imagine something from the PVC

380
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:26,779
will end

381
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:30,110
up in your concentrate I've seen people

382
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:31,519
use the shittiest weed I can only

383
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:33,080
imagine what some of these people were

384
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,329
spraying on their weed before they were

385
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,800
turning it into BHO what I'm saying is

386
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:38,750
back in the day you guys the stuff that

387
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,289
we used to get was black and terrible

388
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:44,149
and funky and over time it got a little

389
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:45,769
more clear and a little more clear and

390
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:49,069
people were learning how to make clear

391
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:51,529
clear shatter shatter that was so let me

392
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,970
explain shatter because this was kind of

393
00:13:51,529 --> 00:13:55,459
how it first started with shatter and

394
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,800
wax and butter so first it was first it

395
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,810
was this black solid not solid but like

396
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:02,539
black layer of stuff that looks like

397
00:13:59,809 --> 00:14:04,099
kind of like like black Jolly Ranchers

398
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:06,469
like if you had a dark Jolly Rancher a

399
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,759
really dark purple Jolly Rancher on some

400
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,110
parchment paper that's what it looked

401
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,029
like then it started getting more

402
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:12,740
transparent and turning into an amber

403
00:14:11,029 --> 00:14:15,259
honey color it looks like you had

404
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,970
hardened honey or yellow Jolly Ranchers

405
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,110
on the parchment paper that's kind of

406
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:20,540
what shatter looked like it would be

407
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,789
thin sheets and it would be like amber

408
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:24,469
colored glass and now would start that's

409
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:26,659
started getting better that tasted

410
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,580
better it had a better hi to it it

411
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,049
didn't make your lungs hurt so bad and

412
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,400
then we started learning to smoke it at

413
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,659
a little cooler tip and we're gonna talk

414
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,039
about that in a minute - that also

415
00:14:32,659 --> 00:14:38,539
affected the long burn on the chest burn

416
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:41,299
and I apologize for in the throat a lot

417
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:43,039
I've been taking a lot of dads but it

418
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:46,099
got more clear and it got more shatter

419
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:49,669
II then we started learning how to make

420
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,560
waxes and batters out of that so wax was

421
00:14:49,669 --> 00:14:52,929
you would take a shatter that was almost

422
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,549
done and then you would just whip it

423
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:57,049
you'd put a dremel tool to it or just

424
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:58,490
whipping it with the whisk real hard to

425
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:00,769
put air in it and it would fluff it up

426
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,600
and make it into wax we learned how to

427
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,559
purge things we learned that running the

428
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,450
butane through it

429
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:07,219
put butane in it you had to get all of

430
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:09,470
that butane out we started putting our

431
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,870
product in the vacuum oven to get that

432
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,720
butane out we learned a lot of things so

433
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:17,299
it went from black goop to shatter which

434
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,700
was basically amber colored glass or

435
00:15:17,299 --> 00:15:22,129
Jolly Ranchers and then we learned how

436
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,900
to make waxes out of that then we had

437
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:26,450
butters or batters which were kind of

438
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:28,100
waxes that wouldn't solidify certain

439
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,840
strains have certain Terps in it and

440
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,220
certain things that just they all react

441
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,980
differently so sometimes you'll try to

442
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,210
make you'll try to make a shatter and

443
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,470
you'll end up with what's called snap

444
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,800
and peel which is kind of more like a

445
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,869
Laffy Taffy consistent

446
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:42,149
see which is acceptable it's justwhat

447
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:43,439
that strain is gonna do so we learned

448
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:45,119
how to purge it we learned how to get

449
00:15:43,438 --> 00:15:46,708
all of the butane out because there were

450
00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:48,509
times when you would throw a DAB on a

451
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:50,008
hot nail and it would sizzle up at you

452
00:15:48,509 --> 00:15:51,869
we would assume that that was leftover

453
00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:53,100
solvents I have no evidence of that but

454
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:55,170
that's what we thought was happening

455
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:58,079
then we started purging with the vacuum

456
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:59,669
oven and things got a lot better and a

457
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,409
second ago I said Laffy Taffy but I

458
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:02,548
totally meant a fruit roll-up so excuse

459
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:03,688
me for the head it would snap like a

460
00:16:02,548 --> 00:16:05,009
fruit roll-up you know a fruit roll-up

461
00:16:03,688 --> 00:16:06,389
he could just peel off a little piece it

462
00:16:05,009 --> 00:16:08,220
would snap and have that text that

463
00:16:06,389 --> 00:16:10,230
texture I was more like a fruit roll-up

464
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,449
so forget I sent Laffy Taffy that just

465
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:15,509
dawned in my head so let me explain

466
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:18,028
waxes a little bit waxes and we're kind

467
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:19,619
of basically like smoking it was like

468
00:16:18,028 --> 00:16:20,639
wax you could handle it a little better

469
00:16:19,619 --> 00:16:22,709
you could pick it up

470
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,778
it wasn't shattering so shattered would

471
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:26,068
snap sometimes he tried to get some on

472
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:27,448
the dabber and it would snap and it

473
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:29,099
would break and go flying across the

474
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:31,378
room if he put too much pressure on it

475
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,999
wax was kind of easier to handle because

476
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:36,209
you could pick it up and you could drop

477
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:37,739
it right into the nail so that was a

478
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,928
difference and a lot of people used to

479
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:41,759
say that wax wasn't purged and I'm not

480
00:16:39,928 --> 00:16:44,999
sure why people would say that because

481
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,399
the wax was just as purged if not more

482
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:49,769
purged because it's been through the

483
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,328
same process as the shatter then it was

484
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:53,578
whipped to make it into the wax

485
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:56,248
consistency and when it was whipped it

486
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:58,349
released even more residual hydrocarbons

487
00:16:56,249 --> 00:17:00,480
so the waxes are purged I'm not sure why

488
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,860
people always said that that's what a

489
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,429
wax is it kind of looks like a small

490
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:07,470
piece of a fluffy crayon not as maybe

491
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:09,569
not as dense of a wax as a crayon but

492
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,699
similar it's a just little pieces of

493
00:17:09,568 --> 00:17:13,019
broken crayon maybe and you just need a

494
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,818
little bit of that stuff that would get

495
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,859
you super high back in the day I like

496
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,720
taking big old chunks and pressing a

497
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,338
giant chunk of wax onto the nail and try

498
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,380
to smoke as hard as I can and see when I

499
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:24,178
had to stop that was always fun so we

500
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,829
started with that black goo we got that

501
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,659
nice and clear we learned how to get all

502
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:29,038
the residual solvents out of it we

503
00:17:27,659 --> 00:17:30,990
started learning how to preserve turfs

504
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,879
we started learning how to make nice and

505
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,470
clear high-quality shatter shatter was

506
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,289
the feint for a long time

507
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,490
shattered in wax and sometimes butter if

508
00:17:37,288 --> 00:17:39,960
you could find some good butter that'd

509
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,370
be alright a lot of people were opposed

510
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,409
to it they didn't like the consistency

511
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:46,229
so shatter and waxes were the hot thing

512
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:48,210
for a long time then some of our friends

513
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,048
here in Colorado got the bright idea to

514
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:52,389
cut down some plants

515
00:17:50,048 --> 00:17:55,778
and freeze them and run them fresh

516
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:57,488
frozen through an obidos machine which

517
00:17:55,778 --> 00:17:58,720
is a closed loop system concentrate

518
00:17:57,489 --> 00:18:01,119
making machine if you want if you're

519
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,489
interested in a high quality closed loop

520
00:18:01,118 --> 00:18:05,138
machine look for an obidos from emo tech

521
00:18:03,489 --> 00:18:06,460
shout out to my friends at emo tech hit

522
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:08,558
up hit up giddy up

523
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,509
it'll take good care of you but kind

524
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:13,928
bill and a few other folks kind bill and

525
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:17,288
giddy decided to put fresh frozen plants

526
00:18:13,929 --> 00:18:20,470
through an obidos machine so when you're

527
00:18:17,288 --> 00:18:23,169
making ice wax or water hash it's a good

528
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:24,489
idea to freeze the buds the frozen buds

529
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,799
work better when you're making water

530
00:18:24,489 --> 00:18:28,298
hash they thought instead of drying the

531
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,308
plants let's cut them down and freeze

532
00:18:28,298 --> 00:18:33,128
them and put them through the BHO

533
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:35,470
machine the obidos the butane extraction

534
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:37,988
device so they went that method and what

535
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:41,288
came out they named it live resin

536
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:42,759
because that fresh freezing process they

537
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:44,679
cut down the plants took off the large

538
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:46,628
leaves and then froze them then ran them

539
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:49,749
through the machine that fresh freezing

540
00:18:46,628 --> 00:18:51,730
process preserved all of the fresh plant

541
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:53,769
terpenes that essence of the freshly

542
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,499
harvested plant it brought that out in

543
00:18:53,769 --> 00:19:02,649
the concentrate and it made this bright

544
00:18:56,499 --> 00:19:05,079
gold mushy fluffy texture eeee delicious

545
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:07,418
I don't know it was for a long time

546
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:09,128
everybody was crazy about live resin it

547
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:11,590
was all people would talk about for the

548
00:19:09,128 --> 00:19:13,898
longest time so live resin was made from

549
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:17,798
fresh frozen plants through an obidos

550
00:19:13,898 --> 00:19:19,148
machine ah giddyup and kind bill were

551
00:19:17,798 --> 00:19:20,710
some of the first folks making live

552
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:23,618
resin because it was done in kiddies

553
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,899
machine then our friends in the garden

554
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:27,488
of Weeden of course ran a bunch of live

555
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:29,768
resin and want some cannabis cups with

556
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:32,200
that so the live resin became the thing

557
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:34,839
everybody wanted that live resin live

558
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,090
resin was the way to go that really

559
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:39,488
revolutionized the machines it

560
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:41,079
revolutionized extracting and it put

561
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:43,298
some science into it and I think that

562
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:46,538
inspired people because out of the live

563
00:19:43,298 --> 00:19:49,388
resin people learned how to separate the

564
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:51,128
terpenes and the cannabinoids for a

565
00:19:49,388 --> 00:19:54,398
little while now we've been able to buy

566
00:19:51,128 --> 00:19:57,099
jars of strained specific terpenoids

567
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:59,648
terpenes so I've got a little vial in my

568
00:19:57,099 --> 00:20:02,009
hand this is a one DRAM vial it

569
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:03,909
contained one gram

570
00:20:02,009 --> 00:20:05,589
excuse me for clearing the throat again

571
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,180
I apologize I usually edit those out but

572
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:10,389
we're gonna keep going it contained one

573
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:13,180
gram of lemon Jeffrey Hyder peeing in a

574
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:16,150
full spectrum extract it was about 99%

575
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:19,299
terpenes and less than 1% cannabinoids

576
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:21,670
in this little jar a long time ago when

577
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,279
we were making shatter and live resin I

578
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:26,140
would see these little shimmery pockets

579
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,029
you'd have a sheet so if you ran a

580
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,009
quarter pound of flowers you would end

581
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:31,389
up with about an ounce of concentrates

582
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:34,509
and that's a parchment paper about the

583
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:35,920
size of a notebook piece of paper with a

584
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:38,129
puddle right in the middle of it that

585
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:40,420
would be your ounce of concentrate

586
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,600
somewhere in that puddle I would see a

587
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,190
little extra shimmery spot it looked

588
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:47,529
like you just dropped just a little bit

589
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:48,220
of water in there and I would I would

590
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,079
pay attention

591
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,940
I would dab off the edge of the the edge

592
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,619
of the concentrate this edge over here

593
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,940
of the whole slab we called those a big

594
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:56,289
slab and you've got an ounce that's a

595
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,299
slough I guess an ounce or more would

596
00:20:56,289 --> 00:21:00,220
work as a slab maybe seven grams or more

597
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:01,569
that's a slab of concentrates if you saw

598
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,210
it on the parchment paper saw it laying

599
00:21:01,569 --> 00:21:06,220
out I'd say oh that's a slab so I would

600
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:07,450
go from this edge of the slab and then

601
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,279
in this edge of the slab and I would

602
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:11,140
compare the flavors based on the texture

603
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,819
some would be one edge of the slab may

604
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:15,490
be harder than the other maybe because

605
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:17,889
you've got this big 28 gram piece of

606
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:20,099
concentrate that was made it was liquid

607
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,270
and it solidified again so now it's

608
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:23,589
non-homogeneous I feel that some parts

609
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:25,809
of that are gonna contain different

610
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:27,009
things I think those little wetter

611
00:21:25,809 --> 00:21:28,839
puddles in the middle that I was

612
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:31,359
spotting were the Terps we were already

613
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,769
kind of separating the terpenes from the

614
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,209
cannabinoids because I would reach into

615
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:35,829
the middle where those little water

616
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:38,049
pockets weren't dabbed at and it would

617
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:41,319
taste so good I'm sure that's where the

618
00:21:38,049 --> 00:21:43,659
tert pockets were hidden so now we went

619
00:21:41,319 --> 00:21:46,299
from the goop to the waxes and shatters

620
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,820
to live resin now we learned how to pull

621
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:51,069
out terpenes I was buying Terps and

622
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:52,119
taking chunks of live resin and chunks

623
00:21:51,069 --> 00:21:53,919
of shatter and dumping

624
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,679
dunking it right into the terpenes and

625
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:58,779
then taking a fat dab of that that would

626
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,910
be tremendous that used to make I feel

627
00:21:58,779 --> 00:22:04,059
like the terpenes wouldn't enhance the

628
00:22:00,910 --> 00:22:05,230
high by a good percentage the terpenes

629
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:07,149
are not cheap when you're buying

630
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,490
cannabis derived terpenes so it

631
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:11,110
definitely was an experience at that

632
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:12,220
time they were way more expensive than

633
00:22:11,109 --> 00:22:13,899
than they are now there are about a

634
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,680
third of the price now from when they

635
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,970
first came out

636
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,320
but that's because a lot more people

637
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,120
have learned the tech and they're more

638
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:22,929
available and that's what happens with

639
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:26,559
legalization so along with the Terps

640
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:30,490
came the high cannabinoid full spectrum

641
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,819
extract oh if you listen to the podcast

642
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,230
often you've heard us have a few vague

643
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:39,189
conversations about making full-spectrum

644
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:42,069
extracts it happens when there is a

645
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,110
solution under pressure there is butane

646
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:46,599
let's just kind of skip the process but

647
00:22:44,109 --> 00:22:48,399
anyway there's a jar and the part that

648
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:50,529
floats to the top is mainly the Terps

649
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,880
the crystals that form in the bottom are

650
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:54,490
the high cannabinoid full-spectrum

651
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:56,890
extract if you leave those crystals in

652
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,960
the bottom for a long time undisturbed

653
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,190
with no vibration you don't open it up

654
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,590
you don't cause it any drama

655
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:05,380
it's gonna form a large diamond if

656
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:09,099
you're doing it correctly so now we're

657
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:11,260
getting small chunks that we call HC FSC

658
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:13,359
also known as little crystals and we're

659
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:15,400
getting HT FSE so you can get the hi

660
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,829
Tareen full-spectrum extract in the top

661
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:20,980
liquid part that's all Terps so you can

662
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:22,599
buy one strand of HC FSC crystals and

663
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:25,569
then you can buy a couple of different

664
00:23:22,599 --> 00:23:26,799
varieties of HT FSC and you can pour up

665
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:28,689
and make different varieties and

666
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,849
different flavors just like when you

667
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:32,769
used to mix the Jelly Bellies back in

668
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:34,719
the day so you can buy one gram of one

669
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:36,160
two grams of the other and you can have

670
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,960
different flavors you can mix and match

671
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,759
you can pour them together or you can

672
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,500
just smoke the crystals by themselves

673
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,940
it's always fun I like to take the

674
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,230
crystals and mix them in with some

675
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,940
batter and some turps

676
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,039
that's always a good hi the batter gives

677
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,779
you a good long punch the Terps give it

678
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:52,210
a good flavor and a good head rush and

679
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:55,119
then that HC FS e crystal makes you go

680
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:57,789
super high so so you've got your HC FS e

681
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,619
small crystals then you've got your h TF

682
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:01,990
SC which is the liquid to the high

683
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:04,449
terpene full-spectrum extract you buy a

684
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,579
jar of like a gram of we'll say just a

685
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:08,230
gram of Gorilla Glue eye cannabinoid

686
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:10,509
full-spectrum extract crystals and you

687
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:11,829
get another gram of Jack flash I can

688
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:13,119
have annoyed full-spectrum extract

689
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:14,710
crystals then you go get yourself a

690
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,139
couple of jars of Terps maybe some lemon

691
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:19,180
Jeffrey and then a cheese and then you

692
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,220
can pour a few drops of this one over

693
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:23,230
here and then you can take a dab of the

694
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,360
gorilla glue hi cannabinoid full

695
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,009
spectrum extract crystals with some

696
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,329
lemon Jeffrey Terps on top of it you can

697
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,700
experience that high

698
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:31,808
then you can get your cheese I don't

699
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,130
even remember the strains I said you

700
00:24:31,808 --> 00:24:34,389
guys but you can mix and match that way

701
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,220
you've got a little mix and match and

702
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,929
it's really fun and then you definitely

703
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,350
do notice different highs from different

704
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:45,580
combinations so we got to making our own

705
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:47,558
full spectrum extracts then came the

706
00:24:45,579 --> 00:24:50,319
diamonds we learned that if you leave

707
00:24:47,558 --> 00:24:51,788
those crystals under pressure in

708
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,250
solution long enough they create

709
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:56,710
gigantic diamonds and a lot of people

710
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:59,919
like dabbing just big old diamonds

711
00:24:56,710 --> 00:25:00,490
I think the diamonds get me ridiculously

712
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,980
high

713
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:04,720
I think the diamonds need a little bit

714
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,519
of turps added to them you got to add a

715
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,440
couple of drops of Terps to the diamonds

716
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:10,569
or it's a little too intense I think

717
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:13,000
that the THC a crystals the diamonds

718
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:15,490
make you go SuperDuper high you

719
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,259
skyrocket high like a firework I think

720
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,079
the terpenes that you add to that are

721
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:22,000
the color your firework makes that may

722
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,288
be a weird way to describe it but the

723
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,638
Terps are what decide if you're gonna

724
00:25:23,288 --> 00:25:25,839
get paranoid if you're gonna get the

725
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:28,119
munchies if you're gonna get laid-back

726
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:30,250
if you're gonna get talkative the Terps

727
00:25:28,119 --> 00:25:30,908
decide what's going to happen and the

728
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:32,919
THC

729
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:34,659
besides how high you're gonna go with

730
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:36,460
that is what I feel when there's no

731
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,690
Terps to it you just go real high and

732
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,340
you kind of get a headache and then you

733
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:41,230
sober up real quickly is what I feel

734
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:43,839
like so it needs some turps to control

735
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:45,759
the drive or the rocket just goes flying

736
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:47,888
off the rails and then it crashes and

737
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,319
it's done so that's the crystals the

738
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:53,199
diamonds by themselves when you take the

739
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:55,450
high cannabinoid full spectrum extract

740
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,798
diamonds that are kind of chunky and you

741
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,659
pour the Terps over them and you see

742
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,398
those diamonds floating in the liquid

743
00:25:58,659 --> 00:26:02,350
turps and Sutan sure if you guys pay

744
00:26:00,398 --> 00:26:04,658
attention to social media you see people

745
00:26:02,349 --> 00:26:07,148
with little jars and they've got this

746
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:08,710
golden liquid stuff in there and they've

747
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,759
got these little chunks just floating

748
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:13,120
around and they're these little crystals

749
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:15,700
that is what's being called sauce those

750
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,859
are diamonds those are HT FSC crystals

751
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:24,429
floating around in Terp sauce you guys

752
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:25,808
it's cannabinoids and turbo way to smoke

753
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:27,820
right now I like a pretty good sized

754
00:26:25,808 --> 00:26:30,038
crystal was just a little bit of the

755
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:31,298
Terp sauce on it I like the high from

756
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:32,950
the crystal like I was saying earlier

757
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,599
and then I like the Terp sauce just to

758
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,880
guide that high give it a direction and

759
00:26:34,599 --> 00:26:39,638
also add some turbo flavor to it so that

760
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,040
seems to be the trend right now is the

761
00:26:39,638 --> 00:26:43,928
sauce the crystals the turn

762
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:46,629
and the Diamonds seems to be the way to

763
00:26:43,929 --> 00:26:48,519
go also we've got to talk about our

764
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,980
solvent list friends I am not much on

765
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,230
the solvent list smoke if you pass me a

766
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,720
solvent list AB hell yes I will take it

767
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:57,160
do I buy solvent list concentrates very

768
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,410
very rarely it's got to be very

769
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,250
impressive to get me to buy a solvent

770
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,259
let's concentrate

771
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:04,029
I would rather buy some sauce because

772
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:06,069
they're about the same price sometimes

773
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:08,379
this solvent list mmm excuse me with the

774
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:09,339
throat once again at 7/10 not gonna edit

775
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:10,690
it keep going

776
00:27:09,339 --> 00:27:12,009
take a dab with me every time every time

777
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:13,090
I clear my throat in this episode you

778
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:15,339
take a DAB that'll be fun

779
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:17,859
here we go but solving this is sometimes

780
00:27:15,339 --> 00:27:19,569
more expensive than sauce as what I

781
00:27:17,859 --> 00:27:21,849
think I was saying let's talk more about

782
00:27:19,569 --> 00:27:24,069
savile a solvent less includes stuff

783
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,480
like eye swags if you see the kids that

784
00:27:24,069 --> 00:27:26,740
show up to the dispensary with a cooler

785
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,480
and they leave with a little cooler

786
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,370
they're probably buying ice wax they

787
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,529
keep it cool until the moment made a bit

788
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:34,209
those plants are harvested in a cool

789
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:36,178
environment they're stored in a cool

790
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:38,590
environment possibly frozen I'm not sure

791
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:41,410
they are processed in a cold environment

792
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:43,779
they are made with ice water then

793
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,730
they're graded up in a cold environment

794
00:27:43,779 --> 00:27:47,500
the entire process they are kept in a

795
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,960
very cool environment until the minute

796
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:51,789
they are dad a lot of people are opposed

797
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,220
to smoking solvents our friend jinx

798
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:56,139
proof won't smoke butane hash or solvent

799
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:58,150
made hash because he's epileptic and

800
00:27:56,140 --> 00:28:00,190
he's afraid to smoke something made with

801
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:01,809
butane which is respectable so a lot of

802
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,480
people go for the solvent list they like

803
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:07,599
the ice wax or the water hatch also

804
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,179
there is rosin rosin has made a couple

805
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,798
of different ways rosin can be made and

806
00:28:10,179 --> 00:28:13,419
I'm just gonna give you the idn't I

807
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:14,950
don't make rosin and if you listen to me

808
00:28:13,419 --> 00:28:17,320
a lot you know I don't enjoy smoking

809
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,480
rosin but I'm not biased I'm gonna try

810
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:22,079
to give you guys a fair report on rosin

811
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:25,029
you make rosin basically by putting a

812
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,639
nugget into a little mesh pouch a very

813
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:29,619
specific micron mesh pouch I'm not sure

814
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,540
of the specific micron because like I

815
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:33,519
said this is not my wheelhouse but this

816
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:36,519
is my understanding you put a nugget or

817
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:39,250
some nuggets in a mesh pouch a very

818
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:41,048
specific micron mesh pouch you then I

819
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,500
think wrap that you fold that in

820
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:46,089
parchment paper then you squish the [ __ ]

821
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,069
out of that with the press I've also

822
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:49,689
seen people use a hair straightener to

823
00:28:48,069 --> 00:28:52,329
do it they use a hot hair straightener

824
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,700
and a clamp to tighten it down real

825
00:28:52,329 --> 00:28:56,558
tight you want heat and pressure so then

826
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,970
you're gonna squish that bud with heat

827
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,158
and pressure and wear that parchment

828
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,140
paper where it's folded in half where

829
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,610
it's not folded the other side the open

830
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,540
side you're gonna get some juice

831
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:07,089
dripping out of there

832
00:29:04,539 --> 00:29:08,740
that is your rosin that golden resin

833
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:10,839
juice that comes out of there that's

834
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:12,669
rosin when you unfold that parchment

835
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,779
paper you're gonna have right around

836
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:18,429
your little square of a micron mesh bag

837
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:19,539
you're gonna have all this goo that came

838
00:29:18,429 --> 00:29:21,159
out scrape that up

839
00:29:19,539 --> 00:29:23,859
that is your rosin that you want to dab

840
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:25,720
that is solvent list and you can smoke

841
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:27,939
that immediately and it's kind of safe

842
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,289
to make if you can enjoy the flavor and

843
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,630
you can get it the way you want it the

844
00:29:29,289 --> 00:29:32,980
temperature the pressure just with a few

845
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,679
simple tools you can make

846
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:37,360
dable rosin at home from flowers know

847
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,548
what a lot of people do it will take

848
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:41,740
some hash some water hash some bubble

849
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:44,109
hash maybe it was some ice wax at one

850
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:47,019
point and they will press that into

851
00:29:44,109 --> 00:29:48,279
rosin and that makes really good rosin

852
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:49,480
the rosin that comes out of that once

853
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:51,129
it's already been cleaned and you're not

854
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,740
pressing all that plant matter and

855
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,960
you're pressing water hash into rosin

856
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,370
that makes delicious rosin that's the

857
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,240
best rosin I think you can make any

858
00:29:57,369 --> 00:30:02,649
press hash into rosin so chatot or

859
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,500
solvent list friends I hope I did you

860
00:30:02,650 --> 00:30:06,730
guys justice honestly I don't smoke a

861
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:08,109
lot of solvent list if you want to come

862
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,579
on the show and talk about solvent list

863
00:30:08,109 --> 00:30:11,048
and teach us about it you were more than

864
00:30:09,579 --> 00:30:12,069
welcome send me an email let's grow from

865
00:30:11,048 --> 00:30:13,750
your heart at hotmail.com

866
00:30:12,069 --> 00:30:16,720
or if you're one of my friends text me

867
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,339
or hit me up on the Instagram and we can

868
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,289
talk about that another type of

869
00:30:18,339 --> 00:30:22,899
concentrate I should mention but I am

870
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:24,579
honestly not a big fan of his propane

871
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:26,200
honey oil most of the concentrates I

872
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:28,480
talked about before we're made with

873
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,220
butane and other techniques there is

874
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,839
you'll see Pho on the shelves when you

875
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,210
shop at the dispensary that is propane

876
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:36,939
honey oil yes we are making concentrates

877
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:38,500
with different gases different gases or

878
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,480
different temperatures they will bring

879
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,548
out different cannabinoids I've noticed

880
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,620
that the phot really brings out good

881
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:46,869
flavors but it makes my lungs feel

882
00:30:44,619 --> 00:30:48,969
really heavy when I smoke it it makes

883
00:30:46,869 --> 00:30:51,279
everything come out kind of waxy it's

884
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:53,440
kind of got that ah Cheesecake batter

885
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,389
sort of a texture to it and it doesn't

886
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,860
taste too bad but it really makes my

887
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:58,419
lungs heavy and it doesn't have the

888
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:00,069
proper high I don't enjoy the high to

889
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:02,230
Pho so that's another thing that I

890
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:04,599
should mention is available so you guys

891
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,700
we went from smoking doodoo

892
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:09,279
just seven or eight years ago we were

893
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:11,019
smoking crap justjust the monkeyest

894
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,609
crappiest stuff there would be different

895
00:31:11,019 --> 00:31:14,710
colors it'd be brown it would be black

896
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:16,240
it would sizzle on the nail it would

897
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:18,220
give you a headache sometimes it would

898
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,700
make your throat burn and now the

899
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:24,279
concentrate that I've got in my hand is

900
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,110
super super clear I can see my finger

901
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,879
through the bottom of the jar and there

902
00:31:26,109 --> 00:31:29,679
are just little little diamonds sitting

903
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,840
in here it's not the same color but I

904
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,130
want to compare this to the beauty of a

905
00:31:31,839 --> 00:31:34,480
little hot cocoa with little

906
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:36,460
marshmallows on the top you know those

907
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,690
little little tiny marshmallows that's

908
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,340
what these little diamonds look like in

909
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,049
here and then they're just cascaded

910
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:43,259
throughout this little little Terp sauce

911
00:31:41,049 --> 00:31:47,259
and it smells wonderful

912
00:31:43,259 --> 00:31:49,329
it smells like orange candies and jet

913
00:31:47,259 --> 00:31:52,450
fuel it's so delicious this is the Reba

914
00:31:49,329 --> 00:31:54,759
jam from Green Dot labs so guys we went

915
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,750
from smoke and crap to smoking the best

916
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:57,490
stuff on the planet

917
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:59,380
in just a few years and that's because

918
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:02,500
of legalization so that is the evolution

919
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,990
of the dabs now let's talk about some of

920
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,240
the dab equipment let's talk about nails

921
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,099
at first I talked about the skillet

922
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,200
that's that upside down bong bull with

923
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:12,459
the piece that swings underneath it and

924
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,509
then you heat that piece you swing it

925
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,799
under there and you set your dab on

926
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:16,509
there hope it doesn't run off of there

927
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,069
onto your leg while it's still hot

928
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:20,319
because that's happened and it's [ __ ]

929
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:24,609
hot and it sucks so we started off with

930
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:27,939
the skillet then we learned to use a

931
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:30,699
nail now a nail you had to have a male

932
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,039
rig most so if you've got a bong it's

933
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,289
probably a female your bong Bowl fits

934
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,599
into the stem right now imagine if that

935
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:39,099
stem were the male part and the bowl fit

936
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:41,649
on the outside that would be called a

937
00:32:39,099 --> 00:32:43,480
direct inject Bowl is what that is if

938
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:45,580
you had a direct inject Bowl that's a

939
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:48,640
male you just set the dab nail right in

940
00:32:45,579 --> 00:32:52,389
there they made a dab nail it kind of

941
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,100
looks like a big nail it would be excuse

942
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:55,750
me it's a titanium hopefully titanium

943
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,949
you want a quality titanium nail you

944
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,000
don't want to smoke some Chinese stuff

945
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:59,410
because you're gonna heat it up it's

946
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,150
gonna off gas I'm not gonna rant about

947
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:03,130
that but a titanium eel I recommend

948
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,550
highly educated titanium so you get a

949
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:07,930
titanium nail it is kind of a it looks

950
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:09,669
like a nail it's got a head on it and

951
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,900
then it's got a long body right but it

952
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:12,009
would have another piece on it that

953
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,420
would screw up and down and make it

954
00:33:12,009 --> 00:33:15,819
adjustable so you can adjust the height

955
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:17,350
that piece would sit and so you drop it

956
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:18,779
right into the male part of the rig and

957
00:33:17,349 --> 00:33:21,029
you'd adjust that

958
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:22,470
to where it would fit into the rig and

959
00:33:21,029 --> 00:33:24,809
stick out enough to where then you would

960
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:26,789
slide a dome over it so you would heat

961
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:28,740
the nail then you would slide a dome

962
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:31,529
just like he would put your bowl onto

963
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:33,269
the bomb he would slide a dome over that

964
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:34,950
nail and it would fit over there and the

965
00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:37,139
purpose of that is then you would take

966
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,819
your dab and touch that hot nail with it

967
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,740
and the smoke would kind of stay it

968
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:42,029
would be trapped in that dome and then

969
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,829
he would smoke through the bong or the

970
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:45,420
bubble or whatever you're using and he

971
00:33:43,829 --> 00:33:48,799
would hit it that way so we went from

972
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:51,269
the skillet to the nail and dome method

973
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,069
the nail was a little archaic but it

974
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:54,660
worked very well I would see a lot of

975
00:33:53,069 --> 00:33:56,819
people try to carve the nail and burn

976
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,350
the [ __ ] out of themselves it took a

977
00:33:56,819 --> 00:33:59,970
little while for people to catch on to

978
00:33:58,349 --> 00:34:01,740
the nail tech it took a long time to

979
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:03,390
teach people not to heat the [ __ ] out of

980
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,519
their nail I still take a pretty hot dab

981
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:07,770
back in the day everybody was going even

982
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,210
hotter than me we had to teach people to

983
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:11,039
mellow down on that some people still

984
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:12,869
don't want to hear it including myself I

985
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,809
guess so you had the nail with the dome

986
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:17,759
on it you're probably familiar with that

987
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:19,980
then task rock started making different

988
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,409
types of nails and he made the flux nail

989
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,719
the flux was my favorite I check out the

990
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:27,119
flux nail by highly-educated when I used

991
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,500
a domed nail the flux was my go-to but

992
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:34,079
then TAS came out with the domeless nail

993
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:36,570
so the domeless nail kind of looks like

994
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,668
a rook from a chess set you guys it

995
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,780
looked like the rook on a chess set I

996
00:34:38,668 --> 00:34:42,480
got to write something down here excited

997
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,310
in write down carb cap the carb cap

998
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,260
changed a lot of stuff when I came to

999
00:34:44,309 --> 00:34:49,679
dabbing I didn't write that down so the

1000
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,330
the domeless nail kind of looked like

1001
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,230
you took a rook and set it right on your

1002
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:56,940
pipe right on your rig it was shaped

1003
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:58,349
like it tapered it was wider at the

1004
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,960
bottom and it tapered up and then it had

1005
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:03,449
this wide head on it with like a dish

1006
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,650
with a piece up at that in the center of

1007
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:07,829
the dish it looked like it kind of had

1008
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:09,329
an axle that was hollow so it had a dish

1009
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:10,690
you could drop your dab in but the

1010
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:13,989
sinner

1011
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,519
had a a wall around it so that your dad

1012
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:16,959
wouldn't fall right down the hole but

1013
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,369
you could smoke and the smoke would go

1014
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,539
up and then down that hole through the

1015
00:35:18,369 --> 00:35:20,950
rig and you could hit it I think I

1016
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:22,509
described that accurately imagine you

1017
00:35:20,949 --> 00:35:24,250
took a rope from a chess set drill the

1018
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:25,630
hole right through the top of it and set

1019
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,619
that [ __ ] right on top of your

1020
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,240
nail that's kind of what it looked like

1021
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:29,140
but if you dropped your nail right on

1022
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:30,098
there it would fall through the hole in

1023
00:35:29,139 --> 00:35:31,480
the middle right so they just put a

1024
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,430
little ring around that so we didn't

1025
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:36,190
fall through now you got yourself a dish

1026
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:38,169
with a hole you'd smoke on there now

1027
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:39,730
that was cool but you had to heat that

1028
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,869
thing real hot to hit it and he would

1029
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:42,579
put your dab on there and part of the

1030
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:44,289
smoke would get away and they need

1031
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:46,450
chokha locks it was so hot so task

1032
00:35:44,289 --> 00:35:49,029
invented a thing called a carb cap a

1033
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:51,129
carb cap was another piece of titanium

1034
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:55,150
that fit perfectly on top of your

1035
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:57,430
domeless nail now that carb cap would

1036
00:35:55,150 --> 00:36:00,099
trap the heat inside of your nail and it

1037
00:35:57,429 --> 00:36:02,469
would minimize the amount of outside air

1038
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:04,990
that was allowed to pass the surface of

1039
00:36:02,469 --> 00:36:07,179
that nail which would stoke the heat of

1040
00:36:04,989 --> 00:36:09,279
the nail and make your dab burn better

1041
00:36:07,179 --> 00:36:11,529
at a lower temperature so now you were

1042
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,480
getting a better flavor dad because he

1043
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:15,099
weren't burning off the Terps it wasn't

1044
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,780
burning your lungs it wasn't burning

1045
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:18,970
your throat and he didn't have to use so

1046
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,290
much heat to get all of your smoke he

1047
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:21,730
would drop a big old dab on there and

1048
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:23,739
he'd cap it and that heat would remain

1049
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:24,909
inside the nail as it was covered and

1050
00:36:23,739 --> 00:36:26,409
then you could just keep pulling on it

1051
00:36:24,909 --> 00:36:27,519
until you get all of it otherwise he had

1052
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:29,199
to heat it real hot and just try to get

1053
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:32,289
as much smoke as you could to try to

1054
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:34,689
take a big dab and part of the carb cap

1055
00:36:32,289 --> 00:36:36,699
evolved from people were taking a

1056
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:39,400
domeless nail and placing their thumb or

1057
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:40,838
two fingers over the hole of the dome to

1058
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,280
kind of minimize and restrict the amount

1059
00:36:40,838 --> 00:36:44,259
of airflow to get a lower temperature

1060
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,720
dab it's kind of what inspired the carb

1061
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,119
cap so we went from the domed nail to

1062
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:52,629
the domeless nail to the dome domeless

1063
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:55,780
nail with a carb cap then somewhere

1064
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:59,260
along that point task rock invented the

1065
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:01,420
email the email was a domeless nail with

1066
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,510
a coil coming off of it it had a wire

1067
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:07,180
that went to a box that would regulate

1068
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:09,310
the temperature of that coil that would

1069
00:37:07,179 --> 00:37:11,289
heat that nail so you didn't have to use

1070
00:37:09,309 --> 00:37:12,849
a torch to heat your dad nail anymore

1071
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:14,409
it was electric and it was always

1072
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:15,970
running you'd plug that son of a [ __ ]

1073
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:17,230
in you dial it to a temperature you'd

1074
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:19,598
wait a couple of minutes for it to heat

1075
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,010
up once it's hot it's gonna be hot until

1076
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:22,599
you turn it off so you could take a DAB

1077
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:24,220
I can pass it to Kevin Kevin would take

1078
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:24,530
a DAB we'd pass it over to Dee Dee would

1079
00:37:24,219 --> 00:37:26,269
take

1080
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:27,950
damn it pass it back to me and I take

1081
00:37:26,269 --> 00:37:29,300
another dab and he'd realize oh my

1082
00:37:27,949 --> 00:37:32,179
goodness this thing is gonna be a

1083
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,430
problem and everybody got so stoned when

1084
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:35,869
the email started first coming around so

1085
00:37:34,429 --> 00:37:38,149
shot it to our friend task rock for

1086
00:37:35,869 --> 00:37:39,769
making the first email he gets credit

1087
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,079
for that you guys he gets the first

1088
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:43,519
email there'd been a lot of companies

1089
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,889
that I made a lot of emails after that

1090
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:48,710
but task did it first so shout out to

1091
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:50,980
task rock and the email um somewhere

1092
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:54,590
along the line so the email got popular

1093
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:56,900
then we started seeing things called the

1094
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:59,360
banger and the club banger the quaff

1095
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,740
banger qwave banger you can see quadric

1096
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,809
wave I'm not sure how you say it I've

1097
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:04,189
been corrected both ways so go with

1098
00:38:02,809 --> 00:38:06,349
whichever one you're comfortable with

1099
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:09,530
but this dude wave made a thing called a

1100
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:13,159
banger it was probably the most commonly

1101
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:15,019
seen dabbing nail after the original

1102
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:17,239
titanium nail it's the one you see the

1103
00:38:15,019 --> 00:38:20,539
most the one most copied the most

1104
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:22,429
knocked off it fits on your rig and it

1105
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:24,170
comes up and then it has an angle to

1106
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:26,299
where it gets horizontal - they've got a

1107
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,960
45 or a 90 degree angle probably on it

1108
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:32,269
or that the dish part sits horizontally

1109
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,909
then it's just basically got a glass

1110
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:36,829
symbol on it and you heat it and you

1111
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:38,809
drop your dab in there and then you

1112
00:38:36,829 --> 00:38:40,759
smoke it and you put a carb cap over it

1113
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:42,230
and then let me write down bubble caps -

1114
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,430
because we didn't talk about bubble caps

1115
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:46,039
because when we get to these other

1116
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:50,239
things we're gonna need a bubble cap so

1117
00:38:46,039 --> 00:38:51,920
basically the Banger looks like a piece

1118
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,719
of glass at an angle that attaches to

1119
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,519
your rig or your pipe with a thimble on

1120
00:38:53,719 --> 00:38:56,809
it and then you would heat that and when

1121
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,579
it got to the right temperature you drop

1122
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:00,920
your dab inside of there put a carb cap

1123
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:02,869
on it and at this point in time a carb

1124
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,159
cap was just a flat piece with a hole in

1125
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:06,289
it so that you could restrict the air

1126
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,309
then we started getting directional carb

1127
00:39:06,289 --> 00:39:08,599
caps it would have a little piece of

1128
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:09,949
glass it would just point the air in a

1129
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,569
certain direction and you would turn it

1130
00:39:09,949 --> 00:39:13,099
to move the oil around in your nail a

1131
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:16,340
little better because people were taking

1132
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:18,019
big dabs so that was the kind of the

1133
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,320
start of the club bangers what they

1134
00:39:18,019 --> 00:39:23,030
called it the glass version of a nail

1135
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,059
from the banger we started seeing

1136
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:29,240
variations of that we saw the gavel from

1137
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:31,519
highly-educated we saw the trough from

1138
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,689
who made the trough we can't think of

1139
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:34,730
who made the trough right now Joe Peters

1140
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:37,559
then we saw the Joel Halen honey hole

1141
00:39:34,730 --> 00:39:40,079
which was very similar to the trough

1142
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:42,329
we saw the Grail from Toro then we saw

1143
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,389
the core reactor which was kind of these

1144
00:39:42,329 --> 00:39:47,610
are all just variations on the on the

1145
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:49,500
original banger and they're just

1146
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:52,079
slightly different but the core reactor

1147
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:53,940
was bigger and it had a piece like a

1148
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,739
hump of glass in the middle of it that

1149
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,840
would hold a little bit of heat longer

1150
00:39:55,739 --> 00:39:59,909
so you could take larger dabs at lower

1151
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:02,010
temperatures it was just like a banger

1152
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:04,049
just like the quaff banger but it had a

1153
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:05,400
larger chunk of glass in the very middle

1154
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,070
of it that would hold the heat so that

1155
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,130
was the core reactor then we started

1156
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:12,360
seeing the thermal banger which I'm

1157
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,410
gonna try to describe to you now I've

1158
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,510
got one in front of me it's what I've

1159
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:18,089
been hitting it is just like the normal

1160
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:19,530
banger so you've got the joint that fits

1161
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:21,539
onto my rig it just sets right on the

1162
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:24,300
rig like a bong Bowl wood and it's got a

1163
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,159
90 degree angle then it's got it looks

1164
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,780
like a glass thimble honestly just a

1165
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,879
piece of just a glass looks like a

1166
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,060
little glass jar or a glass thimble or a

1167
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:35,670
glass Pepsi lid from a Pepsi bottle it's

1168
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:39,570
about that size and it is attached to

1169
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:42,900
this glass a 90 degree angle then inside

1170
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:45,000
of that is another glass dish that looks

1171
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,880
like a smaller thimble so it's like a

1172
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,619
thimble inside of a thimble and the idea

1173
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,570
is that you heat the outer thimble and

1174
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:53,159
the heat never touches that inside

1175
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,289
thimble so it doesn't get dirty and

1176
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:57,149
funky and you don't burn your dab is bad

1177
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:59,099
so you heat the outside part

1178
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:01,530
you drop your dab in there then you put

1179
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:04,920
a bubble cap over it a bubble cap is

1180
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:06,390
shaped it's a bubble with a piece of

1181
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,829
tubing so imagine you took a straw and

1182
00:41:06,389 --> 00:41:09,119
heated it and you blew on it and it

1183
00:41:07,829 --> 00:41:10,559
expanded in the middle and you put a

1184
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,639
bubble in it that's what a bubble cap

1185
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,309
would look like then you cut it off

1186
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:16,589
short on both ends so part of that the

1187
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:18,000
bubble seals the cat the Banger so now

1188
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,930
it's sealed off you drop the bubble cap

1189
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,030
on there it's sealed

1190
00:41:18,929 --> 00:41:22,889
one end of it points down inside of the

1191
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,110
Banger and one end of it points up and

1192
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:26,699
you turn it and when you turn it that

1193
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,170
moves your oil around inside there and

1194
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:29,699
it gets nice and deep inside of the

1195
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:31,470
banger so it moves that oil around

1196
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:33,299
inside the bottom of the banger so your

1197
00:41:31,469 --> 00:41:35,159
oil moves and doesn't stay in one place

1198
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,260
and it burns the whole dab and you get a

1199
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:40,409
nice low temp dab that tastes really

1200
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:43,770
nice so that is and you also use that

1201
00:41:40,409 --> 00:41:46,769
carb cap on the the core reactor banger

1202
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:48,329
so that is going to the evolution of we

1203
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:50,550
went from the titanium the skillet to

1204
00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:51,420
the nail to the flux to the domeless to

1205
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:53,130
the email

1206
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:55,858
then we started using bangers and yes

1207
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:59,430
they do make so bangers are glass or

1208
00:41:55,858 --> 00:42:02,009
quartz off your pan like 20 or 30 bucks

1209
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:04,649
they're glass if you're paying 180 150

1210
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:07,349
they're probably quartz I hope you can

1211
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:09,059
get a quartz email you can get a banger

1212
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:11,640
with an email attachment yes that is a

1213
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:13,109
thing I really appreciate that I enjoy

1214
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:15,900
the way that works the way that tastes

1215
00:42:13,108 --> 00:42:17,400
and the way that dabs so we've talked

1216
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,318
about the core reactor we talked about

1217
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,539
the thermal banger we talked about the

1218
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:22,769
gavel the trough the Grail those are

1219
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:25,440
just different versions you guys from

1220
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:28,019
different makers let's talk about the

1221
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,358
bucket the bucket is what mothership

1222
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:31,920
uses the bucket fits it looks like a

1223
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:33,449
bong Bowl it looks just like you're

1224
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,460
gonna pack a bong bowl but it's got this

1225
00:42:33,449 --> 00:42:37,139
little hinge on it and that hinge has a

1226
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,568
piece that swings out and it's got a

1227
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:41,940
little titanium dish on there you swing

1228
00:42:39,568 --> 00:42:43,710
it out you heat that titanium dish you

1229
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,358
swing it back in and when it cools to

1230
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:47,519
the proper temp then you drop your dab

1231
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,558
on there and then you use what's called

1232
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:53,250
the ofz is what the carb cap is that

1233
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:56,160
fits on the mother ship bucket there's

1234
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:57,838
also this new thing called the knot I'm

1235
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:59,759
not sure what it's actually called it

1236
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:01,500
looks like a pretzel knot it is

1237
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,880
ridiculous it looks like the Hat you

1238
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,769
draw you heat it then you drop in this

1239
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,059
other thing and then you put your dab it

1240
00:43:04,769 --> 00:43:07,858
you heat another thing and drop that

1241
00:43:06,059 --> 00:43:09,569
inside of it and it looks like the hash

1242
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:11,880
falls to the bottom and keeps recycling

1243
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:14,369
up to the top I am not familiar with it

1244
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,530
granny does not like it there's another

1245
00:43:14,369 --> 00:43:18,088
thing from Toro it kind of looks like a

1246
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:20,460
bird feeder I'm pretty sure that's from

1247
00:43:18,088 --> 00:43:24,358
Toro I even ever tried that it doesn't

1248
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:26,280
look just doesn't look like it makes

1249
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:29,068
sense to me it looks like I would rather

1250
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,990
dab off of a banger you guys will see

1251
00:43:29,068 --> 00:43:32,159
that one online the one you drop the dab

1252
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:33,539
in the top and then it falls to the

1253
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:35,489
bottom somehow and it looks it's shaped

1254
00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:37,349
like a [ __ ] Cole what Coleman lantern

1255
00:43:35,489 --> 00:43:39,509
it looks like a bird feeder or something

1256
00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:41,160
I'm not a fan of that thing I haven't

1257
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,480
used it but still it just looks like

1258
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:44,489
it's more cumbersome than it's worth

1259
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,969
it looks like a pain in the ass and it

1260
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:50,729
doesn't make sense to me also there are

1261
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:53,730
insert dabs insert dabs kind of you have

1262
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:55,798
a bigger banger and then you heat the

1263
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:59,068
bigger banger and then you put your dab

1264
00:43:55,798 --> 00:44:02,099
inside up a smaller like a just a glass

1265
00:43:59,068 --> 00:44:03,630
dish and you actually set that inside of

1266
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,490
the banger and then you put a carb cap

1267
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:07,800
on there and then you give it a second

1268
00:44:05,489 --> 00:44:11,039
for the heat to work its way to your dad

1269
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,539
and then you toke on it and that way you

1270
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,190
can just pull out that little dish when

1271
00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,929
you're done the insert and you can clean

1272
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:18,690
that dish off and you have a clean nice

1273
00:44:15,929 --> 00:44:20,368
turkey dab every time it always tastes

1274
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:22,139
delicious and it always tastes fresh

1275
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:24,300
because a lot of people don't want to

1276
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:25,348
smoke off of a burnt out Chas banger if

1277
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,880
your banger is all black and

1278
00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:29,099
funky-looking need some attention

1279
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:34,130
that's called its Chas and he kind of

1280
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:36,690
[ __ ] it up and a lot of passion absorb

1281
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:38,280
angers and nail styles that I can think

1282
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:39,690
of right now I'm sure I missed a couple

1283
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,550
I'm sure something has come out since

1284
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:43,108
I've made this episode I'm sure I'm not

1285
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:45,420
on top of everything but that's a lot of

1286
00:44:43,108 --> 00:44:47,489
what you're gonna see also we've got

1287
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,050
nectar collectors nectar collectors are

1288
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:51,809
kind of like a rig but instead of

1289
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:54,150
dropping the dab into the nail you heat

1290
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:56,039
up the tip of the nectar collector and

1291
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,980
you put your concentrate into a dish and

1292
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:01,108
the nectar collector is made to be held

1293
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:03,088
vertically so it's up and down and you

1294
00:45:01,108 --> 00:45:04,409
hold the dish in your hand and then you

1295
00:45:03,088 --> 00:45:05,489
kind of smoke it like an anteater you

1296
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:07,500
look like an anteater it's like you're

1297
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:09,088
using a giant straw just to suck up a

1298
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,889
DAB you heat up the tip of it and you

1299
00:45:09,088 --> 00:45:13,049
press that hot tip up against the dad

1300
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:15,000
and you get a huge dab out of that a lot

1301
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:17,160
of people love a nectar collector it's

1302
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,559
like basically a dad straw it runs

1303
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:21,420
through water a dab straw is just a

1304
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:23,309
piece of glass it's tapered at one end

1305
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,750
you heat up that one in real hot you

1306
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:26,608
press that up against your dabs and you

1307
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,380
suck through the other end it's a way to

1308
00:45:26,608 --> 00:45:30,509
take a DAB but it's really hot it's

1309
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,640
really uncomfortable for me a nectar

1310
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,650
collector is a very upgraded way to do

1311
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:37,289
that because it filters your dab through

1312
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:39,000
water I always prefer my dab to go

1313
00:45:37,289 --> 00:45:41,338
through water to cool it down a little

1314
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,789
bit for me so I guess that's a good way

1315
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:46,500
to segue into rig selection I prefer a

1316
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:49,108
small rig there's no reason to smoke

1317
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:50,579
your dad's out of a big ass bong you're

1318
00:45:49,108 --> 00:45:52,230
not so let's think about the reason

1319
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:54,838
you're smoking through a bomb you pack a

1320
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:58,019
bowl you like that bull you've got a big

1321
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:59,429
12 18 2 foot bong right you're 24 inch

1322
00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:01,409
bong you're smoking you fill that

1323
00:45:59,429 --> 00:46:03,179
big-ass chamber with all that thick

1324
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:04,920
smoke you can see that cloud coming out

1325
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:06,329
it's coming up at you you're looking at

1326
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,220
it through the tube like all that smoke

1327
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:09,509
is about to go into my head and then

1328
00:46:08,219 --> 00:46:10,949
once you get it all filled up with as

1329
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:12,599
much as you think you can handle you

1330
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:14,250
pull that carb and you suck all that

1331
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:15,380
smoke in and you get that loud water

1332
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,659
noise

1333
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,539
you try not to splash it upon your face

1334
00:46:17,659 --> 00:46:21,618
and you get a big old bong hit you cough

1335
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:22,970
then you put the bowl back in their knee

1336
00:46:21,619 --> 00:46:25,460
pass it to your friend you're like I'm

1337
00:46:22,969 --> 00:46:27,649
[ __ ] stoned bong kids feel great

1338
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:29,358
that's a great thing I love a giant bong

1339
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:31,548
hit but I don't wanna take a dab out of

1340
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,739
a big ol bong head because as soon if I

1341
00:46:31,548 --> 00:46:36,318
heat the nail as soon as that dad

1342
00:46:33,739 --> 00:46:38,268
touches the nail I carb cap it and I'm

1343
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:40,190
starting to get smoke already the smoke

1344
00:46:38,268 --> 00:46:42,169
is coming there's no need to start

1345
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:45,829
filling a chamber I don't want to suck

1346
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:48,710
12 inches 18 or 24 inches of glass of

1347
00:46:45,829 --> 00:46:50,269
air of oxygen to my lungs before I even

1348
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,278
get my dab I'm not trying to smoke a

1349
00:46:50,268 --> 00:46:54,500
gallon of air I'm trying to smoke a gram

1350
00:46:52,278 --> 00:46:57,018
of concentrates so I don't need a big

1351
00:46:54,500 --> 00:46:59,480
bong I want a little tiny piece I like

1352
00:46:57,018 --> 00:47:00,949
what they call a sidecar the rig I'm

1353
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:02,990
hitting right now is made by hitman

1354
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:04,818
hitman doesn't sponsor the show a lot of

1355
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:06,858
people hate on hitman I like the way

1356
00:47:04,818 --> 00:47:08,960
this rig functions I could it doesn't

1357
00:47:06,858 --> 00:47:12,650
matter to me who made this I like the

1358
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,798
way this rig hits this rig is probably 5

1359
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,869
inches tall it's about the size of round

1360
00:47:15,798 --> 00:47:19,969
it's the size of Round of my torch it's

1361
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:22,338
almost the same diameter of my torch

1362
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:24,018
it's like perfectly the size it fits

1363
00:47:22,338 --> 00:47:25,369
right in a cup holder you guys the base

1364
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:26,750
of this fits right in a cup holder I

1365
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:28,519
didn't say that but it fits right in the

1366
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,798
cup holder okay it's a little smaller

1367
00:47:28,518 --> 00:47:32,389
than the diameter of a Pepsi can it's a

1368
00:47:30,798 --> 00:47:34,369
little thicker around in my torch if

1369
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:35,989
it's really nice and a cup holder it's

1370
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:37,309
about 4 inches tall then it's got a

1371
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:38,989
little mouthpiece coming off oh it's

1372
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:40,730
just a can shape they call that a can

1373
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:42,919
and it's got a mouthpiece coming off of

1374
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:45,079
it that's another 4 or 5 inches long and

1375
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,480
that mouthpiece I like a nice flared out

1376
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:49,220
mouthpiece so that my lips fit into it

1377
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,469
and I don't have to make that that

1378
00:47:49,219 --> 00:47:53,209
[ __ ] mouth to try to take a dad also

1379
00:47:51,469 --> 00:47:54,679
I don't like a skinny mouthpiece cuz I

1380
00:47:53,210 --> 00:47:55,880
taking big dabs and I feel like when you

1381
00:47:54,679 --> 00:47:57,469
take a big DAB with the skinny

1382
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:59,420
mouthpiece and you got a mustache like I

1383
00:47:57,469 --> 00:48:01,129
do a lot of concentrate just gathers

1384
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:03,019
right there in your mustache and it's

1385
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:04,369
kind of funky to have sticky lips you

1386
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:06,379
guys have heard me do podcast with

1387
00:48:04,369 --> 00:48:09,170
sticky lips from small mouthpiece rigs

1388
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:10,960
so then it's got a male joint sticking

1389
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,250
straight up off the top the very center

1390
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:16,009
the main portion of this rig is just

1391
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:18,259
shaped like a circle or a can it's just

1392
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:19,699
a can it's a small can so then I

1393
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:21,380
describe the mouthpiece now right on the

1394
00:48:19,699 --> 00:48:23,419
top and the dead center of that can is

1395
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:26,460
where the male joint sticks up and on

1396
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:29,030
that joint I have got a it's a

1397
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:31,230
14-inch joint and I've got a 14-inch

1398
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,700
thermal banger on there and I'm using a

1399
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,349
bubble cap tonight so that's basically

1400
00:48:32,699 --> 00:48:36,059
my dad setup and I'm using a little just

1401
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:38,250
a glass pencil as a dabber from tater

1402
00:48:36,059 --> 00:48:39,750
glass shout out to tater I prefer a

1403
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,489
small rig II guys nothing too big

1404
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:42,960
something that's kind of like hands

1405
00:48:41,489 --> 00:48:43,858
sighs you don't want anything much

1406
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,900
bigger than that

1407
00:48:43,858 --> 00:48:48,299
there's no need to smoke a gallon of

1408
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:50,130
oxygen before your dad gets to you so a

1409
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:52,619
little rig is best in my opinion a

1410
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:53,880
little sidecar is best let's see what

1411
00:48:52,619 --> 00:48:55,108
else do I want to mention we're getting

1412
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:57,119
close to an hour and I've still got a

1413
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:59,369
few notes that I want to make sure let's

1414
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,440
talk about the evolution of rigs when

1415
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:03,720
rigs first came out most of them had

1416
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:05,820
what was known as an 18 millimeter joint

1417
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:07,769
that joint was 18 millimeters around

1418
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:09,210
it's kind of a big joint the way that I

1419
00:49:07,769 --> 00:49:10,500
used to remember the size of that one if

1420
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,579
I went to the store to go shopping and

1421
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:13,679
they didn't know the difference in the

1422
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:15,449
14 or the 18 that was the one that kind

1423
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,399
of fits right over the tip of my pinky

1424
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:19,710
finger that's the 18 millimeter joint

1425
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:22,619
then we went a little smaller we went to

1426
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,690
14 millimeter joints 14 millimeter is

1427
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:26,940
about the size of Round of a Bic pen

1428
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:28,740
without the cap so if you can just fit

1429
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:31,619
your big pen in there that's probably a

1430
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:33,929
14 millimeter a joint there you got a 14

1431
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:36,088
millimeter male or female joint then

1432
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:37,829
everybody wanted to go smaller everybody

1433
00:49:36,088 --> 00:49:39,838
thought that a little tiny teeny tiny

1434
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:40,889
rig was best so people started going

1435
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:43,529
with 10 millimeter

1436
00:49:40,889 --> 00:49:45,239
those are really tiny a pen won't fit in

1437
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,040
there you got to clean that step-down

1438
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:50,459
stem out with a q-tip if you want to

1439
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:51,929
clean it so we evolved from 18 to 14 to

1440
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,269
10 and then I think most of the people

1441
00:49:51,929 --> 00:49:56,669
went back to a 10 to a 14 is about where

1442
00:49:54,269 --> 00:49:58,619
we stayed the 10 got clogged up and you

1443
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:00,480
can't take a giant dab off a 10 mil rig

1444
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:02,760
in my opinion someone's gonna argue with

1445
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,030
me but I don't like doing it I'd rather

1446
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:08,010
have a 14 that's my preferred size 18

1447
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:09,660
that's not bad you just get a lot of air

1448
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:10,859
flow a little restriction on the air

1449
00:50:09,659 --> 00:50:13,440
flow is not bad

1450
00:50:10,858 --> 00:50:16,049
but I don't want that 10 mil so we went

1451
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,119
from 18 to 14 to 10 I think that kind of

1452
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:21,330
covers a lot of the evolution of rigs

1453
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:24,329
you guys rigs can be anywhere from $30

1454
00:50:21,329 --> 00:50:26,460
to $30,000 I've seen a hundred and one

1455
00:50:24,329 --> 00:50:28,230
thousand dollar rig before so get one

1456
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,150
suit to you don't be out there trying to

1457
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:31,679
impress people with your rig get what

1458
00:50:30,150 --> 00:50:33,960
works this rig I'm hitting out of right

1459
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:35,429
now was a hundred and fifty dollars to a

1460
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,150
lot of people you're gonna say holy [ __ ]

1461
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:37,649
that's expensive

1462
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:39,119
a lot of people are out there gonna go

1463
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:40,019
really bro that's all you're smoking out

1464
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,260
of your Rasta Jack

1465
00:50:40,019 --> 00:50:45,929
150 man yeah it works perfectly this rig

1466
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,640
has a perfect perk inside of it I like

1467
00:50:45,929 --> 00:50:49,679
the way it percolates I like the way it

1468
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:50,969
fits on my face it's comfortable I like

1469
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,769
holding it I like the way it goes in my

1470
00:50:50,969 --> 00:50:54,089
hand the way it fits to my hand to my

1471
00:50:52,769 --> 00:50:56,280
face when I'm dabbing I don't have to

1472
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:58,410
reach awkwardly I like this rig it

1473
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,730
doesn't splash in my mouth get a rig

1474
00:50:58,409 --> 00:51:01,829
that's comfortable for you don't buy

1475
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:03,329
something to impress your friends don't

1476
00:51:01,829 --> 00:51:04,469
get something that splashes water up in

1477
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:05,849
your mouth don't get something that you

1478
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:07,259
got to get all cross-eyed trying to take

1479
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:10,409
a hit out of get a rig that's

1480
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:11,460
comfortable for you one more thing I

1481
00:51:10,409 --> 00:51:14,069
want to rant on and then we're gonna

1482
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:15,960
wrap up this hour-long 710 episode of

1483
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:18,059
this podcast you guys a lot of people

1484
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,480
ask me what temp do you set your email

1485
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:23,219
at I like to set my temp on my email at

1486
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:25,380
what works for me I can't make a

1487
00:51:23,219 --> 00:51:27,239
recommendation for you because you've

1488
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:29,970
got a different unit than me you've got

1489
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:33,149
a different box that box is sending a

1490
00:51:29,969 --> 00:51:34,980
frequency up that cable to that coil to

1491
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:36,750
the top of your nail there's no way that

1492
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,449
that box knows what the temperature is

1493
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:41,340
on the top of your nail so setting that

1494
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:43,289
number on your box is just like setting

1495
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:45,180
the number of volume on your car stereo

1496
00:51:43,289 --> 00:51:47,369
you find what it sounds really good I

1497
00:51:45,179 --> 00:51:49,500
know that in my car stereo about 2425

1498
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:51,839
sounds pretty nice when I heard start

1499
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,280
hitting 26 it gets kind of crackling 27

1500
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,860
28 it sounds like [ __ ] it's not even

1501
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,750
worth going there so I rock about 23 24

1502
00:51:55,860 --> 00:51:59,460
all the time find where your dab

1503
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:02,699
temperature is comfortable with your dab

1504
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:05,130
nail maybe you got to go to 500 maybe at

1505
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:06,989
500 the dabs not melting properly maybe

1506
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:08,309
you got to go to 600 maybe at 6 it's

1507
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:10,769
still not going maybe you got to go to

1508
00:52:08,309 --> 00:52:13,170
700 maybe around 7 or 800 it starts to

1509
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:14,820
burn right where you want it dial it in

1510
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:16,200
it may take you a few dabs it may cost

1511
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,600
you a couple of grams to get that email

1512
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:20,549
dialed in but I can't recommend a number

1513
00:52:18,599 --> 00:52:22,319
for you I could say start at a certain

1514
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:24,330
number and then dial up or down from

1515
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,700
there but you kind of have to dial it in

1516
00:52:24,329 --> 00:52:28,409
to the way that you like it so that's my

1517
00:52:26,699 --> 00:52:29,969
rant on dialing in your email

1518
00:52:28,409 --> 00:52:31,980
temperature we don't all have the same

1519
00:52:29,969 --> 00:52:33,629
unit we don't all have the same box we

1520
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:36,150
don't all have the same nail and we're

1521
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:37,500
not all dabbing the same stuff so dial

1522
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,930
it into the way that you like it maybe

1523
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,400
you want that dab and use a carb cap

1524
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:41,699
always use a car cap it's gonna help you

1525
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,079
out

1526
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:44,879
dial it in to where when you drop that

1527
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:46,739
dab on there it starts to melt a little

1528
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:48,360
bit and put the carb cap on there and

1529
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:50,189
give a good draw through it if you're

1530
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:52,260
not getting any smoke turn it up a

1531
00:52:50,190 --> 00:52:53,970
little bit if you're getting way too hot

1532
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,470
way too thick too fast

1533
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:57,750
down you'll figure it out it'll only

1534
00:52:55,469 --> 00:52:59,399
take a few dabs to get yourself in the

1535
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:00,869
right ballpark and then you can dial it

1536
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,970
in and get it perfect from there and

1537
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:04,440
then just remember the number here's

1538
00:53:02,969 --> 00:53:06,389
here's a quick idea that I just thought

1539
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,559
of maybe if you're dabbing and you've

1540
00:53:06,389 --> 00:53:09,569
got an email you've probably been

1541
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:11,880
dabbing off a normal nail before heat

1542
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:13,260
that nail up heat it up and then feel it

1543
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,760
with your hand and when you go that's

1544
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:17,130
where I want to be that's where I would

1545
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:19,109
normally dab get your email and plug it

1546
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:20,730
in and heat that [ __ ] up and play with

1547
00:53:19,108 --> 00:53:22,679
it put your hand up to it and when they

1548
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:24,480
feel about the same you're kind of close

1549
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:25,649
in the right ballpark right so get it to

1550
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,460
the same temperature that you would heat

1551
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:28,019
it with your torch

1552
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:29,250
and it's a different nail keep in mind

1553
00:53:28,019 --> 00:53:31,199
it's a different nail it's a different

1554
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:32,699
nail surface it could be a different

1555
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,259
kind of metal it could be one could be a

1556
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:35,669
bang or wonder what could be courts 1p

1557
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:37,200
could be glass and now you could be

1558
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:38,550
messing with a titanium

1559
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,079
email keep in mind that you're gonna

1560
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,820
have different surfaces to work with but

1561
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,230
heat went up with the torch and then

1562
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:44,789
plug in that email and dial it in and

1563
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:46,769
see if you can get them close if you can

1564
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:47,759
get that email to the familiar feeling

1565
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:49,619
of how you would do with the torch

1566
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,869
that's where you want it drop a DAB on

1567
00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:53,369
there hit it see if it works for you you

1568
00:53:51,869 --> 00:53:55,079
can always turn it up or down that's not

1569
00:53:53,369 --> 00:53:56,550
gonna be your last dab hopefully

1570
00:53:55,079 --> 00:53:57,719
hopefully you got plenty of more dabs

1571
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,300
coming your way you got plenty of time

1572
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,279
to dial it in so that's my rant on email

1573
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:04,200
temperature you guys a lot of people ask

1574
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,269
me what temp to set the email at and I

1575
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,759
really don't know to tell you because I

1576
00:54:06,269 --> 00:54:10,440
don't have your email and now that's a

1577
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:14,070
perfect segue into the next and final

1578
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:16,170
part of this podcast hot dabs versus low

1579
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,849
temp dabs a lot of people talk a lot of

1580
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:19,740
[ __ ] to me because I like to take really

1581
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:21,780
really hot dabs that's just my thing I

1582
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:23,789
take bigger dabs in the average person

1583
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,440
also I feel like to take the big dab

1584
00:54:23,789 --> 00:54:27,449
that I need I need a little extra heat

1585
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,220
when I put that oil onto the nail it

1586
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:31,108
immediately starts cooling the nail I'm

1587
00:54:29,219 --> 00:54:33,269
not using an email I like to use a

1588
00:54:31,108 --> 00:54:35,159
quartz banger I heat it with a torch so

1589
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:36,900
as soon as something hits it before

1590
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:39,868
something hits it when I quit applying

1591
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:41,519
heat it starts cooling I let it get kind

1592
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:43,619
of cooler it's still pretty hot then I

1593
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,030
put my dab on there that rapidly starts

1594
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:46,680
cooling it I've got to get my card cap

1595
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:49,080
on there and start swirling it around a

1596
00:54:46,679 --> 00:54:51,629
lot of times the nail cools before I get

1597
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:53,039
to consume all of the dab so I've got to

1598
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:54,780
go a little bit hotter that's just the

1599
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,639
way I like it when you go a little

1600
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,720
hotter you also get this little punch in

1601
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,838
the chest from it it's just a little

1602
00:54:57,719 --> 00:55:02,519
extra a lot of kids like to go a little

1603
00:55:00,838 --> 00:55:03,989
low temp they don't mind wasting a

1604
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:05,338
little bit they get a q-tip and they

1605
00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:08,339
clean out the bang or when they're done

1606
00:55:05,338 --> 00:55:10,230
that's not my style so if you like load

1607
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:12,240
dad's they see you get more flavor out

1608
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:12,929
of it I may agree with that if that's

1609
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:14,729
your thing

1610
00:55:12,929 --> 00:55:16,559
go for it if you're all about the hot

1611
00:55:14,730 --> 00:55:18,090
dad's if that's your thing go for it

1612
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,559
just don't go so hot that you cause

1613
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,870
yourself health problems you guys be

1614
00:55:19,559 --> 00:55:23,610
careful I know I joke around we talk

1615
00:55:21,869 --> 00:55:25,619
about glow ease and glow squad and we

1616
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:27,690
say red means go that's kind of an

1617
00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:30,029
exaggeration don't [ __ ] your health up

1618
00:55:27,690 --> 00:55:31,380
because of a hot dab be careful you'll

1619
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,970
notice one day you'll take too hot of a

1620
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,500
DAB you'll get you'll get in a hurry

1621
00:55:32,969 --> 00:55:35,849
you'll get impatient you'll heat it up

1622
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,960
you'll have your dab ready you'll be

1623
00:55:35,849 --> 00:55:39,150
talking and you'll go in and you'll go

1624
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,250
all [ __ ] I didn't wait it'll be so hot

1625
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:43,019
just learn to time your dad's eat it up

1626
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,820
let it cool until it's not scorching hot

1627
00:55:43,019 --> 00:55:46,920
then hit your dad when it's comfortable

1628
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:48,330
for you how you like it don't worry
