88
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:23,569
no hash that's the truth can - oh I took

89
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:25,700
a big old fat dab of glue Cinda which is

90
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,359
gorilla glue number four with Lucinda

91
00:03:25,699 --> 00:03:29,000
Williams

92
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,380
it's batter from apothecary when I say

93
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,459
batter it's kind of like it's like you

94
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:34,009
took off a little piece of cream cheese

95
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,199
or cheesecake I just cut a little bit of

96
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:37,789
piece of that off and then I like to

97
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:40,009
smoke the high cannabinoid full-spectrum

98
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:42,019
extract crystals but it's hard to get

99
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,789
them to stay on the dabber so I roll

100
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:45,409
some of the I just take the dab of the

101
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:48,349
glue Cinda and just gently roll it

102
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:50,120
across the sour Joker I can have annoyed

103
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:52,310
full-spectrum extract and it picks up a

104
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,920
few crystals for me I take a big dab of

105
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:56,180
that and now it does a really good job I

106
00:03:54,919 --> 00:03:57,589
might was like do you want another dad

107
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:59,330

concentrates I've also got some this is

113
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:12,139
called Vishnu when I picked this up out

114
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,430
at stem Beach they took it out of the

115
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:14,958
original container and put it in this

116
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,459
container for me to ask - feels okay

117
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,290
first they have to send you out in a

118
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,608
childproof container and the other

119
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:21,200
container is not childproof so I got

120
00:04:19,608 --> 00:04:23,269
this one instead I don't remember maybe

121
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:27,409

122
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:28,969

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,590
like you're gonna say something and you

127
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,610
just change your mind you're like no I'm

128
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:42,649
over here

129
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,020
alright we covered your social media we

130
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:46,370
talked about what we're smoking on

131
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:47,839
ladies and gentlemen if you pay any

132
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,910
attention to the world we're probably a

133
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,859
little bit late but let's talk a little

134
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:55,700
bit about the announcement that was made

135
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,610
by mr. Jeff Sessions that's that's the

136
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,370
point of the bonus episode folks is a

137
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:04,220
special show focused around this topic

138
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:06,319
if you follow cannabis news at all you

139
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,660
definitely heard the news that our

140
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:12,348
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has

141
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,590
rescinded the Cole memo which gave some

142
00:05:12,348 --> 00:05:16,860
legal protection to recreational

143
00:05:15,589 --> 00:05:18,560
cannabis businesses

144
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,330
in states that have legalized

145
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,069
recreational use cannabis we've said a

146
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:24,899
lot of things in just a couple of cents

147
00:05:23,069 --> 00:05:26,520
there was a lot of information there

148
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:29,068
I've got a list of kind of things that

149
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:31,378
we need to keep in mind will you briefly

150
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:34,699
explain to us the cola memo because this

151
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:39,240
all stems from the Cole memo okay so

152
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:41,400
when Obama took office there was no

153
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,650
federal guidance on state medical

154
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:48,089
marijuana or reap recreational marijuana

155
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:50,549
laws we were just sort of operating in

156
00:05:48,089 --> 00:05:54,028
the face of federal law and waiting to

157
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:59,430
see what happened to pieces of

158
00:05:54,028 --> 00:06:03,079
legislation have evolved since then one

159
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:05,819
of which is the Cole memo Cole was

160
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:09,329
Attorney General for a while under Obama

161
00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:11,580
and he wrote a memo basically to all of

162
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:14,008
his federal attorney general prosecutors

163
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,709
I think there's like 93 or 100 of them

164
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,759
or something around the u.s. saying if

165
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:23,519
you operate in a district that covers a

166
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,650
legal marijuana state here are some

167
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,439
guidelines for federal enforcement

168
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:31,049
don't bother wasting money if the

169
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,968
business is following state law instead

170
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:39,418
focus on diversion out of state

171
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:42,300
diversion to minors shenanigans with

172
00:06:39,418 --> 00:06:43,769
banking rules and regulations that sort

173
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,629
of thing there were eight points to the

174
00:06:43,769 --> 00:06:50,250
Cole memo you can pull this up if you'd

175
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:52,439
like but basically it's the the thin

176
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:55,978
little paper shield the legal marijuana

177
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:59,039
industry has been using to really thrive

178
00:06:55,978 --> 00:07:01,258
coast to coast it was the federal

179
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,050
document the industry would look to and

180
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:06,150
point to to say we're doing the best we

181
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:10,110
can trying to comply with what the feds

182
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:12,329
want to see out illegal marijuana it's

183
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:15,629
what states that have passed legal

184
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:19,109
marijuana have used to kind of guide

185
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:21,210
their own rules and regulations it's

186
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,629
part of the reason Colorado right now is

187
00:07:21,209 --> 00:07:25,918
really going after the medical market

188
00:07:23,629 --> 00:07:27,680
it's because our legislatures have

189
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:31,788
decided that

190
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,220
medical marijuana loopholes are feeding

191
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:36,500
that gray and black market out-of-state

192
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,139
diversion and that's one of the Cole

193
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:41,449
memo points that really brings down

194
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:44,389
federal intervention this when stuff's

195
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:46,879
going out of state and so the Cole memo

196
00:07:44,389 --> 00:07:49,519
was it's literally just that it's a memo

197
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,399
it's not a law that was voted on or

198
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:57,049
passed it's not part of any official set

199
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:59,569
of rules it's just an official guideline

200
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,460
basically for the federal enforcement of

201
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,079
marijuana laws couple of bosses talked

202
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:05,870
and said hey that employee sucks watch

203
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,159
him cuz no note made or there was a note

204
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,050
there's a note between two employees

205
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,870
yeah I mean dude it's but it was it's

206
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:15,590
not official it wasn't there was a note

207
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:18,788
I'm not an email kind of well it went

208
00:08:15,589 --> 00:08:23,569
out in a very official way it was

209
00:08:18,788 --> 00:08:26,649
released as how the Obama administration

210
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:29,360
would choose to spend federal resources

211
00:08:26,649 --> 00:08:31,159
coast-to-coast there's a limited amount

212
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,560
of money that the feds have to do

213
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,229
anything there's a limited number of

214
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:38,569
people in man-hours and they can't go

215
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:40,879
after everybody who's breaking every

216
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,660
rule and so they have to pick and choose

217
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:47,588
and yes it would be easy for states

218
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:49,819
federal prosecutors to just round up

219
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:52,790
large numbers of legal marijuana

220
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:55,520
employees and say like look at me

221
00:08:52,789 --> 00:08:56,958
they're breaking federal law but that

222
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,458
wouldn't be a good use of their time

223
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:02,989
their man-hours all of that effort money

224
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,489
courtroom time all of that could go to

225
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,649
things like an interstate sex

226
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:08,240
trafficking ring but instead you went

227
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:10,250
after the stores that were following

228
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,850
state rules like that's a bad idea it

229
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,470
was just a memo that said don't bother

230
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:17,690
this is why if you've been listening to

231
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,329
the show for a while especially leading

232
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:22,100
up to last year's election I really

233
00:09:20,328 --> 00:09:24,500
really really pushed listeners to get

234
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,350
involved get registered to vote start

235
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,059
going to local governance meetings at

236
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,430
least start reading the politics section

237
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:32,629
of the newspaper

238
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:35,659
start getting caught up on some of this

239
00:09:32,629 --> 00:09:37,939
stuff because the protections that are

240
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:39,379
in place for this massive legal

241
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,630
marijuana industry that we're building

242
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:44,230
coast-to-coast

243
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:46,149
are not set in stone one of them's a

244
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,409
memo in one of them's an amendment in a

245
00:09:46,149 --> 00:09:50,139
spending bill and we'll talk about that

246
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:53,069
in a little bit but the Cole memo was

247
00:09:50,139 --> 00:09:57,069
just that it was just a guidance memo

248
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:58,960
and so we've been expecting people like

249
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:01,900
me have been expecting our Attorney

250
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:06,519
General Jeff Sessions to rescind this

251
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:08,110
for months now he hates marijuana like

252
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:10,149
most people hate cancer

253
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:11,889
Jeff Merritt Jeff Sessions hates

254
00:10:10,149 --> 00:10:15,069
marijuana a little bit more than most

255
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:18,250
people hate cancer you can pull up all

256
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,110
sorts of crazy quotes from him about

257
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,809
marijuana the big one that's making the

258
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,950
rounds right now is good people don't

259
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:28,029
smoke marijuana that's one of his like

260
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,670
one-liners that he said a couple of

261
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:33,360
times and has really been picked up and

262
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:36,879
reposted Colorado is a bad person

263
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,980
so the Cole memo basically said don't

264
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,539
spend money on bothering cannabis

265
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,580
businesses if the business is doing

266
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:44,439
things legitimately legit let him keep

267
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,330
doing their thing refocus your fund

268
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:48,190
energy and energy on other things Mike

269
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,930
decided to go with sex trafficking on

270
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,870
the highway yeah

271
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:55,779
no interstate not on the interstate okay

272
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,460
anyway Mike wants you to clean up the

273
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:59,289
sex trafficking which makes sense do

274
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,600
that stop busting pot heads work on

275
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:03,189
prostitution rings and the child slavery

276
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,700
and child sex trafficking that's

277
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,210
terrible

278
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:09,850
way more harm in that fix that so this

279
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,980
basically protected the marijuana

280
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:14,200
industry but it wasn't a rule or a law

281
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:15,430
it was just hey let's not [ __ ] with them

282
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,200
let's spend our money somewhere else

283
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:18,219
Mike says that there's more to that

284
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,040
we're gonna that we're gonna talk about

285
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:23,410
in a minute but that is the gist of the

286
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,870
Cole memo that sets us up to go to the

287
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:27,429
next step of what happened this [ __ ]

288
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:30,700
named Jeff Sessions gets involved in our

289
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:32,439
government and then he says no more Cole

290
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:34,480
memo [ __ ] those weed heads

291
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,950
is that accurate to say that but

292
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,019
basically came out and gave us all of

293
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:40,390
the you know he used as close to

294
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:44,710
terminology to that is he's he's allowed

295
00:11:40,389 --> 00:11:48,429
to like I said he really hates cannabis

296
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:51,720
in all forms for all reasons as far as

297
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:53,589
he's concerned this is an evil plot

298
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,980
perpetrated

299
00:11:53,590 --> 00:12:01,200
with the goal of destroying America and

300
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:03,940
he's really invested in reversing

301
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,350
marijuana policy coast-to-coast back to

302
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:12,700
about 1990 look that's his sweet spot in

303
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:14,379
marijuana policy no one really wants to

304
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,990
see that other than him and a handful of

305
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:19,269
hardcore anti pop people right they all

306
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:21,310
live in the same house so this week he

307
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:24,220
came out and said we're gonna go ahead

308
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:29,588
and officially rescind or cancel this

309
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:32,769
memo and that federal prosecutors will

310
00:12:29,589 --> 00:12:35,110
now go back to following just federal

311
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:36,789
law as written when it comes to the

312
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:40,539
enforcement of the Controlled Substances

313
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:45,819
Act and quote like that was basically

314
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:48,939
his directive and this had a lot of kind

315
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:50,890
of immediate effects but not the ones

316
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:53,950
that the anti-pot crowd has been hoping

317
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:56,169
for so that's what I've got written is

318
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,570
what happens next the anti pot crowd

319
00:12:56,169 --> 00:12:59,979
hopes that Trump waves a flag the army

320
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,080
comes in they kick down the dispensary

321
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,580
door they arrest us they detain us they

322
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,129
put us in FEMA camps they come to the

323
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,230
grow they clean up I roll a couple of

324
00:13:06,129 --> 00:13:11,320
posts where they're like why isn't the

325
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:13,180
DEA arresting people yeah from that

326
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,470
crowd and that's that's not at all

327
00:13:13,179 --> 00:13:15,729
what's gonna happen so if you were

328
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,480
wondering if that's what's gonna happen

329
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,029
next

330
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:25,060
that's not what not yeah what's gonna

331
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:28,419
happen next this is kind of an attack or

332
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:30,699
a swipe aimed at investors um

333
00:13:28,419 --> 00:13:32,229
California was just about to just came

334
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,310
online on Monday and I think this

335
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,110
happened Wednesday or Thursday so uh all

336
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:40,029
of the people who were waiting to see

337
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:43,629
how the rollout of California's legal

338
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:44,919
marijuana business went before really

339
00:13:43,629 --> 00:13:47,470
jumping in with both feet

340
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:49,059
investment-wise have now had somebody

341
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,959
from the federal government say you

342
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:55,719
might not want to and likely one of the

343
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,528
immediate repercussions of the this move

344
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,440
by attorney general sessions is that

345
00:13:58,528 --> 00:14:06,009
investment in newly emerging marijuana

346
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,360
markets is gonna be a lot slower for

347
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:09,730
California this is a

348
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,039
especially kind of problematic because

349
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:15,490
of how their rollout is scheduled to

350
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:18,939
progress huge amounts of California have

351
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:22,329
passed bans on legal marijuana

352
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:26,220
businesses until the state rolls out

353
00:14:22,328 --> 00:14:29,229
rules and regs and spells out what local

354
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,600
municipalities can weigh in on and then

355
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:34,570
the local area will pass their rules and

356
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,190
then they'll allow the industry and so

357
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:37,870
we've only hit that first step yet

358
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,720
California said here's what we're gonna

359
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,240
require and that's just now starting to

360
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,070
come online a few areas in California

361
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:47,139
have already jumped on it and said we're

362
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,600
gonna allow this from day one they've

363
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:52,208
already got played licensing protocol in

364
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,399
place other areas have decided to wait a

365
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:56,919
year to before they jump into the

366
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,509
rollout in all of those areas now are

367
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,309
gonna be facing a very different

368
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:02,289
investment market than they would

369
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:05,919
otherwise and that's sort of the point

370
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:09,069
the anti pot group project Sam their

371
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,439
head Kevin Sabet this is what he pushed

372
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,680
for and why he wanted to take some of

373
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,000
the money support out and it looks like

374
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,569
that might have already started to

375
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,100
happen

376
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:19,750
oh yeah wouldn't you be scared if

377
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:24,459
they're like hey you're not protected

378
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:27,429
anymore yes and no that type of money we

379
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:29,439
didn't have protection now we didn't

380
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:33,429
really have protection to begin with we

381
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,010
had a memo and honestly folks you guys

382
00:15:33,429 --> 00:15:39,689
work in all sorts of different fields

383
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:42,669
I'm sure listeners memo means memo

384
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:46,300
across industries in the same way like

385
00:15:42,669 --> 00:15:49,419
when you get a memo it's it's not like

386
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:52,359
an update to the official company

387
00:15:49,419 --> 00:15:54,009
employee handbook even it's just a memo

388
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,930
saying like hey quit leaving your lunch

389
00:15:54,009 --> 00:15:57,819
in the fridge for two weeks until it

390
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:58,659
rots quit playing Nickelback in the trim

391
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,329
room right

392
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:03,338
no more naps at lunch cuz nobody wakes

393
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:06,039
up on time that kind of that's memo

394
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,750
worthy kind of guidance and that's what

395
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:10,120
this was it was a memo it was an

396
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,470
official governmental memo from the

397
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,720
Attorney General of the United States

398
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,589
but

399
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,110
it was still just a memo and so the

400
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:22,259
amount of protection it gave us was

401
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:25,740
really minimal it was not at all

402
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,269
permanent and a lot of people like me

403
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,639
have really continued to push the

404
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:31,188
cannabis community to get involved and

405
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,769
really push our local elected

406
00:16:31,188 --> 00:16:36,778
representatives to move our protections

407
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,610
into something that is permanent we need

408
00:16:36,778 --> 00:16:40,350
to change federal law there's no reason

409
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,889
cannabis should be listed as a Schedule

410
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:45,750
one narcotic alongside heroin there's no

411
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,938
reason we should have federal

412
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:51,389
prosecutors worried about marijuana

413
00:16:47,938 --> 00:16:54,778
period if this was legal lots of things

414
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:57,269
would be better and different but to get

415
00:16:54,778 --> 00:17:01,889
that change made we need mass support

416
00:16:57,269 --> 00:17:05,000
from the public and that's kind of the

417
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:08,009
other thing that's happening right now

418
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,369
Monday morning legal cannabis wasn't

419
00:17:08,009 --> 00:17:14,038
under attack this memo was in place no

420
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:16,048
one was talking about it last week jeff

421
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:20,879
sessions rescinded a whole bunch of

422
00:17:16,048 --> 00:17:22,470
memos rolling back Obama era guidance

423
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,689
policies on a bunch of different stuff

424
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:29,640
and this wasn't included which kind of

425
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:34,830
gave California a nice little shot in

426
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:37,559
the arm but it was never permanent but

427
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:39,869
neither was like there was no attack

428
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:44,158
going on and so there was no sense of

429
00:17:39,869 --> 00:17:46,048
urgency to rally support for and in the

430
00:17:44,159 --> 00:17:49,080
couple of days since this announcements

431
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:51,599
come out and that the Cole memo was

432
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:53,548
rescinded officially we've seen a huge

433
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,250
amount of galvanization across the

434
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:57,720
industry from coast to coast there's

435
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,038
been a couple of really cool things that

436
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:04,140
have happened locally with legislators

437
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,629
from both sides of the aisle Republican

438
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,259
Democrat I mean hardcore Trump voters so

439
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,510
like weights

440
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:10,980
you said states rights they're jumping

441
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:13,529
ship and all of a sudden they're willing

442
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,819
to work with people across the aisle who

443
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:18,149
they didn't want anything to do with on

444
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:20,009
Monday morning because this is an attack

445
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:23,970
on something a whole lot of us have come

446
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:25,558
to see is a great idea in watching

447
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,429
everybody sort of coalesce and come

448
00:18:25,558 --> 00:18:29,190
together has been

449
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:30,570
really kind of encouraging this week it

450
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,879
has been neat watching everybody post

451
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:34,798
the [ __ ] sessions videos or a picture of

452
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,628
themselves session for sessions that has

453
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,970
been fun to see that support already

454
00:18:36,628 --> 00:18:43,079
there's a couple of I'm sure there's a

455
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:44,759
petition or three on change.org already

456
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,449
there are a couple of really easy things

457
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:49,230
you can do

458
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,740
I noticed the hour slash trees forum on

459
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:55,860
reddit one of the top posts immediately

460
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:58,019
was a super easy format page for

461
00:18:55,859 --> 00:19:01,258
figuring out who your local electric

462
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:01,859
representatives are in the House or the

463
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:04,919
Senate

464
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:07,378
how to contact them and then they evey

465
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,480
even gave you a couple of paragraphs if

466
00:19:07,378 --> 00:19:11,069
you're not the type of person who wants

467
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,409
to sit down and write a letter to your

468
00:19:11,069 --> 00:19:16,378
Congressman that gave you a real simple

469
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:18,119
lesson saying hey Jeff sessions did this

470
00:19:16,378 --> 00:19:21,240
this is unacceptable

471
00:19:18,118 --> 00:19:24,319
I support legalization please do this in

472
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:27,028
this to keep those protections in place

473
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:31,408
and then it's autofills in your name

474
00:19:27,028 --> 00:19:34,859
it's super easy to do there's a couple

475
00:19:31,409 --> 00:19:38,249
of different groups that have formed to

476
00:19:34,859 --> 00:19:40,079
help bring out elected reps in different

477
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:43,139
elected officials at all levels that are

478
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,699
supporting legalization and most of

479
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:47,819
these people who were four five years

480
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,200
ago couldn't give a [ __ ] it wasn't an

481
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,118
issue on their radar they weren't

482
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,340
willing to talk about it in public and

483
00:19:51,118 --> 00:19:58,439
now they're out front fighting for us

484
00:19:55,339 --> 00:20:01,378
locally in Colorado

485
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,808
this basically means nothing practically

486
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:06,388
for the industry our industry is

487
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:08,099
established I'm sure there's plenty of

488
00:20:06,388 --> 00:20:10,648
companies looking for investors to

489
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:12,028
expand and whatnot but for the most part

490
00:20:10,648 --> 00:20:14,489
we're here and we've been it worked for

491
00:20:12,028 --> 00:20:16,349
a while now so I actually wrote down

492
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:18,359
that I wouldn't be worried until that

493
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:20,398
one rogue cop in California starts doing

494
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,439
raids or the DEA starts making waves in

495
00:20:20,398 --> 00:20:23,758
California I completely feel the

496
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,169
California would be first because

497
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,970
they're rolling out new laws so the

498
00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:29,249
media coverage has them in the spotlight

499
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:31,589
and they are not as well established and

500
00:20:29,249 --> 00:20:32,850
regulated as Colorado that was something

501
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:35,939
that I had actually written down as a

502
00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:38,339
note well what I mean basically that the

503
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,700
process for in federal enforcement would

504
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:41,500
be the

505
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,480
Attorney General tells like his

506
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,700
assistant attorney generals to go do it

507
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,788
and then they contact local law

508
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,700
enforcement and start doing it so for

509
00:20:48,788 --> 00:20:53,470
Colorado our US Attorney's name is Bob

510
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:56,409
Troyer

511
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,870
and he's covers the district of Colorado

512
00:20:56,409 --> 00:21:00,669
is what they call his district and he

513
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:02,138
came out like five minutes after the

514
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:04,870
news that this was getting rescinded

515
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:08,798
saying this means zero change in policy

516
00:21:04,869 --> 00:21:12,548
for his office so the day after this big

517
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,319
announcement came out he expects no

518
00:21:12,548 --> 00:21:16,058
change in what he does every day

519
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,950
and right now one of the things he

520
00:21:16,058 --> 00:21:21,398
doesn't do is mess with legal cannabis

521
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:24,580
businesses in any way he's happy to

522
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:26,500
prosecute if somebody says hey this

523
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:28,898
legal marijuana business is not fully

524
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,898
playing by the rules they're breaking

525
00:21:28,898 --> 00:21:33,969
this ruler that rule he might take

526
00:21:31,898 --> 00:21:35,859
interest then but he's certainly not

527
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:39,339
taking interest in anybody following but

528
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:41,678
following the rules to top it off our

529
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:44,379
state elected Attorney General cynthia

530
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:46,600
coffman has come out saying not only

531
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:48,730
this her office not interested about

532
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:50,798
prosecuting marijuana crimes in Colorado

533
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:52,450
when it's someone who's following the

534
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,759
rules or illegal business following the

535
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,200
rules she said she's gonna fight the

536
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:58,089
feds if they come in and try to toy with

537
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,159
this that's pretty awesome yep and this

538
00:21:58,089 --> 00:22:02,079
is someone who during the run-up to

539
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,000
legalization was on board with governor

540
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,439
Hickenlooper saying they're not

541
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,480
comfortable with this decision by

542
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,710
Colorado voters they don't support

543
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:14,740
legalization they're worried about

544
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:17,710
possible calm consequences of

545
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,808
legalization and now here we are five

546
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:22,659
years later having lived with

547
00:22:19,808 --> 00:22:25,720
legalization and these people are out

548
00:22:22,659 --> 00:22:29,169
fighting for us that's one of the things

549
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,089
we didn't have before the Cole memo this

550
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:33,580
many Americans weren't living with

551
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:36,459
dispensaries weren't living with late

552
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:39,849
licensed grows weren't living with I

553
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:42,519
mean [ __ ] there's 64,000 meed badged

554
00:22:39,849 --> 00:22:43,959
people across Colorado I'm not saying

555
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:45,669
every single one of them's currently

556
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,440
employed in the legal industry but most

557
00:22:45,669 --> 00:22:52,060
of them are Wyatt's have a badge

558
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:56,200
they're not cheap then we didn't have

559
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:58,720
all that and now we do local elected

560
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:01,299
officials who were really worried about

561
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:04,500
legalization have now had five years to

562
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:07,539
see that the marijuana was always there

563
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,420
while we've done is change where adults

564
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:12,730
buy it and that's been really good for

565
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,900
places like Pueblo I just heated up that

566
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,220
nail and it was ready to hit but you

567
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,920
just brought a good thought to my head

568
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:19,360
do you think that now the government

569
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,130
excuse me government and law enforcement

570
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,659
now that they see how many people go to

571
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,460
dispensaries do you think they realize

572
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:28,630
how much black market cannabis was being

573
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:30,430
bought and sold that's one of the things

574
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,380
that cracks me up about the anti pot

575
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,870
community is they have no concept of

576
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:37,390
what happened before legalization I mean

577
00:23:34,869 --> 00:23:39,099
out of sight was really out of my it was

578
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:41,200
known it was happening it just wasn't

579
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:45,459
but I mean all of it was there the DEA

580
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,870
puts the u.s. buying like sixty forty to

581
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:50,769
sixty billion dollars worth of marijuana

582
00:23:46,869 --> 00:23:53,409
a year back in like ninety nine two

583
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:55,809
thousand for that area and it's not like

584
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:58,150
that markets got any smaller so if you

585
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,619
think of that nationally and you do the

586
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,519
math I was playing with these numbers at

587
00:23:59,619 --> 00:24:06,189
home earlier if you take sixty billion I

588
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:10,150
in sales annually and you look at

589
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:13,029
Colorado's market we did 1.2 billion in

590
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:15,490
one year and it took about sixty four

591
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:17,049
thousand of us to get that done if you

592
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:18,930
do the math that works out to around

593
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:22,659
four million Americans coast-to-coast

594
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:24,700
who were involved in some level with the

595
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:27,160
illicit black market for marijuana four

596
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,110
million people I mean it takes a lot of

597
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,240
people to do six to billion dollars

598
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:33,849
worth of business but it was all just

599
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,319
out of sight it was just two guys

600
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:37,359
meeting in the back of a parking lot

601
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,589
real quick they're probably old friends

602
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,479
who saw each other on the highway and

603
00:24:38,589 --> 00:24:43,299
stopped to say hello

604
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,880
it doesn't look like a marijuana sale

605
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:48,519
going down when someone walks into a

606
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:50,230
dispensary it's pretty clear that

607
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,849
they're there to buy marijuana or at

608
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,370
least to check out what legal marijuana

609
00:24:51,849 --> 00:24:56,469
looks like at the weed store like

610
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:58,119
there's no question what it is so it's

611
00:24:56,470 --> 00:24:59,389
more visible now but there's certainly

612
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:03,288
not more

613
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:06,348
I never go just a look I know people

614
00:25:03,288 --> 00:25:09,499
that do though I'm I've got one foot in

615
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:12,108
both worlds and so I know a lot of

616
00:25:09,499 --> 00:25:13,999
people who are still nervous about going

617
00:25:12,108 --> 00:25:16,489
to visit a legal dispensary because

618
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:18,919
their profession would frown on it or

619
00:25:16,489 --> 00:25:22,069
something like something similar but uh

620
00:25:18,919 --> 00:25:25,129
a lot of people people that are paying

621
00:25:22,069 --> 00:25:27,468
attention they see that we have far less

622
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:30,019
people trying to sell pot locally to

623
00:25:27,469 --> 00:25:32,239
their friends to make site income we see

624
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:34,489
the benefit of moving all of those sales

625
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:36,769
into a legal market and no one wants to

626
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:38,569
go back to what it was like before this

627
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:40,638
a lot of us growers that were growing

628
00:25:38,569 --> 00:25:42,739
before so much legalization we joke

629
00:25:40,638 --> 00:25:43,248
about oh it's pointless to grow weed at

630
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:45,048
home now

631
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:47,028
it doesn't even there's no reason to

632
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:49,098
grow unless you're growing strictly for

633
00:25:47,028 --> 00:25:51,169
yourself for medical cannabis if he used

634
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:53,868
to be a black market grower there's no

635
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:55,669
point in that it's gone cannabis is so

636
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:57,019
cheap at the dispensary there are so

637
00:25:55,669 --> 00:25:59,419
many different things at the dispensary

638
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:01,308
there are so many dispensaries but

639
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:02,229
there's no need for a home black market

640
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:05,209
grower anymore

641
00:26:02,229 --> 00:26:06,348
you got to wait for him to be there no

642
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:07,729
need for that just go to the dispensary

643
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:09,558
the doors open and there pretty girls

644
00:26:07,729 --> 00:26:10,940
working there to go talk to you don't

645
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:12,168
have to go sit on some dudes couch while

646
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,548
he plays video games and deal with this

647
00:26:12,169 --> 00:26:15,169
dirty dog you don't have to sit in a

648
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:16,519
parking lot and wait for anybody you

649
00:26:15,169 --> 00:26:18,619
walk into the store some pretty girl

650
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,358
goes hey then she shows you a bunch of

651
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:22,638
great we need to see all kinds of good

652
00:26:20,358 --> 00:26:24,949
jars of weed do everybody's theory

653
00:26:22,638 --> 00:26:27,588
before we got to see it in practice was

654
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:29,749
that the taxes that everyone was gonna

655
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:32,298
win pose we're gonna jack the price up

656
00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:34,129
to the point where the black market

657
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:37,249
could just easily undercut the legal

658
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:40,878
market and that work for a minute is

659
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:44,450
Colorado's market emerged but at this

660
00:26:40,878 --> 00:26:46,488
point in time no one wants to deal with

661
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:50,569
the hassle I mean you might be able to

662
00:26:46,489 --> 00:26:53,179
save a few bucks on your ounce buying it

663
00:26:50,569 --> 00:26:55,098
from the black market but I mean your

664
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:58,669
times were some it takes time to call

665
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:59,928
set that up go over hang out dispensary

666
00:26:58,669 --> 00:27:03,049
weed comes with a couple of other things

667
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:04,999
yep basically a lot for you a lot for

668
00:27:03,048 --> 00:27:06,679
your basement weed is great nothing

669
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,838
wrong with it dispensary weed comes with

670
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,419
a lab test that lab test includes a

671
00:27:08,838 --> 00:27:12,740
microbial and yeast and contaminant test

672
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:14,809
that tells you there's nothing

673
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,359
key in that herb it also comes with a

674
00:27:14,808 --> 00:27:19,819
THC potency test that tells you how

675
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,979
strong that herb is it also comes with a

676
00:27:19,819 --> 00:27:23,869
pesticide residual testing to tell you

677
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,058
if there are any pesticides in it if

678
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:28,369
they find any problems in any of those

679
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:31,460
tests that batch of cannabis is pulled

680
00:27:28,369 --> 00:27:32,869
and re-examined and Aria reassess what

681
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,880
can be done with that product if he can

682
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:37,629
be used for concentrates maybe they'll

683
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,730
do that sometimes product is destroyed

684
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:43,220
because it does not pass these tests for

685
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:44,480
some people if you have some sort of

686
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,429
lung disease I don't know even know what

687
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,170
a lung disease might be a heart disease

688
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,269
a lung disease a throat disease a mouth

689
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,279
disease an autoimmune disease if you're

690
00:27:50,269 --> 00:27:55,190
compromised in any way that lab test

691
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:57,889
means a [ __ ] lot to you yep that lab

692
00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:00,200
test is way worth the extra tax you

693
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,630
might pay at the dispensary yep you get

694
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,150
lab testing you get product consistency

695
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,590
you get a selection and a level of

696
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:08,480
service that's just not possible with

697
00:28:06,589 --> 00:28:10,129
the black-market and the person inside

698
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,110
the dispensary with the gun is a

699
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:13,760
security guard we've asked him to be

700
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:15,199
there with a gun right wherever else

701
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,960
you're going to get your herb I don't

702
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:24,230
know who's got a gun there it's I mean

703
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:27,440
it's substantially safer the I mean the

704
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:32,089
black market comes with a number of

705
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,070
really nasty just necessities the every

706
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:37,519
decision made in the black market is

707
00:28:34,069 --> 00:28:39,889
based on economics period where does the

708
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:43,039
black market produce the product

709
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,990
wherever it's economical to who handles

710
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,210
the product whoever it's economical to

711
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:49,490
who moves you know who sells it whoever

712
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:52,400
it's economical to who does the ID

713
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:57,200
checks [ __ ] no one no one who pays

714
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:59,630
taxes no there's no lab testing when

715
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,970
product molds out or gets coated in PM

716
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:03,650
there's all sorts of stuff that's super

717
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,960
commonplace in the black market to

718
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:08,990
maintain the highest profit ratio

719
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,259
possible on any product that's produced

720
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:14,509
in the legal market

721
00:29:11,259 --> 00:29:17,900
marijuana's grown inappropriately zone

722
00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:20,960
parcels of land by people who have

723
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,940
passed background checks before they're

724
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,009
even allowed to apply for the jobs in

725
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,440
the industry we had a Department of

726
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:27,569
Agriculture

727
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,038
culture inspection yep and the lady was

728
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:31,138
impressed with my knowledge in the

729
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,210
Department of Agricultural culture

730
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:35,729
Department of Agriculture rules in our

731
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,860
medical marijuana facility if I taught

732
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:39,659
the Department of Agriculture lady a few

733
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,719
things and she was quite impressed uh

734
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:44,278
and it turns out my uh my certification

735
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,079
that I've gotten never expires

736
00:29:44,278 --> 00:29:48,628
I've got like the highest thing you can

737
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,189
get right basically took the class that

738
00:29:48,628 --> 00:29:51,689
the people that work at the Department

739
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:53,460
of Agriculture take before they go to

740
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:57,750
inspections it was a really cool little

741
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:59,669
discovery yeah yeah but there's a lot of

742
00:29:57,750 --> 00:30:03,089
things that come with legalization that

743
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:05,519
one by one have slowly won over huge

744
00:30:03,089 --> 00:30:06,959
chunks of the public sorry folks I

745
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:08,159
thought I'd turn that ringer off I think

746
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,389
you turn it back on when he thought you

747
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,070
turned it off um it's not just lab

748
00:30:12,388 --> 00:30:17,668
testing and like where the products

749
00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:20,548
grown or who gets to sell it but voters

750
00:30:17,669 --> 00:30:22,740
finally get a say in all of that like

751
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:24,569
Colorado's is legal and pervasive of

752
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,149
marijuana market is exists anywhere on

753
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:29,730
the planet and there's still a majority

754
00:30:27,148 --> 00:30:32,668
of the state whose banned our businesses

755
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,319
yeah a lot of them are starting to

756
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:36,240
rethink that decision because they've

757
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,398
seen Pueblo and Trinidad in a couple of

758
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,128
other places that have been like

759
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:44,819
economic punchlines around Colorado for

760
00:30:41,128 --> 00:30:47,278
decades really start to thrive again

761
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,869
because we allow this industry it

762
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:50,609
brought a new wave of investment to

763
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:52,288
Southern Colorado and really got us back

764
00:30:50,609 --> 00:30:54,000
on our feet it's really changed around

765
00:30:52,288 --> 00:30:57,179
here in the past couple of years yep

766
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,019
there's uh one of the big anti pop

767
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:03,360
people put out a list of talking points

768
00:31:00,019 --> 00:31:04,980
to all of his little disciples and one

769
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:06,928
of them is in Colorado they can't even

770
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:09,389
find construction workers the passed a

771
00:31:06,929 --> 00:31:12,980
drug test and I always laugh when I see

772
00:31:09,388 --> 00:31:15,269
that because it's wal slightly true I

773
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,829
happen to know a lot about the company

774
00:31:15,269 --> 00:31:19,079
they're talking about and the reason

775
00:31:16,829 --> 00:31:20,609
that company has trouble finding

776
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:23,878
employees is because they pay their

777
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:25,408
people [ __ ] and have for decades and

778
00:31:23,878 --> 00:31:27,359
they've always had trouble maintaining

779
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:29,759
in employment force but right now

780
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,888
Colorado's work force we've got like 2%

781
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,019
2.9 percent or 3 percent unemployment

782
00:31:31,888 --> 00:31:34,829
across the state it's as low as it's

783
00:31:34,019 --> 00:31:36,778
been in forever

784
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:38,710
the only people still looking for a job

785
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:40,960
the biggest [ __ ] of

786
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:43,480
ever met or they just relocated or they

787
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,980
just lost their job for some reason most

788
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,769
of them weren't planning for it because

789
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:51,399
right now most people are happily

790
00:31:47,769 --> 00:31:52,898
gainfully employed like these numbers

791
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:55,239
are as low as they've been since I've

792
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:56,918
lived here yeah it's not like every

793
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,079
business you go to around here you could

794
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,700
be high working at most of the business

795
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:02,949
around here will require a drug test

796
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,990
like if you drive that way in that way

797
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:06,370
it's car dealerships all those mechanics

798
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,990
and techs I bet you they get a pee test

799
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:09,729
yeah I don't know for sure but you would

800
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:13,140
assume like that's a forward I bet you

801
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:15,460
Ford piss test they're Texan stuff the

802
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:17,950
company the more likely it is to do it

803
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:20,679
because they get huge insurance

804
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:22,659
discounts for doing so we've got AT&amp;T

805
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:24,220
downtown I know damn well they pee test

806
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:25,778
you if they think you're doing something

807
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,278
stupid it's in your contract they could

808
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:29,679
pee test you whenever they want and

809
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,470
they've done it several of the jobs I

810
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,870
had before what I do now drug tested

811
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:36,339
Mike this got super random odd you've

812
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,359
got a lot of talking points written down

813
00:32:36,339 --> 00:32:38,740
I want to make sure that you get

814
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,168
everything out do you have anything you

815
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:46,990
need to to loop around on that paper

816
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:49,390
because I didn't we do we do back on the

817
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,558
tree so there are two really a couple of

818
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:55,720
really cool things that have happened

819
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:58,178
since AG sessions rescinded the Cole

820
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,860
memo and one of those things was in

821
00:32:58,179 --> 00:33:02,710
Pueblo Colorado we've got a county

822
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:07,298
commissioner named Sal face and this guy

823
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:09,970
I remember Sal when he was very on the

824
00:33:07,298 --> 00:33:13,028
fence about legal marijuana medical

825
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:16,950
marijuana rules were just starting to be

826
00:33:13,028 --> 00:33:19,898
thought about this was in like 2007 8 9

827
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:22,569
he was not at all comfortable with legal

828
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:24,639
marijuana medical marijuana I'm like a

829
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:27,009
lot of elected officials at the time he

830
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,850
was raised on anti marijuana propaganda

831
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:33,190
and we've slowly seen him emerge and

832
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:35,678
actually become the face of regulation

833
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,890
for a lot of Colorado when people think

834
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,240
marijuana rules in Colorado govern and

835
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:43,120
government in politics a lot of times

836
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,910
South who they think of the Pueblo

837
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:48,429
County Commissioners were sort of

838
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:52,390
the first set of small government people

839
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:53,950
to really get into rulemaking and I like

840
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,230
I remember this guy when he was against

841
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:59,230
his so it's really fun to see how much

842
00:33:56,230 --> 00:34:03,069
he's evolved mainly just having to see

843
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:04,509
it all like I remember begging him to go

844
00:34:03,069 --> 00:34:05,980
check out a dispensary for the first

845
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:08,619
time along with his fellow commissioners

846
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:12,490
and him just shaking my head shaking his

847
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:16,269
head at me but Friday after this news

848
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:18,428
broke Sal arranged a conference call

849
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:20,259
with a hundred elected officials from

850
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:22,119
all across the US and legal marijuana

851
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,190
States kind of getting everybody

852
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,878
galvanized and on the same page to fight

853
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:30,010
this and that was really huge

854
00:34:27,878 --> 00:34:32,319
I love seeing stuff like that and

855
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,830
there's been a couple of those incidents

856
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,000
in the last two or three days where

857
00:34:34,829 --> 00:34:38,049
honestly folks if you follow the press

858
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,800
on this you're gonna have an awesome

859
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:43,450
week this week one of the other really

860
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,220
cool things that happened is the very

861
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:48,460
next day

862
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:51,069
Vermont their Statehouse is discussing

863
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:53,110
legalization it looks like Vermont might

864
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:56,830
be I think the first if not the first

865
00:34:53,110 --> 00:35:00,610
one of the first states to pass legal

866
00:34:56,829 --> 00:35:04,239
marijuana recreational adult use no

867
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:06,760
medical card needed legalization by vote

868
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:08,589
of elected representatives in state

869
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,380
government rather than by a vote of the

870
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:14,200
people I'm just average voters the House

871
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:17,110
voted it yep so they're their House of

872
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:19,599
Representatives voted to approve home

873
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:22,000
grow in legal possession limits I think

874
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,199
it's to plants and flower in an ounce

875
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,380
possession limit if I remember right

876
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:31,689
they did that difference or the day of

877
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:33,670
this announcement they voted after the

878
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:35,829
new this news came out and they voted in

879
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:39,430
favor of legalization which I thought

880
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:41,139
was really cool I love that that's still

881
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:43,419
happening it's not a done deal in

882
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:45,969
Vermont they're Senate still needs to

883
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,579
vote in favor and then their governor

884
00:35:45,969 --> 00:35:51,669
would need to sign that into law both of

885
00:35:48,579 --> 00:35:54,279
the both their Senate and the governor

886
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:57,369
have mentioned or come out in favor of

887
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,840
this law it's not it's a dial back

888
00:35:57,369 --> 00:36:00,909
version of one that was debated

889
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:04,420
got very close to passage last year and

890
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:07,599
so it looks good for Vermont my fingers

891
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:10,180
are crossed from Vermont we got an email

892
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,980
from a listener in Vermont who made sure

893
00:36:10,179 --> 00:36:14,279
I was privy to this information and he

894
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:16,329
said I'm pulling up his email he said

895
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,950
white Mike may have hooked you up with

896
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:19,599
this knowledge already but just in case

897
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:22,119
he hasn't and then he sent me a good

898
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,980
link to it he sent me a good article so

899
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:25,089
thanks for that my friend I just wanted

900
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,170
to make sure that I mentioned that one

901
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:29,019
of our friends we have listeners in

902
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:30,670

903
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:32,980
Island we've gotten emails from I have a

904
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,900
question for our Vermont listeners if

00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,409
you're in Vermont okay so here's my

906
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,720
question

907
00:36:35,409 --> 00:36:43,029
I think the publication is called like

908
00:36:37,719 --> 00:36:46,089
VT Diggler it appears to be a newspaper

909
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:48,160
it might just be a website for people in

910
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:50,110
recovery I can't tell the difference

911
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,059
from their online presence but they've

912
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:53,920
been doing a lot of op eds for and

913
00:36:52,059 --> 00:36:55,210
against legal marijuana tweet me and

914
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:58,210
tell me what the hell that is would you

915
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:00,460
please like is it a newspaper or is it

916
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:02,619
just like an anti pot group website or

917
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:05,889
what is it so what's it called I think

918
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:08,109
it's called VT Diggler VT Diggler that

919
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:11,349
sounds like a troll page right I might

920
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:13,510
be this their logos weird it's like

921
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:16,210
letters inside diamonds inside circles

922
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,770
or some [ __ ] and so it's kind of yeah

923
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,780
and it's from Vermont well it's VT

924
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:21,519
Diggler is the Vermont Diggler and I'd

925
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,060
like to apologize to the people of

926
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,159
Vermont

927
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:26,529
one of our local anti-pot cooks is

928
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,299
started traveling to Vermont I'm some

929
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:30,820
anti pot group out there is flying her

930
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:33,430
out to spread her brand of [ __ ] eree

931
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:36,130
and I apologize for that that's

932
00:37:33,429 --> 00:37:38,949
something we let export from our area

933
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:42,039
that yeah it's not pleasant sorry for

934
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:44,619
that this email also says that if all

935
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:46,480
goes according to plan this would mean

936
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:49,059
all states touching New York would have

937
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,820
some form of decriminalization with PA

938
00:37:49,059 --> 00:37:55,539
being the exception PA gonna take a

939
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:59,170
while one of the other things I wanted

940
00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:01,719
to roll back to is the Cole memo only

941
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,960
gave you know what little protection ur

942
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:08,199
did VY provided to recreational

943
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,539
marijuana it did absolutely nothing for

944
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:11,868
medical and there's substantially more

945
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:15,349
medical marijuana

946
00:38:11,869 --> 00:38:17,630
and there are recreational the piece of

947
00:38:15,349 --> 00:38:20,298
federal legislation that governs medical

948
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:23,528
marijuana States and this is important

949
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:26,210
guys so I grabbed a pen and a sticky pad

950
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:28,248
you're gonna sneeze me I've got like

951
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:29,630
half a sneeze cookin if you start sneeze

952
00:38:28,248 --> 00:38:33,048
and I'll start ranting about something I

953
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:35,990
don't have okay so everybody's got their

954
00:38:33,048 --> 00:38:39,440
pen this is called the Rohrbacher blue

955
00:38:35,989 --> 00:38:41,899
Meyer Amendment and it's amendment to

956
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,740
the Omnibus spending the bill basically

957
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:47,740
the federal budget every year that's the

958
00:38:45,739 --> 00:38:50,929
document that gives protection to

959
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:54,348
medical marijuana businesses saying that

960
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:57,919
feds can't spend money to target medical

961
00:38:54,349 --> 00:39:00,170
marijuana businesses employees patients

962
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,960
that are operating in accordance with

963
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,789
state law it's substantially more

964
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,380
protection than we had with the Cole

965
00:39:04,789 --> 00:39:11,089
memo and it's in jeopardy right now also

966

00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:00,769
if you follow federal news you know what

987
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:04,338
I just said

988
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:06,409
if you don't basically the federal

989
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:08,480
budget was set to expire they haven't

990
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:11,118
passed the new budget and so they had to

991
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:12,920
a vote to extend the old budget and that

992
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,289
extended these protections which were

993
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,970
included in the old budget but until

994
00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:19,640
they are officially included in the new

995
00:40:16,969 --> 00:40:22,719
budget and that new budget is passed by

996
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:25,449
a vote of the House and the Senate

997
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,480
that's not official yet

998
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:31,058
so we need to urge support for both of

999
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,250
these from both sides of the aisle call

1000
00:40:31,059 --> 00:40:35,470
your elected officials email them tweet

1001
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:38,260
them they know what the Rohrbacher blue

1002
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:40,598
Meyer amendment is urge support please

1003
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:42,220
we need these protections I know you're

1004
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:43,869
not the guy to ask this question but can

1005
00:40:42,219 --> 00:40:45,639
you spell that for people so that they

1006
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:47,798
can get it good just enough to get

1007
00:40:45,639 --> 00:40:49,568
Google started okay so Rohrbacher and

1008
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:50,949
blue Meyer are named for the two people

1009
00:40:49,568 --> 00:40:54,548
who wrote it it used to be the

1010
00:40:50,949 --> 00:41:00,759
Rohrbacher far amendment its Rohrbacher

1011
00:40:54,548 --> 00:41:07,509
roh are a BAC h ER and then blue mayer

1012
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:08,650
is BL um e and a u e are i think i did

1013
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:10,510
their names down real quick from the

1014
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,769
press was furiously taking notes before

1015
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:15,520
that should get you close enough in

1016
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:17,949
google um if you google federal medical

1017
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,349
marijuana protection amendment it should

1018
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:22,028
come up to in all of those words really

1019
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:23,588
easier to spell than Rohrbacher or blue

1020
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:27,608
mayer a lot of these folks are probably

1021
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:29,440
in a cubicle or cutting concrete or in a

1022
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:31,119
garden so getting them to do that right

1023
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,220
now we're gonna have to kind of just

1024
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:36,630
hand it right to them or it might not

1025
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:38,949
happen what's the time post

1026
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:41,440
41:52 but there will be editing all

1027
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:43,269
right go to about 3540 minutes and hit

1028
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,559
play and hopefully you can get that

1029
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:46,809
piece that you need to google to find

1030
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:50,099
your local rep there you go get a hold

1031
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:53,619

1039
00:42:03,548 --> 00:42:06,579
way thanks man

1040
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:08,109
I I've been following the story really

1041
00:42:06,579 --> 00:42:09,930
closely oh yeah when this announcement

1042
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:12,730
came out I was like we got it honestly

1043
00:42:09,929 --> 00:42:14,710
people were telling me on Instagram and

1044
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:16,179
on Facebook wins Mike coming over you

1045
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:18,039
got to get Mike over for this episode of

1046
00:42:16,179 --> 00:42:20,259
Mike on what are you guys doing what's

1047
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,970
the talks Mike and I feel bad to kick

1048
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,349
this back we're gonna do it Friday I had

1049
00:42:21,969 --> 00:42:24,969
to push it back don't feel me doing

1050
00:42:23,349 --> 00:42:28,720
Saturday I had to push it back I know

1051
00:42:24,969 --> 00:42:30,899
exactly so and children first both the

1052
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:34,389
kids first up family first always yeah

1053
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,579
specially when it's the little ones this

1054
00:42:34,389 --> 00:42:38,119
is a really important topic and honestly

1055
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:41,060
this is a really

1056
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:44,839
kind of pivotal moment in history like

1057
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:48,019
politics exists on a pendulum if you

1058
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:50,030
look the longer look you take down the

1059
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:53,059
historical timeline the clearer this

1060
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:56,570
gets um things go liberal then things go

1061
00:42:53,059 --> 00:42:58,900
conservative the roaring 20s and all the

1062
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:01,730
liberalism and drinking and dancing and

1063
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:04,550
the sexual revolution that took place in

1064
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,500
the 20s was completely crushed by the

1065
00:43:04,550 --> 00:43:08,769
crash markets or the stock market crash

1066
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,230
in the 1930s and 40s

1067
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:14,119
everything reversed hard and we've seen

1068
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:16,490
that a couple of times historically this

1069
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:20,929
the sixties gave us the [ __ ] 80s

1070
00:43:16,489 --> 00:43:22,879
quick hit like disco is responsible for

1071
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:25,339
shoulder pads and suits for women all

1072
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,230
through the 80s I think marijuana has

1073
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:31,910
been moving forward as a social policy

1074
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:34,699
in a major way since 1999 all movements

1075
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:37,819
been towards legalization there's bound

1076
00:43:34,699 --> 00:43:42,250
to be at least an effort in a back swing

1077
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:44,450
and that's needed before the

1078
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:46,489
galvanization of the country and we

1079
00:43:44,449 --> 00:43:48,829
decided that no as a group we're not

1080
00:43:46,489 --> 00:43:51,679
going to go back to that and we actually

1081
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:54,289
take the next big step forward and start

1082
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,649
changing federal law and it looks like

1083
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:59,710
this idiotic move by sessions might have

1084
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,789
actually triggered that avalanche

1085
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:04,460
there's a couple of different people

1086
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:07,029
talking about this that I mean man on

1087
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:09,289
Monday this wasn't a major talking point

1088
00:44:07,030 --> 00:44:11,210
already the people who were mumbling

1089
00:44:09,289 --> 00:44:13,279
about maybe running against Trump in

1090
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:18,980
2020 are talking about legal marijuana

1091
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:23,480
protections Denver Republicans that were

1092
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:26,420
in contested races right now going into

1093
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:30,139
the next election cycle first statewide

1094
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:33,050
elections are pissed because now their

1095
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:35,809
option is come out against something the

1096
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:39,050
Trump administration is doing ie their

1097
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:42,409
own parties doing and maybe piss off

1098
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:44,340
their base or come out for marijuana and

1099
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:47,250
seem like a liberal druggie

1100
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:49,079
and that's not a conversation they

1101
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:51,179
wanted to have going into the next round

1102
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,569
of elections and now that's the

1103
00:44:51,179 --> 00:44:56,419
conversation they're all having good

1104
00:44:53,570 --> 00:45:01,080
stir that [ __ ] up yep

1105
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:03,599
if you're the donating type hop online

1106
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,630
find your representatives that are

1107
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,519
really supporting of this and send them

1108
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:10,110
one of those $4 20 cent donations let

1109
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:12,179
them know exactly why they're getting a

1110
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:14,280
few bucks from you who who said that who

1111
00:45:12,179 --> 00:45:16,289
set that for to learn 20 cent donation

1112
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,920
thing up honestly I can't remember if it

1113
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:21,480
was like Russ Belleville or Tom angle or

1114
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,559
just some putts at high times like it

1115
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:24,900
could have been anybody

1116
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:27,119
that's been going for a few months in

1117
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,030
it's not just you that have started to

1118
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,739
get a handful of those elected

1119
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:50,880
representatives for months have been

1120
00:45:31,739 --> 00:45:52,049
getting discovered on account my patreon

1121
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,210
account for the girl from her podcast

1122
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,900
but I want to spread some love also if

1123
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:59,340
you had to recommend one cannabis um

1124
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:03,000
support group or somebody that needed

1125
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:05,539
some funding where would you send $4.20

1126
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:08,099
to right now if you could pick one group

1127
00:46:05,539 --> 00:46:10,739
he went silent and started staring at

1128
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:12,509
that's not an easy question because

1129
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:18,449
there's a lot of groups doing a lot of

1130
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:20,310
good work on different fronts okay like

1131
00:46:18,449 --> 00:46:22,679
if I was only gonna make one political

1132
00:46:20,309 --> 00:46:24,480
donation period it wouldn't be for pot I

1133
00:46:22,679 --> 00:46:27,750
which is kind of [ __ ] up to say on

1134
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,329
this show but it would go not

1135
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:33,110
everything's pots not everything but if

1136
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:35,069
I was gonna make one marijuana focused

1137
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,950
contribution right now it would be one

1138
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:40,860
or two places I think I would either go

1139
00:46:37,949 --> 00:46:42,119
for normal they're the oldest said the

1140
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,470
longest they're the strongest they're

1141
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:45,839
the most organized and the best

1142
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:50,549
represented it's hard to go wrong with

1143
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:52,350
normal and I would go for Gavin Newsome

1144
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:53,760
if you're from the California area are

1145
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:54,319

1243
00:50:20,489 --> 00:50:24,449
direction that I meant hey Mike thanks

my head it's this is uh I mean this is a

1255
00:50:44,309 --> 00:50:47,190
big story with a lot of implications I

1256
00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:50,219
want to make sure we hit all the bases

1257
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:52,110

1260
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:59,670
crash after this announcement but I've

1261
00:50:56,070 --> 00:51:01,769
already fully rebounded cuz it took a

1262
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:03,659
minute for everybody to remember like oh

1263
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:08,730
yeah they call it the comb memo because

1264
00:51:03,659 --> 00:51:12,149
it was just a memo and that in reality

1265
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:13,440

00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,139
sometimes I spit into the microphone

1306
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:34,579
cover you think it doesn't smell it's

1307
00:52:33,139 --> 00:52:35,779
whatever you ate last time do you

1308
00:52:34,579 --> 00:52:37,940
remember the orange one that was here

1309
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:39,650
for like the first four months that was

1310
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,539
another guy the creepy mustache guy

1311
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,610
haunts he used to spit into it a lot

1312
00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:45,860
it's yeah whenever we break the

1313
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:50,210
microphones out I do a tentative kind of

1314
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:51,559
sniff test yeah before I get up on the

1315
00:52:50,210 --> 00:52:52,670
other side of the recording equipment I

1316
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,289
keep them over there and when people

1317
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,809
leave I just pop them out and there's a

1318
00:52:54,289 --> 00:52:58,849
reason this show sounds as good as it

1319
00:52:56,809 --> 00:53:00,889
does folks and it's because Jeff's got

1320
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:02,900
some nice equipment and sometimes pieces

1321
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:04,849
that equipment eat it eat themselves

1322
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:09,950
we haven't [ __ ] headphone amplifier

1323
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:11,150
we yeah we went through had to go to

1324
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:12,199
Guitar Center and get an upgrade

1325
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,789
eventually they looked at me like what

1326
00:53:12,199 --> 00:53:17,599
are you doing to them they'd see your

1327
00:53:13,789 --> 00:53:19,340
van pulling and just get one here's two

1328
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,079
just take two this time and when they

1329
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,789
break bring them back so though you've

1330
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:24,469
got a backup already I just upgraded

1331
00:53:22,789 --> 00:53:25,940
pieces that's all but yeah sometimes

1332
00:53:24,469 --> 00:53:27,859
[ __ ] does go wrong sometimes things

1333
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:29,389
break I pay for high-speed internet

1334
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:31,849
because uploading these large shows my

1335
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:35,449
devices don't like hash I don't I don't

1336
00:53:31,849 --> 00:53:37,159
know why they fight so much I

1337
00:53:35,449 --> 00:53:38,808
had my iphone on my computer are you can

1338
00:53:37,159 --> 00:53:41,118
stick them all to the wall and use it as

1339
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:42,769
a desk but yeah the patreon campaign you

1340
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,180
guys I use it to pay for the website the

1341
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:46,159
website does cost quite a bit of money

1342
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:47,629
every year to cover so your patreon

1343
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,548
contributions will cover the cost of my

1344
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:53,390
website you guys were kind enough to

1345
00:53:49,548 --> 00:53:54,500

thank you

1347
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,588
it does cost a little chunk of money to

1348
00:53:56,088 --> 00:53:59,838
pay for the domain name and pay for all

1349
00:53:57,588 --> 00:54:01,639
the hosting I pay for a lot of bandwidth

1350
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:03,920
because I use a lot of bandwidth on that

1351
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:05,480
[ __ ] website every episode is

1352
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,700
available like the last hundred episodes

1353
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,769
I think it's available that cost a

1354
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:11,149
little bit to host but thank you you

1355

[ __ ] yeah but that was never my goal I

1366
00:54:31,329 --> 00:54:35,119
honestly how it started I was sitting

1367
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:36,318
not how but part of how it started was I

1368
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,059
used to hang out with Maddy and Spence

1369
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,529
at their house and people would come

1370
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:40,760
through all the time and we'd smoke and

1371
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:42,048
hang out and dab and the people would be

1372
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,180
like Rasta Jeff told me this about

1373
00:54:42,048 --> 00:54:45,858
plants help me grow and I would say it

1374
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:47,179
and they would leave and then somebody

1375
00:54:45,858 --> 00:54:48,679
would come over and ask the same damn

1376
00:54:47,179 --> 00:54:49,879
question and mani and Spencer look at me

1377
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:51,710
like are you gonna say the same damn

1378

1379
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,010
