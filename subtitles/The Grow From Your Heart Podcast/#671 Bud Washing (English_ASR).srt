description really quickly i do want to

86
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:07,119
apologize that the last episode was

87
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,719
shorter than normal i did cut out a good

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
chunk of that episode i don't don't know

89
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,080
if you noticed

90
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,400
my magical editing skills i removed a

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,800
good portion of that show that i felt i

92
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,200
got way off track and i was basically

93
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,319
talking uh to and for myself and i

94
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,318
didn't want to punish you by leaving

95
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:24,639
that in the show so i cut it out so i

96
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:27,039
apologize for the short show sometimes a

97
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,958
short quick episode is better than a

98
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,239
long bullshitted episode it's easier

99
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,000
just to come in and say here's the point

100
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
here's the lesson here's how you do it

101
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
wishes success i'm out have a good day

102
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,519
uh there's no need for me just to sit

103
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,920
here and extend [ __ ] just to make the

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,719
episode look longer on youtube uh

105
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,039
quality over quantity and i've got 80d

106
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,639
you've got 80d maybe that short episode

107
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:49,280
was exactly what we needed if you need a

108
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,399
longer episode listen to two or i've got

113
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,439
like i had to cut out some [ __ ] that

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,438

125
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,199
fish is my favorite band i've got a few

126
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,120
bands that i really enjoy fish with a ph

127
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,478
ph ish if you never heard of them check

them out fish is my favorite band

129
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,478
there's nothing like it uh no two shows

130
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,960
will ever be the same every show is

131
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:38,719
different they never play the same songs

132
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:40,319
within like a week so if they played

133
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,919
your favorite song friday you won't hear

134
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,959

135
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:45,359

140
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,918
time of my freaking life

141
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,199
we've been on this weird uh i don't even

142

like to talk about quarantine and all

143
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,478
the weird [ __ ] we've been going through

144
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,560
for the past two years we've been locked

145
00:05:00,478 --> 00:05:04,639

146
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,319
and boogie and see some [ __ ] music it

147

148
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,319
good about it uh but part of the fun

149
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,319
fish is a big part of the fun fish is

150
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,000
why we go the band fish puts on a great

151
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,680
show they play great music in my opinion

152
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
they put me in a great mindset that's

153
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,759
only a portion of the event a big

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,918
portion of that event is going and

155
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,439
seeing old friends catching up with old

156
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,198

157
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,120

158
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,879
i see often but we definitely know we'll

159
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240

160
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,240
there are people that i meet for the

161
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,000
first time at fish shows and it is a

162
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
wonderful experience doing all of the

163
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,519
above seeing the old crew meeting the

164

260
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,478

271
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,639
kind of stuff i cut out of the last

272
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,240
episode i'm not going to cut that out of

273
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,639
this one the main topic of today's

274
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,360
episode is bud washing and that's bud

275
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,559
washing with a d washing your bud that's

276
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,839
right you should already be washing

277
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:02,079
everything else today we're going to

278
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,920
learn about bud washing i'm discovering

279
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,680
that a lot of people are experiencing

280
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,479
problems in their outdoor grow early

281
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,239
this year i did predict a lot of powdery

282
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,240
mildew happening in outdoor grows

283
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
because if we've had really drastic

284
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,639
changes here in colorado we've had hot

285
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,040
days cold nights and lots of rain and

286
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,120
that does add up to powdery mildew

287
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,480
situations powdery mildew environments

288
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
i've seen a lot of people on social

289
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,399
media posting about their powdery mildew

290
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,440
laden buds and they're asking how do i

291
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,639
get rid of this then perfectly timed i

292
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,480
got this email on the irie genetics

293

don't have a grow problem as much as a

326
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,839
general question i get why bud washing

327
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,759
makes sense on outdoor grows and it's

328
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,360
logical that outdoor buds can be covered

329
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:46,480
in stuff we don't want to put into our

330
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,240
bodies my question for you is and this

331
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,039
is a very good question it says what is

332
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,959
your take on bud washing on indoor grows

333
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,039
i've seen some claim even indoor buds

334
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,719
are improved by washing i've read okay

335
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,480
so we're going to talk about bud washing

336
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,879
and this person is asking about bud

337
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,800
washing indoors and then it says you

338
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,639
would be surprised how much grime comes

339
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,439
off the buds even in seemingly

340
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:10,000
controlled environments uh yes i do

341
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,760
agree we uh i do agree that we gather a

342
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,879
lot of funky stuff on those buds you

343
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:14,319
never know what could be on there there

344
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:15,360
could be bugs there could be bug poop

345
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,160
we're going to talk about that in a

346
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,278
moment but i do agree that sometimes it

347
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,879
is beneficial to wash indoor buds what

348
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,439
i'm going to talk about will be

349
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,439
applicable to indoor and or outdoor

350
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
products so keep that in mind so this

351
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,040
next comment i found on youtube and it

352
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,440
was done right after i did the pest

353
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,159
management episode and it's referring to

354
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,240
using uh predatory pests so if you've

355
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,559
got if you've got a pest problem and you

356
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,320
use another pest to attack that bug the

357
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,639
obvious question was don't all things

358
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,959
that eat poop so the question is are

359
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,799
those predatory pests going to poop out

360
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,319
the carcasses of the bug that they ate

361
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:51,359
into my plants which is a very good

362
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
question

363
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,959
it says who wants to smoke half eaten

364
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,958
bugs and the poop so ah that is a very

365
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,439
good question and that is a very uh good

366
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:03,759
reason to do blood washing so that is

367
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,680
part of what inspired this episode was

368
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,919
two great emails and a bunch of social

369
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,838
media chatter about bud washing so now

370
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:11,838
that i've set it up let's get right to

371
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,800
it bud washing what do i mean by bud

372
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,800
washing sometimes your buds will be

373
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,919
infested with powdery mildew

374
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,359
unfortunately it does happen sometimes

375
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:23,039
we just want to clean off the buds and

376
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,720
get that powdery mildew off of there and

377
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,480
the buds will be safe to consume some

378
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,920
people are going to argue with me now

379
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,720
some people are going to have varying

380
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,639
opinions in my opinion if that bud has

381
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
if the floured plant has a little bit of

382
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,440
powdery mildew on those leaves i think

383
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,519
we can wash that powdery mildew off with

384
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,600
bud washing it is not something that i

385
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,519
would like to do that i would rely on

386
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,839
that i would do on a regular basis but

387
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,000
in some emergency cases especially this

388
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,760
year's outdoor crop this may be

389
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,399
necessary also this may be beneficial to

390
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,399
people who grow for extraction if you

391
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,440
want your extractions to be as clean as

392
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,440
they can be why not wash off the product

393
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,680
that you're going to extract before you

394
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,079
put it through the extraction process if

395
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:08,399
you don't put dirt grime dust bug [ __ ]

396
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:10,319
bug poop into your extraction machines

397
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,000
you don't have to take that out of the

398
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,680
process you don't have to clean it up

399
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,480
and take that out of the final product

400
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,479
so

401
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,879
uh bud washing sometimes you get powdery

402
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,959
mildew often there are bugs on your

403
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,120
plants often there are bug eggs like

404
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,119
this person said anything that is laying

405
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,039
eggs or eating another bug is also going

406
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,000
to take a [ __ ] so you got some bug [ __ ]

407
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,319
to go into your plants now uh oftentimes

408
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,240
outdoors you will discover bird poop on

409
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,360
your plants there's not much you can do

410
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,120
about that unless you've got a

411
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,240
greenhouse birds are going to fly over

412
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,519
they're going to drop a turd and

413
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
sometimes it's going to land right on

414
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,759
your plants i've got a good way to wash

415
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,600
that off this is very effective for that

416
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,519
sometimes you get spider webs outside

417
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,199
sometimes a spider says hey i see [ __ ]

418
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,639
flying around here there's a lot of

419
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,000
plants attracting a lot of things i'm

420
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,759
going to build a web from this plant to

421
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,120
this plant everything that flies through

422
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,879
[ __ ] dinner for the next couple of

423
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,560
weeks until they harvest

424
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,360
you'll get spider webs

425
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,559
then you will get dust and dirt now's a

426
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
good time for me to make a quick

427
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:05,198
disclaimer if you hear the weirdness in

428
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,720
my nose

429
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:08,240
that uh sorry for that that was really

430
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,079
rude but if you hear the weird nasally

431
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,839
sound in my voice that is because i

432
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,679
spent three days on a dirt parking lot

433
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,920
sucking up dirt and dust and i have got

434
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:17,198
a little nasal thing happening i feel

435
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,799
fine i feel good but there's a lot of

436
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,198
dirt in my nose and it kind of wrecked

437
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,879
me so there's a lot of dirt and dust on

438
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,278
the grow in the plants and they're

439
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,360
sticky they're trichomes so the powdery

440
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,360
mildew the bugs the bug eggs the bug

441
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,919
poop the bird poop spiderwebs dust and

442
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,159
dirt and then who knows what else who

443
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,439
knows what else maybe who even knows

444
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,278
what else is stuck to those plants it

445
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,320
could be anything outdoors right you see

446
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:41,759
weird [ __ ] cocoons and [ __ ] bug eggs

447
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
and weird larvae and things could be

448
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,039
stuck to those whatever the wind blew by

449
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,039
could be stuck to your plants so why not

450
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,399
wash that stuff off it would be a really

451
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,559
good idea if you're going to smoke it

452
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,078
eat it consume it make extracts off of

453
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,239
it we would wash our fruits and

454
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:58,559
vegetables right if i handed you a

455
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,839
tomato or a cucumber or an avocado

456
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,599
whatever it was going to be you'd wash

457
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,440
it before you cut it and eat it right we

458
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,079
should possibly maybe consider doing

459
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,199
that with our products especially if

460
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,599
they've got

461
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:11,359
powdery mildew bug eggs poop bird poop

462
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,519
spider webs dust and dirt something like

463
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,079
that on it why not clean it up

464
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,000
now let's get to the we know why and we

465
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,838
know uh the reasons to do it let's get

466
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
to how to do it

467
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,800
uh we would harvest just like normal all

468
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:24,560
right harvest your plants just like

469
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,559
normal you got your plant it's cut down

470
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,159
your normal harvest process

471
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,638
then you've got to cut the buds into

472
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:33,278
manageable pieces i like to cut the

473
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,198
plant down to where i've got a bud and a

474
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,278
stick and then at the end of that stick

475
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,958
i leave a hook so essentially what i'm

476
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,198
doing is i'm taking the main stock of

477
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,518
the plant and cutting it above the node

478
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,519
so there would be the main stock goes up

479
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
and a node would come off at an angle

480
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,560
and then if you cut right below where

481
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,319
that node comes off you've just left

482
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:52,159
yourself a hanger so when it's time to

483
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,399
hang that butt up you can use that

484
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,000
little v section as a natural hanger for

485
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,078
your plant you'll see this when it comes

486
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
time to cut your plant cut below the

487
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,198
node you'll leave a little hanger you

488
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
can just leave the main stock will

489
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,879
become the the short piece of the hanger

490
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,958
and the branch with the buds will become

491
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,679
the the branch with the butt it will all

492
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,799
make sense so i cut them into manageable

493
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,799
pieces

494
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:15,198
for me i'm going to use a 5 gallon

495
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:17,519
bucket for my bud washing i need pieces

496
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,198
that are shorter than a 5 gallon bucket

497
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,198
so i can dunk them all the way in there

498
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,958
my goal is to get all the bud matter all

499
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,399
the bud material into the five gallon

500
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,799
bucket so i'm going to harvest like

501
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:29,679
normal i'm probably going to before

502
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,399
harvest i would normally go and pull off

503
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:34,638
a majority of the large powdery mildew

504
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,559
laden fan leaves all the big leaves with

505
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,240
the pedial before harvest you could just

506
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,919
go in and strip as many leaves off as

507
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,000
you can get go take off the leaves don't

508
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:44,159
get aggressive and [ __ ] up the buds take

509
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,759
off all the leaves strip them destroy

510
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,120
those leaves they've got powdery mildew

511
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,399
get them out of there maybe wear a mask

512
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,480
while you're doing this definitely wear

513
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,240
gloves stay safe get in there and

514
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,000
defoliate cut down your plants cut them

515
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,159
into manageable pieces leave sticks so

516
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,240
you can hang them after they are dunked

517
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:01,439
then this is where when we're going to

518
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:03,680
actually start cleaning up the buds

519
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:06,240
one more thing i should mention gloves

520
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:07,279
uh we're going to use a five gallon

521
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,439
bucket

522
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,439
filled with water uh you can use regular

523
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,439
tap water ro water that doesn't matter

524
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:18,720
too much to me we're going to add 25 to

525
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:22,079
50 milliliters of 30

526
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,838
hydrogen peroxide to 5 gallons of water

527
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:28,558
let me repeat that that is 25 to 50

528
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,558
milliliters per 5 gallons you can go

529
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,798
harder if you want but i would start

530
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,480
light see if it's washing off the pm see

531
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,639
if it's solving the problem if not go

532
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,400
harder go harder until you see it start

533
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,600
doing some damage to a couple branches

534
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,880
then dilute as necessary usually 25 to

535
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,719
50 mils of 30 hydrogen peroxide not the

536
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,760
cheap [ __ ] you need the good stuff the

537
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,240
30 the medical grade the good [ __ ]

538
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,200
25 to 30 mils and a 5 gallon bucket of

539
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,599
water

540
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,679
ah wear your protective equipment when

541
00:17:55,599 --> 00:18:00,480
you're mixing this wear goggles when

542
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,600
you're handling all of this wear gloves

543
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,919
because that 30 hydrogen peroxide will

544
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:07,519
mess your skin up it is very caustic if

545
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,360
it gets in your eye it's going to be one

546
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,000
of the most painful things you will ever

547
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:14,639
experience so please when you are using

548
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,798
the hydrogen peroxide please use at

549
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,080
least the gloves and i recommend some

550
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:19,759
goggles when you're pouring it i

551
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,159
understand a lot of people aren't going

552
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,160
to go get goggles just to pour some [ __ ]

553
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,000
enter at your own risk rasta jeff is

554
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
making a disclaimer don't [ __ ] sue me

555
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,519
because you're dumb all right enough

556
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,679
said there

557
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,918
uh 5 gallon bucket 25 to 50 mls of

558
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,919
hydrogen peroxide the good [ __ ] 30 you

559
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,600
can go harder if you want but don't

560
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
blame me if that [ __ ] up your buds

561
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,759
start low and then work your way up if

562
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,360
it's not taking off the mildew add more

563
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,599
when it starts bleaching your buds

564
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:46,959
you've gone too far dilute you'll figure

565
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:48,719
it out only take one or two branches and

566
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,319
you'll notice all right so we've got our

567
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,839
five gallon bucket filled with our

568
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,839
solution you don't have to use the

569
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:55,759
hydrogen peroxide but that is what i

570
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,439
recommend if we're going to do this that

571
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,038
is something i would recommend i don't

572
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,880
think it will damage your plants i don't

573
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,640
think it will mess anything up i've

574
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,440
applied hydrogen peroxide as a foliar

575
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,240
spray before to combat powdery mildew

576
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,759
and in my opinion it works very very

577
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,120
well it leaves the growth smelling clean

578
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:12,640
and fresh and the next day you don't

579
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,079
even notice it happened

580
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,759
except there's no powdery mildew and the

581
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,159
plants are happier and it smells amazing

582
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,440
like ganja in that room so we've got our

583
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,120
five gallon bucket we've got our

584
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,120
hydrogen peroxide in there we've got our

585
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,439
gloves on maybe some of you are wearing

586
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:28,319
eye gear probably not we're going to cut

587
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,080
our plant into manageable sections

588
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:31,678
probably 10 to 12 inch sections

589
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,000
something like that is probably

590
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,240
manageable for most people before we

591
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,400
even start dunking these buds have a

592
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,480
place where they are going to hang where

593
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,679
are they going to go once you dunk these

594
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,279
buds you're going to dunk them into

595
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,798
water you're going to swirl them around

596
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,798
we're going to take them out we've got

597
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:48,558
to hang them somewhere for them to drip

598
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:50,400
dry they're going to have a lot of water

599
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,160
in there depending on how spongy and

600
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
dense your buds are and how much bud is

601
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,000
on that stick there's going to be quite

602
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,319
a bit of water left in there it will

603
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,240
come out don't worry don't squeeze it

604
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,319
don't do anything [ __ ] crazy to it

605
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,919
let it drip out let it just come out

606
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,319
naturally okay

607
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,200
so have that space in mind have it

608
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,960
planned have it ready maybe already know

609
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,640
exactly how much space you need to hang

610
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,480
these plants before you even get to this

611
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,400
point because i don't want you to have

612
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,000
wet buds and a struggle that's when

613
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,480
you're going to cause problems if you

614
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,640
don't [ __ ] it up this will go very well

615
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,558
but if you don't have a proper strategy

616
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,440
and a place to put the buds before you

617
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:29,918
dunk them [ __ ] will go wrong i promise

618
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,840
we can't stack up wet buds they've got

619
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,240
to be hung with space uh with care so uh

620
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,399
have a place for them to go have the

621
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,319
product your solution ready have your

622
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,480
protective equipment on cut the buds

623
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,158
into manageable pieces now here's where

624
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,159
we're gonna get crazy you got a five

625
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,240
gallon bucket right take your piece of

626
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,640
bud your branch your stock however much

627
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,480
product you've got and just submerge it

628
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,559
right into the water i know this sounds

629
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,640
brave i know this sounds crazy you just

630
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,960
put months into this product but i have

631
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,640
done entire harvests in commercial

632
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,279
facilities this way i've paid guys to

633
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,280
spend all day washing buds with hydrogen

634
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,720
peroxide because we couldn't rescue this

635
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,720
facility that was coated in powdery

636
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,720
mildew and that was our solution it all

637
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,038
got made into extracts it was all tested

638
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,798
it was all safe it all worked i trust

639
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,640
this method so

640
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,158
we're going to dunk our buds directly

641
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,240
into the five gallon bucket with our

642
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,600
hydrogen peroxide solution

643
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,440
while it's in there

644
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:25,918
jostle it the word that i want to use is

645
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,600
jostle stir the buds around don't get in

646
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,360
there and [ __ ] sh

647
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,279
we're not trying to shake the trichomes

648
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,038
off we're trying to jostle the powdery

649
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:35,678
mildew off we don't want to disrupt the

650
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,079
plant i just want to rinse it just not

651
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,360
vigorous but not not lily dipping but

652
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,199
you want to get in there and kind of

653
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,240
just in and out and swish it around a

654
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,080
little bit

655
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,599
just get that just get some movement

656
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,199
gets a little bit of friction in there

657
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,439
just wash that powdery mildew off then

658
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,360
take that plant out and give it a visual

659
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,400
assessment look at it do you see more

660
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,158
problems

661
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,080
did bug poop come off of it did the

662
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,840
spider web come off of it did the bird

663
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:59,759
[ __ ] come off did the powdery mill do

664
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,759
wash off did you do a good enough job if

665
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,519
not dunk that [ __ ] back in there give

666
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,359
it another wiggle another jiggle another

667
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,759
another jostle do what you need to do

668
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,519
until it's clean hang it up

669
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,400
repeat as necessary

670
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:14,639
maybe do a portion of the crop at this

671
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,798
point maybe just do some of it and see

672
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,720
how you like this method check on those

673
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,359
plants check on them in an hour check on

674
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,519
them in two four six every few hours

675
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,038
just check on them see what is happening

676
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,119
before you do the whole crop check on

677
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,720
them see if you like how it is going see

678
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:30,319
if you dunk them enough is there still

679
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,400
stuff on there you want to wash off if

680
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,720
there is you can

681
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,880
but it is very important that you dunk

682
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,519
them and wash them before the plants

683
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,640
begin to dry do not

684
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,400
do not take a dry plant and try to dunk

685
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,559
it and remoisten it and do this you will

686
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,720
destroy everything you'll [ __ ] it all up

687
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,399
you'll be so mad so that's a quick

688
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,360
disclaimer a quick reminder a quick

689
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,960
notice

690
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,959
do not try to remoisten and do this to a

691
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,480
dried plant you can't do that that's

692
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,798
going to be a total failure so take your

693
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,880
wet plant dunk it shake it jostle it

694
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:05,038
around hang it up if you like how that

695
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,360
one came out in a couple of hours do the

696
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,960
rest of the plants dunk them all dunk

697
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:10,798
them jostle them give them a little

698
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,798
swish watch the powdery mildew come on

699
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,038
up now eventually that water is going to

700
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,038
start looking a little bit funky at your

701
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:19,200
own discretion dump that [ __ ] out start

702
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:20,400
fresh the hydrogen peroxide is not super

703
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,319
expensive

704
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,840
you've gotten this far with it hopefully

705
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,678
it's working for you and it is cost

706
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,599
effective but feel free to dump that

707
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,200
[ __ ] out and start fresh

708
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:30,079
let me check my notes make sure i'm on

709
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,159
pace

710
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,319
uh replace the water as necessary you'll

711
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,840
start seeing powdery mildew on the top

712
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,759
or you'll start seeing it'll get crimey

713
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:38,959
and gross you'll know you'll feel you'll

714
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,319
just have a feeling that's gross i

715
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,480
should change it change it don't be

716
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,918
afraid um

717
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,200
hang the buds so hang them where they

718
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,520
can drip dry i would hang them um

719
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,600
somewhere with an ambient environment i

720
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,759
know that wherever like just ambient no

721
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,519
you don't need extreme heat extreme cold

722
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,400
normal ambient environment somewhere

723
00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:00,480
between 65 and 75 degrees would be cool

724
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,240
uh would be ideal but right now i'm

725
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,919
gonna give you up to 82 ish degrees

726
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,278
because it's hotter than [ __ ] everywhere

727
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,520
and it's going to be hard to find a cool

728
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,919
space like that so if you get a cool dry

729
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,960
space that would be ideal let them drip

730
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,159
dry

731
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,240
there's going to be a lot of water

732
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,559
falling out of these buds onto the floor

733
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,798
be prepared for that maybe do it outside

734
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,079
maybe do it in the garage then once

735
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:21,759
they're done dripping and they're no

736
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,240
longer dripping then you can move them

737
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:27,919
to your regular drying space and you can

738
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,079
begin your drying process as normal

739
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:34,080
for the normal drying space

740
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:36,480
ah that's when i would have 55 to 65

741
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,798
humidity maybe 50 humidity since the

742
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,400
plants are so wet uh maybe start off at

743
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:45,359
50 and then let it go up over the next

744
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:49,600
day up to 55 to 65 but 50 to 65 humidity

745
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:51,119
then 65 to 75 degrees in that room if

746
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,119
you can manage that i understand it's

747
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,879
hot as [ __ ] uh right now i'd probably

748
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,278
have to have an 80 degree drying space

749
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:59,120
just because that's how it is uh but we

750
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:00,558
can't always always have all the perfect

751
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,918
[ __ ]

752
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:07,119
have a fan in there have fans moving the

753
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,360
air so none of the air is stagnant but

754
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:11,038
don't have fans directly blowing onto

755
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:12,558
the plants speed drying them so if you

756
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,720
can have an oscillating fan that just

757
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,038
goes across the plants occasionally

758
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,200
that's okay have air movement in the

759
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,720
room but don't blow onto the plants

760
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,038
because that'll cause dryness that we

761
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,798
don't want that'll dry one section fast

762
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,119
and the others won't be dry evenly

763
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,558
that'll start causing you problems

764
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,439
so at this point

765
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:33,759
basically uh dry your plants like you

766
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,840
normally would proceed with caution uh

767
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,679
keep an eye on the plants uh don't let

768
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,798
the room get too humid you may need to

769
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,400
step up your humid uh your dehumidifier

770
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,400
or your extraction fan

771
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,080
however your drying and curing spaces

772
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,200
set up don't let it get too humid in

773
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,038
there that's something that is very

774
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,798
important at this time

775
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:52,798
have that room dialed in have a way to

776
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,480
get rid of the excess humidity because

777
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,519
we did soak these buds in water and then

778
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,200
we put them

779
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:59,679
hopefully let them drip long enough but

780
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,278
there's a lot of water in there so a lot

781
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,360
of that water has to come out expect a

782
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:06,159
couple of extra days on your dry time

783
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:08,399
but that is not a problem in my opinion

784
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,760
letting cannabis dry longer is a good

785
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,240
thing some of you guys want it to dry

786
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:14,400
super fast it's better when it dries

787
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,640
slower a better thing happens there's a

788
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,000
conversion happening there's a

789
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,679
conversion that happens during the

790
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,240
drying and cure process that happens

791
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,600
better if it goes more slowly so take

792
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,558
your time with the drying and curing

793
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:26,719
process

794
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,079
uh i will work on an updated drying and

795
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,159
curing episode i know i haven't done

796
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,839
that updated episode there's a uh just

797
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,360
an audio only version we'll get a video

798
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,278
version of that coming up those episodes

799
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,399
take a lot of focus and a lot of work a

800
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:37,679
lot of time to record a lot of

801
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,600
perfection in the editing but we'll get

802
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:41,200
it right we'll get it out for you but

803
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,158
at this point i feel like i have gotten

804
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,720
you through

805
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:46,480
bud washing it's not as scary as it

806
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,640
sounds it's not as intimidating as it

807
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,798
sounds it's not as nasty as it sounds

808
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,278
you're taking a bucket with some

809
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:55,038
hydrogen peroxide you can use h2o2 if

810
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,960
you've got that available once again be

811
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,679
just as careful if not more careful with

812
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,200
the h2o2 it's just as caustic it'll burn

813
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,278
it'll [ __ ] you up it's dangerous use

814
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,880
your personal protective equipment don't

815
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,240
sue me if you [ __ ] up

816
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,159
also if you get caught doing anything

817
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,240
illegal uh involving this plant this

818
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:11,840
culture this scene i will not be held

819
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,960
responsible rosta jeff is a fictional

820
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:15,359
character and this is a show for

821
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,880
entertainment purposes but ah mix up

822
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,119
your solution dunk that [ __ ] in there

823
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,880
give it a swirl hang it up and don't let

824
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,959
it get moldy because it's too wet and

825
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,200
don't speed dry it that is the gist of

826
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,000
bud washing think about why you're doing

827
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,759
it

828
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,679
a lot of extractors have started bud

829
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:31,359
washing even if there is not a problem

830
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,159
in the grow they find that the grow

831
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:36,479
spaces are dusty where i live uh this

832
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,480
town experience there's a documentary

833
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,480
called the dust bowl this town was part

834
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,960
of the dust bowl this town where i live

835
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,120
gets dusty uh there's desert that way

836
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,120
there's desert that way there's a steel

837
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,158
mill that way that produces all kinds of

838
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:52,239
weird dusty [ __ ] so we have to dust here

839
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,840
constantly if you dust the shelves you

840
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,359
dust monday you're probably dusting

841
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,278
again thursday and if you don't it

842
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,599
builds up a funky gunk of dust it is

843
00:27:57,278 --> 00:28:02,159
dusty here all that shit's on our plants

844
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:03,599
as well my table is not very sticky it's

845
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,399
kind of sticky because i take some dabs

846
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,079
here

847
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,639
but the table is not naturally really

848
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,798
sticky and it gets dusty and funky or

849
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,559
cannabis plants if you're doing it right

850
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,480
they're sticky as [ __ ] especially

851
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,798
outside so you're going to get all of

852
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,399
that dust from the desert that we've got

853
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,079
all of that weird [ __ ] floating around

854
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,398
from the wind all of that stuff from the

855
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,599
steel mill all the brake dust if you

856
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:25,359
live by the interstate and you got to

857
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,959
grow by the interstate there's a lot of

858
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,240
brake dust in the air all of that [ __ ]

859
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,240
will be stuck to your plants we don't

860
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,399
think about that so that's a very good

861
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,679
logical rational reason to do a little

862
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:35,519
bit of bud washing and then when you

863
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
start rinsing those plants and you see

864
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:38,960
what's left in the water you'll be a

865
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,880
little bit disgusted that you haven't

866
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,278
thought about doing it before we're

867
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,760
making extracts we're making food we're

868
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:47,599
smoking these products imagine it would

869
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,278
you want to smoke a bunch of dirt would

870
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,439
you want to smoke a nice hit of bird

871
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,278
[ __ ] you down bro hey bro i got a big

872
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,798
bag of bird turd you want to take a hit

873
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,798
off of this that doesn't sound appealing

874
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:58,720
to me don't be afraid don't be scared to

875
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:59,599
wash your buds don't be ashamed of it

876
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,440
either

877
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,839
we put a lot of work and a lot of energy

878
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,360
into our grow sometimes you have to have

879
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:07,038
something to show for it a lot of you

880
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,719
this is your medicine for the year this

881
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:10,879
is what is going to get you by this is

882
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,558
what's going to make you not

883
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,760
super sick from whatever ails you i

884
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:15,678
don't want to pin you with some sort of

885
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,519
condition but this may be what is saving

886
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,960
your life for the next year let's do

887
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:21,759
what we can to save it let's be proud

888
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,600
about it let's be safe let's be as clean

889
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:24,558
and conscious as about it as we can as

890
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,719
well

891
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,960
uh keep in mind prevention is key but

892
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,038
right now uh at the outdoor season that

893
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,558
i saw there was a lot of powdery mildew

894
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:34,240
and there were not a lot of ways to

895
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,879
prevent it because we cannot control the

896
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,519
vpd outdoors you can apply a few things

897
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,080
i do like cease i like zero tall

898
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:42,879
i like double nickel uh what's the one

899
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,038
from

900
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,799
marone bioinnovations the uh they've got

901
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,720
a couple maybe it's grand devo there's a

902
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,359
lot of great products that we can spray

903
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,200
that work as a preventative or a uh it

904
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:55,599
will help remove the pan eradicator of

905
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,440
the powdery mildew but i understand

906
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,398
sometimes [ __ ] gets away from you so uh

907
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,558
if you're just fighting the powdery

908
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,398
mildew now you can spray with c so you

909
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,240
could spray with double nickel and then

910
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:07,278
when it comes time to harvest do that

911
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:10,000
dunk in either zero tall or hydrogen

912
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:12,319
peroxide also heavy defoliation will

913
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
help you with powdery mildew all right
