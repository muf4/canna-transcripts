00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,879
what am i missing if you're part of the

166
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,639
merch marketing team let me know what

167
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,719
else i should make also

168
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,079
if you've got some designs uh if there's

169
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,919
a strain that i put out that doesn't

170
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,439
have cool artwork and you make some

171
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:03,439
artwork let me know maybe we can use

172
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:04,879
your artwork also keep in mind we have

173
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,478
to be careful with some of the strains

174
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,000
that i've created we can't make art for

175
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,879
all of them because that may get us in

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,478
trouble if the strain name is uh derived

177
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,079
from something famous already we

178
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,159
probably shouldn't make artwork for it

179
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,000
but some things we could definitely use

180
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,680
artwork for now i feel like i'm begging

181
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,918
for art begging for your help out there

182

190
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,399

191
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:43,599
the topic of this podcast which is your

192
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:46,079
mom your mom plans to be more specific i

193

do have an email here this one came from

194
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:49,199
our friend used to be cool used to be

195
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,198
cool has been listening to the podcast

196
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,560
for a long time has not emailed with a

197
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
question in quite a while which makes me

198
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,759
feel like uh our friend is learning

199
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,038
quite a bit they've gotten confident in

200
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,720
the grow they haven't needed my help

201
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,439
which makes me proud i do appreciate

202
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
that

203
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,478
i left the mechanic shop the other day

204
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,680
and i said it was good seeing you bro

205
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:05,359
but i really hope i don't have to see

206
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,199
you for a while and he understood he's

207
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,639
understood exactly what i meant every

208
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,319
time i see him something's wrong with a

209
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,319
damn car didn't want to have to see him

210
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,520
for a while uh i think that our buddy

211
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,800
used to be cool is doing great because

212
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:17,198
he hasn't messaged me with the problem

213
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,280
in a long time this one i will quit

214
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,680
rambling and we'll cut to the chase i

215
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,359
goes a little bit like this it says if

216
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,439

218
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,038
lot of your messages i know you as used

219
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
to be cool when i see your real name it

220
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,879

it says i have a question about keeping

225
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:42,000
a mother plant i have never kept a cut

226
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,759
beyond a few runs mainly because of

227
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,120
space restrictions that is completely

228
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,439
understandable i'm here in the state of

229
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,038
colorado if you've got recreational

230
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:50,800
cannabis you're allowed six plants if

231
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:53,038
you've got your medical recommendation

232
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,360
you're allowed an additional six in most

233
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,560
cities and counties uh most places limit

234
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,720
you a lot of people talk about their

235
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,720
extended plant count a lot of cities and

236
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,879
counties don't give a [ __ ] about your

237
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,240
extended plant count you are limited to

238
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,560
6 and

239
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,879
12. it says however

240
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
i found a plant i want to explore a

241
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,840
little my dude fell in love

242

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,960
was [ __ ] fantastic it's fabulous to

248
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,478
found her you say that five times fast

249
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,120
i'll send you a pack of seeds

250
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,560
and so she can't be replaced yes i know

251
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,278
that feeling i've got a lot of female

252
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,879
cuts that cannot be replaced especially

253
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,120
my male cut imagine if we had to find

254
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,320
another king solomon it goes on i'm

255
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,839
rambling today you guys i must have

256
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,000
smoked some good [ __ ] thanks for hanging

257
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,720
out with me says however i realize i

258
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,200
don't really know how to keep a mom my

259
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,759
specific question is whether i should

260
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,920
multi-top the plant to increase branches

261
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,559
so i can harvest more cuts or simply let

262
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:57,519
it grow naturally and let the cuts i

263
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,159
take also count as topping i would also

264
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,000
just like some basic information about

265
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,000
how long to keep the mother before

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,759
flowering it out and starting a new mom

267
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
and any other

268
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,039
it looks like my printer just [ __ ]

269
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,480
gave up at that point i was like nope

270
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,639
i'm done printing so that's what we got

271
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,839
here it ends with and any other i'm

272
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,120
pretty sure you can ask for any other

273
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,800
information that i can provide to help

274
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,879
you out keep a mother plant happy set

275
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,559
you up for success let's get into that

276
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,720
because i do have a lot of useful tips

277
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,719
being a breeder a long time cultivator i

278
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,839
have kept cuts around

279
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
excuse me for having to hear that for a

280
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,720
moment i've cut kept cuts around for a

281
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,399
long time i've talked about a flow plant

282
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,399
that i had for

283
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,200
uh 2008 i probably had that [ __ ] for

284
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,720
10 12. um

285
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,160
man i probably had that plan for 12

286
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,320
years we're just going to say 12 years i

287
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,079
don't know exactly uh but 10 or 12 years

288
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,480
i had a flow plant by keeping a mother

289
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,240
plant of it when that mother plant would

290
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,600
outgrow the pot or outgrow the shape

291
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,039
sometimes they just you cut them and

292
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,040
take mom like take clones off when they

293
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,799
start getting unshapely and unruly i

294
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,719
would just take another fresh cut and

295
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,639
rejuvenate and start fresh that's a

296
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,000
thing as a breeder with a selection of

297
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,159
mom plants that's something that i do

298
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,399
routinely it's about every six months

299
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,240
sometimes sooner depending on the cuts

300
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,120
uh the congo grows too fast she has to

301
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,560
be remomed too early um but i try to

302
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,639
remom my [ __ ] occasionally just to keep

303
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,239
the genetics fresh just to keep them uh

304
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,600
ruley the shape that i want so you

305
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,039
started with a very good question let me

306
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,240
get back on track here um let me back up

307
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,759
into something

308
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,039
that we should that you should have done

309
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,000
further you didn't make a mistake you

310
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,000
didn't know this was going to be a

311
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,159
champion so you did not know to keep a

312
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,879
clone but this is why i say

313
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:34,319
always keep a clone of every plant you

314
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:36,480
grow i'm a breeder i run a lot of tests

315
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,640
seeds it is hard to keep a clone of

316
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,000
everything so what i do in that a lot of

317
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,360
times i'm willing to just let it go

318
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,958
because i've got enough seeds where i

319
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
can run it and find it again i found

320
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:45,838
i've seen what i wanted to see that can

321
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,320
go i'm not too attached a lot of the

322
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,839
time sometimes i do wish i had a keeper

323
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
i wish i would have kept it in that case

324
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
what i will do is re-veg a plant it's

325
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,320
never too late to cut a clone off of a

326
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
plant if you've decided that that plant

327
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
is [ __ ] fire you want it cut a clone

328
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,958
keep that around or re-veg that plant

329
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:06,000
after you harvest i've done uh full

330
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,679
episodes on cutting clones re-veging

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,360
monster cropping i've done episodes on

332
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:10,958
all of that that's all available so

333
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,800
always take a clone because you never

334
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,479
know um

335
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,159
if it's going to be fire you never ever

336
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,079
know just like this case it's the only

337
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,159
female and it needs to be kept so if you

338
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,679
would have had a clone um

339
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:23,439
if you have a clone then you can keep

340
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,000
this going on so hopefully you've got a

341
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,680
clone um but always keep it calm that's

342
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,600
something i talk about then where are we

343
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:33,039
or learn to re-veg um i have re-veged a

344
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,720
bud i may have talked about this on the

345
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,719
show before i was at a friend's

346
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,560
greenhouse and he had plants that were

347
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,720
pretty far along

348
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:41,679
it was almost smokeable but not quite

349
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,959
and he thought it would be nice and

350
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,039
clipped me off a little bud like a

351
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,319
good-sized bud and toss it to me and

352
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:47,919
he's like go home and smoke that and let

353
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,278
me know what you think and i was like

354
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:50,958
well it's way too early i'm gonna think

355
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:53,200
it's crap but that was super nice of you

356
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,638
because our buddy white mike had the

357
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,240
brilliant idea he said if you don't

358
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,079
clone that you [ __ ] up and i was like

359
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,680
dude i think we're thinking the same

360
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:01,759
exact thing so we drove straight to the

361
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,799
house put it in some clonex put it in a

362
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,639
dome uh got it go put it in a clone plug

363
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:08,479
put it in a dome got it going as a clone

364
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,919
and that [ __ ] rooted and it revenged

365
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,519
and i had a clone on my friend's plant

366
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,719
that he didn't know that i had kept it

367
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,839
around to me

368
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,519
maybe

369
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,800
maybe i've bred something to it recently

370
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,000
that we can't talk about yet here on the

371
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,359
show because people don't even know that

372
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,200
that's what they're testing let me keep

373
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
myself on track here

374
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,360
uh so you can clone it's never too late

375
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
to clone something re-veg it and rescue

376
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
it so now let's talk more about keeping

377
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,159
a mom plant your first question is how

378
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,559
do you shape it

379
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,679
to provide clones that is a very

380
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:38,159
good question it is all about your goal

381
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,879
i don't know how many clones you need i

382
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,719
don't know how your gross style is so

383
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,399
the main thing i always take that middle

384
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,160
top right out and make that a clone

385
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,679
because all the other branches are going

386
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:48,879
to grow to a certain height and that top

387
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,319
is going to keep going and [ __ ]

388
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:51,759
everything up it's going to you're going

389
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,000
to have to adjust the light and

390
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,559
everything because of that top bud that

391
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
top node that apical dominant node just

392
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,078
take that out use that as a clone now

393
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
you've got a nice even canopy now you've

394
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,239
got a lot of options for cloning once it

395
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,159
starts to grow as a home grower you're

396
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,079
probably i'm assuming here you're

397
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,919
probably not going to need more than six

398
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,919
12 maybe 20 i don't know your state your

399
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,078
limit uh what you're doing you're not

400
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,240
going to need a lot of clones so one

401
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,958
mother plant any three to five gallon

402
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,399
pot can provide a lot of clones but you

403
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:22,159
have to learn how to

404
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,240
shape it to provide those clones and

405
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,159
where to cut from to keep the plant

406
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,000
active and growing to give you even more

407
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,919
clones once you've cut it so it's kind

408
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,799
of learning learning the plant if you've

409
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:34,319
got a plant that is squat and stout

410
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,759
and it makes a lot of branching it's

411
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
easier to get more clones more

412
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,319
frequently if you've got a tall stretchy

413
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,078
plant like the congo um

414
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,839
there aren't a lot of places to clone

415
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,919
from but there's a lot of plant material

416
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,920
because it's so [ __ ] long but it's

417
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,919
one big main with like eight side

418
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,639
branches so if i were to clone from it i

419
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,719
could get nine clones maybe but i've got

420
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,959
some uh let's talk about the chernobyl

421
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,519
plant that i've got that [ __ ] grows

422
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,359
real short real squat and makes one main

423
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,278
top that takes off but then a lot of

424
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,519
side branching i could get 40 clones off

425
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:06,720
of a plant the same size as i could the

426
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,480
congo just because the shape and

427
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,759
structure of the plant so that's going

428
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,039
to have a lot to do with it the main

429
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,759
things are the shape and structure of

430
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,439
the plant the size of the plant and then

431
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,198
how many clones and how frequently do

432
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,720
you need them so i always start with

433
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:21,599
that main top take that out let them

434
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,199
grow evenly and then as they get taller

435
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,560
take those as your next round of clones

436
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,240
and they'll start catching up eventually

437
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,239
you'll have like a hedge then you can

438
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,759
you'll learn when i cut here always cut

439
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,440
at the node when there's another node

440
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,799
sticking up so you got your main branch

441
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,000
and you got another let me come down let

442
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,278
me adjust this mic and get my [ __ ]

443
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,958
together that was awkward the way i did

444
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:38,320
that uh you got the main branch coming

445
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:39,599
up this is your main branch right these

446
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,120
are leaves whatever my fingers are

447
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,680
leaves you got a node right here

448
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,278
sticking off top it right before that

449
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:46,719
and that new one will make another

450
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,000
branch if you do or there's one coming

451
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
up here and one coming up here you just

452
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,679
made two tops where there was one and

453
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
now the next time you cut you got this

454
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:56,559
sticking out and now you got two tops

455
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
and you can those will make more tops

456
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,359
it'll do the same thing and you can cut

457
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,600
the tops out of there and then you'll

458
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,680
make four out of it and if you once you

459
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,360
figure out that art you'll get really

460
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,479
good at it keep in mind

461
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,320
that

462
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,839
you can reclone this plant get a clone

463
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,959
of it grow it out keep it as a mother

464
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,279
plant

465
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,119
then once it gets unruly unshapely use

466
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:17,439
one of your clones as your new mother

467
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,320
plant and keep practicing to achieve the

468
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,079
shape you need uh you desire the shape

469
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,680
that reaches your goal all right i do

470
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,958
have a bunch of notes here that i didn't

471
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,159
even talk about i've been going for

472
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,319
quite a while um mom question uh

473
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,319
selection it's all about selection what

474
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
works best for you sounds like you found

475
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,360
one you want to play with you've got a

476
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,958
plant that you want to turn into a

477
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,560
mother plant i would recommend keeping

478
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:39,599
it under a veg

479
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,119
light

480
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,959
i don't have this note written down so i

481
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,839
want to talk about this quickly

482
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:48,319
if you don't up pot your mother plants

483
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,120
sometimes some plants do have the

484
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,360
potential to begin to autoflower or show

485
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,440
you problems once they get root bound so

486
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,680
keep it in a big enough pot for it to

487
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,839
grow wide and strong have a healthy root

488
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:02,000
zone that we can branch out bush out and

489
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,160
provide you the clones you need so pot

490
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,320
size is very important then

491
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:09,360
after that i'm going to say that veg

492
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,199
light is very important light cycle um

493
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
the same with the pot size if you don't

494
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:14,639
give it enough light if you don't give

495
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,559
it enough air enough space

496
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,839
if the vpd is off if this plant gets

497
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,479
stressed out and you keep it around for

498
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,880
a while it may try to flower on you so

499
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
give it enough light depending on we're

500
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,958
going to talk about daily light integral

501
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
in a very soon upcoming episode here but

502
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:29,758
depending on the kind of light you're

503
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,399
giving it the intensity and the amount

504
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,680
of hours pay attention to that light pay

505
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,120
attention to the plant give it enough

506
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,319
light to where it will not go into

507
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,720
flower i sometimes i run 18-6 for my

508
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,680
moms often if i've got full control of

509
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,278
everything it'll be 20 on and four off

510
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:47,039
for my mother plants give them those two

511
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,039
hours extra of light

512
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,639
just makes them grow stronger prevents

513
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,480
them from flowering they don't even get

514
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,560
the idea that it's dark enough to think

515
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,560
about flowering and then they get four

516
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,000
hours for the plant to sleep a lot of

517
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,758
the root cycles a lot of the stuff

518
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
happening down there in the rhizosphere

519
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,959
happens in the night a lot of the growth

520
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,439
stuff

521
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:07,279
happens in the night uh also i want my

522
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,959
equipment to get a four hour rest that's

523
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,439
four hours of electricity i don't have

524
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:14,078
to pay for four hours longer my bulb

525
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,839
will last every day uh it doesn't seem

526
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:17,678
like a big deal in a homegrown a small

527
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,359
cultivation but if you're running a

528
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,880
large-scale commercial cultivation

529
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:25,119
facility uh your mom room can be i've

530
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,199
been in a veg room a mom room with 50 to

531
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,879
100 lights just vegging and mom i've

532
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,160
been in much larger but i'm just saying

533
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,919
it can be

534
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,679
50 lights just for mother plants just

535
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,280
for keeping genetics and small clones

536
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,038
around can be a lot so if you can

537
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,200
minimize the amount of lights that are

538
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,879
on the time give your equipment some

539
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,279
rest that will save some on the bill

540
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,120
also time on your equipment less fans

541
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,798
running less [ __ ] happening uh

542
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,038
everything costs a little something

543
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,038
right now everything costs a lot more we

544
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:53,279
don't need to talk about that but um

545
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,839
lights think about lighting we want veg

546
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:57,440
lighting blue lighting um if you've got

547
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:59,918
the options for switching if you're old

548
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,919
school you do hps and metal halides you

549
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,400
want the blue metal halides right now if

550
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,400
your uh led light has a switch for veg

551
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,759
or flower switch that [ __ ] to veg

552
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,519
that's where you want to be the most

553
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,279
blue light you can give it i'm not an

554
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,279
expert on lighting but we do want veg

555
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,599
lights at this point also to go with

556
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:18,079
that veg light we do want vegetative

557
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:20,079
nutrients i focus mainly on that

558
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,038
nitrogen phosphorus potassium of course

559
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,199
they're going to need a little bit of

560
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,798
calmag they're not in flour they're not

561
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,319
in high performance mode once they get

562
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,918
bigger and the soil burns out whatever

563
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,599
you got them in you will need to feed

564
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:32,880
them calmag and other things but think

565
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,959
about the basics uh just basic veg newts

566
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,160
i like to feed them a lot of microbes i

567
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,600
feed everything that shits on the

568
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,360
microbes just because i think that keeps

569
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,839
the soil moving we're going to talk in

570
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,199
the future about over feeding of

571
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:45,439
microbes uh but feed it veg nutrients

572
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,558
basically uh your basic vegetative

573
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,840
nutrients you don't have to give it all

574
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,759
the boosters and [ __ ] because you're not

575
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,119
trying to make it uh grow grow grow

576
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,960
we're just trying to make it a big

577
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:53,839
enough plant to provide healthy happy

578
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,720
cuts

579
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:56,000
um

580
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,519
then we're gonna touch on something i

581
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,440
already talked about shape it to offer

582
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,759
the amount of clones you need at the

583
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,120
frequency of which you need them

584
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,359
um

585
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,199
maybe some people keep a one gallon tiny

586
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,719
bonsai mother plant that they take one

587
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,798
clone off of and it grows a little bit

588
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,079
bigger and they take two off of they let

589
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,240
it grow a little bit bigger next time

590
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,159
they get three then they up pot that

591
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,519
into a bigger pot or maybe they just

592
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,200
abandon that one and use one of the

593
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:22,000
other clones and keep going because they

594
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:23,759
cannot have large plants or maybe you

595
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,759
grow gigantic [ __ ] plants that you've

596
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:27,359
just got hedged up and trimmed up as

597
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,279
much as you can and you're just taking

598
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,199
thousands of cuts at a time it's all

599
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,918
about your goal i talked about shaping

600
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,840
it

601
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,000
shaping the plant will become an art

602
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,279
once you realize when i cut here

603
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,119
this branch will grow this way when i

604
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,798
cut here these two split this way you

605
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,479
kind of have to do it to learn it and

606
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,240
you'll experience it and you'll figure

607
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,400
it out very quickly on a couple of

608
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,079
plants so shape it the way you want

609
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,160
mother plants can be small they can be

610
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,519
huge it depends on how many you want to

611
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,558
keep around and how many cuts you're

612
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,480
going to need

613
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,639
i generally keep my mother plants in a

614
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,400
three to five gallon pot i keep them

615
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,759
fairly far apart so the wind can blow

616
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,120
and they don't get any issues and when i

617
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:04,960
apply a sprayed pesticide or foliar feed

618
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:06,479
that was harder to say than it looked

619
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,759
they're far enough apart that i can get

620
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,120
all the plants carefully and

621
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,640
individually

622
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,879
i keep them in the three to five gallon

623
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
pot i veg them out or i keep them i

624
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,559
guess

625
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,559
i try to keep them around 18 inches 24

626
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,558
inches tall sometimes they'll hit about

627
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:21,839
three feet tall once they get about that

628
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,599
three feet tall they start getting

629
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:25,678
unruly out of control i have to make too

630
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:27,918
many adjustments that's when i'll take

631
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,759
as many clones as i can get from one

632
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,200
plant i'll get as many clones as i can

633
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:32,879
get from that one plant so i'll make

634
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,880
sure that i'm gonna get a keeper i'll

635
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,760
have a row of all of my mom plants in a

636
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,440
clone dome temporarily um

637
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,519
we'll get roots as soon as i see roots

638
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,759
and as soon as i know i've got security

639
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,279
i will toss that big mother plant or

640
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,640
maybe i'll put it into flour we're going

641
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,558
to talk that about that in a moment

642
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,080
maybe i'll drag it out to the greenhouse

643
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,759
uh i point it right there it's not right

644
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,960
there it's way the [ __ ] out there but

645
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,558
we'll take it out to the greenhouse out

646
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,840
in the middle of nowhere put it out

647
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:56,798
there make some seeds out of it you

648
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,119
never know what could happen but

649
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:01,359
oftentimes once they get big and unruly

650
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,719
uh i whack them down it hurts mike's

651
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,479
feelings mike has been here and helped

652
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,679
me put giant plants and trash cans and

653
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,599
he just shakes his head and he's like

654
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,759
buddy i wish we could put these outside

655
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,119
i'm like bro it's [ __ ] december like

656
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,240
we could but they're just gonna freeze

657
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:13,839
and it's gonna be like it's

658
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,679
heartbreaking a little bit to chop down

659
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,199
giant plants but once you realize uh

660
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,880
those plants have given me a hundred

661
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,360
clones and they've served their purpose

662
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,120
they've made a thousand seeds and 500

663
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,079
other plants and 40 pounds of weed and

664
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,599
you start thinking about all the other

665
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:27,918
[ __ ] they produced it's okay that that

666
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,279
big mother plant goes bye-bye so some

667
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,280
people are going to keep big mother

668
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,279
plants some people are going to keep

669
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,960
small mother plants i think i keep

670
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,678
medium-sized mother plants two to three

671
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,279
feet tall uh they're about uh probably

672
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,559
i'm a drummer that's probably 18 inches

673
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,200
around i'm thinking about the size of a

674
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,639
good floor tom 16 18 inches 18 inches

675
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,798
around at the top i can get plenty of

676
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,559
cuts from those

677
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,679
then sometimes let's talk about this is

678
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:54,319
this on my notes in this direction um

679
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,960
occasionally i will just drag that

680
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,439
mother plant in quotation marks into the

681
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,240
flower room and bloom it out if you were

682
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,798
using this mother plant as a clone donor

683
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,720
while it veged and you used those clones

684
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,158
to shape that plant

685
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,400
i always talk about when i'm running a

686
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,400
new plant i take that main top out and

687
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,240
use that as a clone when i'm lolly

688
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,919
popping i take two of the bottoms off

689
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,679
and i use those as clones now i've got

690
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,919
three clones

691
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,919
i could do that with a mother plant and

692
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,038
then flower it just as easily as i did

693
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,640
with my new seedling so sometimes if you

694
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:30,000
don't have space

695
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,000
for a full-on dedicated mother plant or

696
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,279
an arsenal of mother plants let's say

697
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,119
that you're limited

698
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,879
to only 12 plants and you want to keep a

699
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:38,879
genetic around but you can't dedicate a

700
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,799
mother space or a mother room

701
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,960
i use your veg plants as a mother plant

702
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,879
just perpetually have let's just say we

703
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,319
want to grow let's say lemon jeffrey

704
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
you've got a lemon jeffrey plant you

705
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,918
want to grow it over and over again but

706
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,839
you can't keep a dedicated mom you've

707
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,320
got a plant of it grow it up like you're

708
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,240
gonna veg it take the top out take a

709
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,200
clone of that take the two bottoms off

710
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,279
of it because you're gonna clean the

711
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,880
bottom of this plant up anyway take two

712
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,960
bottoms off of it create clones out of

713
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
that now you've got three clones

714
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,400
one of them should root if you've

715
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,919
watched my clone tech video

716
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
there's a full podcast about cutting

717
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,320
clones i cut clones in the video if you

718
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:16,319
watch that follow that sop you will have

719
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:18,079
success one of those three clones will

720
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:20,158
root if you do this so

721
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,359
get the three clones now once you've got

722
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,200
your three clones and you're sure that

723
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:25,519
they're going to root you can drag that

724
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,120
big plant into the flower room and just

725
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,400
take good care of those clones maybe

726
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,719
wait a little bit longer if you're not

727
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,400
super experienced but you've got secure

728
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,919
cuts you can keep vegging also if your

729
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,480
veg time isn't up if you're still

730
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:39,280
vegging waiting longer you can cut those

731
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,519
clones get them rooted put them into a

732
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:43,440
small pot let them grow and you've got

733
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,240
three of them over there now you've got

734
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:48,080
mother plants for backup

735
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,159
pick the best one keep that as your

736
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,918
growing plant or keep those three for

737
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,679
veg for the next run you've got plants

738
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,200
for the next run and then guess what

739
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,120
when it's time to run the next run

740
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,038
you've got those three plants take the

741
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,639
three tops as clones you could probably

742
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,720
pull a [ __ ] nine or twelve off the

743
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,960
bottom of those now you got at least

744
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,640
three to 12 clones to [ __ ] with again

745
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,200
drag those big plants into the flower

746
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,520
room you got your clones pot those pot

747
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,960
them again veg them get them stronger

748
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,278
repeat the process so you don't

749
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,679
necessarily need a dedicated mother

750
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,480
plant as long as you remember to take a

751
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,720
clone or as many clones as you need from

752
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,240
your crop before you flower it out most

753
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,960
of us are topping our plants cutting the

754
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,720
bottoms off anyway so why not if you're

755
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,480
doing three big plants in the flower

756
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
room four big plants in the flower room

757
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,159
you've got four tops [ __ ] what is

758
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,000
that eight bottoms you could take off

759
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,240
there that's gonna give you however many

760
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,480
what that is eight was sixteen twenty

761
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,440
four some number and multiples of four

762
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,720
as a drummer i should have followed

763
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,759
along it's probably twelve is probably

764
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,558
the number i'm [ __ ] up and i'm a

765
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,759
drummer is why i didn't think of 12. um

766
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,359
you can get your cuts off of those

767
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,200
plants the amount of plants you're about

768
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,798
to flower is the amount of cuts you need

769
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,558
probably right if you're keeping a cycle

770
00:24:52,798 --> 00:24:56,400
going so you got three big plants take

771
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,319
three big clones and do it all over

772
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,759
again you don't need a dedicated mother

773
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:01,918
i hope i made that clear because i

774
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:04,240
talked about it for a really long time

775
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,080
veg the plant cut a clone

776
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,240
veg that plant while that one's vegging

777
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:10,240
throw the other one into flour as soon

778
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,480
as that one's ready cut more cones from

779
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,159
it throw it into flour you got clones

780
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,480
they're right there as long as your

781
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,159
clone tech is solid or as long as you

782
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,519
wait until you can get that clone into a

783
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
pot and get it grown big enough to where

784
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,720
you're secure that you've got it if

785
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
you've got two or three copies you know

786
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,679
you've got it there

787
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,640
then throw it into flour and if all else

788
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,159
fails

789
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,840
we can re-veg the one that's in the

790
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,440
flower room we can take a cut from that

791
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,798
one so that is an easy way to keep the

792
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,278
mother plants you don't have to keep it

793
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,918
dedicated mother plant god i went on for

794
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,440
way too long about that um rotate your

795
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,520
mom's occasionally if you're not going

796
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,480
to do the rotational move like i just

797
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,798
talked about

798
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,400
uh refresh renew and rotate your mother

799
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,480
plants occasionally i said i do it about

800
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,240
every six months once a year depending

801
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,000
on the genetics the situation the size

802
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,079
of the room sometimes that goes more

803
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,759
quickly sometimes it takes longer and a

804
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:57,199
commercial grow

805
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,200
i may do it sooner because the plants

806
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,120
grow so largely under all of those

807
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,558
lights now here's something people are

808
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,239
going to talk about

809
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,440
the word you're going to try to spit out

810
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,599
throw at me

811
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,278
use for controversy type in the comments

812
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:10,558
is the word genetic drift and right now

813
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,119
i'm gonna go

814
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:15,440
wrong nope genetic drift is not possible

815
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,278
in this situation uh if you listen to

816
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,759
the full episode i did call genetic

817
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,599
drift that will explain why this is not

818
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:24,319
genetic drift if you do notice that your

819
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:26,558
plants are getting weaker over time

820
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,639
genetic drift is not the cause of this

821
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,798
if you keep a healthy mother plant and

822
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,720
you take healthy clones in a clean

823
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,319
environment and you grow those clones

824
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,000
properly and love them and take care of

825
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,240
them and feed them and don't let them

826
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,119
get any pathogens or problems you can

827
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,440
perpetually keep those plants forever

828
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:45,359
you will not face any problems if you

829
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,159
keep them clean don't let them get any

830
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,479
viruses any pathogens no bugs everything

831
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,000
like that will degrade the quality of

832
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,278
your plants that will give you weaker

833
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,759
plants

834
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,679
less strength less vigor you'll start

835
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:59,038
seeing changes also different

836
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,440
environments will give you different

837
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,440
changes so if you think that the plant

838
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,120
is changing your clone tech or the

839
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,120
environment possibly are changing from

840
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:09,359
that plant maybe your humidity

841
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,199
your warmth anything could change will

842
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,639
give the plant a little bit different

843
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,319
expression i noticed that my winter

844
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,559
crops and my summer crops are different

845
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:17,759
in the same room with the same cuts

846
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:19,759
just basically because of the

847
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,919
environmental factors i cannot control

848
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,079
can't dial in because of the extremes we

849
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,440
face here in colorado we get a negative

850
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:29,359
17 in the winter and [ __ ] 117 in the

851
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,360
summer so i've got a lot to work with i

852
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,119
see a lot of different conditions it's

853
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,038
my responsibility to dial them in i get

854
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:37,599
as close as i can trust me but it's a

855
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,359
lot to work with sometimes however

856
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:42,398
genetic drift is not the word you may

857
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:45,119
see problems some degradation but in my

858
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:47,599
opinion in my experience healthy plants

859
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,759
make healthy clones for generations i

860
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,480
told you i kept that flow clone around

861
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,720
for at least 10 years when i decided to

862
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,960
get rid of it it was just as beautiful

863
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,319
and healthy as the day i got it i cut a

864
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,840
bunch of clones of it when i was done

865
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:01,759
with it and i spread those clones out to

866
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,278
my friends i felt that was the polite

867
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:05,519
thing to do i was like hey you guys love

868
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,200
flow i've been growing her for years i'm

869
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,960
done with her instead of just taking her

870
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,319
out back and shooting her maybe i'll

871
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,600
give you guys a bunch of cuts and you

872
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,278
can let it live on just don't let me

873
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,199
[ __ ] smell it smoke it i don't want

874
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:16,960
to be around it anymore nothing wrong

875
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,519
with that plant you guys i'm just done

876
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,480
with it i've smelled so much flow i grew

877
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,079
so much flow smoked so much flow that uh

878
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,919
i'm done i don't want to smell it taste

879
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,759
it look at it i woke up every morning

880
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,919
smelling flow then i would go to the

881
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,319
dispensary at which i worked and we sold

882
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,720
flow and guess what just smell sell

883
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,000
smoke more flow i got sick of it

884
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,839
shout out to flow from progressive

885
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,200
nothing but love also a big shout out to

886
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,558
dj short

887
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,000
and everybody involved in that flow

888
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,599
story you guys know where the flow came

889
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,519
from if you know you know big up and

890
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,959
thank you much respect all right healthy

891
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:49,119
plants make healthy clones i don't think

892
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,880
genetic drift is a thing it's definitely

893
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,798
not a thing when we're cloning plants do

894
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,840
some research i've already explained why

895
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,918
in a full episode all right my friend

896
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,839
used to be cool i think i've rambled on

897
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,159
for long enough about mother plants feed

898
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,678
them veg nutrients give them lots of veg

899
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,120
light keep them in a big enough pot to

900
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,200
where they don't get root bound because

901
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,359
they will get root bound and they may

902
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,278
give you some problems there

903
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,558
shape them the way you need them

904
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,278
to give you the amount of clones as

905
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:17,440
frequently as you need rotate them out

906
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,359
you don't need a keeper mom all the time

907
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,960
as long as you've got a veg plant of

908
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:23,519
that mom you have got the genetics

909
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,600
stored cut a clone of it get that clone

910
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,839
rooted put that big plant into flower

911
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:29,278
perpetually keep that bad [ __ ] around

912
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,038
that's how you can do it all right

913
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:33,519

episode of the grow from your heart

920
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,038
podcast i did have a good time recording

921
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,798
this one felt super comfortable tonight

922
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,558
sometimes this microphone just sounds so

923
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,240
good in the headphones

924
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:52,319
sometimes it doesn't let's hope it edits

925
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,599
as well as it recorded big shout out to

926
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:55,278
this camera

927
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,719
for holding on camera number two could
