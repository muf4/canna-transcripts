right i don't want to ramble too much

79
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,719
here at the start of the show i feel

80
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
like we could talk for a long time about

81
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,359
this topic so let's jump right into this

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,239
email this one came from patreon it came

83
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,239
from our friend luke and it goes a lot

84
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,800
like this it says hey ross to jeff i

85
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,120
just finished the podcast the podcast

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,439
about back cross would you do another

87
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,640
one on the same topic just go a little

88
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:13,359
further like talking about an rb x1 and

89
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:16,559
keep crossing it to itself or better yet

90
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,239
crossing it back to its mom or an rb x1

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,000
s1 to a p1 or crossing that to an s3 to

92
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
an s1 it looks like you just grabbed a

93
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,639
bunch of seed packs and saw those

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,319
letters on there and just decided to

95
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,439
throw a bunch of those in the email i

96
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,000
know what you're saying i know what

97
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,318
you're asking for we can delve into this

98
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
it says i love the show and all of the

99
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,560
knowledge it brings us you can say my

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,039
name say my name say my name big shout

101
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,719
out to my buddy luke61 uh thank you for

102
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,359
the great question and for the continued

103
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:46,080
patreon support this is a good question

104
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,440
we see this on a lot of seed packs i am

105
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
a seed maker

106
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,799
seed seller i try to label my seed packs

107
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:55,119
quite clearly i see a lot of other

108
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,080
seed makers and seed breeders and seed

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,039
sellers

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,959
creating

111
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,359
really confusing seed labels and i see a

112
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,878
lot of arbitrary things out there so

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,040
let's try to talk a little bit about

114
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:08,158
some of those letters and labels that we

115
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,759
see on our seed packages

116
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:11,840
now luke did ask about some very

117
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,039
specific lettering in here but i do want

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,799
to start with a little bit of a

119
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,719
foundation what can we learn without a

120
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,280
foundation so let's start from the

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,639
beginning most of the time we're going

122
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,119
to see things like f1 or f2 if we see

123
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,879
the letter f in there that means filial

124
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
generation most of the time if you see

125
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:30,680
an f it is going to be a regular male

126
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,199
female

127
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,560
non-feminized c that will not always be

128
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:40,240
the case but most of the time a f1 and

129
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,399
f2 will be a regular male female seed

130
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,280
we will talk about s1s and r1s in a

131
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,719
moment those are also f1s we'll talk

132
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,198
more about that in a minute but i wanted

133
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,759
to just throw that out there and s1 is

134
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:55,439
also an f1 but an f1 is not always an s1

135
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,639
that will that will make sense in just a

136
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:57,918
minute but i wanted to make sure to put

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,519
that out there

138
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,279
so when we take two plants that are

139
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:04,000
vastly different and we breed them

140
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,159
together we are now making an f1 hybrid

141
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
if those plants are too close together

142
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
we haven't done our proper breeding that

143
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,759
is a polyhybrid that is a whole other

144
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,680
podcast conversation that we could talk

145
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,680
about in the future i would love your

146
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,319
feedback and input on talking about the

147
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,720
difference in f1s and poly hybrids that

148
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,199
can be a fun conversation so most of the

149
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,479
time if we see the letter f that is

150
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,560
indicating filial generation and f1

151
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,240
means it is the first time that that has

152
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,240
been crossed that golden goat and

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,478
daybreaker have been crossed we just

154
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:39,360
made a rise f1 it is the first filial

155
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:41,680
generation now if i were to find a male

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,759
and a female from that first batch of

157
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,079
seeds we take the daybreaker and the

158
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,038
golden goat we breed them together it

159
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,279
makes seeds that is an f1 if i grow out

160
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,959
those seeds and find an awesome male and

161
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:56,000
an awesome female and cross those

162
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:59,279
together we have now made f2 we are

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,879
making filial generation number two

164
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,359
as long as we keep repeating that

165
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:06,399
process we are moving forward and in

166
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,960
what is called the filial generation we

167
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,799
take the plants that come out of f2 we

168
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,519
grow those we find a solid male and a

169
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,400
solid female we breed those together we

170
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,959
have now made the f3 repeat that process

171
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:21,038
all the way up to f6 and you will make

172
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,198
totally completely stable plants that

173
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:26,318
look like clones of each other if you

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,879
have done the selection process properly

175
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,360
so that is moving forward in filial

176
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:33,199
generations f1 f2

177
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,199
that should make sense i'll just keep

178
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,199
going number wise as long as we're

179
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,038
pulling from that batch of seeds and not

180
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,639
adulterating and going backwards or

181
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,560
bringing in new plants anywhere you were

182
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
moving forward with the filial

183
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,199
generation you take a male and a female

184
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,360
you make new seeds that is f1 you take a

185
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,120
male and a female from that batch and

186
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
now you breed them together you make f2

187
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,598
you take a male and a female from that

188
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,759
batch you make f3 i think i've made that

189
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,519
clear now let's talk about where do we

190
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,439
go from there let's jump into the back

191
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:04,240
cross i did talk about back cross in a

192
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,399
previous episode we will talk about that

193
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,478
the bat cross if i were to take the

194
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,279
golden goat and the daybreaker and breed

195
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,839
them together we have now made an f1 if

196
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,198
i were to take the male plant or we

197
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:16,478
could do the female but we're to stick

198
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,120
with the male for

199
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,680
my topic here if i were to find a male

200
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,319
plant out of that f1 batch and pollinate

201
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,720
the original golden goat girl again that

202
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,800
is a bat cross if you use one of the

203
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
plants that you used in the original if

204
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,120
you go backwards if you cross back to

205
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
one of the original parents you are back

206
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,478
crossing the reason we would do that is

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,560
to stabilize and isolate the traits of

208
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,800
that original parent plant that is the

209
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,720
focus of the back cross podcast so you

210
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,598
can listen to that to learn all about

211
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,560
back crossing so an f1 is when we make

212
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:51,279
new stuff uh f2 f3 is when we breed that

213
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,280
further down the line uh with itself not

214
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,159
back to another plant but forward with

215
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:57,679
itself bat cross would be going back to

216
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,599
one of the original parents no matter

217
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,720
what generation you're using you can

218
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,399
always back cross you can do an f3 back

219
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,479
to the one of the original parents you

220
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:08,159
could do an f4 back to the parent it

221
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,519
would still be a back cross you may

222
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,520
label that

223
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:16,159
golden goat how would you label it

224
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:17,519
golden goat two uh a rise f4 back cross

225
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,439
that's how that would be because if you

226
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:21,680
use the f4 you'd want to indicate that

227
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,279
the f4 was used in there a lot of people

228
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,759
just want to know that information a lot

229
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,119
of this is just a lot of it isn't

230
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,960
important if you're just growing this

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,959
and enjoying it a lot of this is

232
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,598
important if you're going to make seeds

233
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,278
and sell or share them or if you're just

234
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,640
really trying to document history of

235
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,038
cannabis a lot of this won't be

236
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,718
important to a smoker or a consumer it

237
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,319
wouldn't matter to you at all but if

238
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,560
you're kind of nerding out and creating

239
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,080
things and wanting to know history and

240
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,079
how to make labels and how to understand

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
the labels better this would help you

242
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,720
out all right so we've done f1 i feel

243
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,839
like we've covered back cross now let's

244
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,680
talk about r and s rns is when people

245
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,440
get confused

246
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,759
i've talked about this before the

247
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,920
easiest way for me to explain this is

248
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,480
reversal is when we are making feminized

249
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,719
seeds we will take a female plant and

250
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,879
treat it with the solution now we have

251
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,879
reversed that plant to become a pollen

252
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,120
donor we're not going to label we're not

253
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:17,120
going to label that plant as a male

254
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
we're going to label that plant as a

255
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,679
pollen donor because it is not a male it

256
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,360
is also not a hermaphrodite when you

257
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,439
guys talk about

258
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
feminized seeds and feminize plants and

259
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
reversing plants stop saying

260
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,278
hermaphrodite because it is not a

261
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:33,838
hermaphrodite if it were an intersex

262
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,679
plant i would not use it i am using a

263
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,320
solid female plant that is treated with

264
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,639
a solution to create pollen it is not a

265
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,680
hermaphrodite it is not intersex that is

266
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,000
my rant on that let me stay on focus

267
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,759
i would take a female plant and treat it

268
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,480
with a solution now it will create

269
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,720
pollen that pollen is now feminized

270
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,680
pollen what i do with that pollen

271
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,000
dictates if i am creating s or r

272
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,359
generations now let's talk about that an

273
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,360
r generation would be a reversal if i

274
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,399
reverse that plant and put that pollen

275
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,879
on any other cultivar other than itself

276
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,320
we have just made a reversal that is an

277
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:13,200
r1

278
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,320
let's talk about lemon jeffrey as an r1

279
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:19,200
lemon jeffrey is a reversed golden goat

280
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,959
pollinated pollinated a lemon skunk so

281
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,200
we got a reverse golden goat took the

282
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:25,679
pollen put that on lemon skunk the

283
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,278
offspring from that is the lemon jeffrey

284
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:32,000
that is an r1 i used reversed pollen put

285
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:35,600
it on a different plant we made an r1

286
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,679
that is the that is an s1 that is an s1

287
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:41,040
because it is the first creation the

288
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:43,679
first filial generation of this plant

289
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,679
but i would use r1 to indicate to my

290
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:47,199
customers my consumers the people buying

291
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,759
these seeds the people looking at the

292
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,519
website that this is a feminized

293
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,679
creation that is why i would go with the

294
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,919
r in that indication to show you it's

295
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,958
been reversed pollen and it is the first

296
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,278
time we have done that it is an r1 now

297
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,039
where does the s come in you'll never

298
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,039
forget this it sounds crass but i

299
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,278
promise you'll never forget

300
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,278
the letter s in that indication stands

301
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:12,559
for self which means that plant

302
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:15,600
basically [ __ ] itself if we were to

303
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,838
take golden goat reverse the golden goat

304
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,920
pollinate another clone of the golden

305
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,399
goat we are making golden goat s-1 that

306
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,078
is a golden goat self-plant there's

307
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
nothing else in that golden goat to

308
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,039
adulterate those golden goat genetics i

309
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,879
took a golden goat plant i reversed it

310
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,039
put put another golden goat plant up

311
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,200
there and it basically [ __ ] itself

312
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,360
that sounds crass but i promise you're

313
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,440
going to remember that that is a self

314
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,839
plant that is when a plant is flipped

315
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,040
reversed pollinated itself and [ __ ]

316
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,639
itself and makes seeds of itself that is

317
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:53,519
a feminized golden goat s1

318
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,839
also an f1

319
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,799
so basically when we make feminized

320
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,360
seeds if it is a reversal if the pollen

321
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,679
from the donor plant is used on any

322
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,320
other plants that is an r1 that is a

323
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,838
reversal if that feminized pollen is put

324
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,839
back on the same plant that it was

325
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,279
reversed from the same cultivar it would

326
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,120
be a different clone but it's the same

327
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:16,078
plant basically you see what i'm saying

328
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,240
that would be an s because it is selfing

329
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,000
itself you'll never forget that it just

330
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,799
selfed itself it's either it's been

331
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,399
reversed or self so let's talk more

332
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,958
about some of the details which you

333
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:31,039
asked oh uh you said p1 you included the

334
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:33,359
letters p1 in here p1 p means parent so

335
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,360
p just stands for parent is what p is in

336
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
that equation now let's talk a little

337
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,399
bit more you said can you talk about

338
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:41,919
taking it further like

339
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,919
taking an rb x1 which is a reversed back

340
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,159
cross one let's talk about what is a

341
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,078
reversed back cross one let's uh

342
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,000
decipher this code

343
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:52,479
all right so i'm going to pick a plant

344
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
to give an example with this rbx1 i'm

345
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,920
just going to pick blueberry cookies

346
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,399
because i work with that a lot it does

347
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,879
make great reversals great fem seeds

348
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,000
great outcrosses let me try to explain a

349
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:06,559
little bit about what this rb x1 is

350
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,958
without having the actual seed package

351
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,719
in front of me i don't know uh what they

352
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,319
did there and i don't know where you got

353
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,160
the idea so i'm going to try to explain

354
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,320
this to the best of my knowledge i have

355
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:20,078
a good idea uh who you're reading these

356
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,560
uh letters from rbx1 the r indicates

357
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:26,000
that that is a reversal so this will be

358
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,879
feminized bx1 indicates that there was a

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,519
plant that was selected and bred back to

360
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,958
its parent for a desired trait without

361
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,278
knowing a little bit more history of

362
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,278
this i don't know exactly which order it

363
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:39,600
happened but it sounds like we took a

364
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,600
plant and reversed it and put that

365
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,839
pollen back on one of its parents is

366
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,240
possibly what happened here because you

367
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,920
were it's a reversal which is an r so i

368
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,759
would assume we've got the plant we

369
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,559
treated it with the solution that plant

370
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:55,439
made pollen then we put that pollen back

371
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,759
onto one of its parents would be my

372
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,199
assumption here again without the uh

373
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,198
without the seed pack without more

374
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,958
details without more of the story all i

375
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,399
can do is make assumptions and try to

376
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,119
decipher this code here but rbx1 would

377
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,198
be

378
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
if you took a plant and reversed it and

379
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,519
put that pollen from that plant back

380
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,600
onto one of its parents would be an easy

381
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,120
way to explain that one

382
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,278
so let me try to think of how that would

383
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,000
go we would take a blueberry cookies

384
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,078
plant and then we would uh reverse that

385
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,919
and we would pollinate another plant it

386
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,759
doesn't matter which plant that is uh

387
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,399
we'll say that we pollinated strawberry

388
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,000
fields and we just made the raphael

389
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,958
so now we've got blueberry cookies to

390
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,198
strawberry fields makes raphael now at

391
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,399
this point we've got to do a back cross

392
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,559
so i think we're going to take the

393
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,639
raphael plant which is the blueberry

394
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,638
cookies and the strawberry fields we're

395
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,959
going to treat that with a solution

396
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,198
which will make that plant make pollen

397
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,599
now we can take that pollen and put it

398
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:54,000
back on either the blueberry cookies or

399
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,519
the strawberry fields plant or we could

400
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,519
do the opposite we could reverse the

401
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,120
blueberry cookies or the strawberry

402
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,480
fields and put that to the raphael but

403
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,600
i'm not sure which order they did it

404
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,959
because i don't have more details but

405
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,720
that kind of gives me an idea of what

406
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,879
happened there was a reversal and

407
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,800
something went back to apparent without

408
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:15,198
more of the equation i can't really do

409
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,958
the math uh there's algebra to be done

410
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:17,919
here and i don't have the other letters

411
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,399
all right

412
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:24,838
so that is rbx1

413
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:27,919
all right then you wrote s1 crossed to

414
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,240
p1 if we selected a keeper from that uh

415
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:32,479
batch of feminized seeds and put it back

416
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,639
to one of the original parents is what

417
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,639
it sounds like that would be that would

418
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,720
have to be feminized right because we're

419
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,639
making a reversal in s1 that's a

420
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,639
feminized project back to one of the

421
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,799
original parents that would be a fem

422
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,480
project that uh that's kind of almost is

423
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:47,838
that an s1 bad that's kind of a back

424
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,000
cross right there you're doing a

425
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,920
feminized back to one of its parents

426
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,320
that's a really good way to lock in

427
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,919
certain traits if you find a feminized

428
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,920
seed with the trait that you're looking

429
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,159
for cross it back to one of his parents

430
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:02,479
that is a her appearance that is a

431
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:03,838
really good way to lock in and isolate

432
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,199
traits that you're looking for that

433
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,120
would work really well or crossing an s3

434
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,240
to an s1

435
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,799
um

436
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,919
if you're doing an s3 to an s1 that is

437
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,958
the same line that is a back cross if

438
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:20,639
you're doing an s3 to an s1 like a self

439
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,119
plant let's just say that we got a

440
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:25,600
golden goat uh where are we

441
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,078
s3 s3 just sounds weird i don't think

442
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,159
anybody even does s3 yeah i'm not

443
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,000
familiar with anybody that does an s3

444
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,000
i've seen s2s i'm not sure that colin's

445
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
going to s3 or not

446
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
but so let's just say that we took a

447
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,759
golden goat and selfed it and then

448
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,120
golden that golden goat and selfed it

449
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,199
and did it again and did it again to the

450
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,039
third generation and then if we just

451
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,359
took a different plant there was an s1

452
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,039
like a lemon skunk s1 across those

453
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,440
you're just making another f1 that is

454
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:54,719
just another poly hybrid uh it would be

455
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,920
an s1 an f1 or a poly hybrid probably

456
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,759
fit in all of those categories

457
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,639
but honestly technically most of these

458
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,400
labels don't really matter unless you

459
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,480
are the breeder unless you really want

460
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,079
to know the details about how these

461
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,038
plants were made what came from these

462
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:10,558
plants

463
00:17:09,038 --> 00:17:12,078
if you're that passionate and that

464
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,078
curious about the crosses and the

465
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,078
history i'm sure that a little bit of

466
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,000
research on the website of the breeder

467
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,678
that made those seeds will give you a

468
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,000
lot of clues of what they've been doing

469
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,240
you can see the history of a lot of my

470
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,759
crosses and where things have gone

471
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,359
just if you looked at like the current

472
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,839
stuff you could see what's been crossed

473
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,359
to add up to what we've got going on now

474
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:32,798
so if you did a little bit of diving a

475
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,199
little bit of investigation you could

476
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,679
probably reverse engineer most of the

477
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,840
crosses that you see on a lot of popular

478
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:41,600
breeders websites i think i understand

479
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,279
where you're getting these ideas my

480
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,079
friend colin at the ethos collective at

481
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,918
etho seeds likes to use the rs the s's

482
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,359
the bx um

483
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,600
and honestly

484
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:54,159
these labels are kind of being uh

485
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,399
bastardized and readjusted and

486
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,679
reinvented to suit the cannabis industry

487
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,640
we're not really using them the

488
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,200
technical way uh that they were meant to

489
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,280
be done in agriculture and horticulture

490
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,840
i really don't even think that bx is the

491
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,200
correct term my friend f1 pete i could

492
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,079
see a little vein in his head his head

493
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,558
tries to rupture every time we say bx

494
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,319
so we may start adjusting and correcting

495
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,918
that to bc because it is back cross

496
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,359
again i said bx

497
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,919
we use that because when we're listing

498
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:23,678
crosses we put the x in there and when

499
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,679
you go to back cross it you just use the

500
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,679
x because it stands for cross and it's

501
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,000
back cross it makes sense but i honestly

502
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,240
don't think it is correct the cannabis

503
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,640
industry is kind of bastardized and uh

504
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
just created and altered this labeling

505
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
system to work for us

506
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,720
um

507
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,399
one thing i can say though when we're

508
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,480
listing genetics this may be kind of a

509
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,080
side ramp but this is important always

510
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,759
list ladies first or pollen donor first

511
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,759
because sometimes we're working with

512
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,519
feminized reverse plants i don't want to

513
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,640
call that one a boy that is a reversed

514
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:57,440
lady in 2021 we've got to use the proper

515
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,000
pronouns that is a reversal not a dude

516
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,480
not a lady that's a reversal definitely

517
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,400
not a hermaphrodite not intersex it's

518
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,440
definitely not a herme hermes not even a

519
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,519
word

520
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
that word sounds so third grade to me

521
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,798
herme

522
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,240
just say herm or intersex intersex is

523
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,480
the real word all right ladies and

524
