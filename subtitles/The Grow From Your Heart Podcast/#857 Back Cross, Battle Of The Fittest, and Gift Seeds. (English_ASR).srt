I did mention that I was selling clones

36
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,240
on edirect decom many people took

37
00:01:30,599 --> 00:01:34,599
advantage of that clone drop a lot of

38
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,319
people got GMO clones a lot of people

39
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:40,359
got lemon Jeffrey clones unfortunately

40
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:41,959
it has been 30° outside in Colorado and

41
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:44,040
I am not comfortable shipping those

42
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,640
clones so they have not left yet those

43
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,079
clones are still in the cloner being

44
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,960
well taken care of those clones will

45
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:52,879
ship as soon as the weather is better it

46
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,759
should be warmer probably Monday or

47
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,718
Tuesday I will get those clones in the

48
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,680
mail for you as soon as the weather is

49
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,478
better you do not want those clones in

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,439
the mail while it is 30 agrees they will

51
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,799
not survive they will not make it you

52
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,919
will be very mad at me so I did us both

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,840
a favor and I waited a few days to send

54
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,920
those they should go out Monday or

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,319
Tuesday when the weather goes better I

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,039
promise they're ready the shipping

57
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,878
labels have been printed the boxes are

58
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:18,159
folded all I have to do is put that

59
00:02:15,878 --> 00:02:19,959
little clone into the uh the packaging

60
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,239
and send it to you it's just a matter of

61
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,039
weather at this time trust me uh you'll

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,640

from my new friend Biscuit Goes just

86
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:19,158
like this it says Hey Rost to Jeff I've

87
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,840
got a question for you and you know what

88
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:22,878
dude this was a great question it will

89
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,280
really get me rambling so thank you for

90
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,359
the good springboard here on the podcast

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,438
the question goes a little bit like this

92
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,360
it says can you please tell me the

93
00:03:29,438 --> 00:03:35,359
difference between a bx1 and an S1 seed

94
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,360
that's a very good question and yes I

95
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,400
will give you a very good detailed

96
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,840
explanation of the difference here the

97
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,080
question does go on it says uh my

98
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,598
understanding is that a bx1 is the plant

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,280
back cross to itself uh that's a little

100
00:03:46,598 --> 00:03:50,679
different I'm going to explain that um

101
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,719
there's a lot of stuff in here then it

102
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,000
says I have a pack of permanent marker

103
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:57,239
S1 from another breeder and on the

104
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,039
package it says permanent marker to

105
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,759
permanent marker Now isn't that a back

106
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:03,639
cross no um and I'm going to explain why

107
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,438
uh in some detail here in a moment it

108
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:07,039
says please help me understand this you

109
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,239
always explain things the best I

110
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,280
appreciate that then it says thanks in

111
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,959
advance my dude you are very welcome

112
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
thank you for the great question I've

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,720
got a lot of great notes Here let me try

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,399
to stay focused we will talk about this

115
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,000
we've got two very specific questions to

116
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,399
deal with here we're talking about what

117
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,759
is an S1 and what is a BX and then from

118
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:28,839
there we're going to talk about what are

119
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:30,879
the similarities and differences in

120
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,879
those things we're also going to touch

121
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:34,918
on a whole different realm called an R1

122
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:36,279
but you'll see where that fits in so

123
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:39,240
what are we going to start with let's

124
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,839
start with the BX or the BC if you will

125
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,439
the back cross what is a back cross why

126
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,198
would somebody do a back cross what's

127
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,478
the purpose why does it exist let's dig

128
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,960
into this a backat cross a backat cross

129
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,519
is essentially if you take um I'm going

130
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,439
to have to take a minute to unfold this

131
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,120
but it will all come together in the end

132
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:59,279
a backat cross if you take progyny of a

133
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,918
parent plant and breed them together if

134
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:04,119
you go backwards in a filial generation

135
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:06,439
that is a back cross you have bred back

136
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,399
to a previous generation back to a

137
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:09,959
previous parent that's why the word back

138
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,159
is in there you're going backwards in

139
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:13,799
the breeding which is not necessarily a

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,800
bad thing that is to stabilize things

141
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,160
that can lock things in let's talk about

142
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,038
the main reason why someone including

143
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,280
myself would do a back cross let's talk

144
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,599
about the plant Golden Goat everybody

145
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,839
knows I love working with Golden Goat

146
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,400
Golden Goat is what is known as a clone

147
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,799
only uh Golden Goat SE were never put

148
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,478
out until I did it the original breeder

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,840
never put out the Golden Goat seeds

150
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,359
there were no seeds released the only

151
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,560
way Golden Goat was put out to the

152
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,800
public was the breeder that made it

153
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
released a clone it was released as a

154
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,520
clone only that's a term that will be

155
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,199
important for the rest of this podcast

156
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,079
and learn about clone only it means a

157
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:52,160
lot clone only means the breeder that

158
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:54,359
made it never put out seeds of it so

159
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,120
there's no boy there's that one clone

160
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,960
it's that clone only version that's

161
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,918
what's available is the clone of Golden

162
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:02,680
Goat now I can make feminized seeds of

163
00:06:00,918 --> 00:06:04,279
Golden Goat and those are widely

164
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,240
available so that's one way to make

165
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:10,038
seeds but many people in the growing

166
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,079
Community are not into feminized seeds

167
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:14,240
they do not like fem seeds for whichever

168
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,839
reason and that is fine uh there's a lot

169
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,360
of stigma a lot of questions a lot of

170
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,560
miseducation around feminized seeds many

171
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,479
people simply do not prefer it and that

172
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,160
is okay that is the market that is what

173
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,719
people want so perhaps a grower wants

174
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,280
Golden Goat seeds but like I mentioned

175
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,240
before Golden Goat is a female clone

176
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:35,038
only so there are no pure Golden Goat

177
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,960
seeds now I want to make Golden Goat

178
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,839
what am I going to do to create Golden

179
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,719
Goat seeds that are not feminized what's

180
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:43,079
the easiest way to do it would be to

181
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,840
create a bat cross but to do that we

182
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,000
have to open up that Golden Goat we have

183
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,478
to adulterate with another plant it has

184
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,120
to be pollinated by something to create

185
00:06:49,478 --> 00:06:55,038
a starting batch of seeds so what I

186
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,879
would recommend what I have done this is

187
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,120
how I made my Golden Goat BX seeds I

188
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:02,039
took the original Golden Goat girl

189
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,639
I found another plant that was

190
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:06,598
completely different in all ways than

191
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,680
that Golden Goat plant I used a

192
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:10,839
daybreaker mail is the plant that I used

193
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,759
it's got giant leaves uh the golden

194
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:16,198
goat's got uh skinny thin sharp very

195
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,199
serrated leaves that daybreaker plant

196
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:19,759
has giant leaves that are they look like

197
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:21,160
dinner plates you could build a canopy

198
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,560
underneath them you could build a canoe

199
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,120
with them you could build a hammock with

200
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,240
them these were gigantic leaves uh the

201
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,199
Golden Goat grows kind of compact kind

202
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,000
of tight nodes kind of tight node inter

203
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,280
space ing uh the uh daybreaker was real

204
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,399
stretchy and real wide so I used that

205
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:39,399
daybreaker to pollinate my Golden Goat

206
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:41,399
plant The Offspring was really easy to

207
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:44,158
identify the plants that looked like

208
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:47,000
Golden Goat because they had skinny very

209
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:49,279
serrated leaves not big wide fingery uh

210
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,918
big fat leaves they were very different

211
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,598
anything with a big fat leave with a

212
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:54,560
stretchy shape I got rid of that

213
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:56,800
immediately CU that was not Golden Goat

214
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,598
that was daybreaker Heavy I got rid of

215
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,800
that I found a male plant that looked

216
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,038
just like the original Golden Goat so

217
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,319
what I'm doing is I'm washing out all of

218
00:08:04,038 --> 00:08:08,959
the traits from that daybreaker I've now

219
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,158
found a Golden Goat mail that looks just

220
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,918
like the original Golden Goat Mommy I

221
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,560
went as far as to pull leaves off of

222
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,198
both plants and hold them up next to

223
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,800
each other and look at the amount of

224
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,158
serrations and the shape of the leaves

225
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,720
and the spread between the fingers I was

226
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:24,560
really OCD about this selection so I

227
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
found a male that looked just like that

228
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,879
Golden Goat and then I pollinated the

229
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,840
Golden Goat with that now why is that a

230
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,440
batross because this Golden Goat was the

231
00:08:30,839 --> 00:08:35,519
original mom in that cross I took the

232
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,760
daybreaker I took the Golden Goat I made

233
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,719
seeds from those seeds I found a male

234
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,838
Golden Goat it's basically go it's it's

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,800
a cross but it looks just like Golden

236
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:48,080
Goat I took that pollen and I went back

237
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,120
to the mom and put that pollen on there

238
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,800
now that is now my Golden Goat backat

239
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,879
cross first generation that is why we

240
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:57,000
would do a batross that is how a batross

241
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:59,159
is done why would we do that because we

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,879
want seeds of that that are pure Golden

243
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:03,120
Goat but there's no way to make a Golden

244
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,639
Goat pure seed uh because perhaps you

245
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,600
don't have the parents there's only the

246
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,838
female so that's the first way to do it

247
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,040
you have to open up the line make seeds

248
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:12,920
you have to adulterate it adulterate it

249
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:16,039
make seeds and then the next step is to

250
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:18,278
start washing out the adulteration so I

251
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:20,240
have now made seeds I have found a plant

252
00:09:18,278 --> 00:09:21,838
that looks just like my Golden Goat I

253
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,200
breed that to Golden Goat that's going

254
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,680
to make more seeds I'm going to take

255
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,720
those seeds and guess what I'm going to

256
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,879
do again I'm going to find another one

257
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,879
that looks just like that Golden Goat

258
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,078
and put it back on the original Golden

259
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:36,879
Goat clone that is my batross 2 that's

260
00:09:35,078 --> 00:09:38,799
my second filial generation of that

261
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,240
batross there's a lot of different ways

262
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,479
you could go about doing that depending

263
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,320
on the traits you want what you're

264
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,560
looking for but that's the way that I

265
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,320
would do it keep keep making seeds back

266
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,278
to that Golden Goat and then what we're

267
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,680
doing is every time you go to the Golden

268
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,720
Goat plant with that pollen that progyny

269
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:55,239
has less and less of the daybreaker in

270
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,600
there so we're washing out that

271
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:00,079
daybreaker with each filial generation

272
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
if we do it correctly so that is a

273
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:04,399
batross that's how why and what I would

274
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,040
do a batross for now let's talk about

275
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,480
the other part of the question which was

276
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:12,120
s1's what is an S1 why would we do an S1

277
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,839
how was that useful let's focus again on

278
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,399
the original Golden Goat plant many

279
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:18,040
people out there in the world want the

280
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,000
Golden Goat plant I have got the

281
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:21,799
original Golden Goat clone there are a

282
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,399
lot of breeders a lot of Growers out

283
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:25,199
there a lot of medical consumers a lot

284
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,919
of recreational people out there they

285
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,879
would really enjoy and really benefit

286
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,679
from having Golden Goat seeds so they

287
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:34,000
can grow it and benefit from the effects

288
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:36,159
of this plant so I am able to offer pure

289
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,799
unadulterated feminized Golden Goat

290
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,399
seeds to the market now how do I do that

291
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,240
it is a very easy process once you

292
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:45,679
understand it I take a clone of the

293
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,399
Golden Goat I take another clone of the

294
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:49,199
Golden Goat I've got two clones of the

295
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:51,519
exact same plant they are both Golden

296
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,440
Goat so we are not introducing anything

297
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,240
new in this process at this time I will

298
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,320
treat one clone with a solution I'm

299
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,240
using silver tho sulfate I'm also

300
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,920
experimenting with the new product but

301
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,959
we will treat this clone with a solution

302
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,479
uh it's got to be the proper dilution

303
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:09,799
the proper intervals uh the proper time

304
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,320
there's a lot of stuff that goes on to

305
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,359
it I'm going to spray this plant seven

306
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,720
times over the course of its life and

307
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,839
what I'm going to do is create a

308
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,120
reaction in this plant that will create

309
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,839
this female plant to create pollen that

310
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:24,440
only contains female chromosomes yes I

311
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,600
know it sounds like a lot of Wizardry a

312
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,560
lot is going on once you understand the

313
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,399
science of it it's really not that

314
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,799
amazing that hard to understand I'm not

315
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,399
going to explain it here I've done a

316
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:36,639
full episode on this but I treat this

317
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,839
plant and right now I'm going to give a

318
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:41,560
big disclaimer the word Herm

319
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:42,839
hermaphrodite in sex is not involved in

320
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:45,518
this at all when you are making

321
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:47,720
feminized seeds the word Herm should not

322
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,560
be involved at all if Herman is in there

323
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:51,600
don't use it to make interex plant or

324
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:53,559
don't use that to make feminized plants

325
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,879
don't use any interex plants in any

326
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:58,319
breeding there is no Herm happening when

327
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,360
making fem seeds I'm treating a female

328
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,720
plant with a a solution I'm treating it

329
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:04,720
with silver thiosulfate the silver gets

330
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,800
into the plant it disrupts the copper

331
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,278
movement in that plant that creates a

332
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:11,799
hormonal reaction inside that plant that

333
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:14,078
makes it create anthers which create

334
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:16,439
pollen it is not a hermaphrodite it is

335
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,078
not a male it is a reversed female it is

336
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,839
a big difference than the other things I

337
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:23,000
mentioned those anthers will drop pollen

338
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,920
that pollen will be feminized pollen

339
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,159
because there are no male chromosomes

340
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:29,479
available in this plant so I'm going to

341
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,559
take that Golden Goat reversed pollen

342
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,920
put it on a Golden Goat female plant

343
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:37,719
guess what I just did I made pure Golden

344
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:40,479
Goat seeds that are all females so S1 is

345
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,959
all Golden Goat to Golden Goat the BX

346
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,839
one is Golden Goat to something else

347
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,759
then back to the Golden Goat to wash out

348
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,440
all that other stuff so the basic

349
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,439
difference is regular and feminized the

350
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:55,360
other difference is one is adulterated

351
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,360
and one is unadulterated Golden Goat uh

352
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,079
we can do filial generations with that

353
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,600
batross and wash out the whatever we use

354
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:05,078
to open it up or start the batross with

355
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,639
you can wash that out through two three

356
00:13:05,078 --> 00:13:08,919
definitely through four batross

357
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,759
generations but with the fem seeds

358
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,599
there's no need to wash it out with the

359
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,799
feminized seeds in the first batch 50%

360
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,720
of those seeds are going to look just

361
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:19,120
like the original Golden Goat then

362
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,079
you're going to get about 20 of them

363
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,198
that look like the mom of the Golden

364
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:24,638
Goat 20 that look like the dad of the

365
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,719
Golden Goat and then you're going to get

366
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,039
10% that are just [ __ ] weirdos

367
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,680
they're going to look like grandparents

368
00:13:28,039 --> 00:13:31,679
great grandparents

369
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,359
uh weird mutations of all of the above

370
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,519
that is just the way the genetics kind

371
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,000
of mix with that plant so let me check

372
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,399
my notes make sure I'm on track here to

373
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,399
keep myself going we have talked about

374
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:43,240
bat crosses we talked about when where

375
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:45,639
why and how that works we've talked

376
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,720
about making an S1 of the Golden Goat

377
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:51,039
now let's talk about r1s what is an R1

378
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,440
an R1 is very simple so let me give you

379
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,679
a phrase that you're going to remember

380
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,680
here that you'll never forget it's a

381
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,399
little crude it's a little crass promise

382
00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:01,198
you're never going to forget it and S1

383
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,440
uh self plant that plant selfed itself

384
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:05,919
it went and [ __ ] itself and S1 is

385
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,560
because that plant selfed itself it's an

386
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:11,198
S1 now an R1 now we're going to talk

387
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,799
about the r1s the S1 is if I were to

388
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,078
take the pollen and put it on the same

389
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:18,879
plant itself in R1 is if I take that

390
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:21,000
Golden Goat pollen and put it on any

391
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,320
other plant that is just indicating that

392
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,078
I have used reversed pollen to indicate

393
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,399
that this is a feminized project here uh

394
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:32,078
the R1 is the first filial generation a

395
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,078
reversal project the S1 is the first

396
00:14:32,078 --> 00:14:38,799
filial generation of a self project so

397
00:14:35,078 --> 00:14:41,679
S1 is a self R1 is a reversal meaning I

398
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:43,439
put the pollen on any plant other than

399
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,719
what I reversed I'm just opening up

400
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,440
doing more breeding and that is very a

401
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,240
very uh very viable breeding idea I do

402
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,040
that with a lot of stuff that is how

403
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,399
orange gasm is made that's how lemon

404
00:14:52,039 --> 00:14:57,360
Jeffree is made uh so when I'm making

405
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:59,240
Golden Goat fem seeds I I reverse one

406
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,278
Golden Goat plant and I put that that

407
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,120
pollen from that one plant on another

408
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,720
Golden Goat I just made Golden Goat s1's

409
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,720
while I'm in the room why not put it on

410
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:11,199
a Lemon Skunk to make some lemon Jeffrey

411
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,800
r1s put it on the uh the Platinum Tangi

412
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,198
to make orange gasm r1s why not just get

413
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:19,039
creative and do stuff like that so that

414
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:22,078
is the backat cross that is R1 and that

415
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:26,159
is S1 that's my story and I'm sticking

416
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:29,000
to it uh my dude biscuit bro thank you

417
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,879
for the great question oh also I can't

418
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,159
speak for the breeder that made that

419
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,278
package I don't know exactly what

420
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:36,318
they're doing but with what the details

421
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:38,879
you have given me um that is going to be

422
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:40,679
an S1 they took just like they said they

423
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:42,639
took that permanent marker plant the

424
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,599
other permanent marker plant uh they

425
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,120
reversed one put the pollen on the other

426
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,120
they did not add anything else they

427
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:50,679
didn't go backwards if it's feminized

428
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,360
you have got yourself a permanent marker

429
00:15:50,679 --> 00:15:55,078
S1 is what you've got there once again

430
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,000
my dude biscuit make sure you check your

431
00:15:55,078 --> 00:15:59,638

435
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,440
another question here in front of me

436
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:11,360
this question also came from the growel

437
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,560
tab on iry genetics.com the question

438
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,519
came from our new friend Barry Bryant

439
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:17,078
Barry Bryant welcome to the IR Army

440
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,560

00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:24,599
free pack of seeds the question goes a

444
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,278
little bit like this it says greetings

445
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,639
my dude greetings bro good to hear from

446
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:31,360
you it says this thought was brought to

447
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,278
you by by orange GM the tasty breakfast

448
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,839
treat to get your day started that's a

449
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,198
really good tagline a really good ad I

450
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,839
should have put that on the packaging

451
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:42,879
but I did not there is more it says

452
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,880
anyhow I do have a hypothetical idea or

453
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,559
question for you this is a good question

454
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,879
I like this it says what if I have a 2

455
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:53,479
by two veg tin with one big pot of soil

456
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,679
then I throw in a handful of seeds and

457
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:59,680
let the seeds fight for survival one

458
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,919
plant remains is that one actually the

459
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,838
keeper or is that a dumb way to sort

460
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:08,279
through a batch of beans uh that is one

461
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:10,720
way to do it but in my opinion you're

462
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,599
not going to find the plant with the

463
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,679
best TPS the best Buzz the best

464
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,918
resistance to pathogens the best

465
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,679
resistance to bugs uh you're going to

466
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,079
find the plant that uh just fights the

467
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,120
best which might not be uh the best

468
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:26,558
plant for smoking consuming selling

469
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,000
medicating whatever you're going to do

470
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,639
with it uh that is the plant with the

471
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,558
strongest Roots the most aggressive

472
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,320
plant uh before I've talked about

473
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,200
selecting male plants from a population

474
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,720
I'm going to say that this may have the

475
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,759
same sort of criteria let's just say

476
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,200
that you do find one plant that is super

477
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,279
vigorous and super strong in winds that

478
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:49,840
is going to be the plant with the most

479
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:51,599
robust Roots the most fibrous stocks uh

480
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,399
that is not necessarily going to be the

481
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:57,399
plant with the biggest fattest juiciest

482
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,720
stickiest stinkiest most Tricom Laden

483
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,720
buds um just just like when I talk about

484
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,038
selecting males I say if we've got five

485
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,679
male plants to choose from that first

486
00:18:04,038 --> 00:18:07,759
plant that grows real tall and shows

487
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,120
that it's a boy and is real vigorous get

488
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,919
rid of that because it's just too

489
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:13,239
vigorous you're making hemp fiber it's

490
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,480
going to be all male in the breeding mix

491
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,519
I feel like your your female plant that

492
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,279
survives this run is just going to be

493
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,000
real hempy real fibrous it's not going

494
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,399
to be good smoke it'll be a badass

495
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,038
grower it might be something to breed to

496
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,000
to add uh productivity Vigor strength

497
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:29,919
and all that into another plant but I

498
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,159
don't think it's going to be the one uh

499
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,200
that we're going to want to smoke it's

500
00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,000
not going to be the one that makes

501
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,120
people say damn it'll be the one that

502
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,960
makes the grower say damn but not the

503
00:18:36,119 --> 00:18:39,798
consumer not the clientele not the

504
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,640
patients not the customers and that's

505
00:18:39,798 --> 00:18:43,798
who we're trying to impress uh the

506
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,480
people that actually smoke the [ __ ] so

507
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,798
it's a good idea it's a fun game to play

508
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,679
I do like the battle of the fittest idea

509
00:18:47,798 --> 00:18:52,319
the uh the Beyblade idea you got going

510
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,759
on here but I would not do it that way I

511
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,079
would give them all their separate pots

512
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:58,319
um because like I said the one that wins

513
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:00,639
isn't going to be the best smoke it's

514
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,599
going to be the strongest plant and that

515
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,440
that's a big part of selection but that

516
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,439
is not the only thing and I think you

517
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,360
could find better um if you grow them

518
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,279
separately I'm rambling I have made my

519
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,079

00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:07,918
you decide if you want to try them

545
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,439

been good um been having some fun in the

549
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,558
grow so everything is iy let's answer

550
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:20,719
this question here a little bit uh how

551
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,519
do I decide that I want to grow gifted

552
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,038
seeds that is a very very good question

553
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,279
uh every couple of months I do like to

554
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:29,359
pop a new batch of seeds I uh pick out

555
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:31,279
some of my stuff a couple of I pick out

556
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,879
stuff from other breeders and I want to

557
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,079
see what my stuff does right next to

558
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,799
theirs in my rooms I want to see what my

559
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:38,639
New Creations do compared to my old

560
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:41,400
creations I'm very curious is what I'm

561
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,480
saying here so uh after I choose what of

562
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,159
my seeds I'm going to run sometimes I

563
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,120
pull out my whole seed collection the

564
00:20:45,159 --> 00:20:48,919
big horde of seeds that I've got and I

565
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:50,399
look through and I decide like o this

566
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:52,640
looks interesting or oh I've been

567
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,440
thinking about that but really it's all

568
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,679
about do I have room that is the main do

569
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,480
I have space to grow these seeds and

570
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,280
then um what else is in the room and how

571
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,679
much time are those plants going to take

572
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,200
if I'm picking a bunch of OG kush or a

573
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,320
bunch of Indica stuff I'm not going to

574
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,960
find other hazes to go with that cuz

575
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,200
that's going to [ __ ] up the whole room

576
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,919
so if I'm running let's just say I just

577
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,080
found a bunch of random something

578
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:19,240
something OG cush seeds and I'm going to

579
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,119
run some kush and some [ __ ] that I cross

580
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:24,038
to OG I'm going to go look into in my

581
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:26,158
batch for one more OG Kush varietal from

582
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:27,679
a friend that may match up with that so

583
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,799
that's one of the first criteria do I

584
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,360
have room and then does whatever I'm

585
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:33,278
thinking about running does it match the

586
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,918
rest of the room cuz I don't want [ __ ]

587
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:37,679
uh one plant 5 foot tall and the other

588
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:39,038
plant 8T tall I don't want some [ __ ] 55

589
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,960
day which is hypothetical you're never

590
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,119
going to get a 55 day flower I don't

591
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,360
want something at 55 and something at 82

592
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,558
days of flower CU that's going to be a

593
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:49,439
[ __ ] to manage so I think about plant

594
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:52,119
compatibility in the room is one thing

595
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,679
um then what is the cross is there

596
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:56,359
something that's getting my attention is

597
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,600
there did I smoke something recently uh

598
00:21:56,359 --> 00:22:00,240
um I keep saying OG Kush did I smoke a

599
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:02,278
cush that's got me thinking damn I want

600
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,359
that turp or I really need that in my

601
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:05,640
arsenals there's something I'm missing

602
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:07,119
um if there's something I'm missing

603
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,240
maybe that's what I'm looking for maybe

604
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:11,079
I got a pack of seeds that uh somebody

605
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,839
said hey do you have guava in the lineup

606
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:15,240
and I thought I don't so I'm packing

607
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,798
popping a pack of guava from nothing but

608
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,000
gas big shout out to my boy nothing but

609
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:20,839
gas but I will have guava so there are a

610
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,960
lot of things that dictate me deciding

611
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:24,759
which pack of seeds to grow it could be

612
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,319
uh something I need it could be a trait

613
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:28,679
it could be a flavor it could be a turp

614
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,678
I'm after it could be a breeder that I

615
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,278
just want to give a chance uh could be a

616
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:34,000
friend like my friend nothing but gas

617
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:35,440
he's been putting [ __ ] out for a while

618
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,880
it's time to give him a run and see what

619
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,880
he's up to see if his seeds are good

620
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,360
he's a good dude he's a cool guy why not

621
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,960
run his seeds while I've got some room

622
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:44,199
and see how those seeds are going to do

623
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,480
in my grow uh like I said it's all about

624
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,519
to the plants match up do I need that

625
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
turpine do I need that flavor do I need

626
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:52,720
that growth do I need a trait from that

627
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,320
plant for a breeding project so it could

628
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,278
be a turp that I'm looking for it could

629
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:59,079
be a specific trait in a pack of seeds

630
00:22:56,278 --> 00:23:00,558
I'm looking for a growth structure uh

631
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:02,839
maybe I've got a breeding idea that

632
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,480
that's going to be a precursor to maybe

633
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,918
I want to make strawberry vanilla

634
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,640
biscuit cookies and this one's got

635
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,200
vanilla biscuit and I'm just trying to

636
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,640
find that turp to get maybe it's a

637
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,960
springboard or a stepping stone uh maybe

638
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,559
I've got a friend that's been breeding

639
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,720
for a long time and as I'm going through

640
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:18,519
my seeds I've got like a bunch of stuff

641
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,038
that's going to be 90day flowering and I

642
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:24,440
see his pack and it says 90-day flow and

643
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:25,798
I go hey let's run this um or maybe just

644
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,080
like I'm letting my buddy nothing but

645
00:23:25,798 --> 00:23:30,158
gas have a spot in a grow space uh maybe

646
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,639
I'm just running those guavas uh because

647
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,080
it's time to give my friend a chance

648
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,799
he's been at it for a long time he's

649
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,240
been putting in the work I've got his

650
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,240
seeds they fit the criteria why not run

651
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,480
those and see how they do so there's a

652
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,480
lot of determining factors do they fit

653
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,679
uh the timeline do they fit the growth

654
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,720
shape are they a stepping stone is there

655
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,080
a trait that I need uh is there

656
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,120
something hyped up in there that's got

657
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:52,480
my attention is did a friend breed it

658
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:55,479
that I looked at it and said that guy

659
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,038
deserves attention um or also with all

660
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,759
of that being said it could also be

661
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:01,480
complet completely [ __ ] random I

662
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,278
might look at a pack and go wait

663
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,599
starberry skunk weasel I want to grow

664
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:08,038
that I don't know why but I do just like

665
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:11,199
a lot of times out there you guys see a

666
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:13,079
strain name uh people are going crazy uh

667
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,759

Ninja Turtles on it you guys go crazy

669
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:17,919
for that I've got a new strain coming

670
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:20,158
out that I haven't said the name on a

671
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,400
lot of public forums I do talk about it

672
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,120
in the uh the Discord server every time

673
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,798
I say the name people want some of that

674
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,119
people wanted Cherry skunk before they

675
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,879
ever saw the plants uh when I said I

676
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,479
have cherry skunk they said take my

677
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,360
money uh so a lot of it is names a lot

678
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,319
of is just random packaging it's

679
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:39,798
whatever gets my attention advertising

680
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:41,359
and marketing works on me too uh

681
00:24:39,798 --> 00:24:43,359
sometimes I'm try not to fall for it but

682
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:46,319
that [ __ ] does get me so this was a

683
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:48,319
really good fun question um I just

684
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:50,439
decide based on does it fit the criteria

685
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,359
of the room uh flowering time

686
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,399
growth-wise is there a turp or a trait

687
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:56,678
that I need is it a stepping stone for a

688
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:59,119
breeding project or honest it could just

689
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:01,759
be a random pack of seeds chose to fill

690
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,839
in that section of the room cuz I needed

691
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:05,798
more seeds there's a lot of random there

692
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,959
are a lot of details and a lot of

693
00:25:05,798 --> 00:25:09,639
nothing that helped me decide that so

694
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,079
there's no Rhyme or Reason but there's

695
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:14,440
also a lot of criteria take it that what

696
