00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,959
he made fun of me a little bit both

166
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,360
nights so that was cool two days of Doug

167
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:56,569
Benson hanging out with Doug Benson

168
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,480
the second night he treated me it was

169
00:05:56,569 --> 00:06:01,430
not even like some celebrity and his fan

170
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:02,870
hanging out Jeff Tate walked up to me

171
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,060
and asked me a question he had a

172
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:06,620
question for me because I I was part of

173
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,810
the show at the end of the show they

174
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,699
play games and they play a game called

175
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,399
the last man standing the thing is

176
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:15,469
somebody the audience names an actor and

177
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:17,389
then the participants in the game have

178
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,430
to name movies that that actor has been

179
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:23,329
in until they run out yeah we just keep

180
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,889
going back and forth until Doug knew

181
00:06:23,329 --> 00:06:26,419
that I listened to the podcast so he's

182
00:06:24,889 --> 00:06:27,800
like Rasta Jeff will definitely have a

183
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,120
name for us we'll go to him for a name

184
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,129
in just a minute so he let me give him

185
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,300
the name when it came time to it I said

186
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:33,439
I have two names in my head do you want

187
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,819
me to give you two of them any pick one

188
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:36,529
he goes nope just give me one and we'll

189
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:38,959
do it I was like all right so the name I

190
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:41,149
gave them for the game was Philip

191
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:44,060
Seymour Hoffman because I mean he's got

192
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:45,620
a lot of [ __ ] movies it was really

193
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,899
good they liked it a lot of fun with it

194
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,139
so after the show Jeff Tate walked up

195
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:52,489
he's like who was your other name bro

196

197
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:55,970

198
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,290

199
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,870

00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:34,990
going to music shows but some music

219
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,580
crowds are [ __ ] yep the crowds have

220
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:38,079
evolved into [ __ ] that want to shove

221
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:39,609
their way to the front and spill their

222
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,109
beer on you and just be a disrespectful

223
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,610
dick and don't appreciate the show and

224
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,530
they kind of ruin some concerts for me I

225
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:48,520
started enjoying sitting in the back and

226
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:50,289
getting high as [ __ ] a long time getting

227
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:51,969
older but comedy shows they don't allow

228
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,290
any of that pushing and shoving [ __ ]

229
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:55,210
they'll kick you right out if you heckle

230
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,710
so you're sitting down the whole time

231
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:58,269
and you can order food and they bring it

232
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:00,370
to you so comedy shows have been kind of

233
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:02,319
my new go-to thing for a date or for

234

235

listen to the show but you know who you

238
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:14,979
are the wild cousins comedy shot at all

239
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,329
the Pueblo comedy crew much love much

240
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,040
respect all right we've been talking

241
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,930
about everything but cannabis on this

242
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:24,180
podcast for the past 10 minutes I'm for

243
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,180
some let's talk about cannabis actually

244
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,240
cookies let's take a quick second here

245
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:37,389
do you realize what I just asked you I

246
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,580
do serve people in places they were

247
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:51,399
probably just smacking their smth

248
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:53,500
smacked my damn head right now girls got

249
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,329
cookies and gorilla glue just sitting

250
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:57,009
there ready to smoke yes you guys and

251
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:05,170
it's not even flowers it's the most

252
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:06,429
beautiful hash you've ever seen yes but

253
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:12,219
when you do make sure that you include

254
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:14,349
some sort of law or allow you to have

255
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,089
some sort of consumption place where

256
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:17,290
everybody can gather and smoke cannabis

257
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,640
because that's what we missed here in

258
00:09:17,289 --> 00:09:20,349
Colorado and right now we're struggling

259
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,819
to get those types of rules in place

260
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,960
wonderful yes but before you do let's

261
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:27,220
make a decision here would you like the

262
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,889
Girl Scout cookies or would you like to

263
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:32,399
go with the gorilla glue only because

264
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:34,509
right before we started recording we did

265
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,750
yes we did all right

266
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:42,100
it was quite wonderful but I coughed for

267
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:50,980
quite a bit hope will give you a little

268
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:52,659
dab Mike's kind of that's the truth you

269
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:55,149
don't have to take a DAB that's

270
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:57,189
comfortable for you Mike just said that

271
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:59,079
he had some news to share I'm gonna make

272
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:07,570
Mike share his news before he takes this

273
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:09,070
dad will be your reward reward that is

274
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:10,780
waiting for you and I'm gonna dabble you

275
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,200
tell us about your news so I got a text

276
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:17,289
a few days ago from a local friend of

277
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,140
mine in the industry down here he's

278
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:21,789
always been kind of a step removed like

279
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:25,509
he's not an owner of a dispensary or

280
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:27,039
anything like that but he got me a text

281
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:30,100
and he had a licensing hearing you

282
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:34,750
needed he wanted me to attend and he

283
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:37,629
received his special use permit to open

284
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:40,419
a cannabis museum slash consumption

285
00:10:37,629 --> 00:11:07,090
location here in Pueblo County is this

286
00:10:40,419 --> 00:11:08,049
somebody that I know yep look for that

287
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:11,590
coming

288
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:13,959
so a cannabis museum during the

289
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:17,080
licensing hearing his description of it

290
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:21,100
would be a marijuana themed Hard Rock

291
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,990
Cafe would be the closest business that

292
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,550
he could related to that everyone's

293
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,279
familiar with so when you sit down at

294
00:11:24,549 --> 00:11:29,469
your your booth with the marijuana

295
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,240
product you bring yourself there will be

296
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:33,279
stuff on the wall that's like marijuana

297
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,899
was originally outlawed and it out it

298
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,639
out it out like historical stuff and

299
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:38,319
they've hired local historians like

300
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,830
professional historians that do this for

301
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,420
a living

302
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:42,400
Wow and are currently researching

303
00:11:40,419 --> 00:11:45,108
cannabis because there isn't a local

304
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:54,239
historian who expert

305
00:11:45,109 --> 00:11:58,168
word lost my focuses I suppose I could

306
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,999
qualified but I didn't know that we need

307
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:01,288
to come to somebody all the schooling

308
00:11:59,999 --> 00:12:03,178
will be great useful but then they need

309
00:12:01,288 --> 00:12:05,068
to come to somebody involved in it right

310
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:06,538
to get it sure they've got a college I

311
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:08,759
like us on the team and if they don't

312
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:12,389
I'm gonna be that person on the team for

313
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:14,999
them if at all possible Rock Cafe if you

314
00:12:12,389 --> 00:12:16,889
will I'm sure it's got a name but I

315
00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:20,399
don't I don't honestly remember it but

316
00:12:16,889 --> 00:12:23,178
yeah that should be coming here earliest

317
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,259
estimates first of the year

318
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:28,078
knowing how these things go sometimes

319
00:12:25,259 --> 00:12:30,509

320

remember hearing about that huh I was

334
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,558
really pissed that they did it because

335
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,979
that said everybody back it's like six

336
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:07,078

here before too long that is really cool

347
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:30,089
Mike said something about public

348
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:31,859
consumption I am going to humble myself

349
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:33,809
I'm going to eat a little bit of crow if

350
00:13:31,859 --> 00:13:36,359
you will on this show never said eat

351
00:13:33,808 --> 00:13:37,588
crow before I get the phrase and now

352
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:38,939
that I've said it I understand where it

353
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:39,959
comes in perfectly I've never said that

354
00:13:38,938 --> 00:13:41,728
I've heard it and thought that's a weird

355
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:42,988
phrase but it just came in perfectly so

356
00:13:41,729 --> 00:13:49,589
shout out to the phrase eat some crow

357
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:51,469
it's got its place recently I've had

358
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:55,829
I've had beef with a couple of people

359
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:58,889
personal issues childish [ __ ] that's

360
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:01,169
stuck in my mind and they recently

361
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:02,909

gonna like you in the future but I see

411
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:53,248
them trying to make progress I've tried

412
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:55,048
to work with those people before and we

413
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:56,999
just butt heads and so I've kind of

414
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,208
separated myself but I'm gonna get over

415
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,528
it

416
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,869
and I'm gonna go there next eBay because

417
00:15:58,528 --> 00:16:01,610
they crushed it this time

418
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:04,519
all right so I had to man up there for a

419
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:05,600
minute I feel better all right Oh Mike

420
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:10,250

421
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:12,259
look on your face nerds I wished I would

422
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:13,970

423
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:15,139
how well it went I was bummed that I had

424
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,100

425
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:18,110
couldn't wish that I would have gone

426
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,330
that's fully the first time I felt about

427
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,129
one of their events and they finally did

428
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:24,110
it right from what I hear you gonna try

429
00:16:22,129 --> 00:16:25,730
haven't heard about any blowback from it

430
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:30,200
either nothing has really nothing

431
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:33,259
nothing wrong yeah well it's been

432
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,550
several days it's Wednesday now it's

433
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:43,519

434
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:44,929
happen all right so I was gonna say I

435
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,819
was gonna try not to miss any Doug

436
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:49,370
Benson shows at Comedy Works I'm gonna

437
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,140
try to get as many as I can because if

438
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:52,610
you tweet Doug Benson he will read your

439
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:53,750
tweets during the first 20 minutes of a

440
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,700
show that's what he does he just reads

441
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:58,580
tweets and makes fun of people and so uh

442
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:59,930
I just tweeted at him hey Doug front row

443
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,550

444
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:03,199
and so he read a bunch of tweets and he

445
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:05,119
goes this guy back here says where's

446
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,338

451
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:23,389
that seat for the last 18 Doug Benson

452
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:25,099
shows he hasn't missed a show yet though

453
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:26,540
so funny I'm gonna try not to miss any -

454
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:28,250
it's gonna be a good time if the

455
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:32,149
listeners out there want this experience

456
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:38,808
the way to do every Doug Benson show

457
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:40,370
it's just there's a way to do this go

458
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:43,609
bananas I think that's the club in

459
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:45,049
Cincinnati baby if that's see like I

460
00:17:43,609 --> 00:17:47,449
almost want a Google a juleps I'm gonna

461
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:48,859
take [ __ ] 30 seconds - we might pause

462
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:50,400
it we might not let's see we're gonna

463
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:52,500
have Siri do it

464
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:57,720
yeah I've been a dog fan for a long time

465
00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:00,480
I guess we'll see I just ask Siri

466
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,819
where's the club go bananas live

467
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,029

471
00:18:09,808 --> 00:18:12,899
alright because we've been rambling on

472
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,579
for like 20 minutes let's get on to a

473
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,220
topic here we've got a couple of things

474
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,439
in the news that we could talk about um

475
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:21,180
I read an article I'm not gonna read you

476
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,299
the article because it's forever long

477
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,009
it's way too many words long but I found

478
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:28,919
this article on a website called The

479
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:30,390
Guardian Mike also read it we'll be able

480
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,440
to discuss it without reading it here on

481
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,790
the show and we'll be able to paraphrase

482
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,529
a little bit for you guys and tell you

483
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:39,480
what it's about essentially um they're

484
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:41,670
talking about an influx of people coming

485
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:44,490
from across the country to Pueblo

486
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:47,940
Colorado because Pueblo Colorado for the

487
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:49,980
size of the city that we are and for our

488
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:53,279
economic development in the amount of

489
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,799
cannabis jobs available we are the most

490
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:57,539
affordable place to land when you come

491
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:02,009
from out of state would you agree with

492
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:07,109
that Mike we routinely ranked is like

493
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:08,700
the cheapest city in Colorado right if

494
00:19:07,109 --> 00:19:17,099
you anywhere smaller you're pretty much

495
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:19,140
[ __ ] there's a hundred thousand people

496
00:19:17,099 --> 00:19:20,519
here which is just about perfect for

497
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,090
coming to a city that's not too

498
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:31,879
expensive trying to get a new star the

499
00:19:24,089 --> 00:19:31,879
cheapest cities in the u.s. its Denver I

[Music]

502
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:54,300
was part of this story in like a back

503
00:19:52,289 --> 00:19:56,279
room since I've met with all the players

504
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,849
about this topic but don't spill too

505
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,210
many of those beans I won't

506
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:00,379
[Music]

507
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:02,480
we're not gonna beat but we'll talk

508
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,090
about it so they're saying that all

509
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,669
these people moving to Pueblo Colorado

510
00:20:04,089 --> 00:20:09,949
are beginning to put a burden on our

511
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:11,509
resources here we have a resource called

512
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,019
Posada which is a nonprofit organization

513
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:16,339
that helps families I get there some

514
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:18,558
themselves on their feet if something

515
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:20,720
happens to somebody here in Pueblo they

516
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,069
can go to Posada for example there's a

517
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,659
guy in this news article that hurt his

518
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:24,889
foot something fell on him and broke his

519
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:26,750
foot and he can't work for a little bit

520
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,220
so he's going to Posada to get a little

521
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,450
bit of help maybe I don't know what

522
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:31,548
they're given and possibly some food

523
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:33,710
probably some cheese just to keep him on

524
00:20:31,548 --> 00:20:36,528
his feet while he's unable to work but

525
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:39,259
they're saying that those resources at

526
00:20:36,528 --> 00:20:41,450
Posada are being strained and the people

527
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:42,890
are coming from all over the nation to

528
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:44,538
come work here and they're not prepared

529
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:45,830
like you look like you got something on

530
00:20:44,538 --> 00:20:48,730
your mind already you're stewing but no

531
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:52,129
it's so what they're getting at is that

532
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:53,990
legal marijuana is creating a huge

533
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:58,159
homeless problem in Pueblo Colorado

534
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:59,990
right and it's not like causing good

535
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,419
hardworking Americans who got hooked on

536
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,159
marijuana to become homeless it's

537
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:07,909
attracting homeless people in other

538
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,720
areas to pueblos apparently and the

539
00:21:07,909 --> 00:21:15,140
article goes on to say people that work

540
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:18,019
at Posada and a couple other agencies in

541
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:21,409
town saying that they've had huge

542
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:24,288
increases in people seeking services

543
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:30,080
from them whether it's housing vouchers

544
00:21:24,288 --> 00:21:34,778
or food stamps or medicine bank medicine

545
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,778
vouchers or help with medical problems

546
00:21:35,109 --> 00:21:40,729
Posada especially has been pretty vocal

547
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:43,490
with the press down here in Pueblo and

548
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:45,259
then it's spiraled nationally when the

549
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,390
anti pot groups picked it up and started

550
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:48,109
pushing it other newspapers started

551
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,570
picking it up

552
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:53,769
the one of the problems caused by

553
00:21:50,569 --> 00:21:56,298
amendment 64 is more homeless people

554
00:21:53,769 --> 00:21:59,960
coming to Colorado because of our

555
00:21:56,298 --> 00:22:03,379
marijuana laws and just that idea never

556
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,880
really made sense to me until I realized

557
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,890
that it's not illegal to be homeless

558
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,940
most places but it is illegal to have

559
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:12,000
pop most places right

560
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:15,420
and homeless people have huge rage of

561
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,029
substance abuse and if if you're

562
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,380
homeless consuming substances is a way

563
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:21,930
to deal with some of the miserable

564
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:25,560
conditions in that lifestyle absolutely

565
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:26,730
so if you can move to a place where

566
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:28,409
they're not going to chase you around

567
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:31,920
and throw you in jail for having some

568
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:34,680
weed why not be there and when that's

569
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:36,330
combined with a number of other things

570
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,539
that are happening at the same time like

571
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:41,579
legal marijuana here everybody's talking

572
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:43,139
about how many thousands of people are

573
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:45,720
working in the industry and how much

574
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,390
money it's making no one's talking about

575
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,680
what it takes to get an Emmy D badge so

576
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,480
that's something I was gonna touch on a

577
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,180
few minutes when you're homeless

578
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,309
and there's a new it booming industry I

579
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,470
mean it's he was been doing it since

580
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,379
humans started doing anything we moved

581
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:03,450
for to where there's work especially

582
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,520
when there's no work and we're just

583
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:07,680
coming out of a depression like a

584
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:10,440
national depression where works hard to

585
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:13,650
come by everywhere especially in our age

586
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:16,740
demographic remember all those articles

587
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:22,710
about people than their 30s that moved

588
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:24,420
home after college right I'm not saying

589
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:26,850
me but a lot of them got degrees unlike

590
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,320
internet stuff those jobs are all taken

591
00:23:26,849 --> 00:23:29,669
up that should kind of failed but not

592
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:31,169
failed but I mean it's just gotten so

593
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,400
much easier to make a webpage that that

594
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,740
guy that you used to know how to do it

595
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,000
isn't and I have a theory that that's

596
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,440
gonna happen to the weed grower or to

597
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,750
I'm gonna do a whole report on that here

598
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,190
on the podcast in the future so yeah

599
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:44,940
those those people are now in the weed

600
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:47,910
industry making a pretty solid living

601
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,549
yeah um so there's a lot of reasons

602
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,170
homeless people are at our people on the

603
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:55,950
break of being homeless or moving to

604
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:57,990

605
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,670

00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:39,509

653
00:25:41,489 --> 00:25:52,919
the trimmers I use go trim for other

654
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:54,689
people if you're not trimming if you

655
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,038
don't need a mad badge that's probably

656
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:57,659
not a job that's gonna last for very

657
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,338

660
00:26:00,898 --> 00:26:04,949

were in good order I do is get a thing

729
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:25,109
from both long companies it was really

730
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:27,390
easy I filled out I printed the

731
00:28:25,109 --> 00:28:28,558
application online I printed it at home

732
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,150
I filled it out it took me like 30

733
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:32,129
minutes to do it whatever you know it's

734
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:32,970
just like a thick job application but

735
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:34,530
really thorough

736
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,279
yeah and then they give it to the FBI

737
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:39,869
who checks it so you can't just lie and

738
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:41,730
while they're checking a better smartest

739
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:43,679
[ __ ] they take your paperwork

740
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:45,690
running it then they call you back while

741
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,460
it's being ran and they fingerprint you

742
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,350
they take their sweet [ __ ] time

743
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,819
fingerprinting you so that if there is

744
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:52,409
anything wrong with your paperwork and

745
00:28:50,819 --> 00:28:53,849

right there oh yeah I wondered why it

748
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:00,750
took so long it seemed like the tech was

749
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,849
brand new and yet it took her 74 tries

750

to get my index finger oh yeah that

751

this podcast my niche is making seeds my

822
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,119
niche is growing like a [ __ ]

823
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,320
my initiatives taking care of my

824
00:32:38,119 --> 00:32:41,779
patients and paying attention to what

825
00:32:39,319 --> 00:32:44,450
works for them medicinally and adjusting

826
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:46,240
my grow schedule and micronutrients and

827
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,830
my gross strains to work for my

828
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,450
individual patients medical needs which

829
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:52,220
is an arc to tell you the [ __ ] truth

830
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,870
to draw enough weed for Mike and enough

831
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,360
weed for Doug and other people that I

832
00:32:53,869 --> 00:32:58,579
supply and have the right strains at the

833
00:32:56,359 --> 00:33:00,109
right times for these people it takes a

834
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:02,949
little bit of scheduling and a little

835
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:05,449
bit of foresight so whatever you do

836
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:05,769
you're a construction worker and you

837
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,539
look

838
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:09,910
move here and do construction and smoke

839
00:33:07,539 --> 00:33:11,440
weed and the evenings have as much of a

840
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,029
[ __ ] plan about what you're gonna do

841
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,710
in life as Jeff just laid out right

842
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:17,950
there it's like what he does is his

843
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,680
niche like at least that much you should

844
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:23,830
be getting online and like oh you know

845
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm a car salesman and find a dozen car

846
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:28,149
dealerships looking for employees before

847
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,250
you even consider moving out here yeah

848
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:31,930
call them contact them send them your

849
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:34,480
information let them know you'll be here

850
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:36,400
whenever looking for a job yep long

851
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,200
before you move out here the people that

852
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:40,960
moved out here with just a hope and a

853
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,700
prayer most of them have had to beg

854
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,710
people for money so that they can haul

855
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:50,500
their ass back home and that has to suck

856
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:52,529
unfortunately a Colorado has become be

857
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:54,640
not what you know but who you know state

858
00:33:52,529 --> 00:33:56,500
if you want to be in the cannabis

859
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,570
industry right now there's just so many

860
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:00,910
rules and regulations and the tiniest

861
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,829
[ __ ] can cost the shop ten thousand

862
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:05,470
two hundred thousand bucks that you can

863
00:34:02,829 --> 00:34:07,240
lose their licensing because you did

864
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:08,860
something that half the people that walk

865
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:15,369
in our doors every day assume we're

866
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:16,780
doing constantly so gaining that level

867
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:21,279
of trust and a job interviews a

868
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:23,409
[ __ ] absolutely and if your main

869
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,950
sales pitches that you've been hired for

870
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:28,480
a decade like just don't try like come

871
00:34:26,949 --> 00:34:30,428
here and do whatever you've been doing

872
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,139
to make a living if it's selling weed

873
00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:34,780
don't move here because we got stores to

874
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:37,089
do that now I get to look at a lot of

875
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,620
job applications because anything that

876
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:40,510
goes for the grow department the job

877
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:44,109
applications get passed to myself and

878
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:47,710
another guy you would not believe some

879
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:50,950
of the verbage that I see in job

880
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:52,929
applications like list your skills dog I

881
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:55,449

884
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:03,159
away I bring a resume look professional

885
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:05,379

cool gangster and try to impress us be

893
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:19,969
professional legal comes with rules

894
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,409
illusions and expectations you're gonna

895
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:22,849
be wearing a lab coat if you work next

896

903
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:37,130
another lab coat before you enter room

904
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:39,110

905
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,700
cross-contamination yeah yeah we need to

906
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:42,349
know that you can read the warning signs

907
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:44,599
when we use a pesticide and we put up a

908
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,460
certain do not enter sign or whatever

909
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,659
gear is required to enter this room we

910
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,030
didn't know that you can read that kind

911
00:35:47,659 --> 00:35:53,000
of stuff even the salespeople if I make

912
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:56,300
a real simple mistake I can get the shop

badge if we do with the law if we say

916
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:04,519

921
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,179
chairs where I work there are no chairs

922
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:18,409
in my work area I'm always standing up

923
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:20,149
but also we're under camera from every

924
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,679
angle and all times you're on two

925
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,300
cameras no matter where you are in that

926
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,250
building there are two cameras covering

927
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:27,170
that area I cannot scratch my ass in

928
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,539
that building without being seen if you

929
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,400
do something really funny you can go to

930
00:36:29,539 --> 00:36:34,059
the office and ask for the footage like

931
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,980
immediately cuz it's available I've had

932
00:36:34,059 --> 00:36:42,469
security that was three rooms away make

933
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:48,260
fun of me for but Craig is on camera to

934
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:51,409
the point where they can read on my car

935
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:52,910
outside the parking lot with the camera

936
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,170
yeah that's how [ __ ] smooth those

937
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:57,079
cameras are they were reading VIN

938
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,380
numbers on cars like people really don't

939
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,150
understand the level of regulations

940
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,650
those cameras go up at a hundred feet

941
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:05,300
all the way around the perimeter of the

942
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,619
building all the way like a hundred feet

943
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,240
seriously I'm not even kidding we go all

944
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:09,829
the way to the street and [ __ ] that's

945
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:11,389
when you hear about a dispensary getting

946
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:13,009
robbed in Colorado you hear about the

947
00:37:11,389 --> 00:37:15,849
arrest the guy who did it like an hour

948
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:18,050
and a half late right yeah oh boy and

949
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:19,819
it's funny because if somebody smokes

950
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:21,140
anywhere near the building our security

951
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,000
guards damn near run outside with their

952
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:25,569
gun in their hand you cannot smoke on

953
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,570
our premises

954
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:36,129
but if you cannot smoke anything

955
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:37,960
anywhere near our dispensary guys we

956
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:40,240

there's good music up front most of the

1001
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:31,389
time so there's good music going on is

1002
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,068
one of the best parts but the only time

1003
00:39:31,389 --> 00:39:35,348
you get to chill out and have fun is on

1004

little team meetings and [ __ ] which are

1006
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:39,219

1007
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:40,960
dispensary

1008
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:43,389

you can't close up there until the time

1021
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,779
in the back we can pretty much work but

1022
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:14,980
we just got to finish the job there's a

1023
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,710
lot of [ __ ] to do in the best sometimes

1024
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:19,059
it's just what happens in the legal

1025
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,750
industry like there's work to be done

1026
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:26,429
and it's got to get done by somebody and

1027
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:29,800
politics a lot of work what a planning

1028
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:31,690
planning for us in the back people come

1029
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,519
here with just the craziest expectations

1030
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:34,659
and it's [ __ ] a lot of people if

1031
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,980
you're one of those guys that quits a

1032
00:40:34,659 --> 00:40:37,449
job all the time if you're one of those

1033
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,619
guys who can't show up on time if you're

1034
00:40:37,449 --> 00:40:39,699
one of the guys that makes excuses

1035
00:40:38,619 --> 00:40:45,970
you're not gonna make it in the

1036
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:47,108
marijuana time yeah you gotta look

1037
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:49,750
professional you gotta take care of

1038
00:40:47,108 --> 00:40:52,119
yourself here you guys this may sound

1039
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,670
like [ __ ] but this is the truth for

1040
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,470
every one dude that is hireable there

1041
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,809
are seven women that are hireable that

1042
00:40:56,469 --> 00:40:59,919
are way more attractive than you so if

1043
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:02,199
you're a dude and you're trying to get a

1044
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,950
job in the industry you gotta get your

1045
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:09,159
[ __ ] together because women sell more

1046
00:41:05,949 --> 00:41:11,699
weed so it's already a an uphill battle

1047
00:41:09,159 --> 00:41:14,980
for a lot of you dudes clean up yeah

1048
00:41:11,699 --> 00:41:18,399
always resume resume

1049
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:20,400
all right you [ __ ] um let's see we've

1050
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,160
been going for 40 minutes holy crap um

1051
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,700
so this is like the longest news article

1052
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:29,949
summation we didn't even different

1053
00:41:27,699 --> 00:41:34,868
places with this I like this podcast it

1054
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:37,179
felt right um so just to get slightly

1055
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:39,220
back on top let's do the thing that

1056
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:41,710
pisses me off the most about this whole

1057
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:45,250
legal pot causes an increase in

1058
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:47,588
homelessness nonsense is like one of the

1059
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:49,719
big reasons Puebla is experiencing a lot

1060
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:51,279
more homeless people right now looking

1061
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:52,259
for services or people on the brink of

1062
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,570
being homeless

1063
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:55,740
Services is because all of the cities

1064
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,450
around us

1065
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:58,799
currently bust homeless people out of

1066
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:01,829
their area that's the only way they've

1067
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:03,900
got to deal with it if Posada could have

1068
00:42:01,829 --> 00:42:06,659
anything they wanted right now it would

1069
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,750
be millions more funding so that they

1070
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:11,579
could send everybody back home and

1071
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:13,739
there's a small reason for that like if

1072
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:15,960
you send everybody home hopefully

1073
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:17,399
they've got family friends people in the

1074
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,050
community that they know and can make

1075
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,059
contact with to help them get back on

1076
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,410
their feet like somewhere where they're

1077
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:24,360
tied to the community a little bit

1078
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:28,440
rather than here where they're strangers

1079
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,900
to everybody right but most places are

1080
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:32,880
just like hey guess what I hear this

1081
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:34,820
place it the way that you probably can't

1082
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,130
get back to without a lot of help is

1083
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:40,470
banging you should go there here's the

1084
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:44,730
bus ticket there for free bro they've

1085
00:42:40,469 --> 00:42:46,889
got like everything you need um I had a

1086
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:48,900
guy asked me for a ride that one day and

1087
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:50,400
I probably would have told him no except

1088
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,809
the place he was asking to go was like a

1089
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,630
block and a half from where I was headed

1090
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:56,130
and I took a look at him and he looked

1091
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:58,890
totally [ __ ]

1092
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,570
but like recently like his clothes were

1093
00:42:58,889 --> 00:43:04,079
clean but he looked like he had the

1094
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:05,610
worst day after the worst month ever and

1095
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,199
I was like all right dude I can give you

1096
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:09,570
a ride to where I'm already going I've

1097
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:11,339
like got like 150 pounds on you even if

1098
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:13,920
you pull like a real [ __ ] loaded

1099
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,530
weapon on me I've got this especially in

1100
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,769
a car like if I can reach you it's I win

1101
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:23,900
and his little story just wrecked me

1102
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:27,090
like he had a serious medical condition

1103
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:28,530
he was in Albuquerque and they were like

1104
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:30,840
dude didn't you hear

1105
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:34,050
Pueblo got it for you they've got like

1106

1111
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,110
they're talking about we don't got [ __ ]

1112
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,110
off for anybody

1113
00:43:48,889 --> 00:43:53,369
unless you're looking to invest a couple

1114
00:43:51,179 --> 00:43:55,739
of million dollars in a numeric form

1115
00:43:53,369 --> 00:44:03,509
like what I don't got what you're

1116
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:05,429
looking for it's cheap to live - we've

1117
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:07,470
got the Colorado unemployment rates like

1118
00:44:05,429 --> 00:44:09,329
four point something it's one of the

1119
00:44:07,469 --> 00:44:11,639
lower and the lowest in the nation but

1120
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:15,090
Pueblo unemployment rate is like five

1121
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:16,769
and a half or six like a good point and

1122
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,110
a half higher than the rest of the state

1123
00:44:16,769 --> 00:44:20,369
and when you magnify that times the

1124
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:23,539
amount of people that are in the state

1125
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:26,639
like it's a huge huge chunk of the jobs

1126
00:44:23,539 --> 00:44:28,139
like there's a lot of people that came

1127
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:30,179
here looking for work that are just

1128
00:44:28,139 --> 00:44:32,670
[ __ ] [ __ ] out of luck now yeah cuz

1129
00:44:30,179 --> 00:44:34,739
they came with no plan but we're trying

except there being nuts on this issue

1148
00:45:18,269 --> 00:45:22,949
they're getting national press talking

1149

about how it's all marijuana's fault and

1150
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:26,819
then if you read the article you'll get

1151
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:28,650
about 3/4 of the way through when they

1152
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:30,930

them are gonna get jobs in the marijuana

1159
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,289
industry only to find out that we don't

1160
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:52,800
take felons

1161
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:54,989
I mean multiple multiple that they just

1162
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,630
don't publicize any of the requirements

1163
00:45:54,989 --> 00:45:59,789
anywhere outside of this podcast

1164
00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:00,930
basically right yeah so that's your

1165
00:45:59,789 --> 00:46:02,489
public service announcement you guys

1166
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:03,539
make sure you google that [ __ ] make sure

1167
00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:06,599
you can find out if you're even

1168
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:07,980
qualified to work in our industry and if

1169
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:09,449
you're going if you're coming here to

1170
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:13,320
run an illegal industry I'm not even

1171
00:46:09,449 --> 00:46:15,449
trying to be a smartass I was deep [ __ ]

1172
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:17,039
into the illegal cannabis industry I can

1173
00:46:15,449 --> 00:46:18,359
admit it now I could talk about that you

1174
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:20,849
know what I had to get away from it

1175
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,410
because it wasn't gonna work much longer

1176
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:24,989
I was gonna go downhill trying to stay

1177
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:28,139
on that side of the world now I've got a

1178
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:29,879
steady job everything is legit it's much

1179
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:31,889
easier you guys it's much easier and the

1180
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,900
illegal industry is going away you can

1181
00:46:31,889 --> 00:46:36,629
see it crumbling here those people that

1182
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:38,010
are too stubborn to come to the light

1183
00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,220
you can see them struggling and

1184
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:43,290
dwindling and falling off I saw it a

1185
00:46:41,219 --> 00:46:45,149
couple of years ago the people I knew

1186
00:46:43,289 --> 00:46:47,309
that we're living right on that the edge

1187
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:49,650
but between the black and the white

1188
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:54,329
market like the what you'd call the gray

1189
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:56,970
market the more stores that opened up

1190
00:46:54,329 --> 00:47:00,389
the harder it was to compete with them I

1191
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:03,839
mean the guy that had one strain for you

1192
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:06,809
in March come July would show up a seven

1193
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:11,220
by December there was a selection hash

1194
00:47:06,809 --> 00:47:12,269
in his bag too and by January it was

1195
00:47:11,219 --> 00:47:14,129
just too much of a [ __ ] hassle

1196
00:47:12,269 --> 00:47:16,019
regardless of the selection because you

1197
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:17,579
could just go to a store and pick right

1198
00:47:16,019 --> 00:47:20,009
like you never had to hang out and not

1199
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:22,529
seem like foot traffic or any of that

1200
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:24,600
meet somebody somewhere how much how

1201
00:47:22,530 --> 00:47:26,090
many episodes of how it's made would

1202
00:47:24,599 --> 00:47:28,500
never have been watched

1203
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,150
if we could just buy weed in stores

1204
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,489
Deadliest Catch what I've never been

1205
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:34,019
viewed Yeah right viewership on a lot of

1206
00:47:32,489 --> 00:47:35,069
[ __ ] would go way down if you didn't

1207
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,960
have to hang out with your weed dealer

1208
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:40,230
for two hours so you didn't seem like

1209
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,940
you were there buying weed this dude is

1210
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:43,710
just really really bored and a lot of

1211
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:47,159
his friends come to visit for two hours

1212
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:48,869
at a chunk I guess yeah like it's just

1213
00:47:47,159 --> 00:47:50,129
so much more convenient even when you

1214
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:54,329
get to the shop and you're like really

1215
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:55,710
that's the price [ __ ] taxes like you

1216
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:58,380
start wondering how much your time's

1217
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,309
worth like how many hours that I spent

1218
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,579
sitting on the couch listening to

1219
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:02,349
[ __ ] because I was

1220
00:48:00,579 --> 00:48:04,360
by a bag of weed and that was the best

1221
00:48:02,349 --> 00:48:06,099
way down because every weed dealer wants

1222
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:13,620
to show you his new thing that he bought

1223
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:15,789
with your money but you did you redo man

1224
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:19,989
anything but more [ __ ] Deadliest

1225
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:21,039
Catch yeah I don't know why used to get

1226
00:48:19,989 --> 00:48:22,959
stoned and watch the [ __ ] out of

1227
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:24,730
Deadliest Catch that's really weird it's

1228
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:26,829
it's fun which one's gonna get squashed

1229
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:28,690
by a crab cage next I'm gonna write

1230
00:48:26,829 --> 00:48:33,190
myself a note here this is not show

1231
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:34,869
related watch more Deadliest Catch no I

1232
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:36,670
record another podcast and have a

1233
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:43,719
Deadliest Catch story that I want to

1234
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:45,430
tell on that podcast this weird dream

1235
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:50,169
story on this podcast I mean this shows

1236
00:48:45,429 --> 00:48:51,399
almost a [ __ ] hour long I got my

1237
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:53,019
wisdom teeth removed and they gave me

1238
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,490
vicodin then I took too many of them I

1239
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:56,409
fell asleep watching Deadliest Catch

1240
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:59,979
okay that's like the main setup here I

1241
00:48:56,409 --> 00:49:01,599
woke up in a dream that I caught

1242
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,340
somebody trying to kill people on The

1243
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:05,500
Deadliest Catch boat and I murdered him

1244
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:06,730
cuz he was trying to kill me and in

1245
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,079
self-defense I killed him on the [ __ ]

1246
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:09,610
cuz he killed everybody else on the boat

1247
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:12,069
but then I realized everybody on the

1248
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:13,329
boat is dead but me I think I did this

1249
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,800
[ __ ] and I'm all covered in blood the

1250
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:15,819
boats all covered in blood so I gotta

1251
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,130
get the [ __ ] out of here then I wake up

1252
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:20,559
and since I took too many vicodin before

1253
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:21,940
I fell asleep I woke up I didn't really

1254
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:23,529
wake up I'm still dreaming but I was

1255
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:25,480
physically sitting up in real life but

1256
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:27,519
in dream life I was still in my boat and

1257
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,650
I saw blood all over my house and it

1258
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:30,849
took me a good I don't really know but

1259
00:49:29,650 --> 00:49:32,139
I'm gonna say like three or four minutes

1260
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:33,639
of like shaking my head around and

1261
00:49:32,139 --> 00:49:35,440
walking around my bedroom going why is

1262
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:36,549
there blood everywhere what the [ __ ] is

1263
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,889
happening and then finally the blood

1264
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,220
faded away and I woke up don't too many

1265
00:49:38,889 --> 00:49:41,289
fight

1266
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:43,149
don't do too many vicodin kids that's my

1267
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:44,500
it's my [ __ ] theory but I had my

1268
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:47,530
wisdom teeth taken out they [ __ ] hurt

1269
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,269
dude that [ __ ] sucks okay I was kind of

1270
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:51,070

Interstate 25 that's right I just left

1394
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:20,000
the champs trade show I thought it'd be

1395
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:22,549
a good idea to jump on the microphone

1396
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,969
and do a little bit of recording while

1397
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:27,380
it's still fresh in my mind so today I

1398
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:29,269
went to the Chams trade show in Denver

1399
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:31,250
it was a beautiful Drive it takes me

1400
00:58:29,269 --> 00:58:33,710
about two hours to get up to Denver

1401
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:36,260
it took me about another 20 minutes to

1402
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:38,809
find a good parking spot anyway I got a

1403
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:41,030

00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:49,070

venue we were not allowed to smoke any

1445
01:00:12,059 --> 01:00:17,548
type of cannabis we couldn't dab there

1446
01:00:15,449 --> 01:00:20,159
was actually somebody pressing out rosin

1447
01:00:17,548 --> 01:00:21,809
dabs he had a rosin press if you know

1448
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,719
about rosin it's made by squishing your

1449
01:00:21,809 --> 01:00:26,190
buds between two heated surfaces using

1450
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:28,618
parchment in the middle as a way to

1451
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,329
catch your hash he was pressing out

1452
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:31,858
rosin right there for you so you could

1453
01:00:30,329 --> 01:00:33,990
bring your nugs and get him squished is

1454
01:00:31,858 --> 01:00:35,369
what they were calling it some people

1455
01:00:33,989 --> 01:00:36,568
were taking dabs of that right after

1456
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:38,579
they would squish it although it was

1457
01:00:36,568 --> 01:00:40,858
frowned upon and if you got caught they

1458
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:42,720
would escort you out of the building so

1459
01:00:40,858 --> 01:00:44,670
anyway I met up with the hitman crew I

1460
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:47,278
fell in love with a couple of rigs they

1461
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:49,619
had a mini sidecar rig with a blue label

1462
01:00:47,278 --> 01:00:50,338
the Blue Label was beautiful it's my

1463
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:52,200
favorite color

1464
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:54,028
my exact favorite color blue

1465
01:00:52,199 --> 01:00:56,399
unfortunately I just bought the same rig

1466
01:00:54,028 --> 01:00:58,769
with a yellow label so I could not bring

1467
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:00,119
myself to spend another 150 dollars on a

1468
01:00:58,769 --> 01:01:02,548
rig although one hundred and fifty

1469
01:01:00,119 --> 01:01:04,980
dollars on that rig was a steal I just

1470
01:01:02,548 --> 01:01:06,929
didn't want to buy a copy of a rig that

1471
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:08,940
I have already God did not make sense to

1472
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:10,469
me anyway so I had to walk away before I

1473
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,028
bought the sunday stack and before I

1474
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:13,528
bought the blue mini sidecar

1475
01:01:12,028 --> 01:01:17,608
they had a bunch of great rigs at the

1476
01:01:13,528 --> 01:01:19,510
Hitman booth also I made friends with a

1477
01:01:17,608 --> 01:01:22,750
bunch of people

1478
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:24,520
I also got to bump into our crew with

1479
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:27,070
oil slick Josh Boyle slick and the oil

1480
01:01:24,519 --> 01:01:29,739

1481
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:31,330
sent me home with the sample of the I

1482
01:01:29,739 --> 01:01:33,579
forget the official name of it I've been

1483
01:01:31,329 --> 01:01:36,159
calling it the bond condom it's actually

1484
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:37,509
a it's basically a condom you put on the

1485
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:39,460
mouthpiece of your bong so that if

1486
01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:41,200
you're at a large party or an event you

1487
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,269
can swap those out so that not everybody

1488
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,639

1522

1527
01:03:02,409 --> 01:03:07,269

1584
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:05,079
I'm not a shy guy but for some reason

1585
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:07,500
when I saw Miss Charlo Greene something

1586
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:11,199
inside of me [ __ ] melted ah

1587
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:13,329
hey guys charlo is more beautiful in

1588
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:15,879
person than she has ever looked online

1589
01:05:13,329 --> 01:05:18,429
on Facebook on the internet on Twitter

1590
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:20,740
on Instagram whatever you saw her on she

1591
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:23,829
is even more beautiful in person and her

1592
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:26,229
personality is sassy and stunning so I'm

1593
01:05:23,829 --> 01:05:28,029
walking toward her and she spotted me

1594
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:30,340
and she reached out and put her hand on

1595
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,769
my shoulder and said hey you and she

1596
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:34,600
knew who I was which was kind of weird

1597
01:05:32,769 --> 01:05:36,219
I've stalked her on Facebook and said

1598
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:38,679
hello but she has no reason to know who

1599
01:05:36,219 --> 01:05:40,118
rhasta Jeff is so I was a little excited

1600
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:41,559
by that that made me a little spellbound

1601
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:44,829

lot of things but I'm just saying it's

1711

1713

1724
01:09:41,158 --> 01:09:46,408
I did not record anything today I had

1725
01:09:44,009 --> 01:09:47,789
felt rude I didn't even think about

1726
01:09:46,408 --> 01:09:49,259
taking my gear in there because it felt

1727
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:50,640
rude walking around I just wanted to say

1728
01:09:49,259 --> 01:09:53,338
hi to my friends and hang out

1729
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,960
and not be that interview guy in the

1730
01:09:53,338 --> 01:09:56,699
future I will do that if there's a

1731
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,289
two-day event I'll walk around one day

John Doe radio I don't know where to

1738
01:10:07,529 --> 01:10:11,489
tell you to go look for that it's

1739
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,680
probably on iTunes the conversation that

1740
01:10:11,489 --> 01:10:16,409
him and I had today leads me to believe

1741
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:19,380
that his podcast is on iTunes all right

1742
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:21,569

1779
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:31,590
minute and it had me completely

1780
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:33,479
intrigued Fox is now in Colorado he's in

1781

Colorado Springs one time this week and

1782
01:11:33,479 --> 01:11:37,229
I am going to do my best to link up with

1783
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,360
him and get him to talk into a

1784
01:11:37,229 --> 01:11:40,829
microphone for you and share you some

1785
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:43,170
ideas that he's got he's got some

1786
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:45,300
amazing [ __ ] happening I cannot wait for

1787
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:47,300
you guys to get to hear it so I think

1788
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:50,340
that's all of this shout outs I've got a

1789
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:52,560
guy gave me an edible to try but I'm not

1790
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:54,180
going to do a shout out on that or any

1791
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:56,010
review until I'm able to sit down and

1792
01:11:54,180 --> 01:11:58,500
look at the packaging and eat it right

1793
01:11:56,010 --> 01:12:00,180
now I'm driving on Interstate 25 going

1794
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:01,680
about 70 miles an hour there's nobody

1795
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:03,869
else out on the interstate it's just me

1796
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:06,090
it's a Wednesday night it's pretty

1797
01:12:03,869 --> 01:12:07,500
I'm actually driving through monument

1798
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:09,360
right now shout out to the city of

1799
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:10,949
monument and shout out to that cop that

1800
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:12,869
didn't pull me over a few miles back I'm

1801
01:12:10,949 --> 01:12:14,460
full-on talking into a microphone and

1802
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:16,500
that cop did not pull me over

1803
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,970
that's pretty killer so let's see I

1804
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:19,800
think I've done all these shout outs I

1805
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:21,240
apologize if I missed anybody

1806
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:24,570
it's nothing personal big shout out to

1807
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:27,300
Adam hand for throwing me a pin big

1808
01:12:24,569 --> 01:12:28,739
shout-out to everybody that I hung out

1809
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:30,329
with today I apologize if I skipped you

1810
01:12:28,739 --> 01:12:33,119
I want to move on to this next part you

1811
01:12:30,329 --> 01:12:36,689
guys I was gifted from a vendor a jeep

1812
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:39,630
in mini disposable is called the Jeep in

1813
01:12:36,689 --> 01:12:41,819
disposable vaporizer it's got a battery

1814
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:43,619
already in it you're supposed to use it

1815
01:12:41,819 --> 01:12:45,689
until it dies and then you're supposed

1816
01:12:43,619 --> 01:12:47,909
to throw it away so it's got

1817
01:12:45,689 --> 01:12:49,949
instructions of press the button five

1818
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:52,739
times to turn it on unscrew the

1819
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:54,809
mouthpiece lows load with your desired I

1820
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:57,210
think it said essential oil as what it

1821
01:12:54,810 --> 01:12:58,650
said on the packaging and then it said

1822
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:01,529
screw on the cap and then it said press

1823
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:03,689
the button and inhale so I was gifted

1824
01:13:01,529 --> 01:13:05,819
this it's a yellow Jeep in disposable

1825
01:13:03,689 --> 01:13:07,889
it's the concentrate version I have

1826
01:13:05,819 --> 01:13:10,529
followed the instructions i unscrewed I

1827
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:12,539
loaded I turned it on I screwed it back

1828
01:13:10,529 --> 01:13:13,649
together now you guys we were going to

1829
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:15,810
press the button and we're going to

1830
01:13:13,649 --> 01:13:18,299
inhale and we're going to see what kind

1831
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:19,830
of drawers we get off of the Jeep in

1832
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:22,220
disposable let's check it out right now

1833
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:22,220
here we go

1834
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:38,448
so it's dead silent I know it's shitty

1835
01:13:32,869 --> 01:13:40,369
for podcasting but I loaded it with New

1836
01:13:38,448 --> 01:13:41,689
York City diesel live resin that I got

1837
01:13:40,369 --> 01:13:44,269
from Spence from the garden of Weeden

1838
01:13:41,689 --> 01:13:45,738
big shout out to Spence and it tastes

1839
01:13:44,270 --> 01:13:47,780
really good but honestly I didn't get a

1840
01:13:45,738 --> 01:13:49,009
bit of smoke it's lighting up like it

1841
01:13:47,779 --> 01:13:51,550
should let's try this again let's give

1842
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:51,550
it another Pole

1843
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:05,449
so honestly I just got some hash in my

1844
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:09,500
mouth which tastes really good but

1845
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:10,970
there's no smoke and it's not working

1846
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,489
the way that you would really expect a

1847
01:14:10,970 --> 01:14:15,260
hash pen to work I packed it down

1848
01:14:13,489 --> 01:14:17,960
properly it comes with a little uh a

1849
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:19,880
little pokers he can live resin in my

1850
01:14:17,960 --> 01:14:20,930
mouth I came with a little poker so that

1851
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,980
you could pack it down in there and it's

1852
01:14:20,930 --> 01:14:24,079
packed down in there it's pressed

1853
01:14:21,979 --> 01:14:26,629
against the coil I've used plenty of

1854
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:28,819
hash pins in my day and this one so far

1855
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:30,920
two hits in I'm ready to throw it out

1856
01:14:28,819 --> 01:14:32,689
the [ __ ] window if I hadn't loaded it

1857
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:34,460
up with some decent New York City live

1858
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:36,019
resin it would be out the window the car

1859
01:14:34,460 --> 01:14:38,689
by now so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna

1860
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:40,220
hold it up right to where the hash will

1861
01:14:38,689 --> 01:14:41,779
melt into the coil when I press the

1862
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:44,630
button and I'm gonna let it melt for a

1863
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:47,539
couple of seconds I'm doing that it's

1864
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:49,069
lit up it seems to be doing its thing so

1865
01:14:47,539 --> 01:14:51,829
now I'm hoping that I've melted the hash

1866
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:54,109
down gravity wise into the coil and I'm

1867
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:55,489
gonna hold it to where it you know what

1868
01:14:54,109 --> 01:14:56,899
I mean right it's where the [ __ ] hash

1869
01:14:55,489 --> 01:14:59,149
is melting into the coil while I hit it

1870
01:14:56,899 --> 01:15:00,859
I'm gonna give it a give it a third try

1871
01:14:59,149 --> 01:15:02,359
and we're gonna see how this goes so

1872
01:15:00,859 --> 01:15:04,309
excuse me for one second you'll get more

1873
01:15:02,359 --> 01:15:05,449
silence but I'm gonna try this hopefully

1874
01:15:04,310 --> 01:15:08,170
we don't end up with hashing out my

1875
01:15:05,449 --> 01:15:08,170
throat while I'm driving

1876
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:23,690
no smoke and a little more hash in my

1877
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:25,010
mouth so we will try this again on an

1878
01:15:23,689 --> 01:15:26,239
episode at home when we're in the house

1879
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:29,650
to where we're not driving in the car

1880
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:34,340
trying to do this but so far the

1881
01:15:29,649 --> 01:15:36,259
disposable Jeep in I find it to be a

1882
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:38,150
fail I think you press it five times to

1883
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:40,520
turn it off let's see one two three four

1884
01:15:38,149 --> 01:15:41,750
or five they flashed and went off I'm

1885
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:44,750
gonna set that in the seat next to me

1886
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:46,819
next to the microphone case and we're

1887
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:47,960
gonna say fail on that for now you guys

1888
01:15:46,819 --> 01:15:49,969
got to take a quick drink so I have a

1889
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:53,539
bunch of chunks of wax stuck in my teeth

1890
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:54,590
you know live resin in my mouth so we've

1891
01:15:53,539 --> 01:15:55,609
been going for a few minutes give me

1892
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:57,289
just one second I'm gonna set down the

1893
01:15:55,609 --> 01:15:59,269
microphone all I did this out but I need

1894
01:15:57,289 --> 01:16:01,279
to take a drink hold on I got because of

1895
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:03,850
that pin I've got melted wax in my teeth

1896
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:03,849
hold on here we go

1897
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:12,979
[Music]

1898
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:19,600
all right I might edit a few seconds of

1899
01:16:18,069 --> 01:16:22,479
that out I apologize guys I'd take a

1900
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:25,150
drink there's nothing like having hash

1901
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:25,659
smeared across your two front teeth that

1902
01:16:25,149 --> 01:16:28,179
was weird

1903
01:16:25,659 --> 01:16:29,739
all right so where was I I was talking

1904
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:31,840
about the champs trade show right you

1905
01:16:29,739 --> 01:16:35,409
guys champs trade show was at the Denver

1906
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:37,360
Convention Center it was free they make

1907
01:16:35,409 --> 01:16:39,369
it seem like you need to be some sort of

1908
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:41,679
a vendor or have some sort of a license

1909
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:44,739
to get in there but honestly I don't

1910
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:46,270
have why do I have an LLC in [ __ ] but I

1911
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:47,319
walked up and said hey I'm here and they

1912
01:16:46,270 --> 01:16:50,320
said what company are you with

1913
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:52,239
and I said I was with my buddy Tim

1914
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:54,189
didn't even say anything I said I'm with

1915
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:56,439
organic ax and they looked at Tim and

1916
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:57,939
Tim's with organic ax and so they said

1917
01:16:56,439 --> 01:16:59,349
what's your name and I said Rasta Jeff

1918
01:16:57,939 --> 01:17:01,419
and she wrote my name on a little tag

1919
01:16:59,350 --> 01:17:02,860
and handed it to me no questions asked

1920
01:17:01,420 --> 01:17:05,590
it didn't cost me anything champs is a

1921
01:17:02,859 --> 01:17:07,299
free event if you're in the industry if

1922
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:08,470
not all you gotta do is have a good

1923
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:09,970
reason to be there and tell them that

1924
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:11,650
that's why you're there if you have like

1925
01:17:09,970 --> 01:17:13,180
a wholesale license or something like

1926
01:17:11,649 --> 01:17:15,129
that you can definitely get in if not

1927
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:16,480
you've got a friend that has a way to

1928
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:19,930
get you into champs if you want to cook

1929
01:17:16,479 --> 01:17:21,519
want to go it's free which is a good

1930
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:23,170
thing because it's not really worth a

1931
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:24,370
whole bunch of money to walk through

1932
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:26,739
there if it was like a five dollar

1933
01:17:24,369 --> 01:17:28,239
ticket I wouldn't complain I was a cool

1934
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:29,889
event there's nowhere to sit down it's

1935
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:31,179
illegal to medicate in the building it's

1936
01:17:29,890 --> 01:17:32,530
illegal to consume cannabis in the

1937
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,630
building you can't even hit a vape pen

1938
01:17:32,529 --> 01:17:35,619
they did not like that of course like I

1939
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:38,170
said there were a couple of people

1940
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:39,489
taking a couple of rosin dabs but they

1941
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:41,770
would have been escorted out had they

1942
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:44,380
been caught um it was a great event it

1943
01:17:41,770 --> 01:17:45,910
was fun I had a good time the best part

1944
01:17:44,380 --> 01:17:47,409
for me honestly was linking up with a

1945
01:17:45,909 --> 01:17:49,029
bunch of people from the industry I

1946
01:17:47,409 --> 01:17:51,130
would up Anthony would have Johnny be

1947
01:17:49,029 --> 01:17:53,259
sorry I forgot you guys I did not mean

1948
01:17:51,130 --> 01:17:54,400
to skip you I apologize we spent some

1949
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:56,170
time together hanging out and I almost

1950
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:57,579
[ __ ] spaced it you know why because

1951
01:17:56,170 --> 01:17:58,960
our conversation was just friendly and

1952
01:17:57,579 --> 01:18:01,090
natural it wasn't something that had to

1953
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,890
be documented it was just a good

1954
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:07,060
conversation which I love so shout out

1955

1959
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:17,050
hanging out that was my favorite part

1960
01:18:15,789 --> 01:18:19,210
was meeting up with people and shaking

1961
01:18:17,050 --> 01:18:20,920
hands and seeing everybody was a really

1962
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:22,149
really good time so it's a great place

1963
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:25,119
to go if you're in the industry and you

1964
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:27,029
know a few people you can buy a lot of

1965
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:29,578
great glass at very great

1966
01:18:27,029 --> 01:18:31,559
counted prices I saw some beautiful

1967
01:18:29,578 --> 01:18:34,198
beautiful glass but you guys honestly

1968
01:18:31,559 --> 01:18:35,880
I'm not into buying really artful glass

1969
01:18:34,198 --> 01:18:38,279
lately I've been buying what they call

1970
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:40,949
production work and functional glass is

1971
01:18:38,279 --> 01:18:43,259
just clear and hits like a champ I hate

1972
01:18:40,948 --> 01:18:45,269
it when I spend hundreds to a thousand

1973
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,530
dollars on a nice rig hold on I gotta

1974
01:18:45,270 --> 01:18:50,340
put the microphone down here cuz the car

1975
01:18:46,529 --> 01:18:51,509
just gonna be one second alright I just

1976
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,170
didn't want that car to see me talking

1977
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:53,400
into the mic

1978
01:18:52,170 --> 01:18:54,809
I hate it when you spend a lot of money

1979
01:18:53,399 --> 01:18:57,569
or your friends spend a lot of money on

1980
01:18:54,809 --> 01:18:58,949
a rig and you can only put like a really

1981
01:18:57,569 --> 01:19:00,630
certain amount of water in there because

1982
01:18:58,948 --> 01:19:02,250
one drop more it splashes it in your

1983
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:04,260
mouth and one drop less it doesn't perk

1984
01:19:02,250 --> 01:19:06,359
right I found that to be really annoying

1985
01:19:04,260 --> 01:19:08,070
on a custom-made piece so I buy

1986
01:19:06,359 --> 01:19:10,019
production pieces that are clear and I

1987
01:19:08,069 --> 01:19:11,308
think they hit like a [ __ ] champ you

1988
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:13,230
guys I think there's nothing wrong with

1989
01:19:11,309 --> 01:19:14,460
having a clear rig you don't even need

1990
01:19:13,229 --> 01:19:16,078
to spend a lot of money on a rig you

1991
01:19:14,460 --> 01:19:17,760
guys you could have spent 40 bucks on a

1992
01:19:16,078 --> 01:19:19,408
really nice rig today and been set up

1993
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,510
you could have got a highly-educated

1994
01:19:19,408 --> 01:19:23,368
titanium male and a carb cap for a

1995
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:24,599
really good price champs is a great

1996
01:19:23,368 --> 01:19:26,759
place if you're looking to come up on a

1997
01:19:24,599 --> 01:19:28,199
rig or two or if you've got a wholesale

1998
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:31,860
license it was really the place to buy a

1999
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:33,299
whole bunch of [ __ ] alright so also shot

2000

2001
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:39,510
set up in style yeah so for a free event

2002
01:19:37,738 --> 01:19:41,519
it was really a good time it was a great

2003
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:44,760
day in Denver it rained a little bit but

2004
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,710
they didn't slow anybody down most of

2005
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:48,210
the vendors that I really appreciated

2006
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:51,989
seeing will be at the Cannabis Cup in

2007
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:53,309
Denver or excuse me I'm burpin they'll

2008
01:19:51,988 --> 01:19:55,169
be at the Cannabis Cup in Denver in

2009
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:56,489
April if that happens there's rumors

2010
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:57,690
that that may not happen I'm not gonna

2011
01:19:56,488 --> 01:19:58,859
start talking [ __ ] about it on the show

2012
01:19:57,689 --> 01:20:00,538
but there have been rumors that that

2013
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:02,698
won't happen let's hope that it does

2014
01:20:00,538 --> 01:20:04,769
most of those vendors will be available

2015
01:20:02,698 --> 01:20:06,658
and present at the Cannabis Cup in full

2016
01:20:04,770 --> 01:20:08,820
force if there's a cannabis cup in your

2017
01:20:06,658 --> 01:20:11,009
area I bet those vendors will be there

2018
01:20:08,819 --> 01:20:12,658

2019

2023
01:20:18,658 --> 01:20:22,019
[ __ ] time when you get a new glass

2024
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:24,000

nail I like a domeless nail on a carb

01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:32,158

2052
01:21:17,029 --> 01:21:20,809
while I was driving see if I could

2053
01:21:18,199 --> 01:21:22,819
actually do a car podcast never thought

2054
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:24,680
of that before now that I've got this

2055
01:21:22,819 --> 01:21:26,750

2056
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:29,600
you guys I've got an episode coming up

2057
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:33,170
Monday I think Monday we are going to

2058
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:35,150
talk about ways reasons why your

2059
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:36,590
cannabis is not top-shelf in ways that

2060
01:21:35,149 --> 01:21:39,259
you can improve your cannabis and make

2061
01:21:36,590 --> 01:21:40,850
it top-shelf I wouldn't take a whole lot

2062
01:21:39,260 --> 01:21:42,829
foremost do you guys just upgrade your

2063
01:21:40,850 --> 01:21:44,539
grow just a little bit it won't cost you

2064
01:21:42,829 --> 01:21:46,760
money it will cost you more time energy

2065
01:21:44,539 --> 01:21:49,220
effort and attention which we all should

2066
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:52,190

your day a little bit better thanks for

2130
01:23:58,649 --> 01:24:03,299
joining me guys I'm back in the studio

2131
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:05,639
last time I was on I did an episode from

2132
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:08,429
the car and I did a review on the Jeep

2133
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:11,760
in slim disposable vaporizer

2134
01:24:08,429 --> 01:24:13,020
I used the concentrate version you know

2135
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,429
when I was in the car I gave this thing

2136
01:24:13,020 --> 01:24:16,710
kind of a shitty review but let me tell

2137
01:24:14,429 --> 01:24:18,449
you that was a preemptive strike I got

2138
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:20,460
home and I looked at it a little bit all

2139
01:24:18,448 --> 01:24:22,678
I had to do was passion pack the hash in

2140
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:24,389
a little bit harder press it down and

2141
01:24:22,679 --> 01:24:27,029
heat it up a little bit and it actually

2142
01:24:24,389 --> 01:24:30,270
gave me quite a few fat rips so I'm

2143
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:32,550
going to what is it called withdraw my

2144
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:34,590
my shitty review of this product and I'm

2145
01:24:32,550 --> 01:24:37,650
going to update it I'm going to give it

2146
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:39,210
like 4 out of 5 stars for a vape pen

2147
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:41,368
that's disposable this is probably the

2148
01:24:39,210 --> 01:24:44,439
best quality we're gonna find so like 4

2149
01:24:41,368 --> 01:24:46,689
out of 5 stars because for a DAB

2150
01:24:44,439 --> 01:24:48,939
wacks hit or a concentrate hit I prefer

2151
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:50,289
a rig you need a rig for five stars but

2152
01:24:48,939 --> 01:24:52,000
it's a good product if you're in

2153
01:24:50,289 --> 01:24:53,529
Colorado and you're picking up some

2154
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,090
concentrates and you need something to

2155
01:24:53,529 --> 01:24:56,829
smoke it through these little yellow

2156
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:58,539
vape pens that you're gonna throw away

2157
01:24:56,829 --> 01:25:00,789
when you're done I think these are an

2158
01:24:58,539 --> 01:25:02,829
affordable and economical deal so I

2159
01:25:00,789 --> 01:25:04,510
apologize for the shitty review my

2160
01:25:02,829 --> 01:25:07,840
updated review says it's a quality

2161
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:09,970
product all right so the whole nation a

2162
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:10,630

2192
01:26:08,409 --> 01:26:12,819
shows and they set up their booths and

2193
01:26:10,720 --> 01:26:14,710
they take great care of the customers

2194
01:26:12,819 --> 01:26:17,380

breeding big shout out to all those

2238
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:38,770
people I really enjoy going to those

2239
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:40,240
events it's really a refreshing time all

2240
01:27:38,770 --> 01:27:41,980
right so you guys let's get down to

2241
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:42,750
business here is the topic for the show

2242
01:27:41,979 --> 01:27:44,829
today

2243
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:46,720
I've been bumping into people and

2244
01:27:44,829 --> 01:27:48,399
they've been talking about why some

2245
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:50,470
people are able to take their cannabis

2246
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:53,739
to the next level and some people are

2247
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:56,079
stuck growing it's not mid grade but

2248
01:27:53,739 --> 01:27:58,059
it's still not stellar cannabis so I

2249
01:27:56,079 --> 01:28:00,489
thought that I would write down some of

2250
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:02,440
the reasons why your herb not yours but

2251
01:28:00,489 --> 01:28:04,599
some herb is not what we would consider

2252
01:28:02,439 --> 01:28:06,819
top-shelf product and then we could talk

2253
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:10,240
about a few ways on how to improve that

2254
01:28:06,819 --> 01:28:12,159
and get your herb up to the top shelf so

2255
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:13,929
let me work on my list here I got a

2256
01:28:12,159 --> 01:28:16,180
couple things written down all right you

2257
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:18,070
guys the main reason I find the cannabis

2258
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:20,350
is not able to be considered top shelf

2259
01:28:18,069 --> 01:28:22,299
product is because it has been over

2260
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:24,250
fertilized a lot of people are thinking

2261
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:25,930
that they can add more fertilizer and

2262
01:28:24,250 --> 01:28:27,699
feed it more and you're gonna get better

2263
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:30,400
product but actually what you're doing

2264
01:28:27,699 --> 01:28:32,019
is you are pumping it full of nutrients

2265
01:28:30,399 --> 01:28:33,579
that are gonna affect the flavor it's

2266
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:35,380
gonna be harder to flush that stuff out

2267
01:28:33,579 --> 01:28:37,470
in the end everything that you put into

2268
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:40,329
your plants will affect the flavor

2269
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:41,920
another big reason that I find a lot of

2270
01:28:40,329 --> 01:28:43,750
cannabis is not able to be considered

2271
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:46,600
top shelf product is that it was not

2272
01:28:43,750 --> 01:28:48,579
properly flushed you guys your cannabis

2273
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:51,610
plants need to be flushed for a minimum

2274
01:28:48,579 --> 01:28:55,059
of 10 days preferably two full weeks

2275
01:28:51,609 --> 01:28:56,889
before harvest so 10 to 14 days before

2276
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:58,780
you plan on cutting down your plants you

2277
01:28:56,890 --> 01:29:02,680
need to start watering it with just

2278
01:28:58,779 --> 01:29:04,599
clean water pH and about six five get in

2279
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,190
there just fill every pot

2280
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:07,480
the whole pot with water so that it's

2281
01:29:06,189 --> 01:29:10,239
dripping out of the drain holes a little

2282
01:29:07,479 --> 01:29:12,099
bit do that 14 days before harvest and

2283
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:13,059
then let it dry up just like you

2284
01:29:12,100 --> 01:29:15,100
normally would and when you're gonna

2285
01:29:13,060 --> 01:29:16,990
water again make sure you water it until

2286
01:29:15,100 --> 01:29:18,640
it drips out of the pot a little bit and

2287
01:29:16,989 --> 01:29:21,010
you don't want to give it any nutrients

2288
01:29:18,640 --> 01:29:22,390
for the last 14 days if you're an

2289
01:29:21,010 --> 01:29:24,100
experienced grower there are a few

2290
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:25,690
things you can add at the end there but

2291
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,490
I wouldn't recommend too many things

2292
01:29:25,689 --> 01:29:29,349
unless you really know what you're doing

2293
01:29:27,489 --> 01:29:31,689
that's this is where you're really going

2294
01:29:29,350 --> 01:29:33,340
to start affecting your flavor so be

2295
01:29:31,689 --> 01:29:36,879
careful at the end make sure you flush

2296
01:29:33,340 --> 01:29:38,890
for at least 14 days you can go longer

2297
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,300
you I don't think you can over flush if

2298
01:29:38,890 --> 01:29:42,130
you feel like you start flushing about

2299
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:43,630
14 days before you think you're gonna

2300
01:29:42,130 --> 01:29:45,670
harvest and you feel like those plants

2301
01:29:43,630 --> 01:29:47,319
can go a few more days don't worry let

2302
01:29:45,670 --> 01:29:49,239
them go a few more days they'll be just

2303
01:29:47,319 --> 01:29:51,340
fine and they will taste even better let

2304
01:29:49,239 --> 01:29:52,840
them finish up let them ripen up let

2305
01:29:51,340 --> 01:29:54,579
them flush out let all the nutrients

2306
01:29:52,840 --> 01:29:57,190
come out and you'll be okay hey you guys

2307
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:58,569
you may see some yellowing hope for some

2308
01:29:57,189 --> 01:29:59,979
yellowing that means you're flushing it

2309
01:29:58,569 --> 01:30:01,989
properly that means that you're getting

2310
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:04,389
all the excess nutrients out of the

2311
01:30:01,989 --> 01:30:06,159
leaves that are stored in the plants and

2312
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:07,329
you're gonna flush that right on out

2313
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,769
that means that there aren't extra

2314
01:30:07,329 --> 01:30:10,479
nutrients left in the soil that the

2315
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:12,340
plants eating it means it's eaten all of

2316
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:15,609
its food and it's getting cleaned up and

2317
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:17,020
it's almost time for harvest now I want

2318
01:30:15,609 --> 01:30:19,929
to take a step back and say over

2319
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:21,700
fertilization and not flushing are both

2320
01:30:19,930 --> 01:30:24,579
possible even when you were using

2321
01:30:21,699 --> 01:30:27,039
organics you guys organic nutrients can

2322
01:30:24,579 --> 01:30:29,289
still burn your plants organic nutrients

2323
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:31,720
can over fertilize your plants be

2324
01:30:29,289 --> 01:30:33,220
careful when using organics you can add

2325
01:30:31,720 --> 01:30:34,869
the wrong I mean think about the way

2326
01:30:33,220 --> 01:30:36,640
that stuff smells when you're working

2327
01:30:34,869 --> 01:30:38,769
with some organics it literally smells

2328
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:40,720
like a pile of [ __ ] if you over

2329
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:42,910
fertilize it they can make your buds

2330
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:46,270
taste like a pile of [ __ ] it is very

2331
01:30:42,909 --> 01:30:47,739
possible also not flushing I hear a lot

2332
01:30:46,270 --> 01:30:50,530
of people say they don't have to flush

2333
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:52,989
because they used organic nutrients you

2334
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:54,939
need to flush if you're using if you're

2335
01:30:52,989 --> 01:30:56,170
using your own like super soil and you

2336
01:30:54,939 --> 01:30:57,219
know that you don't need to flush

2337
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:58,600
because you've been flushing the whole

2338
01:30:57,220 --> 01:31:00,039
time you're an experienced grower and

2339
01:30:58,600 --> 01:31:01,660
you understand that but if you're using

2340
01:31:00,039 --> 01:31:05,019
the bottled nutrient or some sort of

2341
01:31:01,659 --> 01:31:06,880
organics or those amended soils you're

2342
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:08,650
going to need to flush you guys so make

2343
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,300
sure you flush even with organics make

2344
01:31:08,649 --> 01:31:12,759
sure you don't over fertilize even with

2345
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:15,310
organics and this can make your cannabis

2346
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:17,320
better if you're using a bottled

2347
01:31:15,310 --> 01:31:18,429
nutrient start with about half of what

2348
01:31:17,319 --> 01:31:21,399
they recommend on the ball

2349
01:31:18,429 --> 01:31:22,840
about half of the dosage rate and then

2350
01:31:21,399 --> 01:31:25,539
if you see that you have a deficiency

2351
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:27,789
move up you can correct you can always

2352
01:31:25,539 --> 01:31:29,590
add but you can never subtract from what

2353
01:31:27,789 --> 01:31:33,158
you fed your planets all right

2354
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:35,590
so don't over fertilize and do flush the

2355
01:31:33,158 --> 01:31:38,500
next thing that I see that makes

2356
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:41,170
cannabis not able to be top shelf is a

2357
01:31:38,500 --> 01:31:43,779
really poor trim job you would not

2358
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:45,940
believe how much very well grown

2359
01:31:43,779 --> 01:31:46,869
cannabis I have seen that would have

2360
01:31:45,939 --> 01:31:49,119
been top-shelf

2361
01:31:46,869 --> 01:31:50,738
if the grower would have taken just a

2362
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:52,510
little bit more time to make sure to

2363
01:31:50,738 --> 01:31:54,250
take all those little tiny leaves off

2364
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:55,900
yours we don't want to see any leaves

2365
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:58,390
when we're looking at the buds we want

2366
01:31:55,899 --> 01:32:00,279
to see trichomes we want to see resin we

2367
01:31:58,390 --> 01:32:02,050
want to see just just bud so we don't

2368
01:32:00,279 --> 01:32:03,519
even want to see any stick at all just a

2369
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,360
little tiny stick that sticks out at the

2370
01:32:03,520 --> 01:32:07,570
bottom of the bud

2371
01:32:04,359 --> 01:32:08,710
that's all that we need so when you're

2372
01:32:07,569 --> 01:32:10,269
trim and make sure you take off all

2373
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:12,429
those little tiny pointy leaves get in

2374
01:32:10,270 --> 01:32:14,469
there and clean that [ __ ] up cut all the

2375
01:32:12,429 --> 01:32:16,960
little sticks out cut your sticks off of

2376
01:32:14,469 --> 01:32:19,149
the big gigantic buds and trim your weed

2377
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,980
to look like just buds look at a

2378
01:32:19,149 --> 01:32:22,629
magazine look online look what good

2379
01:32:20,979 --> 01:32:24,819
quality bud looks like and trim it up

2380
01:32:22,630 --> 01:32:26,020
like that if you can see an obvious leaf

2381
01:32:24,819 --> 01:32:28,059
on there get in there with your scissors

2382
01:32:26,020 --> 01:32:30,280
and clip it off get in there to some

2383
01:32:28,060 --> 01:32:32,560
nail and knock that off trim your we'd

2384
01:32:30,279 --> 01:32:34,569
like connoisseur grade weed and it will

2385
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:36,730
be top-shelf alright

2386
01:32:34,569 --> 01:32:37,988
and also wear rubber gloves you guys

2387
01:32:36,729 --> 01:32:39,729
when you're trimming your cannabis make

2388
01:32:37,988 --> 01:32:42,009
sure that you wear rubber gloves and in

2389
01:32:39,729 --> 01:32:43,718
my opinion top-shelf herb is hand

2390
01:32:42,010 --> 01:32:45,219
trimmed and not machine trimmed if

2391
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:47,770
you've got machine trimmed bud that one

2392
01:32:45,219 --> 01:32:49,569
a cannabis cup I'm impressed ah let's

2393
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:50,710
see what rubber gloves you guys whenever

2394
01:32:49,569 --> 01:32:51,670
you're touching these buds whenever

2395
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:53,050
you're touching a product that

2396
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:55,060
somebody's going to smoke make sure you

2397
01:32:53,050 --> 01:32:56,800
wear rubber gloves we do not want to

2398
01:32:55,060 --> 01:32:58,750
smoke your skin oils I don't want to

2399
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:01,449
hear your skin oil or your skin moisture

2400
01:32:58,750 --> 01:33:04,390
sizzling my dab that's just so gross so

2401
01:33:01,448 --> 01:33:06,729
trim your weed wear gloves and use

2402
01:33:04,390 --> 01:33:09,909
scissors not a trim machine is something

2403
01:33:06,729 --> 01:33:13,928
I want to stress alright so another

2404
01:33:09,908 --> 01:33:16,329
thing that quite often deters people's

2405
01:33:13,929 --> 01:33:20,109
cannabis from being top-shelf product is

2406
01:33:16,329 --> 01:33:22,420
a very poor cure a lot of people are

2407
01:33:20,109 --> 01:33:25,269
trying to speed dry their cannabis you

2408
01:33:22,420 --> 01:33:27,639
guys the slower your buds dry the better

2409
01:33:25,270 --> 01:33:30,210
they are going to taste the better they

2410
01:33:27,639 --> 01:33:32,400
are going to smoke think about your goal

2411
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:35,130
our goal is to

2412
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:37,409
eventually grind up this bud and either

2413
01:33:35,130 --> 01:33:40,710
roll a joint out of it or pack a bowl or

2414
01:33:37,409 --> 01:33:42,359
stuff it in your vaporizer or most of us

2415
01:33:40,710 --> 01:33:45,239
nowadays are going to stuff it into a

2416
01:33:42,359 --> 01:33:46,739
tube and turn it into BHO or a lot of

2417
01:33:45,239 --> 01:33:49,079
your gonna freeze it and turn it into

2418
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:50,340
ice wax or something but anyway let's

2419
01:33:49,079 --> 01:33:52,680
think about what we're trying to do

2420
01:33:50,340 --> 01:33:55,079
eventually most of us are gonna grind up

2421
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:57,000
this herb and roll a fat joint out of it

2422
01:33:55,079 --> 01:33:59,159
then when you smoke your joint you want

2423
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:01,439
it to smell good you want it to taste

2424
01:33:59,159 --> 01:34:03,389
good you want it to get you nice and

2425
01:34:01,439 --> 01:34:04,739
stoned but something that you really

2426
01:34:03,390 --> 01:34:07,020
want it to do that you don't think about

2427
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:09,599
is that you want it to burn nice and

2428
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:11,490
smoothly you want it to burn evenly you

2429
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,470
want it to burn and make a nice white

2430
01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:16,260
ash you don't want it to burn into this

2431
01:34:13,470 --> 01:34:18,119
hard black charcoal looking thing that

2432
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,739
hard black charcoal that's in the bottom

2433
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:21,510
of your bowl when you're done or that

2434
01:34:19,739 --> 01:34:24,170
your joint turns into that's nutrients

2435
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:26,430
that weren't flushed out of the plant

2436
01:34:24,170 --> 01:34:29,430
anyway I'm backing up a little bit but a

2437
01:34:26,430 --> 01:34:31,560
lot of times a bad cure will make your

2438
01:34:29,430 --> 01:34:34,800
buds not burn properly when you're

2439
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:36,690
curing your buds you are removing excess

2440
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:39,659
chlorophyll from the plants you are

2441
01:34:36,689 --> 01:34:42,299
removing a water molecule from the THC

2442
01:34:39,659 --> 01:34:44,880
which makes the THC more psychoactive

2443
01:34:42,300 --> 01:34:47,100
you are also pulling chlorophyll which

2444
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:49,199
is making the plants taste better

2445
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:52,560
making your buds taste better so a

2446
01:34:49,199 --> 01:34:55,439
proper cure and not a speed dry is very

2447
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:57,360
important of proper cure will definitely

2448
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:00,599
affect the way that your buds burn

2449
01:34:57,359 --> 01:35:03,029
slowly drying your buds will suck out

2450
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:05,550
all of that chlorophyll and it will suck

2451
01:35:03,029 --> 01:35:08,429
the moisture out slowly and your buds

2452
01:35:05,550 --> 01:35:10,680
will burn very nice and smoothly they'll

2453
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:14,310
be nice and sticky and they will burn

2454
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:15,960

01:35:53,199 --> 01:35:57,909
back in the game here we are talking

2475
01:35:55,569 --> 01:36:00,429
about a poor cure is what makes your

2476
01:35:57,909 --> 01:36:02,769
buds not top-shelf because they don't

2477
01:36:00,430 --> 01:36:05,320
taste good and they do not burn properly

2478
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:08,290
you guys it is very possible to have

2479
01:36:05,319 --> 01:36:09,819
nice sticky buds that are properly dried

2480
01:36:08,289 --> 01:36:11,979
and cured that will burn like a champ

2481
01:36:09,819 --> 01:36:13,869
stink up the whole [ __ ] neighborhood

2482
01:36:11,979 --> 01:36:15,879
and get you high a [ __ ] that's your goal

2483
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:17,800
so listen to the episode learn how to

2484
01:36:15,880 --> 01:36:19,810
properly dry and cure the buds um

2485
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:22,150
another thing don't try to speed dry

2486
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:23,830
your weed you guys do not speed dry it

2487
01:36:22,149 --> 01:36:26,019
cut it down hang it upside down and let

2488
01:36:23,829 --> 01:36:29,500
it dry properly that's what that's gonna

2489
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:32,890
give you a huge advantage also here is a

2490
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:35,079
major contributing factor to why I feel

2491
01:36:32,890 --> 01:36:38,380
like a lot of people's buds are not

2492
01:36:35,079 --> 01:36:41,890
top-shelf you guys people really love to

2493
01:36:38,380 --> 01:36:45,069
cut their buds way too early what that

2494
01:36:41,890 --> 01:36:47,260
[ __ ] grow let it finish just because the

2495
01:36:45,069 --> 01:36:50,229
packaging on your seed package says that

2496
01:36:47,260 --> 01:36:51,820
those seeds will be done in 60 days does

2497
01:36:50,229 --> 01:36:55,239
not mean that you have to cut them down

2498
01:36:51,819 --> 01:36:56,679
in 60 days get yourself a nice scope get

2499
01:36:55,239 --> 01:36:58,510
some sort of a scope where you can

2500
01:36:56,680 --> 01:37:00,490
magnify the size of your trichomes to

2501
01:36:58,510 --> 01:37:02,890
where you can see how many of them have

2502
01:37:00,489 --> 01:37:05,109
turned opaque how many of them have gone

2503
01:37:02,890 --> 01:37:07,000
cloudy and how many of them are amber

2504
01:37:05,109 --> 01:37:08,920
when you start seeing about 30 percent

2505
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:11,859
amber trichomes is when it's time to

2506
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:13,449
harvest you guys a lot of people are

2507
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:16,089
just cutting weed down way too early

2508
01:37:13,449 --> 01:37:18,279
they're trimming it like [ __ ] there's

2509
01:37:16,090 --> 01:37:20,619
speed drying it and then they're trying

2510
01:37:18,279 --> 01:37:22,420
to get top-shelf prices for it and they

2511
01:37:20,619 --> 01:37:23,920
feel bad and they feel let down when

2512
01:37:22,420 --> 01:37:26,859
they're not able to sell their product

2513
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:29,020
for a top-shelf price you've got to let

2514
01:37:26,859 --> 01:37:30,489
it finish you've really got to let it

2515
01:37:29,020 --> 01:37:32,170
finish it doesn't even taste right it

2516
01:37:30,489 --> 01:37:33,550
doesn't get you high enough and you're

2517
01:37:32,170 --> 01:37:35,260
not even getting the right weight if you

2518
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:36,850
don't let it finish that last week or

2519
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:39,579
two is really where it starts packing on

2520
01:37:36,850 --> 01:37:41,620
weight on a lot of strains so let the

2521
01:37:39,579 --> 01:37:43,720
weed grow longer quit cutting it too

2522
01:37:41,619 --> 01:37:46,899
early and it will really improve the

2523
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:48,820
quality of your buds like I said get a

2524
01:37:46,899 --> 01:37:50,199
scope start watching the trichomes quit

2525
01:37:48,819 --> 01:37:51,909
paying so much attention to your

2526
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:53,649
calendar and pay a little bit more

2527
01:37:51,909 --> 01:37:55,510
attention to the plants I understand

2528
01:37:53,649 --> 01:37:58,299
you're on a schedule but the plants are

2529
01:37:55,510 --> 01:37:59,739
the boss here and if you want a Plus

2530
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:01,539
top-shelf bug

2531
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:04,539
this is what you're gonna have to do all

2532
01:38:01,539 --> 01:38:06,489
right so don't cut too early now also

2533
01:38:04,539 --> 01:38:09,100
you're going to have to pay a lot more

2534
01:38:06,489 --> 01:38:10,869
attention to the room we can tell I can

2535
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:13,000
tell by looking at the finished product

2536
01:38:10,869 --> 01:38:15,340
if the room got too hot or if the room

2537
01:38:13,000 --> 01:38:17,470
got too humid or if you had some sort of

2538
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:19,569
bug infestation or if there was some

2539
01:38:17,470 --> 01:38:21,490
sort of struggle a professional grower

2540
01:38:19,569 --> 01:38:24,099
can tell by looking at your finished but

2541
01:38:21,489 --> 01:38:26,889
what the problem was off your buds are

2542
01:38:24,100 --> 01:38:28,750
airy and fluffy you probably got too hot

2543
01:38:26,890 --> 01:38:30,640
in there if the buds have this weird

2544
01:38:28,750 --> 01:38:33,220
texture to them they probably got too

2545
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:34,690
humid in there I can spot bug damage on

2546
01:38:33,220 --> 01:38:37,090
those leaves that you're not cutting off

2547
01:38:34,689 --> 01:38:39,609
I can see the spider mite marks on those

2548
01:38:37,090 --> 01:38:41,650
leaves you guys so pay a lot of

2549
01:38:39,609 --> 01:38:43,179
attention to the room get good control

2550
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:45,670
of your rooms it's all about the

2551
01:38:43,180 --> 01:38:47,409
environment you have to set up that room

2552
01:38:45,670 --> 01:38:50,230
to have proper air flow you need air

2553
01:38:47,409 --> 01:38:51,789
exchange you need to get the old stale

2554
01:38:50,229 --> 01:38:53,649
air out of there and you need to get

2555
01:38:51,789 --> 01:38:55,149
fresh air in so that that plant can

2556
01:38:53,649 --> 01:38:57,579
breathe you don't want to be trapped in

2557
01:38:55,149 --> 01:39:01,420
a stale humid ass closet all day neither

2558
01:38:57,579 --> 01:39:03,250
do your plants so and they also don't

2559
01:39:01,420 --> 01:39:05,230
want to be too hot if you get the plants

2560
01:39:03,250 --> 01:39:07,720
too hot they start Fox tailing the buds

2561
01:39:05,229 --> 01:39:10,119
start getting wispy it's just like in

2562
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:11,289
the summer time you guys you guys you

2563
01:39:10,119 --> 01:39:13,180
know what I'm talking about when it gets

2564
01:39:11,289 --> 01:39:14,619
all hot your junk starts swinging down

2565
01:39:13,180 --> 01:39:16,780
all low is just trying to cool itself

2566
01:39:14,619 --> 01:39:19,059
down the plants will do the same thing

2567
01:39:16,779 --> 01:39:20,259
it starts spreading its legs all far so

2568
01:39:19,060 --> 01:39:22,270
that it can get some air and it starts

2569
01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:25,000
Fox tailing that's from too much heat

2570
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:26,890
you guys so if you get your grow room

2571
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:29,619
under control you will be able to

2572
01:39:26,890 --> 01:39:31,210
produce better cannabis get the bugs

2573
01:39:29,619 --> 01:39:32,710
under control you guys if you don't have

2574
01:39:31,210 --> 01:39:34,510
bugs on your plants your plants don't

2575
01:39:32,710 --> 01:39:36,250
have to spend all their energy fighting

2576
01:39:34,510 --> 01:39:38,699
off these predators and they're able to

2577
01:39:36,250 --> 01:39:42,399
use all of their energy into producing

2578
01:39:38,699 --> 01:39:45,460
delicious tasty trichomes and resin and

2579
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:51,129
terpenes let the plants focus on what

2580
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:52,449
they're supposed to do alright so pay

2581
01:39:51,130 --> 01:39:54,100
attention to the room get the room under

2582
01:39:52,449 --> 01:39:57,220
control is the point of that part right

2583
01:39:54,100 --> 01:39:59,530
there so another reason why a lot of

2584
01:39:57,220 --> 01:40:02,949
cannabis that I see cannot be considered

2585
01:39:59,529 --> 01:40:07,119
top-shelf cannabis is because the grower

2586
01:40:02,949 --> 01:40:09,039
basically forgot the general rules of

2587
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:12,039
growing he forgot to think about his

2588
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:13,389
lights his air his water or his soil he

2589
01:40:12,039 --> 01:40:15,639
just kind of got off

2590
01:40:13,389 --> 01:40:17,800
times as growers we get complacent we

2591
01:40:15,639 --> 01:40:19,748
get cocky we get egotistical we get

2592
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:22,300
overconfident we get ahead of ourselves

2593
01:40:19,748 --> 01:40:24,868
that [ __ ] happens and sometimes that's

2594
01:40:22,300 --> 01:40:27,939
when you start worrying about something

2595
01:40:24,868 --> 01:40:29,380
that is really obscure and then you

2596
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:30,999
forget about something that was really

2597
01:40:29,380 --> 01:40:32,349
basic you're trying some new trick

2598
01:40:30,998 --> 01:40:33,668
that's really gonna improve the crop

2599
01:40:32,349 --> 01:40:35,469
right this new trick is gonna make

2600
01:40:33,668 --> 01:40:39,130
everything [ __ ] magical it's gonna be

2601
01:40:35,469 --> 01:40:41,168
amazing but as I did that I forgot to pH

2602
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:42,998
the nutrient solution before I water it

2603
01:40:41,168 --> 01:40:45,099
something stupid like that you guys just

2604
01:40:42,998 --> 01:40:47,109
pay attention to the basics pay

2605
01:40:45,099 --> 01:40:48,760
attention to your lights pay attention

2606
01:40:47,109 --> 01:40:50,618
to the air pay attention to your water

2607
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:52,329
and pay attention to your soil and

2608
01:40:50,618 --> 01:40:53,948
everything should be cool of course pay

2609
01:40:52,328 --> 01:40:56,228
attention to the plants look at the

2610
01:40:53,948 --> 01:40:58,448
leaves every day for bugs do all that

2611
01:40:56,229 --> 01:41:00,249
stuff but remember the basics you need

2612
01:40:58,448 --> 01:41:03,609
good lighting if you don't have good

2613
01:41:00,248 --> 01:41:05,679
lighting you can't grow quality buds you

2614
01:41:03,609 --> 01:41:07,808
can grow quality bud under a small lamp

2615
01:41:05,679 --> 01:41:09,788
I wouldn't go you know you can use it

2616
01:41:07,809 --> 01:41:11,708
250 you're not gonna grow cannabis cup

2617
01:41:09,788 --> 01:41:14,529
winning buds underneath the 250 watt

2618
01:41:11,708 --> 01:41:16,779
light you may do okay under a 4 you've

2619
01:41:14,529 --> 01:41:18,819
got potential under a 6 but I really

2620
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:21,130
think if you're gonna grow cannabis cup

2621
01:41:18,819 --> 01:41:23,708
winning top-shelf a great buds you need

2622
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:25,569
at least a thousand watt light at least

2623
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:28,359
1000 watt light and you don't want to

2624
01:41:25,569 --> 01:41:30,998
try to put more than about a 4 by 4 or a

2625
01:41:28,359 --> 01:41:32,889
5 by 5 floor pattern worth of plants

2626
01:41:30,998 --> 01:41:34,478
underneath there you want your canopy to

2627
01:41:32,889 --> 01:41:36,578
be nice and tight under that thousand

2628
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:38,649
watt light the light is the main

2629
01:41:36,578 --> 01:41:40,958
nutrient for your plants that's what the

2630
01:41:38,649 --> 01:41:43,030
plants want more than anything so have

2631
01:41:40,958 --> 01:41:45,429
enough lighting and also make sure you

2632
01:41:43,029 --> 01:41:47,708
have the right spectrum that's super

2633
01:41:45,429 --> 01:41:50,769
important don't forget about that air we

2634
01:41:47,708 --> 01:41:52,389
sort of discussed air before ah don't

2635
01:41:50,769 --> 01:41:54,639
have too much humidity don't have too

2636
01:41:52,389 --> 01:41:56,918
much heat try to find a way to replenish

2637
01:41:54,639 --> 01:42:00,429
the co2 by replacing the air in the room

2638
01:41:56,918 --> 01:42:02,738
very often your water I've mentioned

2639
01:42:00,429 --> 01:42:04,239
this make sure your pH in your nutrient

2640
01:42:02,738 --> 01:42:05,859
solution before you're feeding it to

2641
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:07,029
your plants make sure you're checking

2642
01:42:05,859 --> 01:42:08,978
your PPM's

2643
01:42:07,029 --> 01:42:10,688
make sure you're using good quality

2644
01:42:08,979 --> 01:42:13,389
water if you can start with reverse

2645
01:42:10,689 --> 01:42:15,610
osmosis water that would be ideal

2646
01:42:13,389 --> 01:42:17,918
make sure you remember to check the pH

2647
01:42:15,609 --> 01:42:19,958
you guys a lot of people or simply have

2648
01:42:17,918 --> 01:42:21,698
overlooked pH balancing their water

2649
01:42:19,958 --> 01:42:24,010
before they add it to the solute to the

2650
01:42:21,698 --> 01:42:25,819
plants you want that about six five ish

2651
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:28,579
depending on what strains you're running

2652
01:42:25,819 --> 01:42:30,139
on how far into flower you are but make

2653
01:42:28,579 --> 01:42:31,519
sure you've got your nutrients measured

2654
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:33,440
properly you're not over feeding the

2655
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,170
plants and you've got them pH adjusted

2656
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:37,729
your soil you guys you got to use a good

2657
01:42:36,170 --> 01:42:39,350
quality soil you can't be packing your

2658
01:42:37,729 --> 01:42:41,599
dirt too tight you need some aeration

2659
01:42:39,350 --> 01:42:44,510
you need some air in there you need some

2660
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:46,130
drainage in there use good soil don't

2661
01:42:44,510 --> 01:42:48,110
overlook that type of stuff those are

2662
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:49,909
the basics that you guys need to pay

2663
01:42:48,109 --> 01:42:52,549
attention to that you may have forgotten

2664
01:42:49,909 --> 01:42:54,979
that sometimes I forget I'm guilty of

2665
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:57,230
this as well this is all small things

2666
01:42:54,979 --> 01:42:59,479
that I'm trying to remind you about so

2667
01:42:57,229 --> 01:43:00,889
don't forget the basics of growing and

2668
01:42:59,479 --> 01:43:03,859
we can always refer to the old rule

2669
01:43:00,890 --> 01:43:06,079
called laws lights air water and soil

2670
01:43:03,859 --> 01:43:07,639
never forget those and then of course

2671
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:09,289
you got to add love in there because I

2672
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:11,869
think plants grow with a lot of luck you

2673
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:14,269
gotta love the plants so another way to

2674
01:43:11,869 --> 01:43:15,409
improve your cannabis and this is gonna

2675
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:17,870
sound like I'm just trying to make a

2676
01:43:15,409 --> 01:43:20,210
sales pitch here but you need good

2677
01:43:17,869 --> 01:43:23,269
quality genetics you guys unless you've

2678
01:43:20,210 --> 01:43:25,730
got a top-shelf cultivar and I'm gonna

2679
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:28,250
I'm gonna branch here you guys quit

2680
01:43:25,729 --> 01:43:29,719
saying strands it's not a strand we

2681
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:31,640
don't smoke different strands we don't

2682
01:43:29,720 --> 01:43:33,800
grow different strands we grow different

2683
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:35,660
strains and if you really want to be

2684
01:43:33,800 --> 01:43:38,029
difficult and technical they are known

2685
01:43:35,659 --> 01:43:39,829
as varietals and then if you really want

2686
01:43:38,029 --> 01:43:43,189
to be an [ __ ] you would call it a

2687
01:43:39,829 --> 01:43:46,579
cultivar so a specific phenotype of a

2688
01:43:43,189 --> 01:43:48,619
specific strain would be a cultivar but

2689
01:43:46,579 --> 01:43:50,930
I digress use good genetics you guys

2690
01:43:48,619 --> 01:43:53,119
grow a good strain if you're stuck on

2691
01:43:50,930 --> 01:43:55,130
growing that strain and you can't get it

2692
01:43:53,119 --> 01:43:57,109
to be what you want it to be maybe it's

2693
01:43:55,130 --> 01:43:59,960
time to buy a pack of seeds and run

2694
01:43:57,109 --> 01:44:01,549
those seeds and find zi1 in there that

2695
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:03,199
does what you need maybe you're simply

2696
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:05,779
held back by the quality of the clones

2697
01:44:03,199 --> 01:44:08,269
you've got that could be your issue so

2698
01:44:05,779 --> 01:44:10,729
use good genetics do some research get

2699
01:44:08,270 --> 01:44:12,350
some seeds from a reputable breeder I am

2700
01:44:10,729 --> 01:44:14,269
not sponsored by the dank team.com

2701
01:44:12,350 --> 01:44:16,820
currently they do not pay for any ads

2702
01:44:14,270 --> 01:44:19,430
but I can fully recommend my friends at

2703
01:44:16,819 --> 01:44:21,979
the dank team.com they have reliable

2704
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:24,110
seeds I used to say it all the time you

2705
01:44:21,979 --> 01:44:28,129
can get rare dankness mile hike an

2706
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:29,329
adventure Sin City sour seeds those are

2707
01:44:28,130 --> 01:44:31,039
just a few of the people that I would

2708
01:44:29,329 --> 01:44:32,569
recommend of course I read genetics if

2709
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:34,670
you can get your hands on it get

2710
01:44:32,569 --> 01:44:38,119
yourself some good quality seeds from a

2711
01:44:34,670 --> 01:44:39,859
reputable breeder I do a Fino hunt find

2712
01:44:38,119 --> 01:44:42,739
the best one out of there

2713
01:44:39,859 --> 01:44:44,479
you and maybe that will help you improve

2714
01:44:42,739 --> 01:44:45,679
the quality of your cannabis maybe it's

2715
01:44:44,479 --> 01:44:47,899
just that clone that you're growing

2716
01:44:45,680 --> 01:44:50,900
isn't going to get any better maybe it's

2717
01:44:47,899 --> 01:44:52,729
got maybe its potential is only 17% of

2718
01:44:50,899 --> 01:44:55,159
THC no matter what you do to it it's

2719
01:44:52,729 --> 01:44:56,839
just a genetic thing my genetics say

2720
01:44:55,159 --> 01:44:59,059
that I'm not gonna be able to jump six

2721
01:44:56,840 --> 01:45:00,619
feet high no matter what I do I can't

2722
01:44:59,060 --> 01:45:02,230
jump high I'm a white I'm a white man

2723
01:45:00,619 --> 01:45:04,519
they can't jump it's just my genetics

2724
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:07,519
sometimes these plants aren't gonna go

2725
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:10,340
much further than their potential so get

2726
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,410
good genetics hey guys we talked about

2727
01:45:10,340 --> 01:45:14,329
lights air water and soil but what we

2728
01:45:12,409 --> 01:45:17,869
got to think about is do not overlook

2729
01:45:14,329 --> 01:45:19,789
the vegetative stage of growth from day

2730
01:45:17,869 --> 01:45:22,250
one when you get those clones when you

2731
01:45:19,789 --> 01:45:25,310
crack those seeds from the very

2732
01:45:22,250 --> 01:45:28,039
beginning of the grow you are working on

2733
01:45:25,310 --> 01:45:30,020
the quality of that cannabis you may

2734
01:45:28,039 --> 01:45:31,579
just say hey it's a veg I can just put

2735
01:45:30,020 --> 01:45:33,500
it under these weak lights I don't need

2736
01:45:31,579 --> 01:45:36,010
a lot of good air I don't need to feed

2737
01:45:33,500 --> 01:45:39,619
it good so a good nutrients but really

2738
01:45:36,010 --> 01:45:41,630
good teenagers and good kids make good

2739
01:45:39,619 --> 01:45:43,279
adults so why doesn't the same [ __ ] work

2740
01:45:41,630 --> 01:45:45,350
with plants I think you need to take

2741
01:45:43,279 --> 01:45:46,609
really good care of those baby plants

2742
01:45:45,350 --> 01:45:48,590
because that is the beginning of

2743
01:45:46,609 --> 01:45:50,689
everything you need to create a nice

2744
01:45:48,590 --> 01:45:52,909
root zone you need to create a nice

2745
01:45:50,689 --> 01:45:55,339
thick stalk you need a nice node

2746
01:45:52,909 --> 01:45:57,079
structure you need nice strong supported

2747
01:45:55,340 --> 01:45:59,960
branches

2748
01:45:57,079 --> 01:46:02,989
you need nice topping you need nice a

2749
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:04,970
nice canopy you need nice pruning just

2750
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:07,279
take very good care of the plants in the

2751
01:46:04,970 --> 01:46:09,110
veg phase and you will be very prepared

2752
01:46:07,279 --> 01:46:11,509
for happy healthy plants when you go

2753
01:46:09,109 --> 01:46:13,189
into the flowering stage so pay more

2754
01:46:11,510 --> 01:46:15,140
attention to the veg phase I think a lot

2755
01:46:13,189 --> 01:46:17,750
of people overlook the vegetative stage

2756
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:20,060
of cannabis growing so that's a way that

2757
01:46:17,750 --> 01:46:23,539
you could definitely improve the quality

2758
01:46:20,060 --> 01:46:25,400
of your cannabis alright guys I've got

2759
01:46:23,539 --> 01:46:26,750
one more thing that I really think would

2760
01:46:25,399 --> 01:46:28,759
help improve the quality of your

2761
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:31,100
finished product and it will also help

2762
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:33,350
improve the quality of your concentrates

2763
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:36,200
if you're a hash maker something you

2764
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:37,280
really need to do is clean your grow

2765
01:46:36,199 --> 01:46:39,439
room okay

2766
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:40,699
make sure that the floor is clean make

2767
01:46:39,439 --> 01:46:42,589
sure that the tops of your light

2768
01:46:40,699 --> 01:46:44,300
reflectors are dusted off make sure that

2769
01:46:42,590 --> 01:46:46,130
the air conditioner gets cleaned make

2770
01:46:44,300 --> 01:46:47,960
sure that all the blowers and the carbon

2771
01:46:46,130 --> 01:46:50,210
filters the tops of them sometimes they

2772
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:51,980
collect a little dust clean those make

2773
01:46:50,210 --> 01:46:54,380
sure that your carbon filter covers get

2774
01:46:51,979 --> 01:46:56,929
cleaned occasionally hey guys you gotta

2775
01:46:54,380 --> 01:46:59,510
go in there and clean up if you've got a

2776
01:46:56,930 --> 01:47:01,909
shop vac with a good filter on it get in

2777
01:46:59,510 --> 01:47:03,710
there and shop vac the corners clean the

2778
01:47:01,909 --> 01:47:05,869
[ __ ] out of that grow room because every

2779
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:08,149
piece of dust and particulate that is in

2780
01:47:05,869 --> 01:47:10,399
the air will end up sticking to your

2781
01:47:08,149 --> 01:47:11,599
plants if you've ever taken a picture of

2782
01:47:10,399 --> 01:47:14,479
a cannabis plant and there's a little

2783
01:47:11,600 --> 01:47:16,490
hair in there you understand exactly how

2784
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:17,899
bad anything and everything will stick

2785
01:47:16,489 --> 01:47:19,670
to your cannabis plants while they're

2786
01:47:17,899 --> 01:47:20,929
growing you'll never be able to get the

2787
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:23,359
hair out of it you'll never be able to

2788
01:47:20,930 --> 01:47:25,610
get the dust out so clean up the grow

2789
01:47:23,359 --> 01:47:27,469
room if you've got long hair if you've

2790
01:47:25,609 --> 01:47:29,059
got a beard think about keeping that

2791
01:47:27,470 --> 01:47:31,010
[ __ ] out of the plants to do what you

2792
01:47:29,060 --> 01:47:32,870
can I can't talk too much [ __ ] I've got

2793
01:47:31,010 --> 01:47:34,850
dreadlocks that go almost to my knees

2794
01:47:32,869 --> 01:47:37,449
I've got to wear a big ass hat just to

2795
01:47:34,850 --> 01:47:40,579
go in the girl room so try to be

2796
01:47:37,449 --> 01:47:42,289
sanitary try to be clean try to be dust

2797
01:47:40,579 --> 01:47:44,029
free try to clean up all that [ __ ] all

2798
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:46,069
of that stuff is going to stick to your

2799
01:47:44,029 --> 01:47:48,199
buds all that stuff is going to end up

2800
01:47:46,069 --> 01:47:49,819
in your finished product all that stuff

2801
01:47:48,199 --> 01:47:51,289
is going to end up in your concentrate

2802
01:47:49,819 --> 01:47:53,569
so just think about all the dust and

2803
01:47:51,289 --> 01:47:54,829
whatever that is its soil and whatever

2804
01:47:53,569 --> 01:47:58,069
else you're dragging around in the grow

2805
01:47:54,829 --> 01:48:00,649
room that's all going to end up in your

2806
01:47:58,069 --> 01:48:01,969
finished product alright guys so I'm

2807
01:48:00,649 --> 01:48:04,159
gonna do a quick recap I've gone through

2808
01:48:01,970 --> 01:48:06,289
my list let's go real quickly if you

2809
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:08,349
want your buds to be a little bit better

2810
01:48:06,289 --> 01:48:10,569
than they are maybe you could

2811
01:48:08,349 --> 01:48:12,519
I'll pay more attention to your feeding

2812
01:48:10,569 --> 01:48:14,499
maybe you could flush a little bit

2813
01:48:12,519 --> 01:48:16,119
better you could possibly trim up your

2814
01:48:14,498 --> 01:48:18,578
buds a little bit better you could

2815
01:48:16,118 --> 01:48:20,318
probably improve the quality of your

2816
01:48:18,578 --> 01:48:21,368
drying and curing method which all you'd

2817
01:48:20,319 --> 01:48:23,739
have to do is listen to episode number

2818
01:48:21,368 --> 01:48:25,929
35 and that'll give you huge steps on

2819
01:48:23,738 --> 01:48:27,908
how to do that you could probably let

2820
01:48:25,929 --> 01:48:29,288
your plants grow a little bit longer pay

2821
01:48:27,908 --> 01:48:30,038
attention to the harvest date that would

2822
01:48:29,288 --> 01:48:32,318
help you out

2823
01:48:30,038 --> 01:48:34,389
you could probably pay more attention to

2824
01:48:32,319 --> 01:48:35,919
the room and dial the room in a little

2825
01:48:34,389 --> 01:48:38,078
bit better you could probably work on

2826
01:48:35,918 --> 01:48:39,908
not having bugs another good way to

2827
01:48:38,078 --> 01:48:42,128
improve the quality of your cannabis is

2828
01:48:39,908 --> 01:48:45,068
to remember the basics remember the

2829
01:48:42,128 --> 01:48:46,748
fundamentals of growing another huge way

2830
01:48:45,069 --> 01:48:50,319
to improve the quality of your grow is

2831
01:48:46,748 --> 01:48:53,139
to use quality genetics from a reputable

2832
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:55,659
breeder another good way is to not

2833
01:48:53,139 --> 01:48:58,628
overlook your veg phase and of course

2834
01:48:55,658 --> 01:48:59,978
clean up the grow room and then of

2835
01:48:58,628 --> 01:49:02,318
course we've got a little side note here

2836
01:48:59,979 --> 01:49:04,059
that says good lighting so make sure

2837
01:49:02,319 --> 01:49:05,769
you're using proper lighting and also

2838
01:49:04,059 --> 01:49:07,389
you guys good nutrients good quality

2839
01:49:05,769 --> 01:49:10,479
nutrients will get you a long way make

2840
01:49:07,389 --> 01:49:11,798
sure your plants are properly fed there

2841
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:14,439
are a few things that I think would work

2842
01:49:11,798 --> 01:49:17,139
with every feed regimen if you wanted to

2843
01:49:14,439 --> 01:49:19,719
add dehydrated coconut water and also

2844
01:49:17,139 --> 01:49:21,760
yucca extract those things will

2845
01:49:19,719 --> 01:49:24,279
definitely improve your cannabis with

2846
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:25,599
almost any feed regimen if you're going

2847
01:49:24,279 --> 01:49:27,309
hydro you're gonna have to figure out

2848
01:49:25,599 --> 01:49:28,838
how to add those to your hydro regimen

2849
01:49:27,309 --> 01:49:30,729
it's a little bit different but if you

2850
01:49:28,838 --> 01:49:32,048
got a soil mix going on those things

2851
01:49:30,729 --> 01:49:33,969
that definitely make your plants taste

2852
01:49:32,048 --> 01:49:35,618
better if your plants are burning and

2853
01:49:33,969 --> 01:49:37,929
making black ashes you're probably over

2854
01:49:35,618 --> 01:49:39,548
new training / nutrient tting over

2855
01:49:37,929 --> 01:49:41,019
feeding over fertilizing that's what I

2856
01:49:39,548 --> 01:49:43,059
think I'm trying to say and you're not

2857
01:49:41,019 --> 01:49:45,309
flushing properly so work on those

2858
01:49:43,059 --> 01:49:47,439
things you guys that's all I've got for

2859
01:49:45,309 --> 01:49:50,469
this episode I'm gonna start wrapping up

2860
01:49:47,439 --> 01:49:51,999
the show I will be back in about I'm not

2861
01:49:50,469 --> 01:49:53,948
gonna do a midweek episode so I will be

2862
01:49:51,998 --> 01:49:55,448
back Monday for you I've got a couple of

2863
01:49:53,948 --> 01:49:57,368
few things planned I'm trying to link up

2864
01:49:55,448 --> 01:49:59,858
with our friend Fox he's in Colorado

2865
01:49:57,368 --> 01:50:01,328
right now he is a busy man he is elusive

2866
01:49:59,859 --> 01:50:03,548
I've chased him down for a day and it

2867
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:05,618

2894
01:55:28,389 --> 01:56:07,719
known as on Instagram on Twitter I'm

2895
01:56:06,340 --> 01:56:12,059
looking for the news article that I had

2896
01:56:07,719 --> 01:56:12,059
tagged here but of course uh refreshed

2897
01:56:22,918 --> 01:56:28,689
something weird happened here recently

2898
01:56:25,090 --> 01:56:31,449
in Colorado Snoop Dogg has signed a deal

2899
01:56:28,689 --> 01:56:33,699
with Live Well a dispensary here in

2900
01:56:31,448 --> 01:56:36,069
Colorado to produce a strain of cannabis

2901
01:56:33,698 --> 01:56:38,918
and market this cannabis under the Snoop

2902
01:56:36,069 --> 01:56:40,268
Dogg name and live well that sounds like

2903
01:56:38,918 --> 01:56:41,559
a really cool thing but wills looking at

2904
01:56:40,269 --> 01:56:44,378
me and shaking his head kind of to the

2905
01:56:41,559 --> 01:56:46,300
side kind of like if you guys have heard

2906
01:56:44,378 --> 01:56:48,340
the show in the past we've reported

2907
01:56:46,300 --> 01:56:50,229
about Live Well putting a whole bunch of

2908
01:56:48,340 --> 01:56:52,899
shitty-ass pesticides in their cannabis

2909
01:56:50,229 --> 01:56:54,729
if you come to Colorado and you shop it

2910
01:56:52,899 --> 01:56:56,229
live well you'll be disappointed because

2911
01:56:54,729 --> 01:56:57,550
it's pretty much like going to the

2912
01:56:56,229 --> 01:57:00,550
shittiest street dealer you can ever

2913
01:56:57,550 --> 01:57:02,739
find and buying the shittiest dirt weed

2914
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:05,550
you can find for way too much money and

2915
01:57:02,738 --> 01:57:08,198
it always seems old like old weed yeah

2916
01:57:05,550 --> 01:57:12,059
just old and it's probably because

2917
01:57:08,198 --> 01:57:12,058
they're using pesticides of low quality

2918
01:57:14,649 --> 01:57:18,819
so I think it's really weird that snoop

2919
01:57:16,449 --> 01:57:21,039
has come and done a deal with the

2920
01:57:18,819 --> 01:57:22,479
shittiest they've got the reputation for

2921
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:25,420
being the shittiest dispensary in

2922
01:57:22,479 --> 01:57:27,549
Colorado soups publicist or publishing

2923
01:57:25,420 --> 01:57:30,930

2924
01:57:27,550 --> 01:57:30,930

2925
01:57:34,649 --> 01:57:39,819

2926
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:42,010
am NOT a law expert but snoop is not a

2927
01:57:39,819 --> 01:57:44,109
Colorado resident how is snoop able to

2928

think of any off the top of my head but

2974
01:59:19,180 --> 01:59:24,100

3096
02:04:41,060 --> 02:04:43,310
we're on that subject about bending her

3097
02:04:42,109 --> 02:04:45,380
hangers I'm gonna give it another shout

3098
02:04:43,310 --> 02:04:47,510
out to my uncle glass here because he

3099
02:04:45,380 --> 02:04:49,150
was one of the first in my opinion to

3100
02:04:47,510 --> 02:04:51,320
start using this and he even posted

3101
02:04:49,149 --> 02:04:52,759
about it a while ago was when before

3102
02:04:51,319 --> 02:04:54,559
even bangers were a thing it was emails

3103
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:55,969
when he nails were a big thing he was

3104
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:58,430
one of the first people to start going

3105
02:04:55,969 --> 02:04:59,539
back to the original female joint as

3106
02:04:58,430 --> 02:05:01,520
opposed to the male joint that people

3107
02:04:59,539 --> 02:05:04,460
are using for dabbing because he noticed

3108
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:07,280
the trend of people using attachments

3109
02:05:04,460 --> 02:05:08,659
and drums and everything so he I

3110
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:10,429
remember him making a post about it and

3111
02:05:08,659 --> 02:05:11,809
everything about you know I'm thinking

3112
02:05:10,430 --> 02:05:13,789
about making transition back to just

3113
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:15,500
this blah blah blah and he was one of

3114
02:05:13,789 --> 02:05:17,659
the first people in my opinion to really

3115
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:19,069
you know I was confused when I first saw

3116
02:05:17,659 --> 02:05:20,269
him going back to the female joints I

3117
02:05:19,069 --> 02:05:22,130
was like what's happening here how do I

3118
02:05:20,270 --> 02:05:24,680
put my nail in this [ __ ] like this is

3119
02:05:22,130 --> 02:05:25,670
new and when I saw the bangers the club

3120
02:05:24,680 --> 02:05:29,200
bangers we're gonna have to talk about

3121
02:05:25,670 --> 02:05:29,199
bangers and have to define

3122
02:05:30,739 --> 02:05:35,960
I wrote down the word banger so this

3123
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:37,039
piece we're talking about you guys I

3124
02:05:35,960 --> 02:05:38,810
know we've been talking about this piece

3125
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:40,310
for a long time it's got a really fat

3126
02:05:38,810 --> 02:05:41,380
base and then it's got what did you call

3127
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:44,570

02:05:48,369 --> 02:05:52,279
sacred geometry in the background and

3132
02:05:51,140 --> 02:05:54,050
when you spin it around in the back

3133
02:05:52,279 --> 02:05:55,939
there's like a mid with the flower and

3134
02:05:54,050 --> 02:05:58,220
two leaves around it and then it seals

3135
02:05:55,939 --> 02:06:00,529
up and coming out of the clear sealed

3136
02:05:58,220 --> 02:06:02,000
part is three pieces of bamboo the

3137
02:06:00,529 --> 02:06:04,460
taller piece is the mouthpiece and then

3138
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:06,020

3155
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:46,550

him I've got the wyoming angler but

3157
02:06:46,550 --> 02:07:02,180
these are like my daily drivers I work

3158
02:06:57,289 --> 02:07:03,199
with more the functional clear so since

3159
02:07:02,180 --> 02:07:04,610
we're talking about your glass under

3160
02:07:03,199 --> 02:07:06,170
brag about my new rig I've got this

3161
02:07:04,609 --> 02:07:09,859
Hitman over here it's actually hit man

3162
02:07:06,170 --> 02:07:11,630
Sampson collab it's got basic yeah yeah

3163
02:07:09,859 --> 02:07:13,279
it's got a basic hitman sidecar design

3164
02:07:11,630 --> 02:07:26,270
but then it's got this sweet bro what do

3165
02:07:13,279 --> 02:07:30,019
you call that color greenish turquoise I

3166
02:07:26,270 --> 02:07:31,910
like the clear glass that's made by like

3167
02:07:30,020 --> 02:07:33,980
a like a brand that's known like hitman

3168
02:07:31,909 --> 02:07:36,260
because I have nothing against these

3169
02:07:33,979 --> 02:07:38,000
rigs but when you buy one of these the

3170
02:07:36,260 --> 02:07:39,890
functions sometimes is questionable

3171
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,590
definitely I've seen friends of ours

3172
02:07:39,890 --> 02:07:42,420
spend

3173
02:07:40,590 --> 02:07:45,480
thousands of dollars on a rig and if you

3174
02:07:42,420 --> 02:07:46,770
put four milliliters too much water in

3175
02:07:45,479 --> 02:07:49,289
it you're gonna get in your mouth and if

3176
02:07:46,770 --> 02:07:51,239
you put five milliliters too short you

3177
02:07:49,289 --> 02:07:52,738
get a dry dab and you choke for days I

3178
02:07:51,238 --> 02:07:54,868
love that these production rigs that are

3179
02:07:52,738 --> 02:07:56,098
made the same all the time I love that I

3180
02:07:54,868 --> 02:07:57,658
know what I'm getting when I buy them

3181
02:07:56,099 --> 02:07:59,520
and if I break it I can write I don't

3182
02:07:57,658 --> 02:08:01,948
want to break it but if I do I can

3183
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:05,630
replace that fairly easily go to the

3184
02:08:01,948 --> 02:08:05,629
hitman store which is illusions around

3185
02:08:10,939 --> 02:08:20,879
this much this is a proto or well that's

3186
02:08:19,289 --> 02:08:22,170
a great piece you guys I'll take a

3187
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:23,760
picture of it and I'll put it on my

3188
02:08:22,170 --> 02:08:25,440
Instagram I just promised that so I have

3189
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:27,349
to do it which means you guys need to

3190
02:08:25,439 --> 02:08:30,000
check out my Instagram I'm running down

3191
02:08:27,349 --> 02:08:31,650
insta so you guys got to check out my

3192
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,679
Instagram I read genetics there are

3193
02:08:31,649 --> 02:08:37,138
pictures of these rigs on there why am i

3194
02:08:34,679 --> 02:08:37,880
ringing that's so weird that the MacBook

3195
02:08:37,139 --> 02:08:40,920
is ringing

3196
02:08:37,880 --> 02:08:42,480
decline that [ __ ] all right so if you're

3197
02:08:40,920 --> 02:08:44,039
on a podcast put all your [ __ ] on

3198
02:08:42,479 --> 02:08:47,729
airplane mode that's that's my advice to

3199
02:08:44,039 --> 02:08:49,260
you where the shits were walking about

3200
02:08:47,729 --> 02:08:55,709
rigs right all right dude Brighton for

3201
02:08:49,260 --> 02:09:01,980
bringing thousands of dollars let's talk

3202
02:08:55,710 --> 02:09:04,408
about because I can hook the titanium

3203
02:09:01,979 --> 02:09:06,718
nail up to the email the nails that I

3204
02:09:04,408 --> 02:09:08,729
use are usually titanium they go onto a

3205
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:10,408
mail joint that points up you drop the

3206
02:09:08,729 --> 02:09:13,289
nail onto there or you put your other

3207
02:09:10,408 --> 02:09:15,118
dome type nail inside there like our

3208
02:09:13,289 --> 02:09:17,279
buddy was talking about this dude

3209
02:09:15,118 --> 02:09:19,829
decided to flip back to the female joint

3210
02:09:17,279 --> 02:09:21,960
because he saw the trend of accessories

3211
02:09:19,829 --> 02:09:24,899
and what we're calling bangers coming

3212
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:25,948
out so there's a guy everyone calls him

3213
02:09:24,899 --> 02:09:28,559
qwave but I think it's actually

3214
02:09:25,948 --> 02:09:36,658
pronounced quad and I don't I'm not even

3215
02:09:28,560 --> 02:09:38,699
sure I go back and forth qwave is more

3216
02:09:36,658 --> 02:09:41,729
comfortable quad sounds a little fancier

3217
02:09:38,698 --> 02:09:44,579
yeah so anyway there's a guy named qua

3218
02:09:41,729 --> 02:09:47,729
made what we call the banger it's got a

3219
02:09:44,579 --> 02:09:49,800
male joint that goes into your rig it's

3220
02:09:47,729 --> 02:09:51,238
got a female joint and then it comes

3221
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:52,409
straight up and then it curves out to

3222
02:09:51,238 --> 02:09:55,619
there are multiple different

3223
02:09:52,409 --> 02:09:57,750
available you get it at 90 a 45 probably

3224
02:09:55,619 --> 02:10:01,199
other angles as well but then it's got

3225
02:09:57,750 --> 02:10:06,569
just a basic it looks like a small it

3226
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:08,869
looks like the lid to your chapstick but

3227
02:10:06,569 --> 02:10:11,369
it's clear it's made out of quartz so

3228
02:10:08,869 --> 02:10:12,869
you heat that [ __ ] up and then you let

3229
02:10:11,369 --> 02:10:14,489
it cool and you drop your dab in there

3230
02:10:12,869 --> 02:10:17,069
and the theory and I believe it is that

3231
02:10:14,489 --> 02:10:19,199
the quartz is giving a much cleaner more

3232
02:10:17,069 --> 02:10:21,840
flavorful hit from your self yes

3233
02:10:19,199 --> 02:10:24,539
compared to the titanium and I really

3234
02:10:21,840 --> 02:10:27,090
agree with it my problem is I'm a little

3235
02:10:24,539 --> 02:10:28,050
clumsy and I I'm gonna break that and

3236
02:10:27,090 --> 02:10:33,300
you got to keep that a little bit

3237
02:10:28,050 --> 02:10:35,670
cleaner with the tie you know you can

3238
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:38,880
get it real dirty and then just get it

3239
02:10:35,670 --> 02:10:40,500
hot and hit it with a little brushes for

3240
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:42,300
the grill even almost a little steel

3241
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:43,500
wool steel wool type things right and

3242
02:10:42,300 --> 02:10:46,020
get it fresh and clean but with a banger

3243
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:47,220
once it gets dirty it's a it's dirty and

3244
02:10:46,020 --> 02:10:49,470
if you want to keep it clean you got to

3245
02:10:47,220 --> 02:11:00,869
do the it's got a q-tip in it every time

3246
02:10:49,470 --> 02:11:02,430
for every use q-tip Texan so that's a

3247
02:11:00,869 --> 02:11:03,599
banger you guys basically a bangers made

3248
02:11:02,430 --> 02:11:05,579
out of course a lot of remain out of

3249
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:07,170
glass I don't see a problem with davon

3250
02:11:05,579 --> 02:11:08,729
Adam the glass piece but it's not gonna

3251
02:11:07,170 --> 02:11:10,109
taste as good it's not gonna last as

3252
02:11:08,729 --> 02:11:11,549
long it's gonna break after heating and

3253
02:11:10,109 --> 02:11:13,229
cooling so long the quartz is better

3254
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:16,980
quality if you can use anything quartz

3255
02:11:13,229 --> 02:11:18,599
art I definitely one of the two yeah the

3256
02:11:16,979 --> 02:11:20,009
Halen honey holes are great if you're

3257
02:11:18,600 --> 02:11:21,960
going for something made out of quartz

3258
02:11:20,010 --> 02:11:22,320
the Halen troughs are amazing those are

3259
02:11:21,960 --> 02:11:24,989
awesome

3260
02:11:22,319 --> 02:11:26,279
the quaff Boehner banger nah cops are

3261
02:11:24,989 --> 02:11:28,109
cool if you trust your artists news

3262
02:11:26,279 --> 02:11:30,569
vendor trust where your stuff is coming

3263
02:11:28,109 --> 02:11:32,639
from China that's where I was

3264
02:11:30,569 --> 02:11:34,679
no China glass it's made by little kids

3265
02:11:32,640 --> 02:11:37,470
that aren't using proper protection is

3266
02:11:34,680 --> 02:11:38,970
there a difference in the glass it's

3267
02:11:37,470 --> 02:11:40,500
really hard to tell but yeah there is a

3268
02:11:38,970 --> 02:11:42,659
definitely difference in there's quartz

3269
02:11:40,500 --> 02:11:43,949
qualities and the Chinese manufacturers

3270
02:11:42,659 --> 02:11:45,630
are definitely gonna be using much lower

3271
02:11:43,949 --> 02:11:47,279
quality cords as cheap as they can face

3272
02:11:45,630 --> 02:11:48,600
cheap as they can find because it's just

3273
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:52,369
some douche over here trying to make

3274
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:54,570
money just exploiting the market um and

3275
02:11:52,369 --> 02:11:56,250
you're definitely gonna find lower grade

3276
02:11:54,569 --> 02:11:58,319
Chinese made court is gonna be much

3277
02:11:56,250 --> 02:12:00,689
lower rate than american-made just like

3278
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:02,729
titanium exactly you sound like a bunch

3279
02:12:00,689 --> 02:12:04,439
of snobby douches when we talk about

3280
02:12:02,729 --> 02:12:05,618
getting a quality nail but that's your

3281
02:12:04,439 --> 02:12:08,379
health you're heating this

3282
02:12:05,618 --> 02:12:09,250
- I don't even know how many degrees I

3283
02:12:08,380 --> 02:12:10,539
don't have to burn the [ __ ] out of

3284
02:12:09,250 --> 02:12:12,069
yourself and you're putting your

3285
02:12:10,539 --> 02:12:13,599
medicine on there you're putting your

3286
02:12:12,069 --> 02:12:15,759
hatch on there and you're smoking

3287
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:17,770
directly into your lungs so whatever is

3288
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:19,449
in that you're you're gonna dab it if

3289
02:12:17,770 --> 02:12:21,429
it's something that puts off some sort

3290
02:12:19,448 --> 02:12:22,899
of gas or has an oil on it or some kind

3291
02:12:21,429 --> 02:12:25,300
of [ __ ] you're gonna dab that right

3292
02:12:22,899 --> 02:12:26,649
along with your Earl so get a quality

3293
02:12:25,300 --> 02:12:30,340
nail that's super important to me

3294
02:12:26,649 --> 02:12:32,920
definitely yeah some q-tip tank with

3295
02:12:30,340 --> 02:12:34,569
your banger and clean it out with a

3296
02:12:32,920 --> 02:12:36,639
q-tip right well you don't even heat it

3297
02:12:34,569 --> 02:12:38,049
the in theory is that if you get the

3298
02:12:36,639 --> 02:12:40,270
good you get a good temperature where

3299
02:12:38,050 --> 02:12:41,860
it's not too hot so you're done dab and

3300
02:12:40,270 --> 02:12:43,690
you get your good temperature you got to

3301
02:12:41,859 --> 02:12:45,158
do it pretty much immediately after you

3302
02:12:43,689 --> 02:12:46,388
grab a q-tip you wipe the inside there

3303
02:12:45,158 --> 02:12:48,250
should be like a little bit of not a

3304
02:12:46,389 --> 02:12:49,510
puddle but some wetness in there you get

3305
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:50,618
it quick enough it'll clean it out look

3306
02:12:49,510 --> 02:12:53,230
good as new you're good to go you don't

3307
02:12:50,618 --> 02:12:54,579
even got to heat it up like this now for

3308
02:12:53,229 --> 02:12:55,809
example I was trying to do it this is

3309
02:12:54,579 --> 02:12:59,889
the nails a couple weeks old now all

3310
02:12:55,810 --> 02:13:01,330
right you know it's still but on this

3311
02:12:59,889 --> 02:13:14,920
one you can see I have it in the q-tip

3312
02:13:01,329 --> 02:13:16,420
check - but that's not gonna that's also

3313
02:13:14,920 --> 02:13:18,069
gonna like burn it and heat like it

3314
02:13:16,420 --> 02:13:20,079
burns it a little bit so the q-tip tech

3315
02:13:18,069 --> 02:13:23,170
is definitely like the ideal I guess

3316
02:13:20,079 --> 02:13:25,149
it's just I saw you saying something on

3317
02:13:23,170 --> 02:13:28,569
Facebook about q-tip tech the q-tip

3318
02:13:25,149 --> 02:13:31,089
q-tip tech it's these new q-tip holders

3319
02:13:28,569 --> 02:13:33,759
as what I find hilarious $300 glass

3320
02:13:31,090 --> 02:13:35,590
holder in there's there's some janky

3321
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:37,690
ones you'll see going for like 150

3322
02:13:35,590 --> 02:13:39,130
dollars and it's literally it's

3323
02:13:37,689 --> 02:13:40,839
literally a shot glass for you people oh

3324
02:13:39,130 --> 02:13:42,819
it's a shot glass that a glass blower

3325
02:13:40,840 --> 02:13:44,139
made and put some color on and some of

3326
02:13:42,819 --> 02:13:46,479
these guys are putting absolutely no

3327
02:13:44,139 --> 02:13:47,980
time into it you can tell and they put

3328
02:13:46,479 --> 02:13:49,988
him up Rotch and they go for like 150

3329
02:13:47,979 --> 02:13:51,809
there was one I will say the one that

3330
02:13:49,988 --> 02:13:54,789
started the whole hype on it was a a

3331
02:13:51,810 --> 02:13:56,469
two-stroke and sleek collab that they

3332
02:13:54,789 --> 02:13:58,569
posted and I think they kind of posted

3333
02:13:56,469 --> 02:14:00,039
it as a joke originally and then they

3334
02:13:58,569 --> 02:14:01,599
and then they got a ton of hype behind

3335
02:14:00,039 --> 02:14:04,630
it and so they decided to auction it off

3336
02:14:01,599 --> 02:14:06,219
and they went for $2,200 holy SH and I'm

3337
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:08,739
not don't get me wrong I mean this [ __ ]

3338
02:14:06,219 --> 02:14:10,090
was amazing these two-stroke and sleek

3339
02:14:08,738 --> 02:14:11,709
are phenomenal glass artists and their

3340
02:14:10,090 --> 02:14:13,659
work goes I mean their work is expensive

3341
02:14:11,710 --> 02:14:15,279
but at the end of the day it was it was

3342
02:14:13,658 --> 02:14:16,759

documentary I believe Scott Debbie his

3502
02:20:20,680 --> 02:20:25,210
most expensive piece of time was $18,000

3503
02:20:23,020 --> 02:20:27,430
like that's that's a crazy amount of

3504
02:20:25,209 --> 02:20:29,469
money obviously for a piece but now

3505
02:20:27,430 --> 02:20:30,940
Scott Debbie is selling pieces for I

3506
02:20:29,469 --> 02:20:36,369
mean eighteen to twenty three thousand I

3507
02:20:30,940 --> 02:20:37,780
mean that's nothing out so what I wanted

3508
02:20:36,370 --> 02:20:39,460
to ask you what makes a market do that

3509
02:20:37,780 --> 02:20:41,350
kind of [ __ ] what makes an artist and

3510
02:20:39,459 --> 02:20:43,539
the market jump up and down and then

3511
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:46,030
like we said earlier elbow the guy that

3512
02:20:43,540 --> 02:20:47,770
makes a dyno rigs he shot up huge for a

3513
02:20:46,030 --> 02:20:50,079
little while and then one day everyone's

3514
02:20:47,770 --> 02:20:52,060
just selling their elbows on Instagram

3515
02:20:50,079 --> 02:20:53,530
for stupid chena what makes [ __ ] Gor

3516
02:20:52,059 --> 02:20:55,119
like that in the glass market well I

3517
02:20:53,530 --> 02:20:56,620
definitely think what happened what

3518
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:58,750
Instagram definitely helps I mean

3519
02:20:56,620 --> 02:21:01,270
Instagram is a huge part of like who's

3520
02:20:58,750 --> 02:21:04,840
doing you know what's who's what in the

3521
02:21:01,270 --> 02:21:05,950
glass world I guess if they've got you

3522
02:21:04,840 --> 02:21:06,969
know lots of followers on there people

3523
02:21:05,950 --> 02:21:09,790
are gonna think they're like oil

3524
02:21:06,969 --> 02:21:12,159
brothers for example Matt Bogle and he's

3525
02:21:09,790 --> 02:21:14,500
he's good he's really good but his first

3526
02:21:12,159 --> 02:21:16,209
rig that he put up for sale it was a

3527
02:21:14,500 --> 02:21:17,649
little coil pot of green mini rig and it

3528
02:21:16,209 --> 02:21:18,969
sold for like eight hundred dollars at

3529
02:21:17,649 --> 02:21:20,829
auction and it was like his first rig

3530
02:21:18,969 --> 02:21:23,619
that he ever sold just cuz yeah it was a

3531
02:21:20,829 --> 02:21:25,239
hype thing but I guess with the market

3532
02:21:23,620 --> 02:21:27,370
what happened was like everybody all of

3533
02:21:25,239 --> 02:21:29,170
a sudden started getting into it and it

3534
02:21:27,370 --> 02:21:30,760
built really fast like it went from

3535
02:21:29,170 --> 02:21:32,889
nothing to something like in a year

3536
02:21:30,760 --> 02:21:35,559
mothership prices worth quadrupling just

3537
02:21:32,889 --> 02:21:36,789
because I really don't know what it was

3538
02:21:35,559 --> 02:21:38,379
it just be kind of like it people

3539
02:21:36,790 --> 02:21:39,820
started finding out about it I guess it

3540
02:21:38,379 --> 02:21:41,920
wasn't all of a sudden an underground

3541
02:21:39,819 --> 02:21:43,149
thing that it was like you know people

3542
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:44,260
had instagrams they get to show their

3543
02:21:43,149 --> 02:21:46,809
stuffs people were buying more stuff

3544
02:21:44,260 --> 02:21:48,940
okay and then everyone when the market

3545
02:21:46,809 --> 02:21:50,199
peaked everyone was like oh man like it

3546
02:21:48,940 --> 02:21:51,489
kind of like a stock market almost is

3547
02:21:50,200 --> 02:21:53,380
like a stock market crash and you want

3548
02:21:51,489 --> 02:21:54,760
to think about it like that where you

3549
02:21:53,379 --> 02:21:56,979
know everyone's like I sell sell sell

3550
02:21:54,760 --> 02:21:58,510
buy buy buy right yeah and you know when

3551
02:21:56,979 --> 02:21:59,979
mothership is like now's the time to

3552
02:21:58,510 --> 02:22:01,569
sell the mother ships and so everybody

3553
02:21:59,979 --> 02:22:03,369
sells their ships or I guess elbow in

3554
02:22:01,569 --> 02:22:04,779
this example everybody had the Brawn

3555
02:22:03,370 --> 02:22:06,790
toes and they were like buying them for

3556
02:22:04,780 --> 02:22:08,170
I bought mine for $2000 for example I

3557
02:22:06,790 --> 02:22:12,280
bought it from illusions $2,000

3558
02:22:08,170 --> 02:22:15,700
brand-new sold it about six months later

3559
02:22:12,280 --> 02:22:17,110
for $1,700 and I struggled selling it

3560
02:22:15,700 --> 02:22:19,420
for that enos and yeah and it was

3561
02:22:17,110 --> 02:22:20,770
usually like before that had no problem

3562
02:22:19,420 --> 02:22:23,559
I definitely bought mine at the peak of

3563
02:22:20,770 --> 02:22:24,850
the the peak of the height yeah it was

3564
02:22:23,559 --> 02:22:26,171
like right when I came down for vacation

3565
02:22:24,850 --> 02:22:28,810
for the first time for a movie

3566
02:22:26,171 --> 02:22:30,880
yeah sweet love that thing yeah but uh

3567
02:22:28,810 --> 02:22:33,370
but I think definitely people they see

3568
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:34,810
what the rigs are going for retail wise

3569
02:22:33,370 --> 02:22:36,460
and so they're like okay that's retail

3570
02:22:34,810 --> 02:22:37,870
I'm gonna they put a high price on it

3571
02:22:36,460 --> 02:22:38,979
and he goes for a little bit more and

3572
02:22:37,870 --> 02:22:40,029
then eventually it's gonna build up to a

3573
02:22:38,979 --> 02:22:42,011
point and then people are gonna be like

3574
02:22:40,030 --> 02:22:43,601
[ __ ] that I'm not paying that anymore so

3575
02:22:42,011 --> 02:22:44,890
the price will start going down and then

3576
02:22:43,601 --> 02:22:46,961
all of a sudden everybody starts to sell

3577
02:22:44,890 --> 02:22:48,251
their rigs trying to oh [ __ ] I got rid

3578
02:22:46,960 --> 02:22:50,409
of this now while they're still still

3579
02:22:48,251 --> 02:22:52,601
worth something and then that and itself

3580
02:22:50,409 --> 02:22:55,300
decrease depreciates the value a little

3581
02:22:52,601 --> 02:22:56,739
bit yeah so full interesting it's funny

3582
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:58,870
to see the mothership hype I saw the

3583
02:22:56,739 --> 02:23:02,409

3584
02:22:58,870 --> 02:23:05,770
the same rate went from 12 to 18 to 24

3585
02:23:02,409 --> 02:23:07,091
to 28 to 32 and now they're about 18

3586
02:23:05,771 --> 02:23:09,311

3721
02:28:42,639 --> 02:28:46,448
doesn't want notoriety he just wants to

3722
02:28:44,318 --> 02:28:48,488
make glass and be a glass artist but uh

3723
02:28:46,449 --> 02:28:49,869
that dude tried to teach me how to blow

3724
02:28:48,488 --> 02:28:51,100
glass and it wasn't his fault that I

3725
02:28:49,869 --> 02:28:53,199
couldn't learn it was totally my fault

3726
02:28:51,100 --> 02:28:55,238
there I'm good at several things and

3727
02:28:53,199 --> 02:28:57,060
blowing glasses definitely not one of

3728
02:28:55,238 --> 02:28:59,251
them I got a fiberoptic

3729
02:28:57,060 --> 02:29:01,380
bird I burned my foot I don't know how I

3730
02:28:59,251 --> 02:29:05,659
burned my foot I don't know what burned

3731
02:29:01,380 --> 02:29:07,890

3732
02:29:05,659 --> 02:29:09,181
people that can shout at the e'en for

3733
02:29:07,890 --> 02:29:11,489
trying to teach me and shout out to the

3734
02:29:09,181 --> 02:29:15,721
raging glass crew that tried to tolerate

3735
02:29:11,489 --> 02:29:22,739
my dumb ass like two attempts to realize

3736
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:39,359
this is not for me and you gotta get in

3737
02:29:22,739 --> 02:29:40,560
that fire yep in itself is expensive too

3738
02:29:39,360 --> 02:29:41,671
that's a big thing that people a lot of

3739
02:29:40,560 --> 02:29:43,440
things I think a lot of people don't

3740
02:29:41,671 --> 02:29:45,810
think about is sometimes you can get

3741
02:29:43,440 --> 02:29:47,131
like a rod of slime like a just a couple

3742
02:29:45,810 --> 02:29:51,300
ounces of slime just a single little

3743
02:29:47,130 --> 02:29:53,010
collar rod can cost like 15 bucks yeah

3744
02:29:51,300 --> 02:29:54,270
yeah and then how many Rhino they

3745
02:29:53,011 --> 02:29:57,239
breaking they killed sometimes when you

3746
02:29:54,271 --> 02:29:59,041
make a how many what percentage of your

3747
02:29:57,239 --> 02:30:02,790
work will break in the kiln you know on

3748
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:05,189
a good day like I'll get like 20%

3749
02:30:02,790 --> 02:30:08,489
breakage but on an average day it's like

3750
02:30:05,190 --> 02:30:09,899
50% so just be like not just like in the

3751
02:30:08,489 --> 02:30:11,790
kiln but it'll like it'll break while

3752
02:30:09,899 --> 02:30:13,140
I'm making it or it'll a piece of it'll

3753
02:30:11,790 --> 02:30:15,600
break have to make a new piece like my

3754
02:30:13,140 --> 02:30:17,100
base will break cuz acute angles will

3755
02:30:15,601 --> 02:30:18,450
kill ya if you have an acute angle on

3756
02:30:17,101 --> 02:30:21,060
glass when it when it cools down it

3757
02:30:18,450 --> 02:30:22,740
cracks if the seals not perfect there's

3758
02:30:21,060 --> 02:30:25,050
air pockets there's just so many little

3759
02:30:22,739 --> 02:30:26,640
little things that go into it cools down

3760
02:30:25,050 --> 02:30:28,649
quicker than one piece if it's too thick

3761
02:30:26,640 --> 02:30:34,949
it's crazy those little details are the

3762
02:30:28,649 --> 02:30:36,270
things that the China glass exactly the

3763
02:30:34,950 --> 02:30:38,490
proper anneal cycles they don't use

3764
02:30:36,271 --> 02:30:39,511
proper seal so you could you know some

3765
02:30:38,489 --> 02:30:40,921
of their seals you could just push it

3766
02:30:39,511 --> 02:30:45,810
with your thumb and it'll fall off oh

3767

3868
02:37:59,640 --> 02:38:05,501

3924

the spot or than anything

3925
02:39:59,420 --> 02:40:05,209
shitty happened I've been at the spot

3926
02:40:01,908 --> 02:40:06,920
since the middle of July and we have

3927
02:40:05,209 --> 02:40:09,920
been building and getting things

3928
02:40:06,920 --> 02:40:11,478
finalized and there is no sign of having

3929
02:40:09,920 --> 02:40:15,379
plants in that building for at least

3930
02:40:11,478 --> 02:40:16,998
another month or two and I am not I'm

3931
02:40:15,379 --> 02:40:19,969
not a plumber I'm not a construction

3932
02:40:16,998 --> 02:40:21,680
worker I can do basic things but I've

3933
02:40:19,969 --> 02:40:23,840
been trying to find stuff to keep me

3934
02:40:21,680 --> 02:40:25,459
busy for 40 hours a week in the spot for

3935
02:40:23,840 --> 02:40:27,828
the past month and there's nothing to do

3936
02:40:25,459 --> 02:40:30,319
and without plants in there I've been

3937
02:40:27,828 --> 02:40:31,939
going crazy you guys the building is not

3938
02:40:30,318 --> 02:40:35,299
ready for plants they're not ready to

3939
02:40:31,939 --> 02:40:37,880
cultivate I was expected to be there and

3940
02:40:35,299 --> 02:40:39,379
perform so it was hard to be there every

3941
02:40:37,879 --> 02:40:41,839
day with nothing to do it was making me

3942
02:40:39,379 --> 02:40:43,398
super anxious I was making me bored I

3943
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:45,978
was spending way too much time on social

3944
02:40:43,398 --> 02:40:48,049
media because I was bored at the shop so

3945
02:40:45,978 --> 02:40:50,208
when my buddy hunt called and said hey

3946
02:40:48,049 --> 02:40:52,248
we need help here at Green and healthy

3947
02:40:50,209 --> 02:40:54,680
it felt like the right thing to do to

3948
02:40:52,248 --> 02:40:56,780
jump on and be part of the team

3949
02:40:54,680 --> 02:40:59,840
at the spot they run hydro it's a big

3950
02:40:56,780 --> 02:41:02,720
huge hydro setup I am NOT a hydro grower

3951
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:05,389
I am a soil farmer at the green and

3952
02:41:02,719 --> 02:41:09,260
healthy grow we're running three gallon

3953
02:41:05,389 --> 02:41:10,939
pots of soilless mix with plants already

3954
02:41:09,260 --> 02:41:13,340
in the building there are plants there

3955
02:41:10,940 --> 02:41:15,110
waiting for me so Friday I'm going to

3956
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:16,309
move plants to the flowering room and

3957
02:41:15,110 --> 02:41:17,960
I'm going to give them a little bit of

3958
02:41:16,309 --> 02:41:20,539
time to veg in the flower room in their

3959
02:41:17,959 --> 02:41:23,029
new home and about 10 to 14 days after

3960
02:41:20,540 --> 02:41:25,340
that I plan to flower the first crop for

3961
02:41:23,030 --> 02:41:27,110
green and healthy wellness so I'm

3962
02:41:25,340 --> 02:41:29,719
leaving a facility that will not have

3963
02:41:27,110 --> 02:41:31,100
plants until my first harvest at my new

3964
02:41:29,719 --> 02:41:33,529
facility is finished is what it feels

3965
02:41:31,100 --> 02:41:34,850
like and I'm in it to grow you guys

3966
02:41:33,530 --> 02:41:37,460
that's what I'm here for I want to grow

3967
02:41:34,850 --> 02:41:38,989
and produce quality cannabis so I had to

3968
02:41:37,459 --> 02:41:40,789
make a move I had to make a huge move

3969
02:41:38,989 --> 02:41:43,459
this is an hour drive to and from work

3970
02:41:40,790 --> 02:41:45,830
every single day but you know what it's

3971
02:41:43,459 --> 02:41:47,869
a soil garden with my homies there's a

3972
02:41:45,829 --> 02:41:50,389
grimy Gatsby and dude it's damsel and

3973
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:53,120
John Randall's junior so in my mind this

3974
02:41:50,389 --> 02:41:55,039
is the right decision sometimes you got

3975
02:41:53,120 --> 02:41:56,360
to just you got to make a move that's

3976
02:41:55,040 --> 02:41:57,620
scares you you got to make a move they

3977
02:41:56,360 --> 02:41:58,790
put you on the spot you got to make a

3978
02:41:57,620 --> 02:42:01,730
move that breaks you out of your routine

3979
02:41:58,790 --> 02:42:03,620
and I feel like my life has really been

3980
02:42:01,729 --> 02:42:06,459
routine for the past couple of years and

3981
02:42:03,620 --> 02:42:09,170
shaking myself up like this really puts

3982
02:42:06,459 --> 02:42:11,119
his lights a new fire under my ass so to

3983
02:42:09,170 --> 02:42:14,299
speak it puts fresh ideas in my head I

3984
02:42:11,120 --> 02:42:17,030
find new inspiration I meet new people I

3985
02:42:14,299 --> 02:42:19,779
go new places I really improves my life

3986
02:42:17,030 --> 02:42:21,829
overall when I put myself in a

3987
02:42:19,780 --> 02:42:23,989
uncomfortable position when I break out

3988
02:42:21,829 --> 02:42:25,909
of my comfort bubble and put myself in a

3989
02:42:23,989 --> 02:42:28,100
position where I'm not exactly sure how

3990
02:42:25,909 --> 02:42:30,619
this is gonna play out it always works

3991
02:42:28,100 --> 02:42:32,510
very well for myself so if you guys are

3992
02:42:30,620 --> 02:42:33,800
scared to do something if there's

3993
02:42:32,510 --> 02:42:35,120
something you're thinking about doing if

3994
02:42:33,799 --> 02:42:37,369
there's a big change in your life that

3995
02:42:35,120 --> 02:42:39,950
you're thinking about making all I can

3996
02:42:37,370 --> 02:42:42,800
say is grab your balls and do it just do

3997
02:42:39,950 --> 02:42:44,180
it don't be afraid success is scary but

3998
02:42:42,799 --> 02:42:46,069
once you succeed and you see what it's

3999
02:42:44,180 --> 02:42:47,870
like to succeed and not fall down from

4000
02:42:46,069 --> 02:42:49,279
that all you're gonna do is want to

4001
02:42:47,870 --> 02:42:50,960
succeed more and more and more your

4002
02:42:49,280 --> 02:42:52,700
goals are gonna get bigger your dreams

4003
02:42:50,959 --> 02:42:54,589
are gonna get bigger your abilities to

4004
02:42:52,700 --> 02:42:56,870
reach those dreams will get bigger right

4005
02:42:54,590 --> 02:42:58,880
alongside all of that so if you're

4006
02:42:56,870 --> 02:43:00,740
afraid of something don't be scared you

4007
02:42:58,879 --> 02:43:02,119
guys you can [ __ ] do it and what's

4008
02:43:00,739 --> 02:43:03,289
gonna happen you're gonna try and you're

4009
02:43:02,120 --> 02:43:03,811
either gonna succeed or you're gonna

4010
02:43:03,290 --> 02:43:05,490
fail

4011
02:43:03,810 --> 02:43:07,470
if you fail you're gonna be right where

4012
02:43:05,489 --> 02:43:09,030
you are you're not gonna go backwards by

4013
02:43:07,470 --> 02:43:10,859
failing because trying something is

4014
02:43:09,030 --> 02:43:12,150
going to give you skills you're gonna at

4015
02:43:10,860 --> 02:43:14,940
least be trying something you're gonna

4016
02:43:12,149 --> 02:43:16,920
feel better and if you succeed holy [ __ ]

4017
02:43:14,940 --> 02:43:18,480
you just succeeded it's something you

4018
02:43:16,920 --> 02:43:20,190
just open a new door to your life you

4019
02:43:18,479 --> 02:43:22,470
just have a new thing you could do or

4020
02:43:20,190 --> 02:43:23,819
somewhere else you can go and what is

4021
02:43:22,470 --> 02:43:25,680
that gonna do that's gonna be a building

4022
02:43:23,819 --> 02:43:28,261
block for the next places you can go and

4023
02:43:25,681 --> 02:43:29,761
the next things you can do so if you're

4024
02:43:28,261 --> 02:43:30,630
scared if you're stuck in your comfort

4025
02:43:29,761 --> 02:43:33,149
zone if you're stuck in your little

4026
02:43:30,629 --> 02:43:34,319
bubble you guys all I can say is snap

4027
02:43:33,149 --> 02:43:36,569
out of that and try to do some new

4028
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:38,129
things I have some faith in the world

4029
02:43:36,569 --> 02:43:39,840
have some faith in yourself have some

4030
02:43:38,129 --> 02:43:42,239
faith in life even if you're not a

4031
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:44,149
spiritual or a religious person you can

4032
02:43:42,239 --> 02:43:47,640
have some confidence you can have some

4033
02:43:44,149 --> 02:43:51,539
some I guess faith is what you need to

4034
02:43:47,640 --> 02:43:53,159
have and don't have fear of failing your

4035
02:43:51,540 --> 02:43:54,750
life if your life is good right now and

4036
02:43:53,159 --> 02:43:56,119
you try something and you fail you're

4037
02:43:54,750 --> 02:43:58,021
still gonna have the life you've got

4038
02:43:56,120 --> 02:43:59,280
nobody's gonna take it away from you

4039
02:43:58,021 --> 02:44:02,070
because you messed up trying something

4040
02:43:59,280 --> 02:44:03,420
new and anybody that does talk [ __ ] to

4041
02:44:02,069 --> 02:44:05,279
you and disrespects you because you

4042
02:44:03,420 --> 02:44:06,899
tried something new and you failed they

4043
02:44:05,280 --> 02:44:08,221

4044

your friends are gonna say man that

4046
02:44:09,750 --> 02:44:13,649

4047
02:44:11,670 --> 02:44:15,870
do and I'm proud of you just for getting

4048

of the people that are out there

4050
02:44:16,950 --> 02:44:20,070

asses to attempt what you just failed at

on Thursday we actually went up today

4123
02:50:23,729 --> 02:50:27,689

02:50:25,890 --> 02:50:29,550
stitcher is failing on picking it up

4125
02:50:27,690 --> 02:50:31,170
it's only got one second of the show

4126
02:50:29,550 --> 02:50:33,390
posted so I've emailed stitcher and let

4127
02:50:31,170 --> 02:50:34,500
them know that there's an issue usually

4128
02:50:33,390 --> 02:50:36,119
stitcher just goes

4129
02:50:34,500 --> 02:50:38,069

4159
02:51:35,159 --> 02:51:38,069
more thing I want to talk about before

4160
02:51:36,450 --> 02:51:41,730
we start getting down to the heart of

4161
02:51:38,069 --> 02:51:44,639
the show guys I got a screenshot of

4162
02:51:41,729 --> 02:51:47,250
something um so we put a lot of work

4163
02:51:44,639 --> 02:51:48,539
into this podcast I take time out of my

4164
02:51:47,250 --> 02:51:49,920
day to take time out of my life Mike

4165
02:51:48,540 --> 02:51:52,170
takes time away from his family to come

4166
02:51:49,920 --> 02:51:53,850
over here and record Mike works 40

4167
02:51:52,170 --> 02:51:55,379
something hours a week in the spot so

4168
02:51:53,850 --> 02:51:57,479
getting him to come over for an hour is

4169
02:51:55,379 --> 02:51:59,399
actually a little effort I got an email

4170
02:51:57,479 --> 02:52:01,350
that makes all of our time all of our

4171
02:51:59,399 --> 02:52:03,389
effort worthwhile these are the emails

4172
02:52:01,350 --> 02:52:05,520
that really make it worth putting in the

4173
02:52:03,389 --> 02:52:06,209
energy so this came from somebody will

4174
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:09,569
just call it Mike

4175
02:52:06,209 --> 02:52:11,309

02:52:12,690 --> 02:52:16,409
more shows with longer content like the

4179
02:52:14,909 --> 02:52:18,750
earlier episodes I would like to see a

4180
02:52:16,409 --> 02:52:21,690
pest management episode and more BHO

4181
02:52:18,750 --> 02:52:23,250

02:52:21,690 --> 02:52:24,989
hiatus from growing after cloning the

4187
02:52:31,229 --> 02:52:33,840

4188
02:52:32,760 --> 02:52:36,840

kushman and then he says yours is the

4191
02:52:38,579 --> 02:52:43,170
best by far great mix of knowledge humor

4192
02:52:40,680 --> 02:52:45,569
and irreverence in a very easy to listen

4193
02:52:43,170 --> 02:52:48,270

4198
02:52:56,879 --> 02:53:00,539

4212
02:53:24,478 --> 02:53:29,250

4220
02:53:37,770 --> 02:53:41,909
iTunes go to the iTunes Store search for

4221

review and type in a comment let me know

4224
02:53:45,719 --> 02:53:48,840

02:53:47,129 --> 02:53:50,549
really cool what that does is moves us

4226
02:53:48,840 --> 02:53:52,649
up in the ranks and iTunes and that

4227
02:53:50,549 --> 02:53:55,379
exposes us to more listeners and then

4228
02:53:52,649 --> 02:53:56,879
more listeners will grow better ganja

4229
02:53:55,379 --> 02:53:59,250
more people will help us liberate

4230

cannabis it's a good thing so give me a

4231
02:53:59,250 --> 02:54:06,600
little review let me know what you think

4232
02:54:00,270 --> 02:54:08,069
I would appreciate that all right so we

4233
02:54:06,600 --> 02:54:09,300
do have a real topic we want to talk

4234
02:54:08,069 --> 02:54:11,549
about here but I want to talk about one

4235
02:54:09,299 --> 02:54:14,279
more things it's since Mike is a little

4236
02:54:11,549 --> 02:54:17,489
familiar with this region of life I got

4237
02:54:14,280 --> 02:54:20,640
the privilege on Monday morning of going

4238
02:54:17,489 --> 02:54:27,899
to jury duty at 8:00 a.m. on a cold-ass

4239
02:54:20,639 --> 02:54:29,250
Monday cold right yeah you gonna be

4240
02:54:27,899 --> 02:54:31,590
there bright and early and it's [ __ ]

4241
02:54:29,250 --> 02:54:32,819
cold and it was so windy there's one of

4242
02:54:31,590 --> 02:54:36,228
the windiest days of the year that's

4243
02:54:32,819 --> 02:54:40,770
crazy you had a really nasty yeah

4244
02:54:36,228 --> 02:54:42,090
because the courtroom has skylight sort

4245
02:54:40,770 --> 02:54:44,550
of windows that are kind of tinted

4246
02:54:42,090 --> 02:54:47,280
behind the judge and they were changing

4247
02:54:44,549 --> 02:54:48,809
from black to baby blue to black navy

4248
02:54:47,280 --> 02:54:50,610
blue with the weather every like 10

4249
02:54:48,809 --> 02:54:53,279
minutes is like holy [ __ ] what's going

4250
02:54:50,610 --> 02:54:55,050
on outside and that was crazy so I had

4251
02:54:53,280 --> 02:54:56,850
jury duty and obviously I was not

4252
02:54:55,049 --> 02:54:58,359
selected I am never selected to be a

4253
02:54:56,850 --> 02:54:59,739
part of the jury I

4254
02:54:58,360 --> 02:55:02,560
down to when they start asking questions

4255
02:54:59,739 --> 02:55:05,379
and then like oh you can go home but uh

4256
02:55:02,560 --> 02:55:06,879
I went in there with a certain thing in

4257
02:55:05,379 --> 02:55:08,379
mind of what I was going to see and

4258
02:55:06,879 --> 02:55:10,510
experience and how I was gonna handle

4259
02:55:08,379 --> 02:55:13,420
[ __ ] and it was nothing like what I

4260
02:55:10,511 --> 02:55:16,601
expected no it's it's not at all like it

4261
02:55:13,420 --> 02:55:18,310
appears on television exactly and if the

4262
02:55:16,601 --> 02:55:19,931
chairs are just isn't comfortable as

4263
02:55:18,310 --> 02:55:21,520
they appear on television if not

4264
02:55:19,931 --> 02:55:25,780
significantly more so but other than

4265
02:55:21,521 --> 02:55:28,870
that very few similarities it was shitty

4266
02:55:25,780 --> 02:55:30,431
church pews it when you're in them it

4267
02:55:28,870 --> 02:55:32,530
feels like it was designed to punish

4268
02:55:30,431 --> 02:55:35,591
everyone that was selected significantly

4269
02:55:32,530 --> 02:55:37,870
yes so Wow the thing that stood out the

4270
02:55:35,591 --> 02:55:39,940
most to me I'm afraid of judges just

4271
02:55:37,870 --> 02:55:41,980
straight up a judge can say you are

4272
02:55:39,940 --> 02:55:43,750
going to jail and you get to do some

4273
02:55:41,979 --> 02:55:45,310
time in jail you get to go get butt

4274
02:55:43,750 --> 02:55:47,681
poked for a little bit and there's

4275
02:55:45,310 --> 02:55:50,591
nothing you can do about it if the judge

4276
02:55:47,681 --> 02:55:53,620
that resided over that courtroom was

4277
02:55:50,591 --> 02:55:55,681
cool as [ __ ] like I don't know the judge

4278
02:55:53,620 --> 02:55:58,570
personally but he presented himself

4279
02:55:55,681 --> 02:55:59,980
fairly I didn't feel like he was passing

4280
02:55:58,569 --> 02:56:02,920
judgment on anybody by the way they

4281
02:55:59,979 --> 02:56:05,170
looked he treated the guys in suits and

4282
02:56:02,920 --> 02:56:06,879
the lady in her sweat pants exactly the

4283
02:56:05,170 --> 02:56:09,489
same he was kind everybody who was

4284
02:56:06,879 --> 02:56:10,510
respectful and he was a human about

4285
02:56:09,489 --> 02:56:12,610
things I figured it was gonna be

4286
02:56:10,511 --> 02:56:14,200
rigorous in like the time everything

4287
02:56:12,610 --> 02:56:15,730
would be on a certain time schedule and

4288
02:56:14,200 --> 02:56:16,780
stuff and he went for a little bit of

4289
02:56:15,729 --> 02:56:18,069
time and he goes does anybody need to

4290
02:56:16,780 --> 02:56:20,320
use a restroom or anything can we wait

4291
02:56:18,069 --> 02:56:22,360
another 15 minutes and everyone's like I

4292
02:56:20,319 --> 02:56:23,261
can wait 15 okay we'll go in 15 minutes

4293
02:56:22,360 --> 02:56:25,000
you guys don't worry and he looked up

4294
02:56:23,261 --> 02:56:25,989
the clock oh sorry it's been about 20

4295
02:56:25,000 --> 02:56:28,181
minutes you guys let's go use the

4296
02:56:25,989 --> 02:56:30,431
restroom we'll take 15 and like he was

4297
02:56:28,181 --> 02:56:33,341
actually pretty cool so you know they're

4298
02:56:30,431 --> 02:56:36,450
at this point for the most part it runs

4299
02:56:33,341 --> 02:56:39,880
like it should like it's much more

4300
02:56:36,450 --> 02:56:42,280
functional in I don't know human that a

4301
02:56:39,879 --> 02:56:44,229
lot of people assume I know judges like

4302
02:56:42,280 --> 02:56:46,540
I've met many of them right there people

4303
02:56:44,229 --> 02:56:48,100
too that's what I said Mike's a little

4304
02:56:46,540 --> 02:56:50,620
more in that realm Mike has experience

4305
02:56:48,101 --> 02:56:52,540
in that side of life and I I'm the

4306
02:56:50,620 --> 02:56:57,670
dreadlock I've got dreadlocks to my ass

4307
02:56:52,540 --> 02:56:59,530
I got red eyes most of the time I try to

4308
02:56:57,670 --> 02:57:01,030
avoid those types of folks but you know

4309
02:56:59,530 --> 02:57:02,530
now that things are changing I'm gonna

4310
02:57:01,030 --> 02:57:04,750
have to mingle and rub some elbows with

4311
02:57:02,530 --> 02:57:06,880
those types of people the judge was very

4312
02:57:04,750 --> 02:57:09,550
fair I did not feel intimidated I didn't

4313
02:57:06,879 --> 02:57:11,500
feel afraid it was really cool it may

4314
02:57:09,550 --> 02:57:13,569
have given me

4315
02:57:11,500 --> 02:57:15,760
touch of faith in our system maybe a

4316
02:57:13,569 --> 02:57:18,399
touch more it's nice to know that

4317
02:57:15,760 --> 02:57:21,100
there's at least humans involved like we

4318
02:57:18,399 --> 02:57:23,199
seen it from just the juror selection

4319
02:57:21,100 --> 02:57:25,870
part she didn't kick us out they didn't

4320
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:27,430
kick out the rejected jurors until all

4321
02:57:25,870 --> 02:57:29,079
of the jurors had been chosen so that

4322
02:57:27,430 --> 02:57:31,450
they knew that there were enough in the

4323
02:57:29,079 --> 02:57:32,950
pool and I got to watch the selection

4324
02:57:31,450 --> 02:57:34,750
process and I got to watch all of the

4325
02:57:32,950 --> 02:57:37,750
jurors be interviewed and then at the

4326
02:57:34,750 --> 02:57:39,579
end of that the two lawyers the

4327
02:57:37,750 --> 02:57:41,709
prosecutor and prosecution and the

4328
02:57:39,579 --> 02:57:43,389
defense passed back and forth a piece of

4329
02:57:41,709 --> 02:57:45,789
paper and they agree on which people are

4330
02:57:43,389 --> 02:57:47,199
gonna be the jurors and I was laughing I

4331
02:57:45,790 --> 02:57:49,060
was like it's like fantasy football for

4332
02:57:47,200 --> 02:57:50,770
the Warriors or something and they're

4333
02:57:49,059 --> 02:57:52,719
like I'll trade you the angry white guy

4334
02:57:50,770 --> 02:57:56,710
for the passive white lady and like I

4335
02:57:52,719 --> 02:57:58,840
could just see a negotiating guy like

4336
02:57:56,709 --> 02:58:00,039
he's too angry he's too mad he wants

4337
02:57:58,840 --> 02:58:02,920
this guy to go to jail before he's even

4338
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:05,950
heard the case the last two times I went

4339
02:58:02,920 --> 02:58:07,450
the first time I got let go before any

4340
02:58:05,950 --> 02:58:09,340
of that started even I never even made

4341
02:58:07,450 --> 02:58:11,380
it to the courtroom they called it all

4342
02:58:09,340 --> 02:58:14,829
but like 20 of us and like the rest you

4343
02:58:11,379 --> 02:58:16,149
know like just no ceremony buddy we

4344
02:58:14,829 --> 02:58:17,739
didn't have to sign out or nothing they

4345
02:58:16,149 --> 02:58:19,479
don't care the first time I went that's

4346
02:58:17,739 --> 02:58:21,250
what happened there was a case that we

4347
02:58:19,479 --> 02:58:23,170
were gonna see that day and the lady

4348
02:58:21,250 --> 02:58:24,700
that was supposed to be in that case

4349
02:58:23,170 --> 02:58:26,500
committed another crime and it been

4350
02:58:24,700 --> 02:58:28,510
re-arrested was going to jail and was

4351
02:58:26,500 --> 02:58:30,430
gonna be retried for all of her [ __ ] so

4352
02:58:28,510 --> 02:58:32,770
she got me at a jury duty that day but

4353
02:58:30,430 --> 02:58:36,700
she [ __ ] up her life no the last time

4354
02:58:32,770 --> 02:58:39,819
they they got down to like 30 people

4355
02:58:36,700 --> 02:58:42,430
that they liked and they just waved that

4356
02:58:39,819 --> 02:58:43,719
the rest of us when I go home and so we

4357
02:58:42,430 --> 02:58:45,880

4376
02:59:19,000 --> 02:59:22,180
have been kind of fun it would have been

4377
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:23,479
a very learning experience for myself

4378
02:59:22,180 --> 02:59:26,420
yeah

4379
02:59:23,478 --> 02:59:27,889
I hate to imagine it but now if I'm ever

4380

4381

4384
02:59:33,049 --> 02:59:35,599
while he's sitting here in friend me

4385
02:59:34,159 --> 02:59:37,219
we'll get a commitment out of you guys I

4386
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:38,630
want you to come to an episode with me

4387
02:59:37,219 --> 02:59:39,920
about how to deal with you how to

4388
02:59:38,629 --> 02:59:42,529
conduct yourself with a law enforcement

4389
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:43,670
oh sure whether you're being pulled over

4390
02:59:42,530 --> 02:59:44,989
whether they're coming to your home

4391
02:59:43,670 --> 02:59:47,659
whether you're in public whether you're

4392
02:59:44,989 --> 02:59:49,909
at a smoking event I'd like to get you

4393
02:59:47,659 --> 02:59:51,079
and we'll get somebody else on the show

4394
02:59:49,909 --> 02:59:53,629
- I have a good idea of who we're gonna

4395
02:59:51,079 --> 02:59:58,370
get on the show I think really it's

4396
02:59:53,629 --> 02:59:59,750
sloppy and you that'll make for a really

4397
02:59:58,370 --> 03:00:01,250
interesting show that's for sure yes

4398
02:59:59,750 --> 03:00:04,370
sloppy you're invited we have such

4399
03:00:01,250 --> 03:00:07,939
different exactly experiences with law

4400
03:00:04,370 --> 03:00:10,040
enforcement you guys on the show and we

4401
03:00:07,939 --> 03:00:10,670
can talk about how to deal we'll talk

4402
03:00:10,040 --> 03:00:13,250
about how to deal with law enforcement

4403
03:00:10,670 --> 03:00:14,569
and not get your ass thrown in jail all

4404
03:00:13,250 --> 03:00:16,189
right guys so I must have blown a couple

4405
03:00:14,569 --> 03:00:17,478
of dabs into the computer because as I

4406
03:00:16,189 --> 03:00:19,159
was saying that part about the judge you

4407
03:00:17,478 --> 03:00:21,228
totally just clicked recording here here

4408
03:00:19,159 --> 03:00:22,850
we got to a computer is to dab doubt

4409
03:00:21,228 --> 03:00:24,199
something went wrong that means that

4410
03:00:22,850 --> 03:00:27,890
we're gonna have to start running an

4411
03:00:24,200 --> 03:00:31,280
auxilary output from the the USB down

4412
03:00:27,889 --> 03:00:32,809
here or the mixer into the h6 and do or

4413
03:00:31,280 --> 03:00:34,159
record this [ __ ] in case that happens

4414
03:00:32,809 --> 03:00:36,559
again and then I can just keep recording

4415
03:00:34,159 --> 03:00:38,809
the h6 would have kept going nice yeah

4416
03:00:36,559 --> 03:00:40,819
or we'll go get a little Roland handheld

4417
03:00:38,809 --> 03:00:42,949
recorder and use the headphone out on

4418
03:00:40,819 --> 03:00:44,420
the mixer and then just run that into

4419
03:00:42,950 --> 03:00:46,070
the handheld recorder and that just

4420
03:00:44,420 --> 03:00:47,870
records onto an SD card so there's no

4421
03:00:46,069 --> 03:00:49,309
failure the age six would work

4422
03:00:47,870 --> 03:00:50,780
the handheld would work we'll do

4423
03:00:49,309 --> 03:00:54,019
something like that as a back-up plan or

4424
03:00:50,780 --> 03:00:55,520
we can just take a DAB when it fails and

4425
03:00:54,020 --> 03:00:56,840
come back a couple of minutes later and

4426
03:00:55,520 --> 03:01:01,069
explain that we just had a major

4427
03:00:56,840 --> 03:01:02,630
technical failure here yeah it's the

4428
03:01:01,069 --> 03:01:03,978
cheapest y'all were wondering like what

4429
03:01:02,629 --> 03:01:05,920
kind of equipment we're doing the show

4430
03:01:03,978 --> 03:01:09,289
is just got a pile of equipment that's

4431
03:01:05,920 --> 03:01:11,149
larger than your car well this is the

4432
03:01:09,290 --> 03:01:12,229
home setup this is where this is that

4433
03:01:11,149 --> 03:01:15,170
you can get the voice like there is a

4434
03:01:12,228 --> 03:01:17,688
cast that's what that's was for all this

4435
03:01:15,170 --> 03:01:19,790
home based versions pretty elaborate

4436
03:01:17,689 --> 03:01:22,610
yeah yeah yeah the to go version is the

4437
03:01:19,790 --> 03:01:24,770
size of a big cell phone basically yeah

4438
03:01:22,610 --> 03:01:26,630
when you record Morris's cell phone

4439
03:01:24,770 --> 03:01:27,829
maybe yeah Zack Morris is older cell

4440
03:01:26,629 --> 03:01:30,379
phone that's the truth we just went

4441
03:01:27,829 --> 03:01:32,510
[ __ ] Saved by the Bell on this [ __ ]

4442
03:01:30,379 --> 03:01:34,729
all right you guys the program crashed

4443
03:01:32,510 --> 03:01:36,710
we had to restart it I just

4444
03:01:34,729 --> 03:01:38,000
didn't had to restart that's the truth

4445
03:01:36,710 --> 03:01:39,680
that is the truth I just give it a

4446
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:41,060
shout-out to the judge that resided over

4447
03:01:39,681 --> 03:01:42,860
that courtroom I felt that it was fair I

4448
03:01:41,060 --> 03:01:44,630
liked the way he treated people I don't

4449
03:01:42,860 --> 03:01:46,221

4450
03:01:44,630 --> 03:01:47,930
went to jury duty you guys it wasn't

4451
03:01:46,220 --> 03:01:49,729
that bad the judge was cool it was fair

4452
03:01:47,931 --> 03:01:57,110

4478
03:03:09,771 --> 03:03:12,771
down to the point of the show you guys

4479
03:03:11,329 --> 03:03:13,909
we've been going for 15 minutes and all

4480
03:03:12,771 --> 03:03:17,120
we've done is talk a bunch of nonsense

4481
03:03:13,909 --> 03:03:18,890
um we've been covering this a little bit

4482
03:03:17,120 --> 03:03:20,570
lately I've got three news articles I'm

4483
03:03:18,890 --> 03:03:21,829
going to read the headline too and then

4484
03:03:20,569 --> 03:03:23,360
we're gonna skip all of that and then

4485
03:03:21,829 --> 03:03:25,220
we're gonna go to the main article that

4486
03:03:23,360 --> 03:03:27,620
I want to talk about but this is kind of

4487
03:03:25,220 --> 03:03:28,970
a little bit of a build-up on the on the

4488
03:03:27,620 --> 03:03:30,410
website called the cannabis twitch is

4489
03:03:28,970 --> 03:03:32,000
where I find a lot of my news big shout

4490
03:03:30,409 --> 03:03:33,591
out to David Liguria and Ricardo Baca

4491
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:36,560
for supplying the world with up-to-date

4492
03:03:33,591 --> 03:03:38,211
cannabis news from Colorado I found an

4493
03:03:36,560 --> 03:03:40,970
article this one was written on November

4494
03:03:38,210 --> 03:03:43,039
13th and it says pesticide edict ensures

4495
03:03:40,970 --> 03:03:45,591
fate of recalled Binford pot products

4496
03:03:43,040 --> 03:03:46,830
the byline is nearly 30,000 marijuana

4497
03:03:45,591 --> 03:03:48,690
infused products

4498
03:03:46,829 --> 03:03:51,209
over pesticide concerns will likely be

4499
03:03:48,690 --> 03:03:53,970
destroyed after Hickenlooper says their

4500
03:03:51,209 --> 03:03:55,979
public safety risk here's another

4501
03:03:53,969 --> 03:03:57,899
article just the headline you guys is

4502
03:03:55,979 --> 03:03:59,039
all I'm gonna read this one once again

4503
03:03:57,899 --> 03:04:01,920
was in the cannabis that says

4504
03:03:59,040 --> 03:04:04,561
denver-based lab 710 recalls pot

4505
03:04:01,920 --> 03:04:07,200
products over pesticides and then the

4506
03:04:04,560 --> 03:04:09,600
byline is in the state's 8th pot recall

4507
03:04:07,200 --> 03:04:11,790
in 10 months lab 710 concentrates calls

4508
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:13,739
back two thousand three hundred and

4509
03:04:11,790 --> 03:04:16,410
sixty two packages of marijuana

4510
03:04:13,739 --> 03:04:17,969
concentrates and then here is the third

4511
03:04:16,409 --> 03:04:19,799
one that I want to read the headline -

4512
03:04:17,969 --> 03:04:21,810
it says denver issues this one was

4513
03:04:19,799 --> 03:04:23,310
written on November 18th once again by

4514
03:04:21,810 --> 03:04:25,860
ricardo Baca and David McCoy of the

4515
03:04:23,310 --> 03:04:28,680
cannabis it says denver issues 9th pot

4516
03:04:25,860 --> 03:04:30,840
product recall in ten weeks and the

4517
03:04:28,680 --> 03:04:33,479
byline is edibles company guys garden

4518
03:04:30,840 --> 03:04:35,819
issues its second voluntary recall in as

4519
03:04:33,479 --> 03:04:39,119
many weeks after banned pesticides are

4520
03:04:35,819 --> 03:04:40,319
detected in products because this is an

4521
03:04:39,120 --> 03:04:43,021
upsetting trend we've been seeing here

4522
03:04:40,319 --> 03:04:49,920
in Colorado in the commercial growing

4523
03:04:43,021 --> 03:04:52,500
industry okay use its I'd I really hate

4524
03:04:49,920 --> 03:04:55,829
that we're finding pesticides and final

4525
03:04:52,500 --> 03:04:57,600
product but I'm so thrilled that we're

4526
03:04:55,829 --> 03:05:00,600
finding pesticides and final product

4527
03:04:57,600 --> 03:05:03,659
like it's this weird duality yes this is

4528
03:05:00,600 --> 03:05:05,130
regulation working this is when you you

4529
03:05:03,659 --> 03:05:07,619
go to the store and you buy a product

4530
03:05:05,129 --> 03:05:10,619
you know there's not pesticides in it

4531
03:05:07,620 --> 03:05:12,510
and now the cannabis is legal were a

4532
03:05:10,620 --> 03:05:14,311
year or so from having all of that

4533
03:05:12,510 --> 03:05:16,021
testing in place so that you know

4534
03:05:14,310 --> 03:05:18,409
there's no buck [ __ ] there's no

4535
03:05:16,021 --> 03:05:20,460
pesticide there's no mold or mildew

4536
03:05:18,409 --> 03:05:22,021
you're just getting delicious

4537
03:05:20,459 --> 03:05:24,089
concentrates so it sucks that they're

4538
03:05:22,021 --> 03:05:25,890
finding it but it's awesome that they're

4539
03:05:24,090 --> 03:05:28,229
finding it right because now we can stop

4540
03:05:25,889 --> 03:05:30,180
it we can start teaching the growers and

4541
03:05:28,229 --> 03:05:33,959
the grow facilities have to stop using

4542
03:05:30,180 --> 03:05:35,130
these products I much in the future I

4543
03:05:33,959 --> 03:05:36,779
predict that the Department of

4544
03:05:35,129 --> 03:05:38,789
Agriculture is going to create a

4545
03:05:36,780 --> 03:05:39,960
pesticide class for the cannabis

4546
03:05:38,790 --> 03:05:41,610
industry they're gonna have to do it

4547
03:05:39,959 --> 03:05:43,109
it's gonna have to happen they're going

4548
03:05:41,610 --> 03:05:44,310
to have to make their own regulations

4549
03:05:43,110 --> 03:05:45,930
because that's who's doing this they're

4550
03:05:44,310 --> 03:05:49,229
gonna have to tell us what we can do

4551
03:05:45,930 --> 03:05:51,630
they kind of are now all that stuff from

4552
03:05:49,229 --> 03:05:53,250
the ground up like it exists in every

4553
03:05:51,629 --> 03:05:55,500
other industry but we're not allowed to

4554
03:05:53,250 --> 03:05:56,129
access any of the components that do

4555
03:05:55,500 --> 03:05:59,520
this

4556
03:05:56,129 --> 03:06:01,500
cantaloupe Roberta backhoe or right beer

4557
03:05:59,520 --> 03:06:03,120
because cannabis is federally illegal so

4558
03:06:01,500 --> 03:06:04,950
we're not allowed to federally test so

4559
03:06:03,120 --> 03:06:07,890
we can't find all the labs that are

4560
03:06:04,950 --> 03:06:10,050
doing the testing were created by the

4561
03:06:07,889 --> 03:06:12,719
demand the medical industry created here

4562
03:06:10,049 --> 03:06:14,609
like all of the labs that are up and

4563
03:06:12,719 --> 03:06:16,319
running around the state came from the

4564
03:06:14,610 --> 03:06:18,600
Medical Marijuana days and they weren't

4565
03:06:16,319 --> 03:06:21,239
state mandated the industry demanded

4566
03:06:18,600 --> 03:06:23,370
them it created them on their own and

4567
03:06:21,239 --> 03:06:25,439
when they deal with testing labs want to

4568
03:06:23,370 --> 03:06:27,810
apply for DEA licensing like they should

4569
03:06:25,439 --> 03:06:30,930
they all got raided so they stopped

4570
03:06:27,809 --> 03:06:33,000
applying for DEA licensing and just ran

4571
03:06:30,930 --> 03:06:35,100
a testing lab anyway with just without

4572
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:37,469
that federal certification meaning that

4573
03:06:35,100 --> 03:06:38,970
they can't do like organics testing or

4574
03:06:37,469 --> 03:06:40,889
certifying or anything like that because

4575
03:06:38,969 --> 03:06:42,959
that's all federal right shun at this

4576
03:06:40,889 --> 03:06:45,809
detail Halen labs actually I don't think

4577
03:06:42,959 --> 03:06:47,879
organic testing is actually federal I've

4578
03:06:45,809 --> 03:06:50,398
been regulations for using that word are

4579
03:06:47,879 --> 03:06:52,109
okay that makes sense recently if you're

4580
03:06:50,398 --> 03:07:00,869
a legal marijuana business and you had

4581
03:06:52,110 --> 03:07:03,239
organics all right so let's talk about

4582
03:07:00,870 --> 03:07:04,620
this article a little bit you guys it

4583
03:07:03,239 --> 03:07:06,449
seems to be a trend in Colorado that a

4584
03:07:04,620 --> 03:07:08,570
lot of the commercial growers are using

4585
03:07:06,450 --> 03:07:11,040
pesticides that have been banned and

4586
03:07:08,569 --> 03:07:12,600
that sounds ridiculous but oftentimes

4587
03:07:11,040 --> 03:07:14,939
these products were sprayed on the

4588
03:07:12,600 --> 03:07:17,340
plants seventy days ago and these rules

4589
03:07:14,939 --> 03:07:19,170
came into effect twenty days ago so you

4590
03:07:17,340 --> 03:07:20,610
can't retroactively lis unsprayed your

4591
03:07:19,170 --> 03:07:23,010
plants you can't go back and that's

4592
03:07:20,610 --> 03:07:25,050
basically what we're seeing plants that

4593
03:07:23,010 --> 03:07:27,389
were harvested six months ago and turned

4594
03:07:25,049 --> 03:07:28,949
into other Earth's sold off and turned

4595
03:07:27,389 --> 03:07:31,170
into other products like edibles and

4596
03:07:28,950 --> 03:07:32,970
concentrates you know I didn't in two

4597
03:07:31,170 --> 03:07:35,850
months ago I didn't account for the time

4598
03:07:32,969 --> 03:07:37,500
from so you've got to grow these plant

4599
03:07:35,850 --> 03:07:39,720
they got a veg they've got to flower

4600
03:07:37,500 --> 03:07:41,549
you're looking at 90 to 120 days there

4601
03:07:39,719 --> 03:07:43,170
it's got to be harvested they've got to

4602
03:07:41,549 --> 03:07:44,879
be trimmed and dried and cured you're

4603
03:07:43,170 --> 03:07:46,920
looking at another two weeks there isn't

4604
03:07:44,879 --> 03:07:48,599
your 140 days ish

4605
03:07:46,920 --> 03:07:50,670
somewhere between 120 and a hundred and

4606
03:07:48,600 --> 03:07:53,520
fifty days by now right that's engineer

4607
03:07:50,670 --> 03:07:56,819
math right and then the product has to

4608
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:58,170
be picked up by the infusion company the

4609
03:07:56,819 --> 03:08:00,389
MIPS whoever's gonna turn it into

4610
03:07:58,170 --> 03:08:02,040
something the processing facility I mean

4611
03:08:00,389 --> 03:08:03,689
then you've got drying and caring too so

4612
03:08:02,040 --> 03:08:05,490
that's what that's what got us to about

4613
03:08:03,689 --> 03:08:08,850
a hundred and fifty yeah we're still

4614
03:08:05,489 --> 03:08:09,399
rolling on almost 200 days for under 200

4615
03:08:08,850 --> 03:08:12,881
days to

4616
03:08:09,399 --> 03:08:16,270
50 yeah before it's even processed okay

4617
03:08:12,880 --> 03:08:18,699
but I mean it wasn't standard practice

4618
03:08:16,271 --> 03:08:21,881
for the company buying the product to

4619
03:08:18,700 --> 03:08:23,561
lab test it again right and that's one

4620
03:08:21,880 --> 03:08:25,840
of the things that these recalls are

4621
03:08:23,560 --> 03:08:28,300
starting to create is the first company

4622
03:08:25,841 --> 03:08:30,521
to really fail that was the first big

4623
03:08:28,300 --> 03:08:32,020
policy change they announced was we're

4624
03:08:30,521 --> 03:08:33,250
gonna test everything that comes in now

4625
03:08:32,021 --> 03:08:37,931
because that's how this happened

4626
03:08:33,250 --> 03:08:41,110
yeah they process really nasty stuff and

4627
03:08:37,931 --> 03:08:43,890
we probably dab some of it it could

4628
03:08:41,110 --> 03:08:46,360
happen and you guys a lot of people did

4629
03:08:43,890 --> 03:08:47,949
none of these recalls have been issued

4630
03:08:46,360 --> 03:08:50,261
because people got sick or anything like

4631
03:08:47,950 --> 03:08:52,360
that it's right industry-wide they're

4632
03:08:50,261 --> 03:08:54,069
all voluntary when they're going through

4633
03:08:52,360 --> 03:08:55,780
and doing lab testing when one of their

4634
03:08:54,069 --> 03:08:57,550
products fails they just do a massive

4635
03:08:55,780 --> 03:08:59,021
recall on anything with that serial

4636
03:08:57,550 --> 03:09:00,310
number which is admirable because that's

4637
03:08:59,021 --> 03:09:00,670
a lot of money that these guys are

4638
03:09:00,310 --> 03:09:03,190
losing

4639
03:09:00,670 --> 03:09:05,380
that's tons of money tons of money I

4640
03:09:03,190 --> 03:09:07,511
just measured money and weight tons of

4641
03:09:05,380 --> 03:09:10,000
money yes dollar amounts and weight so

4642
03:09:07,511 --> 03:09:12,159
these plants could have been sprayed 200

4643
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:14,649
days ago and the rules just were put

4644
03:09:12,159 --> 03:09:16,780
into effect whenever 30 days ago 45 days

4645
03:09:14,649 --> 03:09:18,310
ago and so it's not like people are

4646
03:09:16,780 --> 03:09:20,320
[ __ ] up on purpose it's not like it's

4647
03:09:18,310 --> 03:09:22,511
ignorance it's just it's just timing of

4648
03:09:20,319 --> 03:09:25,270
laws in a lot of the places something

4649
03:09:22,511 --> 03:09:26,950
that I want to mention is all that weed

4650
03:09:25,271 --> 03:09:29,110
used to smoke back in the day before we

4651
03:09:26,950 --> 03:09:30,909
had dispensaries it was being sprayed

4652
03:09:29,110 --> 03:09:32,200
with some [ __ ] there was something at

4653
03:09:30,909 --> 03:09:34,271
worse than what's happening in these

4654
03:09:32,200 --> 03:09:36,610
dispensaries on your wheat you've smoked

4655
03:09:34,271 --> 03:09:39,011
it before it's quality control is one of

4656
03:09:36,610 --> 03:09:41,051
the first things legal marijuana created

4657
03:09:39,011 --> 03:09:42,970
as a side industry and it's been a

4658
03:09:41,050 --> 03:09:45,819
beautiful thing you know I saw quality

4659
03:09:42,970 --> 03:09:49,511
go when medical came real popular around

4660
03:09:45,819 --> 03:09:51,579
2010 quality skyrocketed yep there was a

4661
03:09:49,511 --> 03:09:55,810
huge competition for quality buds and

4662
03:09:51,579 --> 03:09:57,341
then around 2013 2014 the quality

4663
03:09:55,810 --> 03:09:59,229
started going away and the quantity

4664
03:09:57,341 --> 03:09:59,649
started popping up everything looks the

4665
03:09:59,229 --> 03:10:02,229
same

4666
03:09:59,649 --> 03:10:05,199
everything looks real similar I'm gonna

4667
03:10:02,229 --> 03:10:06,341
try to uh to make that different in a

4668
03:10:05,200 --> 03:10:08,409
green and healthy wellness we've got

4669
03:10:06,341 --> 03:10:09,909
some fun we got we got fire genetics and

4670
03:10:08,409 --> 03:10:11,530
I know how to grow so I'm gonna try to

4671
03:10:09,909 --> 03:10:13,149
bring that quality back to the Shelf

4672
03:10:11,530 --> 03:10:15,190
clean and healthy wellness can't wait

4673
03:10:13,149 --> 03:10:16,479
yeah I keep looking back at the

4674
03:10:15,190 --> 03:10:18,040
recording software to make sure we're

4675
03:10:16,479 --> 03:10:19,180
getting what we're saying because we

4676
03:10:18,040 --> 03:10:20,710
can't afford to try to do this all over

4677
03:10:19,181 --> 03:10:22,329
again that was weird right

4678
03:10:20,709 --> 03:10:23,169
alright so we're talking a lot about

4679
03:10:22,329 --> 03:10:25,450
these tainted

4680
03:10:23,170 --> 03:10:27,219
this brings me to an email or an email a

4681
03:10:25,450 --> 03:10:30,159
news article I wish there was an email

4682
03:10:27,219 --> 03:10:31,779
that would have been great this one Mike

4683
03:10:30,159 --> 03:10:33,459
sent this to me from the Denver Post

4684
03:10:31,780 --> 03:10:35,890
right on Mike for finding us the good

4685
03:10:33,459 --> 03:10:38,169
news the headline is Hickenlooper issues

4686
03:10:35,889 --> 03:10:40,779
executive order to declare tainted pot a

4687
03:10:38,170 --> 03:10:42,189
threat to the public the byline is any

4688
03:10:40,780 --> 03:10:43,840
marijuana grown with unapproved

4689
03:10:42,189 --> 03:10:46,989
pesticides would be removed from

4690
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:48,760
commerce and destroyed once again the

4691
03:10:46,989 --> 03:10:50,978
articles from David McCoy and Ricardo

4692
03:10:48,760 --> 03:10:52,450
Baca and it goes a little bit like this

4693
03:10:50,978 --> 03:10:53,709
I need to take a drink cuz I have dried

4694
03:10:52,450 --> 03:10:56,950
up then I'll read you the article Mike

4695
03:10:53,709 --> 03:11:00,429
say something impressive okay basically

4696
03:10:56,950 --> 03:11:02,260
this story just to save Jeff the effort

4697
03:11:00,430 --> 03:11:05,530
of reading a long letter from the

4698
03:11:02,260 --> 03:11:08,739
governor any marijuana grown with an

4699
03:11:05,530 --> 03:11:12,010
unapproved pesticide is now a threat to

4700
03:11:08,739 --> 03:11:15,090
public safety just sort of by default so

4701
03:11:12,010 --> 03:11:17,770
any but any grow that's got a not

4702
03:11:15,090 --> 03:11:20,770
unapproved pesticide use going on and

4703
03:11:17,770 --> 03:11:23,550
that grow is currently scrambling to

4704
03:11:20,770 --> 03:11:26,470
figure out new pest management protocols

4705
03:11:23,549 --> 03:11:28,688
because the rule in this that's gonna

4706
03:11:26,469 --> 03:11:31,809
really throw shockwaves through the

4707
03:11:28,689 --> 03:11:33,760
industry is right now cannabis is

4708
03:11:31,809 --> 03:11:35,769
federally illegal and to sell a

4709
03:11:33,760 --> 03:11:37,659
pesticide in the United States you

4710
03:11:35,770 --> 03:11:40,360
needed a federal certification and

4711
03:11:37,659 --> 03:11:43,539
approval I mean your product has to be

4712
03:11:40,360 --> 03:11:45,370
tested for all kinds of stuff because

4713
03:11:43,540 --> 03:11:48,939
it's being sprayed I'm god-knows-what

4714
03:11:45,370 --> 03:11:50,500
around God knows who so it every

4715
03:11:48,939 --> 03:11:52,270
pesticide comes with a lot of really

4716
03:11:50,500 --> 03:11:53,770
specific rules about how they can and

4717
03:11:52,270 --> 03:11:57,130
can't be used and what they can and

4718
03:11:53,770 --> 03:12:00,280
can't be used on and cannabis right now

4719
03:11:57,129 --> 03:12:02,739
isn't on any of those labels and what

4720
03:12:00,280 --> 03:12:04,689
the governor just said was if cannabis

4721
03:12:02,739 --> 03:12:07,840
isn't on the label specifically you

4722
03:12:04,689 --> 03:12:09,729
can't use it to grow marijuana legally

4723
03:12:07,840 --> 03:12:12,370
in Colorado and nobody's gonna put

4724
03:12:09,728 --> 03:12:15,219
marijuana on there or cannabis take on

4725
03:12:12,370 --> 03:12:18,340
just because it's illegal yeah there is

4726
03:12:15,219 --> 03:12:20,039
a caveat there's some some pesticides

4727
03:12:18,340 --> 03:12:22,079
have

4728
03:12:20,040 --> 03:12:24,630
they're super safe you can use them on

4729
03:12:22,079 --> 03:12:26,190
anything and they have it a standardized

4730
03:12:24,629 --> 03:12:28,590
phrase for that that'll be on the label

4731
03:12:26,190 --> 03:12:32,640
and if the pesticide carries that

4732
03:12:28,591 --> 03:12:34,530
specific use designation then it can be

4733
03:12:32,640 --> 03:12:37,199
used on cannabis so it's not like we

4734
03:12:34,530 --> 03:12:39,960
can't use anything in this industry but

4735
03:12:37,200 --> 03:12:41,521
I guarantee there are countless grows

4736
03:12:39,959 --> 03:12:44,250
around Colorado that have been using

4737
03:12:41,521 --> 03:12:48,841
stuff that's perfectly acceptable for

4738
03:12:44,250 --> 03:12:51,181
tobacco or flowers or food and has been

4739
03:12:48,841 --> 03:12:53,011
used on cannabis for a decade or more

4740
03:12:51,181 --> 03:12:55,560
around the country everywhere just as

4741
03:12:53,011 --> 03:12:56,700
common practice right there scrambling

4742
03:12:55,560 --> 03:12:58,890
right now to figure out what they're

4743
03:12:56,700 --> 03:13:00,000
gonna replace that product with it's

4744
03:12:58,890 --> 03:13:02,520
gonna make a huge difference for a lot

4745
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:03,750
of growers so there's a timeline here

4746
03:13:02,521 --> 03:13:05,370
and I will read part of the article you

4747
03:13:03,750 --> 03:13:06,569
guys might trying to sum it up for us

4748
03:13:05,370 --> 03:13:08,130
but I'll read a bunch of it there's a

4749
03:13:06,569 --> 03:13:10,800
timeline off to the right of the artist

4750
03:13:08,129 --> 03:13:12,209
that's what I was thinking about a

4751
03:13:10,800 --> 03:13:14,189
little bit of hydration so that helped

4752
03:13:12,209 --> 03:13:16,169
out there's a timeline here and it says

4753
03:13:14,190 --> 03:13:20,011
on September 7 months after marijuana

4754
03:13:16,170 --> 03:13:22,341
holds post post tests find pesticides

4755
03:13:20,011 --> 03:13:25,681
and products that was on September 7th

4756
03:13:22,341 --> 03:13:26,970
September 8th Denver recalls mahatma pot

4757
03:13:25,681 --> 03:13:29,040
extracts containing unapproved

4758
03:13:26,970 --> 03:13:31,319
pesticides and then on the 18th denver

4759
03:13:29,040 --> 03:13:33,330
issues two more recalls and it keeps

4760
03:13:31,319 --> 03:13:35,761
going ah let's see

4761
03:13:33,329 --> 03:13:36,989
colorado proposes stricter rules pot

4762
03:13:35,761 --> 03:13:41,120
products made with unapproved pesticides

4763
03:13:36,989 --> 03:13:43,289
recalled on October 18th Colorado puts

4764
03:13:41,120 --> 03:13:45,811
what that's not a real word

4765
03:13:43,290 --> 03:13:47,400
it's just abbreviated stuff on industry

4766
03:13:45,810 --> 03:13:49,619
to use pesticides that are safe on pot

4767
03:13:47,399 --> 03:13:51,209
and then on the 21st Nature's cure of

4768
03:13:49,620 --> 03:13:52,650
Denver recalls pot products containing

4769
03:13:51,209 --> 03:13:54,390
pesticides and it just keeps going you

4770
03:13:52,649 --> 03:13:55,979
guys so they're a bunch of incidents of

4771
03:13:54,390 --> 03:13:57,750
these pesticides on cannabis we're gonna

4772
03:13:55,979 --> 03:13:59,459
keep seeing it and then they think it'll

4773
03:13:57,750 --> 03:14:01,591
taper off in the middle of next year

4774
03:13:59,459 --> 03:14:03,479
it should by by summer of next year by

4775
03:14:01,591 --> 03:14:04,620
spring of next year all this [ __ ] should

4776
03:14:03,479 --> 03:14:06,329
be settled everybody should be

4777
03:14:04,620 --> 03:14:08,271
well-educated on what they can and can't

4778
03:14:06,329 --> 03:14:11,280
use all the tainted herbs should be gone

4779
03:14:08,271 --> 03:14:13,860
some of the problem here is we don't

4780
03:14:11,280 --> 03:14:15,471
have enough testing labs so if you are

4781
03:14:13,860 --> 03:14:21,060
looking to invest in a fun sized

4782
03:14:15,470 --> 03:14:22,859
business call us we want you to be able

4783
03:14:21,060 --> 03:14:24,149
to test for residual solvents and hash

4784
03:14:22,860 --> 03:14:25,801
we need you to be able to test for

4785
03:14:24,149 --> 03:14:27,600
pesticides and flowers we need you to be

4786
03:14:25,800 --> 03:14:30,239
able to test for molds and pathogens and

4787
03:14:27,601 --> 03:14:33,440
our flowers we need ecoli testing in the

4788
03:14:30,239 --> 03:14:36,110
buds yeah we need all the to hood

4789
03:14:33,440 --> 03:14:37,819
testing reliable potency testing yep we

4790
03:14:36,110 --> 03:14:38,931
need it all alright let's read part of

4791
03:14:37,819 --> 03:14:41,209
the article I know Mike tried to sum it

4792
03:14:38,931 --> 03:14:43,131
up but it goes like this

4793
03:14:41,209 --> 03:14:44,750
Governor John Hickenlooper on Thursday

4794
03:14:43,130 --> 03:14:46,459
issued an executive order telling state

4795
03:14:44,750 --> 03:14:48,079
agencies that any marijuana grown with

4796
03:14:46,459 --> 03:14:49,729
unapproved pesticides is a threat to

4797
03:14:48,079 --> 03:14:52,039
public safety and should be removed from

4798
03:14:49,729 --> 03:14:54,171
commerce and destroyed the order is

4799
03:14:52,040 --> 03:14:56,120
Hickenlooper 'he's first word on a month

4800
03:14:54,171 --> 03:14:58,700
old controversy over pesticide used to

4801
03:14:56,120 --> 03:15:01,671
grow cannabis and a more aggressive

4802
03:14:58,700 --> 03:15:03,171
approach then half a dozen recalls by

4803
03:15:01,671 --> 03:15:05,569
denver health officials have put on

4804
03:15:03,171 --> 03:15:08,091
thousands of contaminated products some

4805
03:15:05,569 --> 03:15:09,229
of it later allowed back into commerce

4806
03:15:08,091 --> 03:15:11,210
sorry you guys that was hard to read

4807
03:15:09,229 --> 03:15:12,859
there's a really long since that whole

4808
03:15:11,209 --> 03:15:14,209
paragraph is one sentence and i didn't

4809
03:15:12,860 --> 03:15:24,489
have a good rhythm sorry I made it

4810
03:15:14,209 --> 03:15:25,659
walking for you after but it definitely

4811
03:15:24,489 --> 03:15:29,750
[Music]

4812
03:15:25,659 --> 03:15:31,280
that's the truth the order effectively

4813
03:15:29,750 --> 03:15:32,540
immediately was a result of a

4814
03:15:31,280 --> 03:15:35,000
collaboration with officials from

4815
03:15:32,540 --> 03:15:36,740
several state agencies the Department of

4816
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:39,050
Agriculture Revenue and Public Health

4817
03:15:36,739 --> 03:15:41,569
and Environment among them and provides

4818
03:15:39,050 --> 03:15:43,310
much-needed clarity on the use of pet

4819
03:15:41,569 --> 03:15:45,079
use of pesticides and how agencies

4820
03:15:43,310 --> 03:15:48,970
should treat them according to a joint

4821
03:15:45,079 --> 03:15:48,970
announcement a joint announcement right

4822
03:15:49,209 --> 03:15:52,699
pesticide is applied to a crop in a

4823
03:15:51,319 --> 03:15:54,560
manner that is inconsistent with the

4824
03:15:52,700 --> 03:15:56,240
pesticides label and the crop is

4825
03:15:54,560 --> 03:15:58,130
contaminated by that pesticide it

4826
03:15:56,239 --> 03:16:00,949
constitutes a threat to public safety

4827
03:15:58,130 --> 03:16:03,800
the order says the order says agencies

4828
03:16:00,950 --> 03:16:05,511
agencies should use all investigative

4829
03:16:03,800 --> 03:16:07,341
and enforcement authority to end the

4830
03:16:05,511 --> 03:16:09,200
threat including but not limited to

4831
03:16:07,341 --> 03:16:11,210
placing contaminated marijuana on

4832
03:16:09,200 --> 03:16:13,101
administrative hold and destroying

4833
03:16:11,209 --> 03:16:16,209
contaminated marijuana pursuant to

4834
03:16:13,101 --> 03:16:18,319
existing law industry spokespersons

4835
03:16:16,209 --> 03:16:20,090
spokespersons God my words are hard

4836
03:16:18,319 --> 03:16:21,529
industry spokespersons could not be

4837
03:16:20,091 --> 03:16:23,329
immediately reached for comment late

4838
03:16:21,530 --> 03:16:25,011
Thursday the order comes from Denver

4839
03:16:23,329 --> 03:16:26,780
Post stories that showed how potentially

4840
03:16:25,011 --> 03:16:28,431
harmful pesticides barred for use on

4841
03:16:26,780 --> 03:16:30,351
cannabis were still being applied and

4842
03:16:28,431 --> 03:16:33,681
fought at high concentrations in

4843
03:16:30,351 --> 03:16:35,450
products sold to customers if the Denver

4844
03:16:33,681 --> 03:16:38,750
Post is taking full credit for this

4845
03:16:35,450 --> 03:16:40,671
executive order that's what yeah that's

4846
03:16:38,750 --> 03:16:42,681
what that sounded like thanks - papers

4847
03:16:40,671 --> 03:16:44,081
love it when they can say we reported

4848
03:16:42,681 --> 03:16:45,701
something and then change

4849
03:16:44,081 --> 03:16:47,979
and did a state level because of it and

4850
03:16:45,700 --> 03:16:50,890
so this is a huge feather in their cap

4851
03:16:47,979 --> 03:16:52,600
they've just been buying up random

4852
03:16:50,890 --> 03:16:54,100
product to dispensaries and taking it to

4853
03:16:52,601 --> 03:16:55,990
testing labs who's gonna say that the

4854
03:16:54,101 --> 03:16:58,001
westward started that part of it they

4855
03:16:55,990 --> 03:17:00,550
the westward in the Denver Post both

4856
03:16:58,001 --> 03:17:04,149
hammered the edibles industry a couple

4857
03:17:00,550 --> 03:17:05,831
of years ago over potency issues and

4858
03:17:04,149 --> 03:17:07,600
then they started doing contaminants

4859
03:17:05,831 --> 03:17:09,880
test or the poster - doing contaminants

4860
03:17:07,601 --> 03:17:11,351
testing and it's definitely sent

4861
03:17:09,880 --> 03:17:13,180
shockwaves through the industry it's

4862
03:17:11,351 --> 03:17:15,190
definitely caused change to state level

4863
03:17:13,181 --> 03:17:17,531
so they're running around like they

4864
03:17:15,190 --> 03:17:20,591
scored cuz they [ __ ] scored and they

4865
03:17:17,531 --> 03:17:22,240
kind of did it's been a good smack for

4866
03:17:20,591 --> 03:17:24,899
the legal industry I think like there

4867
03:17:22,240 --> 03:17:28,351
was a little bit

4868
03:17:24,899 --> 03:17:30,270
of shenanigans like we brought a lot of

4869
03:17:28,351 --> 03:17:33,271
the black market stuff with us and

4870
03:17:30,271 --> 03:17:34,800
eventually we were gonna step up enough

4871
03:17:33,271 --> 03:17:36,989
to where we had to play by the same

4872
03:17:34,799 --> 03:17:38,689
rules everybody else did and we've

4873
03:17:36,989 --> 03:17:42,209
passed that point in Colorado now

4874
03:17:38,690 --> 03:17:44,159
significantly and so a lot of the things

4875
03:17:42,209 --> 03:17:45,209
that happen at every employer are now

4876
03:17:44,159 --> 03:17:48,690
gonna be happening throughout the

4877
03:17:45,209 --> 03:17:51,810
marijuana industry and some of that lab

4878
03:17:48,690 --> 03:17:54,329
testing some of that's recalls and it's

4879
03:17:51,810 --> 03:17:55,409
about time it happened is it is all

4880
03:17:54,329 --> 03:17:58,560
right I'll keep going with the article

4881
03:17:55,409 --> 03:17:59,700
it says where was I I wanted to give a

4882
03:17:58,560 --> 03:18:01,379
shout out to Claude the Candyman we're

4883
03:17:59,700 --> 03:18:01,920
talking about edibles shots to Claude

4884
03:18:01,379 --> 03:18:03,389
the Candyman

4885
03:18:01,920 --> 03:18:04,920
dude you're on an adventure of a

4886
03:18:03,389 --> 03:18:08,399
lifetime you're probably not gonna hear

4887
03:18:04,920 --> 03:18:10,500
this podcast but uh Claude is taking a

4888
03:18:08,399 --> 03:18:12,510
personal vacation and I've seen his

4889
03:18:10,500 --> 03:18:15,271
facebook pictures the dude has never had

4890
03:18:12,510 --> 03:18:16,560

4891
03:18:15,271 --> 03:18:22,110
Claude I'm proud of you bro big shout

4892
03:18:16,560 --> 03:18:23,819
out support sweet stone candy so it goes

4893
03:18:22,110 --> 03:18:25,500
on to say the post also identified how

4894
03:18:23,819 --> 03:18:27,029
state laws that barred views of certain

4895
03:18:25,500 --> 03:18:28,590
pesticides were not enforced and the

4896
03:18:27,030 --> 03:18:31,470
testing requirements for pesticide

4897
03:18:28,590 --> 03:18:33,840
residues were sent aside and then it

4898
03:18:31,469 --> 03:18:35,579
says a threat to safety Thursday's

4899
03:18:33,840 --> 03:18:37,739
bulletin specifically mandates state

4900
03:18:35,579 --> 03:18:39,719
agencies to determine any off-label use

4901
03:18:37,739 --> 03:18:42,180
of a pesticides a threat to public

4902
03:18:39,719 --> 03:18:44,189
safety and ensure that the contaminated

4903
03:18:42,180 --> 03:18:47,130
products are quarantined and destroyed

4904
03:18:44,190 --> 03:18:49,230
oh that's a bunch of hash and pot you're

4905
03:18:47,129 --> 03:18:54,899
just gonna watch it just destroyed I'm

4906
03:18:49,229 --> 03:18:56,879
wondering how high the animals the day

4907
03:18:54,899 --> 03:18:58,170
the fire department used to just put all

4908
03:18:56,879 --> 03:19:00,089
the bales of wheat and the fire they

4909
03:18:58,170 --> 03:19:01,530
still do that all over the place and

4910
03:19:00,090 --> 03:19:04,260
every now then they [ __ ] it up and get

4911
03:19:01,530 --> 03:19:06,450
the whole town really high yeah but I

4912
03:19:04,260 --> 03:19:08,159
don't know maybe I think it's just gonna

4913
03:19:06,450 --> 03:19:10,170
get blended with dirt is what it's

4914
03:19:08,159 --> 03:19:12,239
probably gonna happens with it that's

4915
03:19:10,170 --> 03:19:13,771
kind of what happens at a dispensary if

4916
03:19:12,239 --> 03:19:16,110
you run a soil grow and you gotta throw

4917
03:19:13,771 --> 03:19:18,930
leaves away you do like lasagna you do

4918
03:19:16,110 --> 03:19:20,640
leaves dirt leaves dirt smash it up yep

4919
03:19:18,930 --> 03:19:22,200
all right the article goes on to say

4920
03:19:20,639 --> 03:19:24,569
Thursday's bulletin specifically meant

4921
03:19:22,200 --> 03:19:25,740
no way I just read that part that is and

4922
03:19:24,569 --> 03:19:27,629
that is a stiffer approach in the

4923
03:19:25,739 --> 03:19:28,920
quantity quarantines and recalls Denver

4924
03:19:27,629 --> 03:19:30,479
health officials have put on marijuana

4925
03:19:28,920 --> 03:19:32,670
products contaminated with unapproved

4926
03:19:30,479 --> 03:19:34,079
pesticides in most cases the products

4927
03:19:32,670 --> 03:19:35,460
were allowed back into commerce once

4928
03:19:34,079 --> 03:19:37,020
tests confirmed as to

4929
03:19:35,459 --> 03:19:39,619
residues were at levels lower than

4930
03:19:37,020 --> 03:19:42,060
what's allowed on other consumable crops

4931
03:19:39,620 --> 03:19:44,130
Hickenlooper zorder appears to leave no

4932
03:19:42,059 --> 03:19:45,869
room for trace amounts and recalls for

4933
03:19:44,129 --> 03:19:49,829
the destruction of the affected plants

4934
03:19:45,870 --> 03:19:51,870
and any derivative products zero no

4935
03:19:49,829 --> 03:19:53,459
trace elements so if they used any

4936
03:19:51,870 --> 03:19:55,680
pesticide they'd find it on there pretty

4937
03:19:53,459 --> 03:19:58,289
much bye-bye to your whole product line

4938
03:19:55,680 --> 03:20:01,050
if they use some of this stuff I mean

4939
03:19:58,290 --> 03:20:05,970
years ago they could be destroying

4940
03:20:01,049 --> 03:20:07,739
breeding stock or I how we this is most

4941
03:20:05,969 --> 03:20:11,789
of the recalls are stem from a couple of

4942
03:20:07,739 --> 03:20:13,709
bigger grows that wholesale off dried

4943
03:20:11,790 --> 03:20:16,620
flower to other companies to make

4944
03:20:13,709 --> 03:20:18,149
edibles or hash with and so that's it's

4945
03:20:16,620 --> 03:20:20,820
the people that bought it that are now

4946
03:20:18,149 --> 03:20:22,228
issuing recalls is they go through and

4947
03:20:20,819 --> 03:20:24,989
they're like wait [ __ ] we bought 80

4948
03:20:22,228 --> 03:20:27,359
pounds of that and we make chocolate

4949
03:20:24,989 --> 03:20:29,190
bars so we threw that 80 pounds in with

4950
03:20:27,360 --> 03:20:30,780
a thousand other pounds we bought and we

4951
03:20:29,190 --> 03:20:33,390
made butter out of that and then we made

4952
03:20:30,780 --> 03:20:35,310
edibles and now we've got to recall all

4953
03:20:33,389 --> 03:20:37,739
the edible batches with those serial

4954
03:20:35,309 --> 03:20:39,809
numbers on its huge ripples through the

4955
03:20:37,739 --> 03:20:41,579
industry ouch we're gonna see lab

4956
03:20:39,809 --> 03:20:43,829
testing at every level we're gonna see

4957
03:20:41,579 --> 03:20:45,959
the labs triple or quadruple the number

4958
03:20:43,829 --> 03:20:47,430
across the state to handle all the

4959
03:20:45,959 --> 03:20:51,509
testing that's gonna have to take place

4960
03:20:47,430 --> 03:20:54,510
I wouldn't be surprised to see little

4961
03:20:51,510 --> 03:20:58,469
spike in price of a buck or two for

4962
03:20:54,510 --> 03:21:02,670
whatever this [ __ ] cost because yeah

4963
03:20:58,469 --> 03:21:04,228
it's gonna play into a I'm happy to buy

4964
03:21:02,670 --> 03:21:07,530
stuff in the legal industry because I

4965
03:21:04,228 --> 03:21:08,849
know that stuff's coming out yeah yeah I

4966
03:21:07,530 --> 03:21:11,040
don't have to worry about what's being

4967
03:21:08,850 --> 03:21:12,540
sprayed on it or what's still in it man

4968
03:21:11,040 --> 03:21:29,000
you just made the greatest argument for

4969
03:21:12,540 --> 03:21:32,610
legal prostitution yep yep alright we've

4970
03:21:29,000 --> 03:21:33,989
a company could destroy any affected

4971
03:21:32,610 --> 03:21:35,880
marijuana voluntarily or face

4972
03:21:33,989 --> 03:21:37,350
administrative actions by the state to

4973
03:21:35,879 --> 03:21:39,029
force the destruction according to a

4974
03:21:37,350 --> 03:21:42,059
policy statement issued by the Chiefs of

4975
03:21:39,030 --> 03:21:43,979
the three state agencies involved there

4976
03:21:42,059 --> 03:21:45,629
is no pesticide specifically approved

4977
03:21:43,978 --> 03:21:47,099
for use on marijuana because the

4978
03:21:45,629 --> 03:21:49,099
chemicals are regulated by the US

4979
03:21:47,100 --> 03:21:51,470
Environmental Protection Agency and

4980
03:21:49,100 --> 03:21:53,359
cannabis is illegal under federal law as

4981
03:21:51,469 --> 03:21:55,068
a result there have been no tests to

4982
03:21:53,359 --> 03:21:57,109
show how pesticides used on marijuana

4983
03:21:55,068 --> 03:22:00,648
could affect consumers or whether their

4984
03:21:57,109 --> 03:22:02,119
use is safe but state agricultural

4985
03:22:00,648 --> 03:22:04,010
officials have allowed certain

4986
03:22:02,119 --> 03:22:05,659
pesticides to be used on marijuana crops

4987
03:22:04,010 --> 03:22:07,790
only if it would not violate the

4988
03:22:05,658 --> 03:22:09,260
restriction on the products label it is

4989
03:22:07,790 --> 03:22:11,899
a violation of federal law to use a

4990
03:22:09,260 --> 03:22:13,219
pesticide contrary to its label you guys

4991
03:22:11,898 --> 03:22:14,389
this applies to you and your homegrown

4992
03:22:13,219 --> 03:22:17,988
this applies to you and your greenhouse

4993
03:22:14,389 --> 03:22:20,389
grow any pesticide wants to be a dick it

4994
03:22:17,988 --> 03:22:21,799
can be an extra charge yep all you got

4995
03:22:20,389 --> 03:22:24,408
to do when you buy your your spray

4996
03:22:21,799 --> 03:22:25,789
products your pesticides kill off that

4997
03:22:24,408 --> 03:22:27,439
little booklet that's on the back and

4998
03:22:25,790 --> 03:22:30,409
read it there will be rules on there

4999
03:22:27,439 --> 03:22:32,898
there will be what you should really pay

5000
03:22:30,408 --> 03:22:35,478
attention to is the interval of reentry

5001
03:22:32,898 --> 03:22:37,158
if it says not to go in this braid area

5002
03:22:35,478 --> 03:22:38,988
for four hours you should probably stay

5003
03:22:37,158 --> 03:22:40,609
out of there for four hours take that

5004
03:22:38,988 --> 03:22:41,809
seriously you're not gonna notice that

5005
03:22:40,609 --> 03:22:43,640
you're getting sick from a pesticide

5006
03:22:41,809 --> 03:22:45,948
until you start twitching in five years

5007
03:22:43,639 --> 03:22:49,250
right like you really want to read those

5008
03:22:45,949 --> 03:22:51,109
labels yeah so where the heck was I

5009
03:22:49,250 --> 03:22:52,579
despite the prohibitions the post

5010
03:22:51,109 --> 03:22:54,559
revealed in its own testing that a

5011
03:22:52,579 --> 03:22:56,629
number of marijuana infused products

5012
03:22:54,559 --> 03:22:59,180
contained high levels of pesticides not

5013
03:22:56,629 --> 03:23:00,920
allowed for use on cannabis what

5014
03:22:59,180 --> 03:23:01,908
followed were a number of recalls issued

5015
03:23:00,920 --> 03:23:03,260
by the Denver Department of

5016
03:23:01,908 --> 03:23:05,118
Environmental Health after

5017
03:23:03,260 --> 03:23:07,850
investigations and to business is

5018
03:23:05,119 --> 03:23:09,109
connected with the post findings we were

5019
03:23:07,850 --> 03:23:11,329
at the last paragraph you guys go ahead

5020
03:23:09,109 --> 03:23:13,369
my kids downplay the other half of their

5021
03:23:11,329 --> 03:23:15,289
findings they found they tested eight

5022
03:23:13,369 --> 03:23:17,800
samples two of them came back pretty

5023
03:23:15,290 --> 03:23:20,810
dirty but the other six came back

5024
03:23:17,799 --> 03:23:22,429
cleaner than the lab testing dude had

5025
03:23:20,809 --> 03:23:25,519
seen anything in a while

5026
03:23:22,430 --> 03:23:28,130
nice so but that's not news well it

5027
03:23:25,520 --> 03:23:29,899
should be it should be but there's no

5028
03:23:28,129 --> 03:23:32,118
scare tactic involved in that right like

5029
03:23:29,898 --> 03:23:34,129
it's it's really unfortunate that the

5030
03:23:32,119 --> 03:23:35,840
there's a dirty product out on store

5031
03:23:34,129 --> 03:23:37,698
shelves but at the same time it's all

5032
03:23:35,840 --> 03:23:39,829
being recalled because we've got testing

5033
03:23:37,699 --> 03:23:41,930
labs no one else has

5034
03:23:39,829 --> 03:23:45,049
it's kind of a beautiful thing I'm such

5035
03:23:41,930 --> 03:23:46,579
a [ __ ] up way though all right you

5036
03:23:45,049 --> 03:23:51,619
guys I will try I'm gonna make myself a

5037
03:23:46,579 --> 03:23:53,209
note a list of approved I want to find a

5038
03:23:51,620 --> 03:23:54,380
list of approved pesticides which I need

5039
03:23:53,209 --> 03:23:56,089
anyway for the shop

5040
03:23:54,379 --> 03:23:57,560
we just we use basically one or two

5041
03:23:56,090 --> 03:23:59,239
products at the shop we've done a pretty

5042
03:23:57,560 --> 03:24:01,340
good pesticide regimen going on there

5043
03:23:59,239 --> 03:24:02,810
but uh I will get a list of approved

5044
03:24:01,340 --> 03:24:05,170
pesticides we'll talk about that on the

5045
03:24:02,810 --> 03:24:08,510
show when we do the pest management

5046
03:24:05,170 --> 03:24:09,500
episode that I need to work on I've done

5047
03:24:08,510 --> 03:24:11,000
a lot of episodes of like halfway

5048
03:24:09,500 --> 03:24:12,979
written you guys I just need to put them

5049
03:24:11,000 --> 03:24:15,139
together things have been really chaotic

5050
03:24:12,979 --> 03:24:16,609
in my world I've been driving the

5051
03:24:15,139 --> 03:24:18,020
springs like three times a week to talk

5052
03:24:16,610 --> 03:24:19,940
about getting a job and now I've got the

5053
03:24:18,021 --> 03:24:21,680
job so it's gonna be a lot of fun let's

5054
03:24:19,940 --> 03:24:23,510
get on to the last paragraph of this

5055
03:24:21,680 --> 03:24:24,739
news article so that we can get Mike

5056
03:24:23,510 --> 03:24:26,989
home to his little baby

5057
03:24:24,739 --> 03:24:28,760
it says although state officials have

5058
03:24:26,989 --> 03:24:29,750
been battling around pesticide rules for

5059
03:24:28,760 --> 03:24:30,979
more than a year there was no

5060
03:24:29,750 --> 03:24:32,629
enforcement until Denver health

5061
03:24:30,979 --> 03:24:34,760
officials quarantined more than a

5062
03:24:32,629 --> 03:24:36,920
hundred thousand plants it said were

5063
03:24:34,760 --> 03:24:39,409
improperly grown with pesticides the

5064
03:24:36,920 --> 03:24:40,879
state said could not be used the

5065
03:24:39,409 --> 03:24:42,319
quarantines came after Denver fire

5066
03:24:40,879 --> 03:24:44,000
inspectors found potentially hazardous

5067
03:24:42,319 --> 03:24:45,889
pesticides and marijuana growing

5068
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:47,540
facilities during routine inspections

5069
03:24:45,889 --> 03:24:49,459
this year and reported it to health

5070
03:24:47,540 --> 03:24:50,210
officials it as I mentioned this on the

5071
03:24:49,459 --> 03:24:53,089
show

5072
03:24:50,209 --> 03:24:55,039
they found a eagle 20 in there and when

5073
03:24:53,090 --> 03:24:57,200
Eagle 20 is an eagle 20 or flora might

5074
03:24:55,040 --> 03:24:59,120
its Eagle 20 when Eagle 20 catches on

5075
03:24:57,200 --> 03:25:01,790
fire and burns the off gas that comes

5076
03:24:59,120 --> 03:25:03,530
from Eagle 20 is cyanide so that's where

5077
03:25:01,790 --> 03:25:10,100
the fireman fire department doesn't want

5078
03:25:03,530 --> 03:25:11,930
that in your grow yeah like know what

5079
03:25:10,100 --> 03:25:14,180
you've got in your grow know you've got

5080
03:25:11,930 --> 03:25:16,069
in your house this is all gonna get

5081
03:25:14,180 --> 03:25:17,870
alongs yeah you should read the label on

5082
03:25:16,069 --> 03:25:19,100
any product you're using anyway all the

5083
03:25:17,870 --> 03:25:20,390
time you should kind of be aware of what

5084
03:25:19,100 --> 03:25:22,220
you're putting into yourself into your

5085
03:25:20,389 --> 03:25:25,549
plants into your food feeding your dog

5086
03:25:22,219 --> 03:25:27,859
read the label alright last paragraph

5087
03:25:25,549 --> 03:25:29,989
you guys last small sentence in the

5088
03:25:27,860 --> 03:25:31,521
paragraph the state is amid rulemaking

5089
03:25:29,989 --> 03:25:33,649
that would strictly limit the pesticides

5090
03:25:31,521 --> 03:25:35,510
they can be used on marijuana only to

5091
03:25:33,649 --> 03:25:37,579
those whose labels allow for unspecified

5092
03:25:35,510 --> 03:25:39,560
crops that can be used in greenhouses

5093
03:25:37,579 --> 03:25:42,021
and that are not prohibited from human

5094
03:25:39,560 --> 03:25:45,340
consumption s decides allowed in tobacco

5095
03:25:42,021 --> 03:25:49,100
cultivation also would be approved

5096
03:25:45,340 --> 03:25:51,380
alright so any pesticides found in any

5097
03:25:49,100 --> 03:25:52,609
test of cannabis equals your cannabis is

5098
03:25:51,379 --> 03:25:56,028
now being destroyed

5099
03:25:52,609 --> 03:25:57,408
yep that's a huge move that's Mike said

5100
03:25:56,029 --> 03:26:00,259
it a minute ago it's gonna make prices

5101
03:25:57,408 --> 03:26:01,968
go up I'm just gonna send big ripples

5102
03:26:00,259 --> 03:26:04,578
through the industry there's not

5103
03:26:01,968 --> 03:26:06,468
everybody was growing with the stuff

5104
03:26:04,578 --> 03:26:08,869
that's being banned or was banned a

5105
03:26:06,468 --> 03:26:11,868
couple months back so it's not like

5106
03:26:08,869 --> 03:26:15,469
everyone has to change out but every

5107
03:26:11,869 --> 03:26:17,748
company that buys product does like it's

5108
03:26:15,468 --> 03:26:20,328
it's only a matter of time before shops

5109
03:26:17,748 --> 03:26:24,498
our lab testing everything that comes in

5110
03:26:20,328 --> 03:26:26,599
just as a matter of policy let alone

5111
03:26:24,498 --> 03:26:28,398
extract companies edible companies just

5112
03:26:26,599 --> 03:26:30,318
think of a product like cheap wood shoe

5113
03:26:28,398 --> 03:26:32,208

5114

03:27:24,709 --> 03:27:34,399
like they are known to be the shittiest

5139
03:27:28,068 --> 03:27:36,168
the most [ __ ] dispensary that got or

03:27:39,859 --> 03:27:44,658
so they also had a lot of pesticide

5144
03:27:42,408 --> 03:27:46,699
issues I'm curious to see if snoops

5145
03:27:44,658 --> 03:27:48,138
products have residual pesticides from

5146
03:27:46,699 --> 03:27:55,849

feedback on that lately shit's been

5288
03:33:19,158 --> 03:33:24,228
blowing up lately because anti-pop

5289
03:33:22,129 --> 03:33:25,969
people have taken notice and are serving

5290
03:33:24,228 --> 03:33:29,420
you're really pissed when I link their

5291
03:33:25,969 --> 03:33:31,719
stuff and debunk it and it's led to some

5292
03:33:29,420 --> 03:33:35,408
really hilarious little prohibitionist I

5293
03:33:31,719 --> 03:33:37,760
don't know attempted trolling I suppose

5294
03:33:35,408 --> 03:33:38,989
describing it's funny cuz it's sort of

5295
03:33:37,760 --> 03:33:40,940
like

5296
03:33:38,989 --> 03:33:44,059
if a small child decided to lecture

5297
03:33:40,940 --> 03:33:45,470
calculus at you like it doesn't matter

5298
03:33:44,059 --> 03:33:48,049
how passionate they are like they're

5299
03:33:45,469 --> 03:33:51,559
never gonna get it right you're not

5300
03:33:48,049 --> 03:33:53,420
gonna learn anything useful it's just

5301
03:33:51,559 --> 03:33:55,609
this weird thing that I mean to be

5302
03:33:53,420 --> 03:33:58,750
against pot at this point in history is

5303
03:33:55,610 --> 03:34:01,370
to have failed to do your homework and

5304
03:33:58,750 --> 03:34:02,000
that's just where the argument starts

5305
03:34:01,370 --> 03:34:05,990

5306
03:34:02,000 --> 03:34:08,620

03:34:43,940 --> 03:34:48,440
[ __ ] debunk nonsense cuz there's a

5322
03:34:45,829 --> 03:34:50,569

5329

didn't even look at Facebook the past

5332
03:35:07,909 --> 03:35:13,639
week I find myself shunning news and

5333
03:35:11,270 --> 03:35:15,860
social media after events like this just

5334
03:35:13,639 --> 03:35:18,199
because of all that like the event

5335
03:35:15,860 --> 03:35:19,970
itself is bad enough all the hate in the

5336
03:35:18,200 --> 03:35:21,800
fear and the idiocy and the ignorance

5337
03:35:19,969 --> 03:35:23,478
that led up to it's bad enough but then

5338
03:35:21,799 --> 03:35:26,269
the [ __ ] that comes after it's just so

5339
03:35:23,478 --> 03:35:27,500
much worse right yeah yeah Facebook just

5340
03:35:26,270 --> 03:35:28,970
makes me want to smash my head into the

5341
03:35:27,500 --> 03:35:30,228
wall lately so I've been avoiding that

5342
03:35:28,969 --> 03:35:31,789

people are afraid they do really really

5357
03:35:56,600 --> 03:36:01,550
crazy insane things and that's what's

5358
03:35:59,090 --> 03:36:02,960
going on right now is there's a lot of

5359

he's a great guy that's why I don't feel

5382
03:37:08,209 --> 03:37:11,000
bad picking on him because he's actually

5383
03:37:09,290 --> 03:37:12,680
a good dude that's why I'm giving him a
