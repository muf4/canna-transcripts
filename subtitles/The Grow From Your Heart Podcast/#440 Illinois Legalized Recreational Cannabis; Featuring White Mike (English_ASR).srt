23
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:44,878
we've been chatting for a few so we got

24
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:46,349
to jump into this where are we let's

25
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,759
talk about what we're smoking on usually

26
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:50,309
we talk about what we're smoking

27
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:52,799
we just took a couple of dabs of Gigi

28
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:55,439
number four batter the potency label

29
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,030
says it is 65 percent THC with seventy

30
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,878
five point one percent total

31
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:02,820
cannabinoids but I topped that off with

32
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:05,188
some pre 98 bubba kush high cannabinoid

33
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,989
full-spectrum extract the potent season

34
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,750
label says this is eighty four point

35
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,810
five percent THC and ninety six point

36
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,569
seven percent total cannabinoids

37
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,740
basically the batter looks would you

38
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:18,599
agree that that kind of looks like

39
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:20,728
cheesecake or cake batter the lids are

40
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,289
wrong looks like packages so that one

41
00:01:20,728 --> 00:01:24,929
right there let's say cake batter or

42
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,430
cheesecake and then this one put the

43
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,860
lids on the right containers as they go

44
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:31,200
back yeah that's this one over here

45
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:33,539
would you say it looks like diamonds

46
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,759
with hints of yellow yep so I've got

47
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,040
some some batter with some diamonds in

48
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,069
it basically and those dabs were

49
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:43,560
delicious mmm the GG for we're not

50
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:46,919
supposed to say she did other words with

51
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,259
the GG for taste yeah it tastes so good

52
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,759
it's got that that earthy cushy sort of

53
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,769
a thing going on and then that the

54
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,659

Department big shout out to the person

who sent me the message reminding me

94

that I [ __ ] up I said something wrong

95
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:15,900
on the podcast and uh I'm all about

96
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,039
being corrected that's how I learn

97
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,890
sometimes people are gonna make mistakes

98
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:22,689
I did 440 episodes and I think this is

99
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,059
like the second or third correction I've

100
00:03:22,689 --> 00:03:26,620
received right if this is the fourth I'm

101
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,509
gonna say that's still good percentage

102
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:31,060
oh yeah yeah so and I'm gonna make some

103
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:34,120
mistakes and things are gonna change and

104
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:35,710
I apologize when that happens I do my

105
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,780
best to stay on top of it but

106
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:40,240
occasionally I talk fast my brain goes

107
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:42,159
really fast sometimes they don't connect

108
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,689
properly sometimes the wrong numbers and

109
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,460
lighters will fly out but I said

110
00:03:43,689 --> 00:03:47,289
something that was inaccurate and our

111
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,420
Corrections Department sent me a message

112
00:03:47,289 --> 00:03:51,310
and if I do that again please feel free

113
00:03:49,419 --> 00:03:52,780
to send me messages I like learning I

114
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:55,270
like being corrected that's how we stay

115
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:57,310
smart on top so the correction I need to

116
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,130
make is on the last episode I said that

117
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:02,830
I only use products in aggro that are on

118
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:05,079
the Colorado Department of Agriculture

119
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:11,350
approved pesticide list for cannabis use

120
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:13,510
then I listed as a max as a max has been

121
00:04:11,349 --> 00:04:15,000
banned in the use of cannabis and

122
00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:17,139
Colorado medical and recreational

123
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,329
production so when I said that I was

124
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:22,149
absolutely wrong I'm correcting myself

125
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,500
now do not use as a MACT you will get

126
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:26,379
yourself in some trouble with the

127
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,910
Department of Ag so I stand corrected

128
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:29,949
I apologize for that

129
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,360
information I will do my best not to do

130
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:32,889
that again and I promise you I'm not

131
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,660
spraying as a max anywhere I've got

132
00:04:32,889 --> 00:04:35,829
another product I can't think of it off

133
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,120
the top of my head I should have looked

134
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:38,529
that up but that's not what I was here

135
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,870
for today I just wanted to make sure

136
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:43,209
that I did correct you that as a max or

137
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:45,399
correct myself that as a max is no

138
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:47,500
longer allowed in cannabis production

139
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,750
all right so we've made that correction

140
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,339
let's move forward Mike you ready to

141
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,329

fun part up bill was signed into law

152
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:17,589
today at Atlantan on the governor's desk

153
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:19,360
a couple of weeks ago and has been in

154
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:22,389
that fun limbo while the governor

155
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,720
decides or decides not to or waits for

156
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:27,189
the time they feel like signing to occur

157
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,600

163
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,060

00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:41,589
has been that we've basically been

165

waiting for him to sign it I get the

166
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:45,369
feeling of like when there's a movie

167
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,540
coming out or a toy coming out when you

168
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,040
were a kid and you wanted to go to that

169
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,510
movie or you wanted that toy and you

170
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,620
were to ask your mom Friday when the

171
00:05:49,509 --> 00:05:52,000
story comes out can i get it and i get

172
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,379
it and i get it and all week she's like

173
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,089
i don't know because she really didn't

174
00:05:53,379 --> 00:05:56,680
know no she could make that [ __ ] happen

175
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:58,029
Friday when payday came she's gonna pay

176
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,379
up all the bills and if there were six

177
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:00,909
bucks left to go to that movie you could

178
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,019
but do you want to tell you yes does

179
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:03,250
she'd break your [ __ ] heart she don't

180
00:06:02,019 --> 00:06:04,990
want to say no now because she might

181
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:06,610
break your [ __ ] heart so she like I

182
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,610
don't know it all we hear is waiting so

183
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:12,129
it's it's a bizarre political thing like

184
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,350
this is something that the governor in

185
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:16,060
question the governor Illinois said he

186
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:18,850
wanted it was part of his campaign for

187
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,949
reelection I'm getting it done this year

188
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:24,480
was a big platform of his something he

189
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:26,589
talked about wanting to accomplish

190
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,030
legalization efforts especially in the

191
00:06:26,589 --> 00:06:30,789
Legislature's this year took a weird

192
00:06:28,029 --> 00:06:33,699
turn where instead of just getting

193
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:35,650
cannabis legal we're trying to write

194
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:39,050
like a whole bunch of the wrongs that

195
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:43,399
have occurred over the Prohibition years

196
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:46,038
at the same time and it's just too much

197
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:48,649
at once yeah like we want one-stop

198
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:51,469
shopping here where we get weed legal

199
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:54,109
and we get funding for communities that

200
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:57,530
were way over policed for drug crimes

201
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:59,810
and have suffered systemic problems

202
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:02,089
because of that over policing and we're

203
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:03,889
gonna get them some funding and we're

204
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:05,689
gonna make sure that there's a fund for

205
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:07,668
minority business owners to become

206
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:09,379
marijuana business owners to help them

207
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:10,939
out with credit and stuff and we're

208
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:12,710
gonna if you sent that to me in an email

209
00:07:10,939 --> 00:07:14,689
you know what I would reply with too

210
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:16,848
long I didn't read it's yeah it's it's

211
00:07:14,689 --> 00:07:21,978
four or five different ideas on Bush

212
00:07:16,848 --> 00:07:23,779
together they also got fixing past

213
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:25,279
convictions if you were convicted of

214
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:26,478
possession or less than I want to say

215
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,399
it's thirty grams

216
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,709
I remember thinking it was an ounce and

217
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,120
change if you had less than an ounce to

218
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:35,689
change and you were busted in Illinois

219
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,930
you can now apply to have that

220
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:40,879
conviction sealed or removed from your

221
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:43,278
record I'm not sure how they worded it

222
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,810
like that they gave me was 130 grams in

223
00:07:43,278 --> 00:07:47,269
case you got it from me and I gave you a

224
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,310
fat ounce you know you can act for 30 31

225
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:50,598
32

226
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,519
troubles cuz I never gave you twenty

227
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,168
eight point three five also I've

228
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:55,879
mentioned that before twenty eight point

229
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:58,189
three five announces not twenty eight

230
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,278
grams and ounces twenty eight point

231
00:07:58,189 --> 00:08:03,348
three five that only that doesn't sound

232
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:05,269
big that point registers are a little

233
00:08:03,348 --> 00:08:07,610
surprised the rest of the world is like

234
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:09,378
[ __ ] America right yeah well that

235
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:11,300
point three five doesn't sound like much

236
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:12,919
but add it up to four times if you're

237
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:15,288
buying a quarter pound now you're at

238
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:20,990
point seven that's one point for right

239
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:26,360
do the sixteen times what if you're

240
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:27,408
buying ten pounds like I was gonna say

241
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,930
we've got a legal medical marijuana

242
00:08:27,408 --> 00:08:31,490
market now if I say I sold them ten

243
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:33,078
pounds and you only ring up that ten

244
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,579
pounds by twenty eight grams and you

245
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:35,929
actually gave I gave them twenty eight

246
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:37,399
point three five there's gonna be a

247
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,439
shortage somewhere on our system and in

248
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,078
our money as I got halfway on a [ __ ]

249
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,209
crazy rant there that's gonna three

250
00:08:42,078 --> 00:08:46,969
grams thing and don't get me wrong I

251
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:49,259
like all of the parts that they kind of

252
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,090
squeezed into this law but

253
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,009
we watched New York and New Jersey fail

254
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,250
in their attempts to get legalization

255
00:08:53,009 --> 00:08:57,689
done this year not because like a whole

256
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,759
bunch of people there were like maybe

257
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:01,470
it's a bad idea let's hold off and see

258
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,210
how it goes and the other place there's

259
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:05,279
none of that [ __ ] they were all like

260
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,660
well I want money for this pet project

261
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,209
and you know I think it's important that

262
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:12,449
we address this particular wrong with

263
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:15,420
this bill and they could never hatch out

264
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,970
the the taxes and the other stuff they

265
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:19,709
wanted to attach to legalization so they

266
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,690
left it illegal for another eight months

267
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:23,160
or in Texas for two more years because

268
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:26,400
the legislature only meets every other

269
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:28,730
year but illinois' managed to squeak it

270
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,110
out it just barely to that I think when

271
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,759
this bill went through the Senate and

272
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:34,320
the House of Representatives it only had

273
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:36,450
a couple of days left in their official

274
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,820
session so it made it through just one

275
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,500
of the wire and then governors do this

276
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,320
weird thing where they campaign on

277
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,360
something the House passes it the Senate

278
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:48,090
passes it it goes to the governor's desk

279
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,519
and then there's just three weeks so

280
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,730
wondering what the [ __ ] going on why

281
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:56,039
why do they play with us like that

282
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:57,810
there's not any rhyme or reason to it

283
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,870
because all the governors do it and it

284
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:03,059
happens pretty much any time there's a

285
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,580
bill signing the bill heads to the

286
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:06,899
governor's desk in uux you would expect

287
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:08,400
like hey this is a big thing you've been

288
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:09,750
[ __ ] talking about for a year there

289
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,120
was a big fight over at the press and

290
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:17,429
you won like you official one on Friday

291
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,259
why is Monday night like that everybody

292
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:22,079
get together in my office and we'll sign

293
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:23,399
this yeah there's always a couple of

294
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,050
weeks down the road and he's like

295
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:27,329
golfing and then they don't announce it

296
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:29,669
abies so I've been waiting for the

297
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,170
official like hey Illinois got signed to

298
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:32,279
call you and say hey we have to do a

299
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:36,059
show we should talk about Illinois

300
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,620
perfect timing and I've been watching

301
00:10:36,059 --> 00:10:38,849
there's been no one now it's been saying

302
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,490
hey we're gonna sign that sucker on

303
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:42,899
Wednesday nothing it's just I got up

304
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:44,850
today and I was to my phone it was like

305
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:48,029
oh hey he signed it yesterday was the

306
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,409
day it's weird we don't pay attention to

307
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:51,059
much of their stuff going on in Illinois

308
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:52,319
because we are in Colorado so not no

309
00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:53,939
offense to Illinois I just pay more

310
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,870
attention to Colorado stuff I wonder if

311
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,610
he's just been going through a list

312
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:58,600
signing [ __ ] or if today was just the

313
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,940
days like Oh actually does its

314
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,370
he was working on a to-do list and this

315
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,220
was just item 25 and he couldn't get to

316
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:08,649
it until he got item 24 done is there's

317
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,720
nothing like that strange yes

318
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:13,799
either way shout out to our friends out

319
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,210

320

great states eleven yeah if you're from

328
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:39,399
Pueblo that's eleven but most of the

329
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,799
world says eleven so how Colorado gets

330
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,779
to claim to be first Washington gets to

331
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,609
claim to that they went at the same time

332
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:49,809
as us their polls just closed two hours

333
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:51,100
after ours and then every state census

334
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:53,139
tried to come up with their own little

335
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:55,960
claim to fame like Vermont got to say

336
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:58,059
like we legalized adult possession but

337
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,590
through the legislature we're the first

338
00:11:58,059 --> 00:12:00,969
state to do it through the legislature

339
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,800
but they haven't gotten around to

340
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,960
creating a commercial industry system

341
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,969
and so Illinois's went through the

342
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:09,670
legislature they were the second to do

343
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,170
through the legislature but they the

344
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:13,899
first to do it through the legislature

345
00:12:11,169 --> 00:12:15,429
and include a retail system like

346
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,679
framework for that so they're like hey

347
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:19,719
we're first and it's like 11th [ __ ]

348
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,729
people are gonna jump up and say that

349
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,710
Colorado was not first he said

350
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:25,210
recreational when it comes to medical

351
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,009
there are other states that were first

352
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:29,230
happy yeah big shout-out to our friends

353
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:32,950
McCallie and that's that is a good segue

354
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:35,529
33 medical marijuana states here if you

355
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:37,810
guys can do math 33 now yeah that only

356
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:39,759
leaves out six states without some

357
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:41,199
cannabis friendly laws Mike and I were

358
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,330
trying to do some research honestly at

359
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,160
the start of the show and we kept

360
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,440
finding conflicting information on which

361
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:50,319
states do not support medical or some

362
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,060
sort of cannabis so many states at this

363
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,800
point I think I really think it's under

364
00:12:52,059 --> 00:12:58,809
five that don't have any sort of

365
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,000
marijuana law but now there's at least

366
00:12:58,809 --> 00:13:02,338
four or five on top of that original

367
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,370
five

368
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:09,749
that are CBD only where you can get

369
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:13,499
basically help extract that up until the

370
00:13:09,749 --> 00:13:16,350
farm bill passed in November would have

371
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:18,749
been considered totally illegal part of

372
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:23,399
the marijuana plant no different in a

373
00:13:18,749 --> 00:13:25,199
court of law from high THC hash but you

374
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,549
can get CBD extract I think it's like

375
00:13:25,198 --> 00:13:30,208
Utah on a couple of others that are

376
00:13:26,549 --> 00:13:32,878
really minimal CBD only we looked at a

377
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:35,748
map and it had different shades of green

378
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,399
would indicate recreational legal or

379
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:40,528
decriminalized and then little black

380
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,110
states on the map would indicate don't

381
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,879
go here and most of those work down in

382
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:47,100
the southeastern part of our great

383
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:49,499
nation here so that's where we need to

384
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,899
kind of shift our focus on the cannabis

385
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:53,909
legalization efforts most of us seem to

386
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,370
be catching on here it's in it's coming

387
00:13:53,909 --> 00:13:59,159
in quick Wisconsin is one of the states

388
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:02,159
that has no medical marijuana laws no

389
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:04,438
recreational marijuana laws and today

390
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,688
their elected officials several of them

391
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:08,639
were in the press talking about like

392
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:12,838
well you know now we're kind of boxed in

393
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,730
with Illinois goes awesome um so is is

394
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:15,899
illinois' another big state there's a

395
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:17,550
[ __ ] ton of people who live in Illinois

396
00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:19,169
I was gonna Google exactly what their

397
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:20,519
population is but that seems like extra

398
00:14:19,169 --> 00:14:25,909
effort for tonight's show

399
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:28,799
do you thanks Mike do you think that

400
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:30,808
state officials people that

401
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:33,870
decision-makers on that level think like

402
00:14:30,808 --> 00:14:35,549
I do when they see so I'm just gonna say

403
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,139
they were asked where and the states to

404
00:14:35,549 --> 00:14:39,328
the north the South the east and the

405
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:42,539
west of us have all hypothetically just

406
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:44,308
legalized some sort of cannabis use do

407
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:46,469
you think that that makes us go well

408
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:47,850
from an economic standpoint we need to

409
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,339
do this too because all of our people

410
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,870
are just driving 30 miles that way 30

411
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:53,309
miles that way or 30 miles that way or

412
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:55,470
110 miles that way and they're buying

413
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:58,289
product they're bringing it back maybe

414
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:02,579
we need to just start there's some of

415
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:03,928
that that works I know for a fact there

416
00:15:02,578 --> 00:15:06,448
are sections of Colorado that were

417
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:08,549
thrilled that a couple of our

418
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:11,838
neighboring states failed that their

419
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:14,099
legalization attempts because areas like

420
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,610
Trinidad in southern Colorado

421
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,778
have been

422
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:22,060
um really energized by legal cannabis

423
00:15:18,778 --> 00:15:24,939
taxes and revenue investment in the

424
00:15:22,059 --> 00:15:26,469
community it's a Trinidad's a weird city

425
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:30,010
that's gone through several boom and

426
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,379
bust cycles even like their Sheriff is

427
00:15:30,009 --> 00:15:33,879
like hey ride the boom wall it's booming

428
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:36,519
these guys aren't hurting anybody

429
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:38,320
they're investing a ton of taxes more

430
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,519
little area too late for us we have

431
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,019
friends down there we used to go to

432
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,240
gatherings down there and we've seen

433
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:44,679
that place go from a dusty kind of a

434
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,329
fall in a part of town it was almost a

435
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,069
ghost town it was now it's yeah

436
00:15:46,328 --> 00:15:49,809
beautiful like it's strange to say but

437
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:53,110
it was five or ten years from ghost town

438
00:15:49,809 --> 00:15:55,149
yeah I'm and now it's a hustling little

439
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:57,909
city and Trinidad is basically the first

440
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:59,379
city in Colorado when you come from New

441
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:01,719
Mexico if you're coming north from New

442
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:04,809
Mexico which is a good segue to talk

443
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,040
about this part I see a lot on top of

444
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:07,778
what's happening in New Mexico I'm

445
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,819
involved in the New Mexico medical

446
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:11,320
marijuana movement is also and also what

447
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,390
is going to become the recreational

448
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,890
medical marijuana movement I do some

449
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,958
consulting and things like that I help

450
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:19,149
people down there do some teaching and

451
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,069
other things but I pay attention to

452
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:23,379
what's going on down there a big part of

453
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,420
why they are pushing toward the

454
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:27,578
legalization of recreational cannabis is

455
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:30,599
because they see if many people post

456
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:32,859
openly about it on Facebook in the in

457
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,389
anywhere in the groups on the where

458
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,800
wherever we talk on social media like I

459
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:37,389
don't even shop in New Mexico I go to

460
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:38,679
Colorado because it's half the price and

461
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:41,049
so they're showing pictures of all this

462
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:42,489
Colorado product in New Mexico and so

463
00:16:41,049 --> 00:16:44,559
New Mexico saying well [ __ ] they're just

464
00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:46,149
driving two hours that's all they have

465
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:47,588
to do and it's half the price and double

466
00:16:46,149 --> 00:16:49,179
the quality because we have silly rules

467
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,440
here let's change that and that's

468
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:52,719
actually part of why they're changing

469
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,190
their rules that small influence I can't

470
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,160
say it's a big deal but it does affect

471
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:59,890
them they've noticed it there was a huge

472
00:16:57,159 --> 00:17:01,588
influx of they caught tourism traffic

473
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:05,588
through Colorado

474
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:08,289
starting in January 2014 as soon as our

475
00:17:05,588 --> 00:17:10,298
rec stores opened there was no reason to

476
00:17:08,289 --> 00:17:12,220
come visit us with med stores really I

477
00:17:10,298 --> 00:17:14,048
mean you could but you weren't you

478
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:15,730
couldn't get in who wants to go stand in

479
00:17:14,048 --> 00:17:19,230
the parking lot at Disneyland yeah or

480
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:23,110
Walley world or whatever but

481
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:25,029
with wreck people from all around the

482
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:27,879
u.s. I mean all over the planet really I

483
00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,829
when I was but tending it one of the

484
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,880
more touristy spots in town like we

485
00:17:29,829 --> 00:17:34,149
would get people from all over the

486
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:36,700
planet regularly you can remember a

487
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:39,040
couple of guys from Ireland who just

488
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:42,130
spent spent like an hour walking around

489
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,299
and taking pictures of I mean everything

490
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,670
in the dispenser is just blown away

491
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,109
because there's nothing like this where

492
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:49,750
they're from he's not gonna be for

493
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:52,449
another 30 years that's a great ok keep

494
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,579
just watching us exactly

495
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,230
Canada saw some of our state's going

496
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:59,349
legal and that really pushed that

497
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:02,650
government I mean really really pushed

498
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:04,149
they've been more adult about their

499
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,509
marijuana discussion I'd say for the

500
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,790
last 20 years yeah but watching States

501
00:18:07,509 --> 00:18:11,769
in in the u.s. go legal and then having

502
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:14,139
Canadians report like we just jumped the

503
00:18:11,769 --> 00:18:16,539
border to Washington grab what we want

504
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,759
and bring it back no one checks our cars

505
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:24,789
like who smoke will ship from the u.s.

506
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:26,259
into Canada so um Canada jumped on it

507
00:18:24,789 --> 00:18:28,409
Mexico is talking about it right now

508
00:18:26,259 --> 00:18:32,559
when Mexico goes legal that's huge um

509
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:35,019
that's gonna change the game completely

510
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,879
if the feds here haven't made a move on

511
00:18:35,019 --> 00:18:40,539
legalization when Mexico goes they'll

512
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,830
have to yeah absolutely yep yeah that'll

513
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,029
cause okay that'll cause all kinds of

514
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,490
weird probably all kinds of

515
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:46,779
international rule stuff not really

516
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,460
um there's all kinds of [ __ ] that's

517
00:18:46,779 --> 00:18:53,019
legal in Mexico in Canada today illegal

518
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:55,630
here like cigars for one thing anyway I

519
00:18:53,019 --> 00:18:56,920
think those may if I heard correctly we

520
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,790
we lifted that I don't know what's

521
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,320
happening there I don't pay enough

522
00:18:57,789 --> 00:19:00,819
attention to that you did give me a good

523
00:18:59,319 --> 00:19:02,409
opportunity for a good segue I want to

524
00:19:00,819 --> 00:19:05,109
throw it out before I forget it we've

525
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,330
talked about the 11 wreck states the 33

526
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:08,799
medical marijuana States we kind of talk

527
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:09,970
some trash about those punk-ass states

528
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,710
that haven't caught on yet get it

529
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,289
together boys and girls let's get some

530
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,870
some cannabis friendly happenin in your

531
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:18,789
states what do you do you know of any

532
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:20,559
places where would be in your opinion

533
00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,180
the worst cannabis laws and they don't

534
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,710
have to be in the United States where

535
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,140
would you not want to be caught with

536
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:29,500
cannabis there's a bunch of places in

537
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,000
like Asia where government story dude

538
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:34,869
had

539
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,369
a little bit of a nug like that fell off

540
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:37,689
his lap he was rolling a joint like

541
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:40,569
something fell to the end of the joint

542
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:42,670
and got stuck in his shoe and was doing

543
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:49,329
time in like Egypt for it or some [ __ ]

544
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:53,190
at the airport u.s. Texas has always had

545
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:53,189
particularly horrible marijuana laws

546
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,820
especially in regards to concentrates so

547
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,920
if you're caught with hash they would

548
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:02,559
charge you as though it was heroin like

549
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:05,009
went away I have an acquaintance who was

550
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,539
caught with one of these containers in

551
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:10,089
Texas so this container I'm picking up

552
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:13,389
system is in container and inside is a

553
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:14,649
gram container what do you that Abel I'm

554
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,940
gonna turn the mic for the table and

555
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,019
then I'm gonna drop this on the table so

556
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:20,799
you can hear how much this container

557
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:22,480
weighs it's a heavy glass that's heavy

558
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,490
yeah that's a lot of weight today blast

559
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,019
joy so when they busted him in Texas you

560
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:28,870
know what they did they charged in and

561
00:20:26,019 --> 00:20:30,160
for the weight of the container yet so

562
00:20:28,869 --> 00:20:31,989
however much you just heard they hit the

563
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,210
table they think he had that much

564
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,529
concentrate on him when he had less than

565
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:37,269
a gram because honestly had been

566
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:38,500
consuming it was probably three-quarters

567
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,750
maybe a half no and this dude by the

568
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:42,730
time he got to Texas so yeah they've

569
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,190
charged him with that full weight of

570
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:47,200
that container there was a case that I'm

571
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:51,039
pretty sure I mentioned it on the on the

572
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,860
show at the time where a dude I bought

573
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:58,240
two grams of shatter so just two grams

574
00:20:53,859 --> 00:21:00,219
of hash and baked each gram into a tray

575
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,250
of brownies so he had two trays of

576
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:06,339
brownies they weighed the tray that the

577
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,940
brownies were in and the brownies oh and

578
00:21:06,339 --> 00:21:13,990
then charged this kid in court as though

579
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:16,090
he had that way worth of heroin and so

580
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:19,029
this kid was looking at like forty years

581
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:21,189
in prison for making two trays of

582
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:24,430
brownies because he used hash to make

583
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:26,170
them and then they way everything is

584
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,640
they could have they could have charged

585
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,759
him with two grams of marijuana

586
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:32,410
concentrate right but under Texas law

587
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:33,430
they get to weigh the [ __ ] brownies

588
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:35,320
they get to weigh the container the

589
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:37,690
brownies are in and then they get to

590
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:40,519
call it heroin at your trial

591
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:46,369
you had a hard narcotic a Schedule one

592
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:49,009
narcotic miserable Utah

593
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:51,138
I hate on like a number of principles so

594
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:52,548
sorry if you your Utah lever notice I

595
00:21:51,138 --> 00:21:54,229
haven't thrown at any hatred for any

596
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:57,288
places trying to travel

597
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:00,009
Utah's marijuana laws have always been

598
00:21:57,288 --> 00:22:02,628
exceptionally harsh so is Oklahoma's I

599
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:05,450
remember Macaulay Culkin got lost

600
00:22:02,628 --> 00:22:07,038
killing Oklahoma with like a quarter and

601
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:09,950
they were talking about sin and Macaulay

602
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:13,579
Culkin to jail for like yes several

603
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:15,528
years ago they've got a nice medical

604
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:17,298
program going now on now Oklahoma is

605
00:22:15,528 --> 00:22:19,009
kind of like the new Colorado if you are

606
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:20,569
trying to start a cannabis business if

607
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:22,220
you're got something going on if you got

608
00:22:20,569 --> 00:22:24,108
commercial grow experience you're hot in

609
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,679
Oklahoma right now that is a slice to be

610
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:28,908
yet there are stories from I'm from I've

611
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,109
got some background in the music

612
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:31,489
industry I don't want to try to sound

613
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:32,778
like some [ __ ] music guru or

614
00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:35,058
something but I've done some stuff in

615
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:36,679
the music industry excuse that throat

616
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:38,599
stuff there I'll fix that I've done some

617
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:40,159
stuff in the music industry and when you

618
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:41,418
travel out of the states one of the

619
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,769
things that comes in this little

620
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:44,059
pamphlet that a lot of the record

621
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:46,519
companies and touring companies will

622
00:22:44,058 --> 00:22:48,918
give you says that they recommend you

623
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:51,169
buy new shoes and new clothing before

624
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:53,778
you travel to places like Dubai and

625
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:57,230
Egypt and like anywhere in Asia or the

626
00:22:53,778 --> 00:22:59,329
Middle East because they scan you and if

627
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:01,128
they find they say not to wear they say

628
00:22:59,329 --> 00:23:03,079
to go to the airport in one pair of

629
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:04,998
shoes and carry another pair of shoes in

630
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:06,589
the box and never wear them and ditch

631
00:23:04,999 --> 00:23:08,149
those before you get on the plane and

632
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:09,408
then put on your new or ditch the old

633
00:23:08,148 --> 00:23:11,388
ones as you get on the plane and put on

634
00:23:09,409 --> 00:23:12,710
your new shoes and fly in those and

635
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:14,538
travel into the country in your new

636
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,100
shoes because they'll scan your shoes

637
00:23:14,538 --> 00:23:18,798
and if you've got if you've walked

638
00:23:16,099 --> 00:23:20,449
through something with drugs on it they

639
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:23,480
will detect and I'm doing air quotes

640
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:26,179
there's there's at least one Asian

641
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,179
country where there regularly executing

642
00:23:26,179 --> 00:23:32,559
like beheading yeah like Kuwait well

643
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:36,288
they basically drug traffickers but it's

644
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:38,839
anybody caught with more than a tiny

645
00:23:36,288 --> 00:23:40,460
amount of drugs I'm they're doing the

646
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:42,709
same [ __ ] they used to do here where if

647
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,710
you go by a quarter ounce of weed if

648
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:48,169
your guy throws you two bags that are

649
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,700
three point five grams each you don't

650
00:23:48,169 --> 00:23:53,730
you didn't just buy a quarter

651
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:56,909
to law enforcement right you have 7

652
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:59,399

668
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,618
level of ignorance around cannabis and

669
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,210
why it's so effective on so many

670
00:24:31,618 --> 00:24:35,488
different things it's just astounding

671

684
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,778

685
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,799
give him some support so give him some

686
00:25:00,778 --> 00:25:03,118
clicks and follows let him know you

687
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:04,558
found him on the podcast you it always

688
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,608
it's nice to know where your clicks and

689
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,278
falls are coming from

690
00:25:05,608 --> 00:25:10,739
you haven't been inspired to write much

691
00:25:08,278 --> 00:25:11,970
lately hit me up send me some social

692
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:14,548
media love and maybe I'll get writing

693
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:17,669
again trigger him get him going I

694
00:25:14,548 --> 00:25:18,960
started to felt less like arguing and it

695
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,429
kind of felt like I was the dude

696
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,819
clubbing baby seals to death for a

697
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:26,129
minute the needed the average

698
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:28,349
intelligence on the Internet is not

699
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:30,480
impressive so when you go in if you've

700
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:33,778
done two minutes of research you already

701
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,329
look smarter than 99.9% percent of the

702
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:38,909
people in opposition of your idea and

703
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:40,470
it's mostly an echo chamber so if you go

704
00:25:38,909 --> 00:25:42,090
in and you break up the echo chamber you

705
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,528
already look like you're [ __ ] some

706
00:25:42,089 --> 00:25:48,480
sort of elite something already I it

707
00:25:45,528 --> 00:25:52,378
there's the anti pot rats [ __ ] bad at

708
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,538
everything and when I the first three

709
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:56,998
paragraphs my response are correcting

710
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:59,368
words they've used majorly incorrectly

711
00:25:56,999 --> 00:26:02,098
and it's like no you didn't mean school

712
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:04,379
bus dude you meant sneakers oh man well

713
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:05,909
there are only six states left so

714
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,010
it just feels like to watch him down

715
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,420
when you got to start off like that so I

716
00:26:08,009 --> 00:26:10,920
took a little break I've slowed down on

717
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,360
my social media and my social media

718
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,980
trolling and it does make a difference

719
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,039
in your life guys put down the computer

720
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:22,049

721
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,639

together in the front and I'm bad at
