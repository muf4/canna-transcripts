41
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:40,939
I used to go to the clinic in Denver and

42
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,919
they sold this Durbin poison wax and it

43
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:44,239
had the best I loved it but after you

44
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,919
would smoke if you put your teeth

45
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,300
together they would stick together a

46
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:56,779
little bit stick my teeth together and

47
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:59,570
pull apart it was almost like you took a

48
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:07,550
bite of a crown but for some reason I

49
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:08,840
loved the texture quitting let's see

67
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,460
like riding a bike or not I mean I would

68
00:04:00,259 --> 00:04:06,979
take like a couple days off I've got

69
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,420
these big humbly rookie hands and I

70
00:04:06,979 --> 00:04:11,090
can't so when you're blowing glass you

71
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:13,549
guys and I do not know very very little

72
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:15,259
about making glass but when you're

73
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:16,340
blowing glass you got to turn it you

74
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,599
have to turn your right hand in your

75
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,039
left hand at the same time and you got

76
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,030
to have the torch in the middle ish or

77
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,680
whatever section you're heating

78
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,209
and if one hand spins faster than the

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,579
other here [ __ ] starts twisting you and

80
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,169
if you one hand goes higher than the

81
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:30,109
other your piece starts bending and

82
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:32,330
there's a flame in front of you and it's

83
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,710
hot and your muscles start twitching

84
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:35,389
because you're doing the same thing so

85
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:39,049
it's kind of a pain in the ass but so

86
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:41,419

90
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,810
venture now one of the things that I

91
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,489
wrote down that I wanted to make sure we

92
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:55,550
cover is that you went from a basement

93
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,530
grow to a large facility in a very short

94
00:04:55,550 --> 00:05:00,139
time so how long you're from North

95
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:03,019
Carolina right yes did you grow ganja in

96
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:05,209
North Carolina I did I kind of like I

97
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:07,310
did it for a few years there not

98
00:05:05,209 --> 00:05:08,870
successfully for the first year dried in

99
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:12,019
Asheville and just failed miserably

100
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:14,449
gotten into flour and then like sprayed

101
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:16,129
cal-mag on the plants as a foliar one

102
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:17,269
day and like totally like just I don't

103
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:19,370
really don't know what I was thinking it

104
00:05:17,269 --> 00:05:22,459
was one of those just had no nobody to

105
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,449
ask no nothing to do and thought that

106
00:05:22,459 --> 00:05:25,819
was hell I don't know

107
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,860
so healed those plans you learned yeah

108
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:31,129
exactly and then when I lived in

109
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:32,480
Charlotte I had an apartment and I got a

110

166
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:47,559
change shine at the JB I took go see the

167
00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:49,208
leaves change colors out by toward the

168
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:51,189
castle and we went to the castle luckily

169
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:53,799

170
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,790
still raging yeah yeah a big big show

171
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,259
that's all the people that have to deal

172
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:57,458
with those fires I feel so bad for you

173
00:09:56,259 --> 00:09:59,318
my whole vibe does change but I thought

174
00:09:57,458 --> 00:10:01,299
about it but we went out there and there

175
00:09:59,318 --> 00:10:03,009
are so if you're paying attention there

176
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:04,659
are so many grows out

177
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:06,220
there there's a grow every five miles

178
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:07,750
off to the left to the right side of the

179
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,490
interstate some of them are super

180
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,090
high-tech and fancy some were a little

181
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,340
jank

182
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:15,820
but there are so many grows out there

183
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:18,190
from from Pueblo to all the way into

184
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,200
almost to the castle there's a grow on

185
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,580
highway 96 to the left or the right all

186
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,080

00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:40,140
and look at all of the grows on the left

195
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:44,229

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:45,850
it's amazing you'll enjoy all right so

197
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,420
one thing I want to talk about you

198
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,879
started off in a basement like a lot of

199
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:53,349
things do graduated do a basement I've

200
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:56,879
seen your pictures you crush it you grew

201
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:56,879
some Kalonji cush that was gorgeous

202
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:07,659
love that

203
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:08,710
- my favorite strains put together let's

204
00:11:07,659 --> 00:11:11,439
talk about some of the stuff that you

205
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,810
learned that is different that you had

206
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,270
adjust major differences you've noticed

207
00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:18,339
and learned going from like a small grow

208
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,779
in your basement to this big gigantic

209
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:23,110
you said you had a greenhouse do you

210
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,399
know how many square feet not ask couple

211
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,370
people no one seems to know for sure

212
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,529
what it is but we have we have two

213
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:32,470
flower rooms and in each flower room

214
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,139
there is 640 plants and 20 gallons and

215
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:36,490
or raised bed we got raised beds and a

216
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:43,569
couple raised beds if you prefer the

217
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:46,509
raised beds seems to be okay what's

218
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,760
better about them it's just with the way

219
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:50,529
we do them our raised beds are fed

220
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:52,450
differently than we do our 20s our 20s

221
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:55,389
they get we actually get the invest

222
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,770
compost teas okay we use those and we

223
00:11:55,389 --> 00:11:58,360
brew those but for the raised bed it's

224
00:11:56,769 --> 00:11:59,799
been no-till and it's been going no-till

225
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,930
we haven't added any soil to it other

226
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:03,609
than what goes in with the transplants

227
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:06,069
it's been like that since the opening of

228
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:07,659
the greenhouse I think two years ago Wow

229
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:09,490
and it's full of life because we're all

230
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:10,779
organic it's full of life full of

231
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,810
microbes and it's just it's just really

232
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:15,159
cool the plants seem they get they look

233
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:15,449
bigger in the raised bed - they've got

234
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,759
more

235
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:19,379
space for the roots to get out and the

236
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:20,759
flowers just always seem to be a little

237
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:21,929
bit better out of the race bed Wow

238
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,330
that's what we're trying to transition

239
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:26,399
into complete all raised beds okay

240
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,960
keeping that life going and then we'll

241
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,909
talk more about that when we get to the

242
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,320
next part here so let's talk more about

243
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:32,699
some of the stuff that you had to change

244
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,890
and that you've noticed going to the big

245
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:36,509
grow yeah it's pretty crazy like you

246
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:38,399
know I the biggest I've ever had at my

247
00:12:36,509 --> 00:12:44,730
house was a 4k in the basement and now

248
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:46,409
we've got we have 112 kavita's in each

249
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,060
room so we've got 224 lights so I'm

250
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:50,759
going from four lights to 220 for now

251
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,379
and just getting used to the size of the

252
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:53,639
plans and how often I got a water room

253
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,789
and how much I got a water I'm really

254
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,850
changed it's just it was just basically

255
00:12:56,789 --> 00:13:01,620
it put into perspective how how little I

256
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,149
actually was doing at my house right but

257
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,409
it made my growing at home a lot easier

258
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:08,639
to be honest oh yeah I feel the same

259
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:10,019
exactly it's like wow I used to think

260
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:18,169
that watering these twenty plants was

261
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:20,789
hard but now I'm wondering every day

262
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:23,309
checking for bugs making sure there's no

263
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:26,189
problems but in supporting sticks

264
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:27,239
everywhere you need a city it's an M IDI

265
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:29,310
grow so you gotta make sure that

266
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,840
everything is tagged properly yeah that

267
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:33,239
was one thing that was really crazy was

268
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,129
going and getting because I had never

269
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,990
done anything other than a basement grow

270
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:39,600
until I got here like I never worked in

271
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:40,950
any dispensary I've never been in the

272
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,529
industry ever I got my badge and started

273
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:45,110
working there and so that was one thing

274
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:47,789
that was crazy was seeing like how

275
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:50,370
heavily like it's like everything has to

276
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:52,439
be tagged react you get rid of it you

277
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:53,639
have to make sure that you like get rid

278
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,650
of it in the computer and throw it in

279
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:58,139
the right basket and incinerate the

280
00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:00,539
basket and like it that thing that was

281
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:02,460
really that was crazy to be yeah it's

282
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:04,860
still crazy it's overkill but I like I

283
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:06,930
like the overkill kind of music to it

284
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:08,789
keeps the I feel like it keeps everybody

285
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,889
in check and it keeps the people that

286
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:12,659
shouldn't be shouldn't be doing it it

287
00:14:10,889 --> 00:14:14,610
keeps them kind of at bay it creates a

288
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,929
standard exactly and if you can live up

289
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,909
to that standard then you shouldn't be

290
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:20,219
growing this product this is a medical

291
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:21,480
product it is it's also a recreational

292
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,519
product for a lot of people but I think

293
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,060
that recreational use is also medical

294
00:14:23,519 --> 00:15:01,799
for sure that makes sense

295
00:14:26,059 --> 00:15:04,979
it's my recreational yeah it's six of us

296
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:07,169
manage that and so you know we have our

297
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,029
spray days on Wednesday and Saturday and

298
00:15:07,169 --> 00:15:10,740
we've got I think I sent you that

299
00:15:09,029 --> 00:15:14,429
sprayer we had that one time you saw

300
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,049
that yeah huge and so we just have

301
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:18,509
everybody kind of rotates how we we

302
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:21,269
spray but we spray every week two days a

303
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:23,039
week all the way through up until like

304
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:25,379
the last week but we are like I said all

305
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,139
organic we're spraying 100% organic neem

306
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:30,750
oil and 100 organic essentials no no

307
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:32,340
chemicals or nothing all right well it's

308
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:34,500
a kind of transition to that part

309
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,850
because that's something that I've

310
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,519
definitely noticed since you started

311
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:40,320
working at this place your home grow has

312
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,990
completely switched to fully organic now

313
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,070
right was that inspired by this place it

314
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,049
was inspired by a few different things

315
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:47,160
to be honest I started working there

316
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:48,479
when I got the grow you know I was

317
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:49,500
watering my plants and so I needed

318
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,629
something to listen to and I started

319
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,830
listening to you old podcast episodes of

320
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,509
yours that I haven't listened to since I

321
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,290
lived in North Carolina so I figured you

322
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:56,879
know I've learned a couple new things

323
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,620
let me see if I can take anything new

324
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,500
from these and I was listening to the

325
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,889
episodes with Sean Sean Sean at the King

326
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,659
:

327
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:05,659
and yeah he really he was so passionate

328
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:17,730
[Music]

329
00:16:12,919 --> 00:16:19,079
rösti and he's super he was he was

330
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,330
throwing dropping knowledge on me every

331
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:23,490
day and going dad just like you know I

332
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,570
like I was gonna do I had my outdoor

333
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:27,120
going I was like I'm gonna do a raised

334
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:28,410
bed no-till organic outdoor for the

335
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,389
summer and see how much I like organic

336
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:31,829
and I might switch to it then I was like

337
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,840
you know why don't I just completely go

338
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,580
organic it's so much I feel like it's so

339
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,059
much I know it's better like I just you

340
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,379
know I know like it's it's just

341
00:16:37,058 --> 00:16:40,478
I don't know so I made the switch

342
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:43,389
completely and now that I've been doing

343
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:44,919
it I've had one fool complete like from

344
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:46,778
because I switch kind of halfway through

345
00:16:44,918 --> 00:16:48,188
a cycle you know what I'm not gonna use

346
00:16:46,778 --> 00:16:51,099
these bottles anymore I'm organic now

347
00:16:48,188 --> 00:16:53,228
nice and so I had plants and veg and

348
00:16:51,099 --> 00:16:54,579
then plants halfway through flower went

349
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:55,538
through that cycle of plants and becha

350
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:57,308
came through when I went through but I

351
00:16:55,538 --> 00:17:00,848
just now just like last week to go down

352
00:16:57,308 --> 00:17:03,308
my first from seed to harvest like 100

353
00:17:00,849 --> 00:17:11,048
fully organic sweet and it's by far the

354
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:12,970
best Congrats thank you are you going to

355
00:17:11,048 --> 00:17:22,298
eventually turn your home grow into

356
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:24,308
no-till that's what I want to do do you

357
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:26,199
want to teach my listeners just briefly

358
00:17:24,308 --> 00:17:27,189
a quick lesson on no tilt because I

359
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:33,730
don't think we've covered too much

360
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:35,558
no-till on the but it's basically

361
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:37,450
no-till soil is when you have a soil

362
00:17:35,558 --> 00:17:40,569
that you've amended yourself and you've

363
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:43,330
planted the plant in it and you just

364
00:17:40,569 --> 00:17:44,259
defeated top dressings and whatever to

365
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,668
use you want to do whatever you got to

366
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:47,399
do you've got worms in there you get a

367
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:49,840
lot of microbe life going in there and

368
00:17:47,398 --> 00:17:50,918
it's after three years I believe that

369
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,678
you've been running this way you never

370
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,419
you never actually like take the soil up

371
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,038
or put new soil you reuse the soil every

372
00:17:55,419 --> 00:17:59,169
time just taking the root ball out and

373
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:02,109
putting a new plan in we're using the

374
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:04,419
old dirt trying to just in no-till you

375
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:06,849
want to irritate the land as little as

376
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,320
possible okay and after three years it's

377
00:18:06,849 --> 00:18:11,019
basically self-sustaining all you need

378
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:12,548
to need to do is that water Wow yeah but

379
00:18:11,019 --> 00:18:13,808
with the no diligence you've got a lot

380
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:15,730
of microbe life living in there you've

381
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:16,898
got a lot of microorganisms breaking

382
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,868
everything down your plants are really

383
00:18:16,898 --> 00:18:22,148
really really gonna thrive in a well

384
00:18:19,868 --> 00:18:23,859
maintained no-till environment because

385
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:25,148
um you know you're not really feeding

386
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:27,278
your plants at that point you're feeding

387
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:29,498
these microorganisms that live in your

388
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:30,579
soil and then they're gonna absorb all

389
00:18:29,499 --> 00:18:32,618
these things that you're feeding them

390
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:33,999
release them back into the soil and

391
00:18:32,618 --> 00:18:36,368
that's what your plans are gonna uptake

392
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:37,629
and it's you know it's a cycle of life

393
00:18:36,368 --> 00:18:39,730
it's how things are meant to be and

394
00:18:37,628 --> 00:18:41,288
you're just carefully maintaining it

395
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,149
there and it allows the plant to eat

396
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:45,190
what it wants is exactly the ratios

397
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:46,268
you're not forced feeding it some bottle

398
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,690
you're not holding it down putting a

399
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:49,940
nipple on a bottle

400
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:53,450
and formula in its mouth beautiful yeah

401
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,308
okay and so how long does it take to can

402
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:56,990
I almost take if I grow a crop now

403
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:58,638
that's not know till they'll cause it's

404
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:59,929
not amended so I can't do it never mind

405
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,519
I think I know the answer I was gonna

406
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:03,559
ask if I could take a plant that I'm

407
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,960
gonna harvest tomorrow chop the plant

408
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:08,119
pull the root ball out can I now start

409
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,788
my no-till process with that soil or do

410
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:12,378
I need to pre prep my pot beginning you

411
00:19:10,788 --> 00:19:14,720
probably could you know I'm saying but

412
00:19:12,378 --> 00:19:16,638
it would probably be best to start it in

413
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,990
an amended soil okay because you so that

414
00:19:16,638 --> 00:19:20,000
way you know you've already got your

415
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,349
soil is already inoculated you've got

416
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,788
life all the way from the top to the

417
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:24,079
bottom because if you're just throwing a

418
00:19:22,788 --> 00:19:26,298
new plan in there at that point you're

419
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,648
kind of just it's gonna be it's gonna

420
00:19:26,298 --> 00:19:28,908
take a couple weeks for it to take off

421
00:19:27,648 --> 00:19:31,939
really because it's not gonna have any

422
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:33,320
the there's no there's no life in there

423
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:42,710
to give it right food's gonna fire

424
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:45,200
exacts gotta get going okay sounds like

425
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:46,669
a great method to Lindsay the traveling

426
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,778
stoner she just called while returning

427
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,250
to a podcast Lindsay I hope you're

428
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:59,648
listening I'll call you back after we

429
00:19:49,250 --> 00:20:09,528
get done recording I'm excited about

430
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:11,778
it's called all right so where are we

431
00:20:09,528 --> 00:20:13,250
all my notes we got distracted here then

432
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:18,888
no till that sounds great I kind of want

433
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:20,058
to get into that school you learn it's

434
00:20:18,888 --> 00:20:21,918
fun I don't know it's really hard to

435
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:23,148
explain you just get a better feel more

436
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,799
like it sounds cheesy but you feel more

437
00:20:23,148 --> 00:20:26,569
in sync with your plans when you're like

438
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,269
right when you're controlling their

439
00:20:26,569 --> 00:20:30,918
environment that's sort of uh when Sean

440
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,240
was here often and we all got it when I

441
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,620
was being sponsored by the rocky

442
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,298
mountain worm company big shout out to

443
00:20:33,619 --> 00:20:36,888
Jay from the rocky mountain worm company

444
00:20:35,298 --> 00:20:38,569
they were sponsoring me and they were

445
00:20:36,888 --> 00:20:39,829
actually giving me all of the amendments

446
00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:42,589
that I needed to do everything

447
00:20:39,829 --> 00:20:44,778
organically I really loved my product

448
00:20:42,589 --> 00:20:46,369
and I loved if I felt like a farmer you

449
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:48,349
know it again exactly had warm [ __ ]

450
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:50,839
underneath my fingernails and I've

451
00:20:48,349 --> 00:20:52,219
smelled like fish fish emulsion and I

452
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:54,138
was just funky you know what I mean

453
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,839
Realty brewing in my house right now I'm

454
00:20:54,138 --> 00:21:00,879
gonna walk in the door

455
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:02,319
just smelling in and you've got the five

456
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,230
gallon bucket of tea brewing and there's

457
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:10,720
foam three but I also I ran a drain and

458
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,269
healthy we did nutrients that came out

459
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,890
of big five gallon jugs into I put them

460
00:21:13,269 --> 00:21:16,538
into basically a beaker and then put

461
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,970
those into a reservoir and mixed it

462
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:21,190
adjust in the pH and I did it with like

463
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:25,690
goggles on and gloves and it felt very

464
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:28,960
scientifically like that is welcome at

465
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:30,610
home I'm running I like botanic air

466
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,890
bottles it's simple for what I do I

467
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:34,750
breed and so I don't need to do a lot of

468
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:37,149
crazy [ __ ] for what I'm breeding with

469
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:39,278
and the botanic air is perfect it's I

470
00:21:37,148 --> 00:21:42,359
like mixing the bottles a little bit I

471
00:21:39,278 --> 00:21:46,720
put some worm castings in there there's

472
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:50,319
a little bottles to be the easiest way

473
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,480
for me I did a bunch of veg bloom I've

474
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,490
got vegetable it'll probably go in the

475
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,720
next cycle I've actually noticed I

476
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:57,429
wanted to save this for a whole episode

477
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,339
I've noticed it will do an episode about

478
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:03,130
this certain strains actually prefer

479
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:05,168
certain nutrients I've noticed that if I

480
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:07,210
cuz I've ran I've been doing this for a

481
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:08,830
long time I've ran so many nutrient

482
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:10,778
lines and I've had flow for ten years

483
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,579
and I've noticed that if I run flow with

484
00:22:10,778 --> 00:22:13,929
this brand it backs this way if I run

485
00:22:12,579 --> 00:22:15,759
flow with this branded acts this way

486
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:18,610
different brands they've had the same

487
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,859
grow rooms set up for so long and yeah

488
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:22,509
change from different nutrients psycho

489
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:24,788
made everything real colorful and fluffy

490
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,200
but I hated the flavor advanced

491
00:22:24,788 --> 00:22:28,450
nutrients made everything taste exactly

492
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:30,788
the same but I got huge buds but

493
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,558
everything tasted exactly that was I

494
00:22:30,788 --> 00:22:34,269
think the advanced might have been one

495
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:41,619
of the first brands I tried to use nice

496
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:43,058
yeah started with Mills it was I mean it

497
00:22:41,619 --> 00:22:46,538
was cool you know I liked the results

498
00:22:43,058 --> 00:22:48,970
that I was getting but the organic is

499
00:22:46,538 --> 00:22:55,750
just it's like there's more fun to me

500
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:57,159
just I feel like I'm doing more I'm

501
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,319
gonna write no-till look I've grabbed

502
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,720
this

503
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:03,789
ever this is actually it looks like a

504
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:23,650
green colored pencil and it's actually a

505
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:25,149
glass I just grabbed this way frosty if

511
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,809
up on Instagram and we'll get you on the

512
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:36,339
podcast talk about no-till because I'm

513
00:23:34,809 --> 00:23:39,720
sure a lot of our listeners are like I

514
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:39,720
want to know the recipe for the soil

515
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:47,500
just got teased on too cool episode

516
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:51,549
gonna be coming up so there are worms in

517
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:55,200
there how large is your raised bed I'm

518
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:55,200
guessing three by three or four by four

519
00:24:01,049 --> 00:24:06,129
we have 40 plants okay there's a really

520
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:07,690
really really really I'm just gonna ask

521
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:19,090
how many worms are in there like how

522
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:26,920
many did you put in there that's I want

523
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:35,859
to see that gone - enough big outdoor

524
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:38,019
grows this you gotta label everything

525
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:40,059
everything's gonna be tagged by the meb

526
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,049
so I can't just grab a clone and drive

527
00:24:40,059 --> 00:24:42,490
over there and be like here's a clone

528
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:48,119
you guys now you have Capleton

529
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:52,180
good luck yeah bring you some over there

530
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:54,609
all right so what's next what's the next

531
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:57,460
evolution if you go all full no-till

532
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:59,379
then what's the next the next way to

533
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,180
improve your garden after that I mean

534
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,590
100 you know you do your thing you

535
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,330
figure out some good top dressed recipes

536
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:06,159
really just you cuz I mean by that point

537
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:07,720
you got a full-on no to like I mean

538
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,029
Mountain organics everybody on Instagram

539
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:11,190
really wants to see like some really I

540
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:12,359
mean this guy's where I

541
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,890
discovered no-till from a couple years

542
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,299
back before I even knew what no-till was

543
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,970
I was following this guy mountain

544
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,839
organics he's he's got the tech down

545
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:21,059
with the no-till

546
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,619
but um yeah once you've got it going for

547
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:24,269
like that many cycles you know you you

548
00:25:22,619 --> 00:25:26,549
know what it you know what you need and

549
00:25:24,269 --> 00:25:27,900
I really don't think there's much more

550
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:29,549
you can do other than just kind of like

551
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:35,820
seeing if anything new comes out you

552
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:36,149
know if I do a new style of you know

553
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:37,919
hunting

554
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,210
you said that you use easy cloners at

555
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:42,480
the big Grove and we were talking before

556
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:48,630
the show how do you do those organically

557
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:51,709
just curious its om our eyes or max okay

558
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,709
[Music]

559
00:25:53,180 --> 00:26:00,630
we just started using this uh inoculum

560
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:03,269
from mountain organics actually that is

561
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,230
supposed to be the truth so we'll see we

562
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:06,720
actually just sorted using that last

563
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:09,630
week so uh yeah

564
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,519
I was told that inside of the claw Dex

565
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:15,110
dipping gel that I use for Mike Lohner

566
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:18,809
that there is a clearing that there is a

567
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:20,789
chemical called purple lavender dye I

568
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:23,009
think is what it is lavender

569
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:24,389
I think it's purple lavender dye and a

570
00:26:23,009 --> 00:26:25,799
friend mine was like oh dude don't use

571
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,770
that chicks he saw it on my shelf and

572
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:30,180
he's actually I don't know his degree

573
00:26:28,769 --> 00:26:35,309
but he's got college degrees and when he

574
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:37,140
saw he's like no freaked out on me he

575
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,480
told me to get rid of that [ __ ] so you

576
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:41,820
guys do some research that purple velvet

577
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:43,319
die or purple crystalline velvet die or

578
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:45,539
something like that I don't recall

579
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:46,859
exactly but if you google clone x find

580
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,819
the ingredients that purple dye and

581
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:50,599
they're supposed to be really bad for

582
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:52,950
you also there's something in there that

583
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:54,359
it's really not good for you if you get

584
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:56,370
it on your hands and stuff it could

585
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,869
definitely cause you some problems so go

586
00:26:56,369 --> 00:26:58,949
do some research on clone X that's why I

587
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:00,629
was asking well how they do it

588
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,460
organically yeah we do most of our

589
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,570
wheelies the clone boxes those are like

590
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,860
we're trying to phase out of those so we

591
00:27:03,569 --> 00:27:08,279
just have two of those right now

592
00:27:04,859 --> 00:27:10,409
most of our clones go into little root

593
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:12,779
rights that we have packed into little

594
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,850
like one-by-one cubes with some pro mix

595
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:17,490
and then just a little like a solution

596
00:27:14,849 --> 00:27:22,049
of ro aloe and then some some humic

597
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:23,599
acids okay from bio AG and then we dip

598
00:27:22,049 --> 00:27:26,029
those in the aloe and just let those

599
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,389
the domes for two weeks they seem to

600
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:30,678
love hallo everybody's on the hello

601
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:32,650
liquid aloe or power we get just

602
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:34,759
straight raw cold-pressed aloe okay

603
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,429
cutting in that put it right into the

604
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:39,589
root riot and with if you're putting it

605
00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:41,179
in your water I mean you need this just

606
00:27:39,589 --> 00:27:43,129
a small finite amount of aloe goes a

607
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:44,480
long long way okay like for a whole 300

608
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:46,669
gallons when we're watering our plants

609
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,990
we use one ounce oh [ __ ] okay so just

610
00:27:46,669 --> 00:27:59,419
one ounce that's like a coffee cup

611
00:27:47,990 --> 00:28:00,798
basically okay nice a lot of people are

612
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:03,470
gonna be thinking where can I get some

613
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:06,730
powder - hallo that's not something if

614
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,730
you've got a recommendation go for it

615
00:28:16,089 --> 00:28:20,750
calm I recommend that everything you

616
00:28:18,619 --> 00:28:22,819
like don't know anything about organics

617
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,529

618

its but he's got everything you need on

619
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:27,408

like buying the supplies and then he

621
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:33,830
also has like directions on how to clone

622
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:35,000
veg flour different top dress regimens

623
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:36,980

need to go check that sounds like

628
00:28:41,058 --> 00:28:45,288
they've updated a whole bunch but you've

629
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:46,369
got all your powder dry organic

630
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:50,359
amendments and they'll ship them to you

631
00:28:46,369 --> 00:28:52,009
everywhere the great price is very

632
00:28:50,359 --> 00:28:53,149
affordable they're reasonable the more

633
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:54,890
you buy the cheaper it gets because

634
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:55,970
they're powdered in their bulk they

635
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:57,950
don't waste a lot of money on a lot of

636
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:59,210
packaging so they're actually gonna make

637
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:00,200
a little package up for you they're

638
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,640

641
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:06,860

642
00:29:06,109 --> 00:29:08,538
weird with my order

643
00:29:06,859 --> 00:29:10,158
I wondered like two things on the same

644
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:12,109
day and wanted to be in the same order

645
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,549
and I emailed him and like he personally

646
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:15,349
called me from like his cell phone and

647
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:17,000
got it worked out with me and got it all

648

650
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,309
to do that kind of stuff in the grow

651
00:29:21,169 --> 00:29:24,350
industry there are a lot of companies

652
00:29:22,308 --> 00:29:25,700
that if they make a mistake they go home

653
00:29:24,349 --> 00:29:27,689
we've got your money have a nice day

[Music]

00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,320
yeah Bry wrote down a whole bunch of

657
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:35,369
notes but you wrote down a bunch of

658
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,259
notes do I want to make sure that we

659
00:29:35,369 --> 00:29:46,019
cover anything that you wanted to talk

660
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:47,009
about shattered out frosty yeah frosty

661
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:48,150
is a good dude I don't see that dude

662
00:29:47,009 --> 00:29:49,230
often enough we have to make sure to

663
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,538
give that dude a huge shoutout we're

664
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:52,470
gonna get him on the show for a no till

665
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:58,200
frosty don't be nervous just come on the

666
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:59,669
show bro here is the vortex Brewers and

667
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,650
irrigation systems that I learned at

668
00:29:59,669 --> 00:30:04,110
work that sounds pretty cool if you're

669
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:07,110
into brewing teas compost seeds and

670
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:08,668
everything you know the more agitation

671
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:10,319
they get the better it sounds like they

672
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:11,429
brew faster and a little it's gonna be a

673
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:12,720
little stronger the microbes are gonna

674
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:16,110
be a little more active and that they

675
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,538
grew more irrigated I'm just using air

676
00:30:16,109 --> 00:30:20,548
stones works but the vortex is Brewer

677
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:22,140
it's kind of self-explanatory there's

678
00:30:20,548 --> 00:30:24,359
like you know it's a vortex that spins

679
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,070
inside there's three tubes and it spins

680
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:28,319
the water really felt like a vortex

681
00:30:26,069 --> 00:30:29,849
super fast super fast yeah and it'll get

682
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:31,200
I mean you'll get a tube ruin where

683
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:32,969
you'll have bubbles popping up within

684
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,409
minutes and it's not like there's no

685
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,350
extra yuca in there anything like that

686
00:30:34,409 --> 00:30:39,299
it's just wow it's just it gets so

687
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:41,639
quickly I've actually seen guys clean

688
00:30:39,298 --> 00:30:43,408
out their vortex Brewer and put bubble

689
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:54,179
bags in there and make hash in it that's

690
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:55,320
because it's been in the irrigation

691
00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:59,730
system what else we gonna talk about

692
00:30:55,319 --> 00:31:01,950
there I could never be on a run one in

693
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,669
my house because I mean I'm okay I have

694
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:08,250
like at most 40 plants inside but uh

695
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:09,480
it's really cool it's you know I I'm

696
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,619
sure most people know about with their

697
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,750
growers but for those of you that don't

698
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:15,329
it's a irrigation system is basically a

699
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,220
self watering system that you put put a

700
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:19,500
little emitter in each pot or down the

701
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,230
line of the raised bed and you turn on a

702
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,759
motor and it just sucks all the water on

703
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:25,650
the tank and gives each plant the exact

704
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,058
same amount of water it cuts the

705
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:29,909
watering time from like an hour and a

706
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:31,769
half to about 20 minutes right the time

707
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:34,200
it takes you to build that system saves

708
00:31:31,769 --> 00:31:35,279
you so my gosh I've been telling all of

709
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,350
the listeners that we're gonna talk

710
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,230
about building a watering system so you

711
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:42,269
just teased it again half way written

712
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,069
like a forget about half way written

713
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:44,410
it's kind of very specific it's for your

714
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,809
knee

715
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:48,340
it's guyline written so we'll put that

716
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:50,079
out pretty soon here I can record that

717
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,909
one like it'll take me less than an hour

718
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,139
so just sit down and do that one night

719
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,640
so guys that one's coming how to build

720
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:57,310
your own irrigation system or their

721
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,590
suite I think that if you've got eight

722
00:31:57,309 --> 00:32:01,210
plants or a hundred and eight plants or

723
00:31:59,589 --> 00:32:03,669
800 plants I think an irrigation system

724
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:10,150
could be very useful for you it

725
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:12,670
sometimes when I'm away see if they're

726
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,830
dry or when I had the larger grow I just

727
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:16,810
wanted I would go to Denver for shows

728
00:32:14,829 --> 00:32:20,799
and on the way back I would stop and

729
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:22,869
grow and check on the plan she can't go

730
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,490
wrong sometimes it will clog eventually

731
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:26,949
your your watering system is going to

732
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,539
clog but we'll talk about building one

733
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:49,120
of those it's very useful matter how

734
00:32:28,539 --> 00:32:51,250
many plants you're running five be as

735
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,469
big as me come on and then I put my

736
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:57,460
dreads in a giant bun and now I'm like

737
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:59,860
seven feet tall at that point it's fun

738
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:01,299
to grow room can't we're too baggy of

739
00:32:59,859 --> 00:33:07,259
clothes because I get hung up on

740
00:33:01,299 --> 00:33:07,259
everything a little bit sometimes

741
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:13,839
gigantic walk like yeah all right you

742
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:15,130

dad's off the email and Jesse was

903
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:31,260
telling me that he went to Oregon and he

904
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:33,809
was actually ballsy enough to take his

905
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:35,550
medicine on the plane with him a whole

906
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:39,409
bunch of it will tell everybody what you

907
00:47:35,550 --> 00:47:39,410
traveled on a plane with I took

908
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:45,000
ridiculous I took the library as water

909
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:48,059
hash frozen

910
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:53,010

911
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:55,139
turps and a couple of the doctor's

912
00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:56,819
orders vaping cartridges did you ever

913
00:47:55,139 --> 00:47:59,309
read within two rigs pretty much

914
00:47:56,818 --> 00:48:03,900
everything but a torch yeah I knew not

915
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:05,940
to that is very similar to a bomb it's

916
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:07,079
already a bomb essentially yes so they

917
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:09,539
don't they don't want that on the plane

918
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:13,530
so I took all that well the rigs were in

919
00:48:09,539 --> 00:48:17,068
a locked case so and I put the rigs in

920
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,869
my check-in baggage okay all the product

921
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:22,800
that I kept it on my purse or in my

922
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:26,309
carry-on it was back sealed and then in

923
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:28,640
a ziplock baggie and I took my med card

924
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:31,019
and a copy of my driver's license and

925
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:33,719
put it in there so it was the first

926
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:36,000
thing they would see they totally went

927
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:38,939
through my bag and it went through the

928
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,579
x-ray scanner and everything and I flew

974
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:50,880
out of our 16 strains so that we always

975
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:53,610
have extra on hand and to keep in track

976
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,110
with all of that also is a lot of work

977
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:57,090
then it's things that people don't think

978
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:59,220
about is trying to keep the variety

979
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:01,410
coming consistently because in a grow

980
00:50:59,219 --> 00:51:03,899
you're gonna want to put let's do this

981
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:05,460
whole row of Sour Diesel per se just

982
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,088
because you want that whole row but then

983
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:09,249
when it comes time to put it on

984
00:51:07,088 --> 00:51:10,778
shelf now you've got a whole bunch of

985
00:51:09,248 --> 00:51:12,879
Sour Diesel so if somebody comes to the

986
00:51:10,778 --> 00:51:14,289
dispensary to buy product I should turn

987
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,150
a Sour Diesel if that's all you're

988
00:51:14,289 --> 00:51:18,278
interested in and then see where a

989
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:20,739
wholesaler so that makes it even worse

990
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:22,838
so the dispensary buyer comes to us and

991
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:26,170
you know we got a whole bunch of Sour

992
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:27,909
Diesel even if it's Bom you know they're

993
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:29,710
probably just gonna go on

994
00:51:27,909 --> 00:51:33,699
so that's rain big reasons we have to

995
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:35,108
have 31 flavors yeah that's what keeps

996
00:51:33,699 --> 00:51:36,368
them coming back if you could probably

997
00:51:35,108 --> 00:51:38,259
if you could probably sell 10 pounds of

998
00:51:36,369 --> 00:51:39,489
that saundra diesel but if you had five

999
00:51:38,259 --> 00:51:41,380
other strains you could probably salt

1000
00:51:39,489 --> 00:51:43,539
seven pounds of each one of them just

1001
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,369
because of the variety yes a variety of

1002
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:47,079
this kink that's gonna people don't

1003
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:48,369
think about what it takes I've been

1004
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:49,989
talking a little bit about it on the

1005
00:51:48,369 --> 00:51:51,369
show about commercial growing people

1006
00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:52,568
don't think about what it takes it's

1007
00:51:51,369 --> 00:51:54,910
good to hear you come in and talk about

1008
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:56,170
just scheduling the Clones cuz it starts

1009
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:58,478
at the Clones you got a schedule two

1010
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:04,479
clones to know what your variety is

1011
00:51:58,478 --> 00:52:10,348
going to be in about 120 days it's more

1012
00:52:04,478 --> 00:52:10,348
like 94 for my situation but you know

1013
00:52:10,858 --> 00:52:14,920
planning preparation and then everything

1014
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,150
you do this is something that I got

1015
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:18,099
sidetracked on when I was talking with

1016
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:20,289
will everything you do has to be

1017
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:22,838
documented in metric pretty much of your

1018
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:39,519
scissors you have to open up a computer

1019
00:52:22,838 --> 00:52:40,900
and make a note somewhere in the wheels

1020
00:52:39,518 --> 00:52:58,568
and I pushed around to one of the

1021
00:52:40,900 --> 00:53:00,548
smaller areas if you cut off so there

1022
00:52:58,568 --> 00:53:01,838
are varying different different

1023
00:53:00,548 --> 00:53:03,998
compliance officers will tell you

1024
00:53:01,838 --> 00:53:05,949
different rules on this if you cut off

1025
00:53:03,998 --> 00:53:07,959
something on a plant it needs to be

1026
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:09,608
weighed and documented in metric you

1027
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,170
have to go to that plant tag number you

1028
00:53:09,608 --> 00:53:13,389
have to say I manicured

1029
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:15,519
point four grams off of plant number

1030
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:18,079
nine zero five five five and then you

1031
00:53:15,518 --> 00:53:20,000
have to show on camera that you destroy

1032
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,590
the part that was manicured off the

1033
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,739
plant it's but it's very tedious and

1034
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:26,870
metric very tedious alright so we talked

1035
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:28,099
about dabs on a plane Jessie I was

1036
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:31,429
taking shooter on a plane and he looks

1037
00:53:28,099 --> 00:53:33,230
like an ogre - and then we talk about

1038
00:53:31,429 --> 00:53:35,389
gross space let's talk about what we

1039
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,949
brought you here for the main topic the

1040
00:53:35,389 --> 00:53:38,389
G whoa when we talked on Facebook you're

1041
00:53:36,949 --> 00:53:40,099
like I want to talk about reminding

1042
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:42,769
people to clean up their gross space

1043
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:44,569
after the outdoor season for sure yeah

1044
00:53:42,769 --> 00:53:47,929
so what do you want to tell us about

1045
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:50,510
that that is a super good topic I mean

1046
00:53:47,929 --> 00:53:53,839
it depends on how you grow I guess but

1047
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:57,740
you know I'm an organic grower kind of

1048
00:53:53,840 --> 00:54:00,530
homestead style as a term a real farmer

1049
00:53:57,739 --> 00:54:03,309
yeah yes a term I've been using lately I

1050
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:05,360
picked it up from a person in Oregon so

1051
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:11,840
give that person a shout-out did you

1052
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:14,390
mention the podcast I'm not surprised

1053
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:16,640
hippie Mary she lived on the coast down

1054
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:21,500
the road from the place I was staying

1055
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:23,210
and it's normally not like me just go

1056
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:26,329
out and just randomly start talking to

1057
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:28,070
strangers but for some reason I there

1058
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,840
were some huge tomato plants every yard

1059
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:32,059
that kind of attracted me to her so

1060
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:34,039
ended up making a friend out there but

1061
00:54:32,059 --> 00:54:36,559
that's the true farmer in you yeah the

1062
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:37,940
tomato plants are done in Colorado

1063
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,130
they've been harvested and eaten by now

1064
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:46,730
and she had Tomatoes up there and Jesse

1065
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:49,760
was like oh no I told her how she grows

1066
00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:53,000
how I grew is she actually had a couple

1067
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,100
times out back too but uh I told her how

1068
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,420
I grew and she called me a homestead

1069
00:54:55,099 --> 00:55:04,369
farmer so a homestead grower so it feels

1070
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:07,280
good but my situation I've got living

1071
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:10,730
soil I've got a whole bunch of plant

1072
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:12,680
waste the leaves the stalks all that so

1073
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:14,570
I've taken all of that and ran it

1074
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:18,649
through a chipper into the compost pile

1075
00:55:14,570 --> 00:55:21,710
ok so by next you know summer that will

1076
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:23,090
be nice black compost and it'll have you

1077
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:25,550
know all the nutrients that were still

1078
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,088
in it and this is the this will be the

1079
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:29,489
third year we've done this

1080
00:55:27,088 --> 00:55:32,518
but it just all goes right back into the

1081
00:55:29,489 --> 00:55:36,028
system again that's awesome um so I I'm

1082
00:55:32,518 --> 00:55:38,459
old up my soil real good i watered it

1083
00:55:36,028 --> 00:55:41,869
down real good and I've got it covered

1084
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:45,259
with plastic to store it over the winter

1085
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:47,969
gonna make a nice mycelium layer happen

1086
00:55:45,259 --> 00:55:50,130
okay that's a good thing guys when you

1087
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:51,690
see a lot of people see that white fuzz

1088
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:53,039
they'll make recent bristle or there or

1089
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:54,539
they'll make some compost yeah and they

1090
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:56,039
see that white fuzz and they freak out

1091
00:55:54,539 --> 00:55:59,519
that's what you're working for that's

1092
00:55:56,039 --> 00:56:01,140
the goal that white fuzz is magic yes

1093
00:55:59,518 --> 00:56:06,778
sir that's what's gonna make all the

1094
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:11,449
[ __ ] happen yeah we got all that handled

1095
00:56:06,778 --> 00:56:11,449
the plastic is good for several things

1096
00:56:11,478 --> 00:56:17,399
it helps insulate the soil on really

1097
00:56:15,509 --> 00:56:19,009
cold days I mean on really cold days

1098
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:21,059
it's it's gonna get cold

1099
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:23,909
there's nothing you can do about that

1100
00:56:21,059 --> 00:56:26,579
but on days when it warms up and then it

1101
00:56:23,909 --> 00:56:29,460
cools off again it can the the warmer

1102
00:56:26,579 --> 00:56:32,130
the soil stays the more breakdown

1103
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:34,889
happens the more healthy 90 days alive

1104
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:38,039
yeah so it protects it from that it

1105
00:56:34,889 --> 00:56:40,259
protects it from getting blown away

1106
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:43,440
drying out and blowing you know all the

1107
00:56:40,259 --> 00:56:45,960
precious topsoil off and then also

1108
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,608
something I've noticed last year is it

1109
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:50,789
keeps the damn neighborhood cats from

1110
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:54,088
yeah neighborhood cats love to piss and

1111
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:56,278
do their thing in your in your nice

1112
00:56:54,088 --> 00:56:56,489
fresh garden soil so it keeps them away

1113
00:56:56,278 --> 00:56:59,338
too

1114
00:56:56,489 --> 00:57:01,949
perfect yes cats probably helps keeps

1115
00:56:59,338 --> 00:57:05,509
birds out it's possibly Oh birds

1116
00:57:01,949 --> 00:57:08,639
wouldn't be so bad but yeah yeah so you

1117
00:57:05,509 --> 00:57:11,039
can shoot in there oh yeah well that

1118
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:11,788
goes into the compost pile so it just

1119
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,219
all returns

1120
00:57:11,789 --> 00:57:15,479
back to the do you use a bow coffee

1121
00:57:14,219 --> 00:57:17,130
bucket at home yes

1122
00:57:15,478 --> 00:57:19,068
before that Bokashi bucket right into

1123
00:57:17,130 --> 00:57:21,690
there if you have another use for it um

1124
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:24,119
normally I put it in the compost pile

1125
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:27,599
or I'll just bury it directly in one of

1126
00:57:24,119 --> 00:57:29,729
the beds okay oh nice but here lately

1127
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:32,338
I'm gonna go ahead and compost it inside

1128
00:57:29,728 --> 00:57:35,058
after it's done in the bucket well put

1129
00:57:32,338 --> 00:57:36,549
it in a little miniature tumbler I made

1130
00:57:35,059 --> 00:57:38,769
and

1131
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:42,039
that'll be to redo earth make it less

1132
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:44,829
acidic and then I'm gonna feed it to my

1133

Bokashi bucket it's a drainage that they

1139
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:00,550
call it the leachate that's stinky foot

1140
00:57:59,139 --> 00:58:03,699
smell and juice that comes out of there

1141
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:06,039
if you have a clogged drain or that [ __ ]

1142
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:07,839
right down the drain like probably two

1143
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:09,610
ounces down a clogged drain it'll

1144
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:11,140
dissolve if you got like a hair clog or

1145
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:12,670
whatever is in there it'll I've got

1146
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:16,059
these dreadlocks down to my [ __ ]

1147
00:58:12,670 --> 00:58:17,019
knees the drain the shower just pour

1148
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,759
that in there it'll clean it right up

1149
00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:20,380
it'll stink you gotta pour it in there

1150
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,610
let it soak all through it give it like

1151
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,230
an hour and then just go run the hot

1152
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:27,000
water kind of push it down and get rid

1153
00:58:23,230 --> 00:58:30,639
of the smell yeah remember you told me

1154
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,639
[Music]

1155
00:58:33,219 --> 00:58:44,159
[Music]

1156
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:44,159
you're cloners I had a cloner itself

1157
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:51,550
totally scented

1158
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:55,300
another thing on that's on the bowl

1159
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:57,340
Kashi liquid that is basically I've been

1160
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:00,280
told this from two people but really

1161
00:58:57,340 --> 00:59:04,660
know their stuff that is basically em1

1162
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,970
yes so it's like great white shark just

1163
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:10,779
actually yeah I've been using em1

1164
00:59:06,969 --> 00:59:12,219
all summer and I I've been getting it

1165
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,920
from a friend I've been making it myself

1166
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:16,989
and I'm out so for the last couple weeks

1167
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,090
I've just been using tokachi bucket

1168
00:59:16,989 --> 00:59:25,239
juice when I normally would use the em1

1169
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:27,880
and I see no noticeable changes other

1170
00:59:25,239 --> 00:59:30,279
than the the rotting trash can be king

1171
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:33,309
foot smell there's such great stuff

1172
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:40,210
smells like a bar dumpster yeah it's a

1173
00:59:33,309 --> 00:59:41,920
bit that has food yeah so you're

1174
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,630
composting all of your stocks all of

1175
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:46,059
your big leaves aren't usable for any

1176
00:59:43,630 --> 00:59:47,900
product it's all going into the compost

1177
00:59:46,059 --> 00:59:49,818
pile the chicken shits in there

1178
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,680
ah hydrogen all your foodways that

1179
00:59:49,818 --> 00:59:53,088
you've been eating all the time goes

1180
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,129
into your Bo Kashi bucket so you're

1181
00:59:53,088 --> 00:59:57,170
making fertilizer out of that that gets

1182
00:59:55,130 --> 00:59:59,000
buried we've got our soil covered up

1183
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,829
look at the soil covered up you can

1184
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:04,010
actually breathe if you're you know I'm

1185
01:00:00,829 --> 01:00:06,170
not necessarily no-till wearing that so

1186
01:00:04,010 --> 01:00:08,270
you can go ahead and actually Rieman now

1187
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:11,150
and put all your amendments you would

1188
01:00:08,269 --> 01:00:12,949
put it in the spring and it just makes

1189
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:14,389
everything better how much of that old

1190
01:00:12,949 --> 01:00:15,980
root ball do I need to get out of there

1191
01:00:14,389 --> 01:00:18,500
before I do that I leave all over them

1192
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:20,389
you just chop the stick and then kind of

1193
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:23,150
dig another hole later yeah and yeah if

1194
01:00:20,389 --> 01:00:25,429
you keep the soil wet and active

1195
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:27,798
throughout the winter in the span the

1196
01:00:25,429 --> 01:00:29,389
early spring there will be no root ball

1197
01:00:27,798 --> 01:00:31,130
when you come back to it there's if you

1198
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:35,469
let it dry out and you don't cover it

1199
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,470
the root ball will still very much okay

1200
01:00:37,869 --> 01:00:44,858
okay all right so you can read now in

1201
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:46,880
the winter and that stuff will hopefully

1202
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:48,108
rebuttal colonize and keep producing

1203
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,099
itself right then you'll have even more

1204
01:00:48,108 --> 01:00:53,750
potent soil by the time okay so and then

1205
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:56,480
at that point the only things that would

1206
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:58,760
add in would just be like kelp and

1207
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:03,108
alfalfa things that are they're gonna

1208
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:06,349
break down all the way through to where

1209
01:01:03,108 --> 01:01:08,929
you know there's basically none left for

1210
01:01:06,349 --> 01:01:11,298
it so you know go ahead and really

1211
01:01:08,929 --> 01:01:14,328
stumbled all over that's early go ahead

1212
01:01:11,298 --> 01:01:17,358
when you plant go ahead and do like a

1213
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:19,460
micro eyes that inoculant and then add a

1214
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:21,230
little kelp and this is when you're

1215
01:01:19,460 --> 01:01:23,358
landing yeah I'll kind of little alfalfa

1216
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:26,240
to the soil I'm getting ready to roll so

1217
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,679
we can talk more about that later shoes

1218
01:01:26,239 --> 01:01:29,568
you know we're definitely gonna record a

1219
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,858
whole bunch of outdoor episodes for next

1220
01:01:29,568 --> 01:01:33,048
year so that we've got them prepared

1221
01:01:30,858 --> 01:01:35,179

1222
01:01:33,048 --> 01:01:37,068

everything you seem to get involved in

1237

into all these startups I know how to

1241
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:25,860

that's gonna happen there's an election

1264
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:26,759

1265
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:28,559
doesn't want medical cannabis or

1266
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:30,630
recreational cannabis at all that may

1267
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,150
might put a kibosh on some of our plans

1268
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,858
but more locally what jesse is talking

1269
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:36,930
about we have amendment 200 and

1270
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:40,079
amendment 300 here in Pueblo Colorado

1271
01:03:36,929 --> 01:03:42,299
if those pass the marijuana industry in

1272
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:46,108
Pueblo Colorado will be forced to shut

1273
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:48,630
down in 17 they get a full year D to

1274
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:51,090
keep going but after that it's over so

1275
01:03:48,630 --> 01:03:52,500
no new licenses he's gonna like these

1276
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:54,570
people even though they have a license

1277
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:58,440
they've never gone before so

1278
01:03:54,570 --> 01:04:01,650
and and it's kind of a change of

1279
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,150
location form too so they went under the

1280
01:04:01,650 --> 01:04:07,860
new proposal they wouldn't be able to

1281
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:08,940
let it happen yeah good luck yes it's

1282

days it's like 80 degrees in my house

1307
01:05:03,389 --> 01:05:07,170
because we expected winter to come I

1308
01:05:05,699 --> 01:05:08,549
covered up my swamp coolers so that it

1309
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:09,570
would because it was cold during the

1310
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:10,560
night there was coming in there and

1311
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:18,690
freezing me when I was trying to watch

1312

narcos know be more do a Cali cartel

1313
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:23,269

1314
01:05:26,929 --> 01:05:32,669
love anything drug smuggling culture I

1315
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:35,159
just eat it up I've read a few books

1316
01:05:32,670 --> 01:05:40,409
I've watched every documentary I mean

1317
01:05:35,159 --> 01:05:46,230
yeah the dude The Big Lebowski will be

1318
01:05:40,409 --> 01:05:48,500
that a chronic take your picture with

1319
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:48,500
them

1320
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:54,989
yeah yeah all right so let's get a

1321
01:05:54,088 --> 01:05:56,248
little bit back I don't think we

1322
01:05:54,989 --> 01:05:59,849
finished up talking about cleaning the

1323
01:05:56,248 --> 01:06:01,588
garden so we've got a top tray or kind

1324
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:04,048
of remanded for next year we filled it

1325
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:06,358
with some kelp and some alfalfa meal and

1326
01:06:04,048 --> 01:06:07,559
then when it comes time for season we're

1327
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:09,449
gonna dig a little hole and we're gonna

1328
01:06:07,559 --> 01:06:11,189
put some michael rises in there some

1329
01:06:09,449 --> 01:06:15,150
more kelp some more alfalfa maybe some

1330
01:06:11,188 --> 01:06:21,389
crab meal yeah maybe some castings okay

1331
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:23,880
or just worms themselves if you've got

1332
01:06:21,389 --> 01:06:30,118
the compost pile you know by all means

1333
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:32,068
use it up you're planning your plants

1334
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:34,140
submit all that compost that rich

1335
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:36,298
compost can feed those plants even if

1336
01:06:34,139 --> 01:06:37,828
you're sorry to cut you know don't fart

1337
01:06:36,298 --> 01:06:40,349
even if you're grown in pots you can

1338
01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:42,719
still utilize that that compost even if

1339
01:06:40,349 --> 01:06:46,859
you're using salt based chemical

1340
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:49,409
nutrients you can still utilize on

1341
01:06:46,858 --> 01:06:52,018
Instagram and social media and even the

1342
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:53,308
forums of people they're recycling soil

1343
01:06:52,018 --> 01:06:56,098
and running no-till and you're seeing

1344
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:58,739
them top dress and decorate their plants

1345
01:06:56,099 --> 01:07:00,809
to keep like layer in their tour they

1346
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:02,670
can keep the moisture in putting stuff

1347
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:04,739
like alfalfa sprouts and other sprouts

1348
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:06,479
on top of there and I'm loving the way

1349
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:08,369
that it looks in a nice indoor garden

1350
01:07:06,478 --> 01:07:10,948
with these there's other growth on top

1351
01:07:08,369 --> 01:07:16,289
of your play a little on top of your

1352
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:20,699
plant is dying and actually feeding your

1353
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:26,249
plant to learn and see happen it's like

1354
01:07:20,699 --> 01:07:29,900
a miniature environment no there'd be no

1355
01:07:26,248 --> 01:07:34,198
tool which is a permaculture value but

1356
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:36,989
permaculture is hard to wrangle into one

1357
01:07:34,199 --> 01:07:38,699
set you know one definition okay it's

1358
01:07:36,989 --> 01:07:44,219
just a way of looking at things

1359
01:07:38,699 --> 01:07:45,568
so today so now we're still at the end

1360
01:07:44,219 --> 01:07:46,528
of the season let's keep ourselves kind

1361
01:07:45,568 --> 01:07:47,728
of on track we're at the end of the

1362
01:07:46,528 --> 01:07:49,048
season we've cleaned up we've got our

1363
01:07:47,728 --> 01:07:50,759
compost pile everything's chipped up

1364
01:07:49,048 --> 01:07:52,349
everything's covered we put some stuff

1365
01:07:50,759 --> 01:07:54,858
where the old plants were now what

1366
01:07:52,349 --> 01:07:57,059
should we focus on other than that

1367
01:07:54,858 --> 01:07:59,849
cleaning up your trash

1368
01:07:57,059 --> 01:08:02,159
you know inevitable every grows got a

1369
01:07:59,849 --> 01:08:05,279
little bit you know whether it's beer

1370
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:07,920
bottles or you know old netting dr.

1371
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:09,570
pepper bottles yeah you know it's exact

1372
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,820
wrapper yeah get get all that [ __ ]

1373
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:15,180
cleaned up it looks bad

1374
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:17,069
get your cages put away if you use those

1375
01:08:15,179 --> 01:08:20,909
if you're netting or whatever get that

1376
01:08:17,069 --> 01:08:23,160
I'll put up any kind of shade cloth if

1377
01:08:20,909 --> 01:08:24,750
you want to reuse it next year you need

1378
01:08:23,159 --> 01:08:26,970
to store it away and get it out of the

1379
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:28,798
weather same with like your water

1380
01:08:26,970 --> 01:08:30,720
barrels your air pumps any kind of

1381
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:32,609
liquid nutrients you had outside you

1382
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:34,920
need to get all that inside and in a

1383
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:42,359
warm place you know and don't bring it

1384
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:44,069
inside to your grow area outside clean

1385
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:46,170
it if you can take some time and clean

1386
01:08:44,069 --> 01:08:48,359
it just polish it up if you had a fan or

1387
01:08:46,170 --> 01:08:50,640
something outside take it apart clean it

1388
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,529
please clean it with some h2o too

1389
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,910
or some of that I think it's the same

1390
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:56,089
thing but the thirty percent hydrogen

1391
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:57,389
peroxide clean it with some of that

1392
01:08:56,088 --> 01:09:01,140
gloves you guys

1393
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:05,819
or even like enzymes complete or higher

1394
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:07,680
or some of the cleaner stuff up be

1395
01:09:05,819 --> 01:09:10,080
creative you know use what's at your

1396
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:13,980
disposal dr. Bonner soap I mean so that

1397
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:15,359
was like it's like some pine oil and

1398
01:09:13,979 --> 01:09:19,469
stuff or something like that in it would

1399
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:22,890
that's gonna kill anything so yeah I

1400
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:24,240
like the dr. Bronner's yeah wash my

1401
01:09:22,890 --> 01:09:25,680
dreads with it you can wash everything

1402
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:27,539
with it yeah it's perfect

1403
01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:28,798
alright so clean up get out there and

1404
01:09:27,539 --> 01:09:29,939
clean everything up take all the

1405
01:09:28,798 --> 01:09:32,159
equipment out of there make it look like

1406
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:36,960
there was never a grow there yeah okay

1407
01:09:32,159 --> 01:09:38,699
if you're if you grow in pots and you

1408
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,048
want to reuse all your soil even if

1409
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:42,239
you're not if you're growing pots and

1410
01:09:40,048 --> 01:09:45,000
you're not reusing your soil throw it

1411
01:09:42,239 --> 01:09:47,159
away like you know it's just if you had

1412
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,529
any issues they're still lingering there

1413
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:51,960
you know if you are going to reuse it

1414
01:09:49,529 --> 01:09:54,570
get it all in a pile get it wet cover it

1415
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:56,719
with plastic it's the same principle we

1416
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:58,579
were talking about with covering the

1417
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:02,270
with the raised beds and everything so

1418
01:09:58,579 --> 01:10:05,510
you know if we had some fungus gnats or

1419
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:06,890
powdery mildew is that going to be kind

1420
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:10,219
of destroyed in the composting process

1421
01:10:06,890 --> 01:10:12,650
or is that gonna compound fungus gnats

1422
01:10:10,219 --> 01:10:14,600
if you get it heated if you get the pile

1423
01:10:12,649 --> 01:10:17,779
heated up enough which means you've got

1424
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:19,820
to add a considerable amount of raw

1425
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:22,399
green material and just organic matter

1426
01:10:19,819 --> 01:10:24,159
to it for it to heat back up it will

1427
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:27,710
most definitely kill the fungus okay

1428
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:29,659
powdery mildew I have no idea okay so we

1429
01:10:27,710 --> 01:10:31,069
might we might be killing ourselves

1430
01:10:29,659 --> 01:10:33,079
trying to do both because I think if you

1431
01:10:31,069 --> 01:10:34,969
put the green in there PMO girl in the

1432
01:10:33,079 --> 01:10:38,960
green but I don't think the PM can grow

1433
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:48,489
on well I mean greener could even be

1434
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:48,489
like green manure it could be anything I

1435
01:10:49,539 --> 01:11:47,779
mean anything from the way I like to

1436
01:11:17,869 --> 01:11:49,219
grow no because there may be some you're

1437
01:11:47,779 --> 01:11:55,009
probably gonna get 12 you collect it I

1438
01:11:49,219 --> 01:11:56,840
don't it stinks okay put in some bottles

1439
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:59,630
and ship the first tester batches to

1440
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:01,329
Jesse love to try it rinse all the salt

1441
01:11:59,630 --> 01:12:08,539
off first place

1442
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:12,559
please just see the plants just rinse

1443
01:12:08,539 --> 01:12:14,810
the kelp we are way off topic but we are

1444
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,490
still on topic it's amazing how we do it

1445
01:12:14,810 --> 01:12:18,230
clean this is something I deal with

1446
01:12:16,489 --> 01:12:19,309
every year and I [ __ ] did it this

1447
01:12:18,229 --> 01:12:22,159
year

1448
01:12:19,310 --> 01:12:25,039
clean out your your outdoor spray

1449
01:12:22,159 --> 01:12:26,569
bottles because like mine have teas go

1450
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,909
through it which has a lot of molasses

1451
01:12:26,569 --> 01:12:30,710
and they always clog up oh yeah and then

1452
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:32,090
in the spring I'm just like [ __ ] and

1453
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:35,239
end up throwing it away and go and get

1454
01:12:32,090 --> 01:12:37,250
in the new one you guys know I cleaned

1455
01:12:35,239 --> 01:12:39,559
them all out with super hot water this

1456
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:41,210
year I'm good to go for next year you

1457
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,680
guys by the pump sprayers that have the

1458
01:12:41,210 --> 01:12:45,560
nozzle on it where you can release the

1459
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:46,880
pressure you want to be able to release

1460
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,440
that pressure because otherwise you'll

1461
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,630
pump it up real hard and the [ __ ]

1462
01:12:48,439 --> 01:12:54,979
nozzle get stuck you'll never get it off

1463
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:55,909
of there now you can't refill it and pop

1464
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:57,319
it open with something you're gonna

1465
01:12:55,909 --> 01:12:59,689
break it some of the plastic somewhere

1466
01:12:57,319 --> 01:13:01,009
will spin or trust me get there with the

1467
01:12:59,689 --> 01:13:02,960
kind the type that happens that pressure

1468
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:04,220
release valve so you can well once it's

1469
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,869
pumped up and pressurized you can take

1470
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:12,940
that pressure off it's really scary

1471
01:13:05,869 --> 01:13:16,079
trying to undo it spray up in your face

1472
01:13:12,939 --> 01:13:16,079
[Music]

1473
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:29,470
tank that was back before anyone well

1474
01:13:27,260 --> 01:13:34,460
lots of people knew better but we didn't

1475
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:36,110
before we knew something if you get a

1476
01:13:34,460 --> 01:13:37,880
brand new Cologne and it came from

1477
01:13:36,109 --> 01:13:41,659
somebody and you really really want it

1478
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:44,300
but it might have something to take

1479
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:45,680
clothes from that smoke in the floor I

1480
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,720
might add one at least try to get a

1481
01:13:45,680 --> 01:13:50,630
generation from there all right so we've

1482
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:52,250
cleaned up everything we've got we want

1483
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:53,300
to cover up the holes for the area for

1484
01:13:52,250 --> 01:13:57,409
next year do you just want to leave it

1485
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:58,760
exposed so that all the stuff can

1486
01:13:57,409 --> 01:14:00,380
process in there get some heat in there

1487
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,239
you got your compost pile going

1488
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:03,560
I got everything cleaned up it doesn't

1489
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:05,389
even look like a girl happened in that

1490
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:07,490
yard or that field anymore right yeah

1491
01:14:05,390 --> 01:14:09,619
just make it look nice and good yeah and

1492
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:11,269
it's all it's a clean slate for you to

1493
01:14:09,619 --> 01:14:12,590
go back next year and then as soon as

1494
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:14,450
the snow melts and you're thinking about

1495
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:16,100
growing the next thing to do is

1496
01:14:14,449 --> 01:14:18,829
there and fix all of the holes in your

1497
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:20,600
fences and go check that make sure that

1498
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:23,090
that thing is super secure go pick up

1499
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,260
all of the [ __ ] I'm sure your dog or

1500
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:30,560
one of your buddies dogs been out there

1501
01:14:24,260 --> 01:14:33,170
drop in deuces as soon as it gets warm

1502
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,150
that's the stuff you got to do then uh I

1503
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:38,029
mean to pick depending on how serious

1504
01:14:35,149 --> 01:14:40,069
you get I actually I know of a couple

1505
01:14:38,029 --> 01:14:43,609
people that are already growing their

1506
01:14:40,069 --> 01:14:45,739
plants for next season but you know if

1507
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:49,159
you're a small you know twenty-five

1508
01:14:45,739 --> 01:14:52,159
thirty-five plant or less outdoor grow

1509
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:54,019
you can get away with you know you can

1510
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:56,329
start your plants in February probably

1511
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:57,890
if you're growing from seed and you want

1512
01:14:56,329 --> 01:15:00,019
to do a female selection I suggest

1513
01:14:57,890 --> 01:15:03,260
starting now but if you're grown from

1514
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:04,880
clones you know that'd be where you can

1515
01:15:03,260 --> 01:15:08,090
start you know start them up if you're

1516
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:10,069
going for trees so start about get huge

1517
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:12,020
you don't have inside don't let them get

1518
01:15:10,069 --> 01:15:13,670
root bound and I ever yeah

1519
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:15,260
cuz they will start to flower on you

1520
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:17,180
they will start flowering so bedroom

1521
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:19,100
inside get them big top them get them

1522
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:21,409
loved don't let them get root bound to

1523
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:23,539
the pest free don't run yeah keep them

1524
01:15:21,409 --> 01:15:25,970
pest free do not run them on a 24 hour

1525
01:15:23,539 --> 01:15:28,819
light unless you plan on putting them

1526
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:29,869
outside underneath the 24 hour like see

1527
01:15:28,819 --> 01:15:32,269
I would have never thought of that

1528
01:15:29,869 --> 01:15:34,880
yeah yeah I mean if you got a hoop house

1529
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:36,680
and you can run a little all it takes is

1530
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,060
like just a little fluorescent right if

1531
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:40,880
you can do that sure

1532
01:15:38,060 --> 01:15:43,420
go for 24 but in my experience running

1533
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:47,720
them 24 and then putting them outside

1534
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:49,550
under not 24 is it just it either stunts

1535
01:15:47,720 --> 01:15:52,820
them out sativas it'll throw them into

1536
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:55,730
bloom I mean in because it'll throw them

1537
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:58,009
into bloom you know so just and then

1538
01:15:55,729 --> 01:16:00,169
then you get two weeks of going into

1539
01:15:58,010 --> 01:16:01,730
bloom and then going back into veg and

1540
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:03,170
then edging and then going back into

1541
01:16:01,729 --> 01:16:05,239
flower and then you got plans to just

1542
01:16:03,170 --> 01:16:08,659
look like hell and they're mad very

1543
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:14,239
funky looking yeah and your trimmers

1544
01:16:08,659 --> 01:16:15,229
hate you maybe some seeds man is there

1545
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,849
anything else that we should mention

1546
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:18,589
when it comes to cleaning up your garden

1547
01:16:16,850 --> 01:16:22,010
at the end of the season to prepare for

1548
01:16:18,590 --> 01:16:24,529
the winter and the next year nothing

1549
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:25,748
major if you have locks on gates or

1550
01:16:24,529 --> 01:16:28,059
something like that

1551
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:30,550
put them inside unless they need to be

1552
01:16:28,059 --> 01:16:31,779
out there but it just keeps them from at

1553
01:16:30,550 --> 01:16:33,489
least around here keeps them from

1554
01:16:31,779 --> 01:16:36,939
getting arrested up and crap like that

1555
01:16:33,488 --> 01:16:38,468
so just a lot of the things I do is so

1556
01:16:36,939 --> 01:16:40,988
that I don't have to spend money on it

1557
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:43,448
the next year and so that my tools last

1558
01:16:40,988 --> 01:16:46,209
awesome or you know first several years

1559
01:16:43,448 --> 01:16:48,098
not just one season at a time so I think

1560
01:16:46,210 --> 01:16:49,748
a lot of that comes with age or getting

1561
01:16:48,099 --> 01:17:09,909
older for sure we're getting tired of

1562
01:16:49,748 --> 01:17:15,670
buying the same damn hammer this town

1563
01:17:09,908 --> 01:17:16,960
but the town north of us has the other

1564
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:18,849
drug we got the drug that makes you go

1565
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:26,769
real slow and sleepy and then up north

1566
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:29,349
they got the ones that are making a good

1567
01:17:26,769 --> 01:17:37,989

1790
01:33:13,930 --> 01:33:16,810
episode I listened to almost every

1791
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:19,810
episode as soon as it comes out that's

1792
01:33:16,810 --> 01:33:20,980
probably my favorite podcast followed by

1793
01:33:19,810 --> 01:33:24,160
the Church of what's happening now with

1794

01:33:33,850 --> 01:33:36,970
lessons that are useful for you guys

1801
01:33:35,409 --> 01:33:39,220
that's why I like it when the listeners

1802
01:33:36,970 --> 01:33:41,560
send me emails I like treating content

1803
01:33:39,220 --> 01:33:43,449
that is generated from questions from

1804
01:33:41,560 --> 01:33:44,830
listeners so I'm glad you appreciate the

1805
01:33:43,449 --> 01:33:46,840

1806
01:33:44,829 --> 01:33:48,460

1807
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:49,539
read genetics forever that is awesome I

1808
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:51,609
hope you've got some

1809
01:33:49,539 --> 01:33:52,659
genetics in your garden if not we need

1810
01:33:51,609 --> 01:33:55,149
to figure out how to make that happen

1811
01:33:52,659 --> 01:33:56,409
for you you're drawing legally in SoCal

1812
01:33:55,149 --> 01:33:57,789
so that's rad

1813
01:33:56,409 --> 01:33:58,960
we definitely need to get some I read

1814
01:33:57,789 --> 01:34:00,220
genetics in your hands I want to know

1815
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:01,569
what you're growing out there I also

1816
01:34:00,220 --> 01:34:02,890
want to know what part of SoCal you're

1817
01:34:01,569 --> 01:34:05,289
in because that's where I'm from I

1818
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:06,820
actually grew up in Bellflower

1819
01:34:05,289 --> 01:34:08,260
California I went to Bellflower high

1820
01:34:06,819 --> 01:34:10,119
school for middle school and then I

1821
01:34:08,260 --> 01:34:13,000
moved to Colorado in the middle of ninth

1822
01:34:10,119 --> 01:34:14,590
grade so from SoCal also a lot of people

1823
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,550
call me out like what part of California

1824
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:17,560
you from only what are you even talking

1825
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:19,300
about they say that the clothes I wear

1826
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:20,830
and the way that I am they can tell I'm

1827
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:23,199
from California and call that a few

1828
01:34:20,829 --> 01:34:26,649
times so then you also say you want to

1829
01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:28,059
listen to the first 50 episodes most of

1830
01:34:26,649 --> 01:34:29,710
the feeds apparently don't have the

1831
01:34:28,060 --> 01:34:33,070
first 50 episodes cuz I'm all the way up

1832
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:34,779
to 160 this is gonna be 164 so it looks

1833
01:34:33,069 --> 01:34:36,340
like the last 64 episodes are getting

1834
01:34:34,779 --> 01:34:38,409
bumped out of the feed what I've been

1835
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:39,610
talking about doing is going and finding

1836
01:34:38,409 --> 01:34:41,590
those old episodes they're in my

1837
01:34:39,609 --> 01:34:43,119
computer they're on my my drive over

1838
01:34:41,590 --> 01:34:44,350
there I just need to plug that in and

1839
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:46,809
find the old episodes they're probably

1840
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:49,690
on my web server still I just repost

1841
01:34:46,810 --> 01:34:51,400
them and then I don't know if I want to

1842
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:52,839
like go back and edit them at all and be

1843
01:34:51,399 --> 01:34:54,159
like hey what's up this is a repost or

1844
01:34:52,840 --> 01:34:56,260
if I just want to repost it and put it

1845
01:34:54,159 --> 01:34:57,729
in the feed as a bonus episode but

1846
01:34:56,260 --> 01:35:00,400
that's probably the best way to do it if

1847
01:34:57,729 --> 01:35:01,719
you really want them super bad send me

1848
01:35:00,399 --> 01:35:03,670
an email if you guys are like dying to

1849
01:35:01,720 --> 01:35:05,110
hear the first 264 episodes or something

1850
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:06,850
send me an email maybe we can work out a

1851
01:35:05,109 --> 01:35:09,489
way where I can send you the files

1852
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:11,230
through we transfer Dropbox or something

1853
01:35:09,489 --> 01:35:12,699
we'll get it going but I may just throw

1854
01:35:11,229 --> 01:35:15,009
in the first episode the first 50

1855
01:35:12,699 --> 01:35:16,359
episodes back in the feed like every 5

1856
01:35:15,010 --> 01:35:17,440
or 6 episodes or something just put

1857
01:35:16,359 --> 01:35:18,880
another one in there so that you guys

1858
01:35:17,439 --> 01:35:21,009
can go listen to the old stuff and

1859
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:22,329
that'll also be a fun exercise and

1860
01:35:21,010 --> 01:35:23,320
seeing how much we've progressed cuz

1861
01:35:22,329 --> 01:35:25,779
you'll be able to spot the old episodes

1862
01:35:23,319 --> 01:35:28,329
right away so I may have to put the old

1863
01:35:25,779 --> 01:35:29,710
episodes back in the feed and maybe if

1864
01:35:28,329 --> 01:35:31,180
you send me an email and you ask really

1865
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:32,350
nicely for a few episodes they can't

1866
01:35:31,180 --> 01:35:33,909
send you all 50 at once that's gonna

1867
01:35:32,350 --> 01:35:35,829
blow up my computer but if you ask me

1868
01:35:33,909 --> 01:35:38,079
for a few episodes at a time maybe I can

1869
01:35:35,829 --> 01:35:39,670
send you it a few at a time maybe maybe

1870
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,960
we can make a list or something to

1871
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:43,029
people and then I could just dump all

1872
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,529
the episodes to a few people like five

1873
01:35:43,029 --> 01:35:46,059
at a time or something five a week

1874
01:35:44,529 --> 01:35:47,199
something like that I'd love to help you

1875
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:49,480
out though we'll get it going for you

1876
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:50,829
email me back if you want them as a file

1877
01:35:49,479 --> 01:35:52,269
anybody's listening if you want the

1878
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:53,319
first 50 we can figure something out

1879
01:35:52,270 --> 01:35:54,970
send me an email let me see how many

1880
01:35:53,319 --> 01:35:56,679
people are interested we'll figure

1881
01:35:54,970 --> 01:35:58,990
something out alright thanks for the

1882
01:35:56,680 --> 01:36:01,480
email I appreciate it let's get on to

1883
01:35:58,989 --> 01:36:02,889
the next email this one is from a very

1884
01:36:01,479 --> 01:36:03,339
frequent listener somebody that I

1885
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:05,349
interact

1886
01:36:03,340 --> 01:36:07,300
what's on Twitter somebody that's been a

1887
01:36:05,349 --> 01:36:09,159
longtime listener I truly appreciate you

1888
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:10,659
for hanging out so long with us

1889
01:36:09,158 --> 01:36:12,129
this one I could probably say your name

1890
01:36:10,658 --> 01:36:13,509
because you use your Instagram and

1891
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:17,500
Twitter handle this is our friend fast

1892
01:36:13,510 --> 01:36:19,630
very fast very says hello Jeff thanks

1893
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:21,550
for the podcast I enjoy hearing you're

1894
01:36:19,630 --> 01:36:23,829
curing episodes you're drying and curing

1895
01:36:21,550 --> 01:36:25,989
method is almost exactly the way I do it

1896
01:36:23,829 --> 01:36:27,698
so word nice it's good to know that

1897
01:36:25,988 --> 01:36:28,839
people out there are doing the things

1898
01:36:27,698 --> 01:36:30,729
that I'm doing it's good to know that

1899
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:32,380
other people have the same ideas that I

1900
01:36:30,729 --> 01:36:34,089
do working with the same methods little

1901
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:37,270
affirmations always a good good thing

1902
01:36:34,090 --> 01:36:38,829
you also say I would add that I trim dry

1903
01:36:37,270 --> 01:36:41,170
my plants on a piece of parchment paper

1904
01:36:38,829 --> 01:36:43,149
so I can collect the resin resin heads

1905
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:46,060
off that fall later when I clean up

1906
01:36:43,149 --> 01:36:47,888
that's a really good good idea you guys

1907
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:49,989
when you're about to trim your buds put

1908
01:36:47,889 --> 01:36:51,639
down what did he say that he added some

1909
01:36:49,988 --> 01:36:53,559
parchment paper put down a sheet of

1910
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:55,118
parchment paper over the table and then

1911
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:56,560
trim onto the parchment paper and then

1912
01:36:55,118 --> 01:36:58,210
when you're done you can clean up all

1913
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,010
the kief that came off of there you have

1914
01:36:58,210 --> 01:37:01,239
a bunch of resin heads on there and then

1915
01:37:00,010 --> 01:37:03,820
you can either put those in a bowl and

1916
01:37:01,238 --> 01:37:05,408
smoke them or if you're really into it

1917
01:37:03,819 --> 01:37:07,599
you can press them if you know how to

1918
01:37:05,408 --> 01:37:08,979
make rosin so that's something that's

1919
01:37:07,599 --> 01:37:11,170
useful that's a good idea thanks for the

1920
01:37:08,979 --> 01:37:13,718
heads up on that one fast Barry he also

1921
01:37:11,170 --> 01:37:17,050
continues he says I have a full-time job

1922
01:37:13,719 --> 01:37:19,050
so no time for excessive burping of jars

1923
01:37:17,050 --> 01:37:22,239
but I do put the lids on upside-down

1924
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:24,310
metal to glass and loosely screw on the

1925
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:25,868
cap so you guys instead of sealing the

1926
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:27,580
cap the normal way where it's got the

1927
01:37:25,868 --> 01:37:29,500
waxy seal against the glass and then you

1928
01:37:27,579 --> 01:37:31,630
put the lid on real tight he flips it

1929
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:34,329
upside down and puts the metal to glass

1930
01:37:31,630 --> 01:37:36,130
on there so it's not making a super

1931
01:37:34,329 --> 01:37:38,679
tight seal and then he only screws it on

1932
01:37:36,130 --> 01:37:40,659
medium tight apparently loosely screws

1933
01:37:38,679 --> 01:37:42,039
on the cap he says it allows some air

1934
01:37:40,658 --> 01:37:46,059
exchange but it prevents buds from

1935
01:37:42,039 --> 01:37:48,279
drying out I do that for 48 hours then I

1936
01:37:46,060 --> 01:37:51,340
start the 12-hour check burp and will

1937
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:52,779
repeat as needed then daily then weekly

1938
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:55,029
blah blah blah and he said you know you

1939
01:37:52,779 --> 01:37:57,969
just did the episode thanks fast Barry

1944
01:38:03,849 --> 01:38:07,329
the girl from your heart podcast shout

1945
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:08,590
out fast Barry it's good to know that

1946
01:38:07,329 --> 01:38:09,939
other people are doing that and you guys

1947
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:12,520
that's a great update and a great

1948
01:38:09,939 --> 01:38:14,348
addition to what I said if you have a

1949
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:16,179
full-time job if you are if you can't

1950
01:38:14,349 --> 01:38:16,489
dedicate 24 hours a day to your grow

1951
01:38:16,179 --> 01:38:17,840
which is

1952
01:38:16,488 --> 01:38:19,998
understandable I'm not calling you out

1953
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:22,069
most people have a normal job and they

1954
01:38:19,998 --> 01:38:23,929
grow in their spare time if this is you

1955
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:27,380
and you can't check those jars if you've

1956
01:38:23,929 --> 01:38:28,099
got to go to work I for a long time for

1957
01:38:27,380 --> 01:38:31,279
like a year

1958
01:38:28,099 --> 01:38:33,559
I lived 55 miles away from where I work

1959
01:38:31,279 --> 01:38:35,118
so take me one hour to get to work then

1960
01:38:33,559 --> 01:38:37,369
I would be at work for eight to twelve

1961
01:38:35,118 --> 01:38:39,259
hours maybe 14 hours on some days then

1962
01:38:37,368 --> 01:38:40,368
there's another drive home and then you

1963
01:38:39,260 --> 01:38:41,630
got to do whatever you do when you get

1964
01:38:40,368 --> 01:38:43,460
home you got to eat you got a poopy on a

1965
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:45,288
shower you got to put on clothes for the

1966
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,779
next day you got to get all that [ __ ]

1967
01:38:45,288 --> 01:38:50,479
going so of course it limited me to

1968
01:38:47,779 --> 01:38:52,189
maybe four or five hours of time that I

1969
01:38:50,479 --> 01:38:53,658
was able to work on my garden at home so

1970
01:38:52,189 --> 01:38:55,578
I totally understand that a lot of

1971
01:38:53,658 --> 01:38:57,649
people are in that situation you guys

1972
01:38:55,578 --> 01:38:59,479
can put your buds in these jars and you

1973
01:38:57,649 --> 01:39:00,948
can leave the lids on upside down and

1974
01:38:59,479 --> 01:39:02,658
loose and you'll get some airflow in

1975
01:39:00,948 --> 01:39:03,768
there and you'll still slowly dry the

1976
01:39:02,658 --> 01:39:06,698
buds because that's your main objective

1977
01:39:03,769 --> 01:39:09,889
is to slowly and evenly dry these buds

1978
01:39:06,698 --> 01:39:11,569
all right fast berry I appreciate the

1979
01:39:09,889 --> 01:39:13,670
email you guys keep the emails coming

1980
01:39:11,569 --> 01:39:16,009
that is super helpful I've got one more

1981
01:39:13,670 --> 01:39:18,679
email that is actually a correction I

1982
01:39:16,010 --> 01:39:21,769
said something in an episode about THCA

1983
01:39:18,679 --> 01:39:23,960
converting to THC but guess what I was

1984
01:39:21,769 --> 01:39:26,360
wrong I said that [ __ ] backwards so let

1985
01:39:23,960 --> 01:39:27,679
me read an email he says his name in the

1986
01:39:26,359 --> 01:39:29,899
email I'm gonna skip it he says hey

1987
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:31,309
brother my name is beep and I've been

1988
01:39:29,899 --> 01:39:33,049
listening to your podcast since I heard

1989
01:39:31,309 --> 01:39:35,179
an episode on talk radio early on

1990
01:39:33,050 --> 01:39:36,650
earlier on in the year big shout out to

1991
01:39:35,179 --> 01:39:38,599
our friends that took radio big shot at

1992
01:39:36,649 --> 01:39:41,179
the Citizen Jay of course you can listen

1993
01:39:38,599 --> 01:39:42,409
to our podcast Wednesday's should I

1994
01:39:41,179 --> 01:39:42,828
don't know the trek day Wednesdays at

1995
01:39:42,408 --> 01:39:44,149

1996

1997
01:39:44,149 --> 01:39:47,748
radio.com I will correct that by the end

2000
01:39:49,309 --> 01:39:52,639
lot of [ __ ] in my head right now

2001
01:39:50,590 --> 01:39:54,260
anyway he listened to me I took radio I

2002
01:39:52,639 --> 01:39:55,969
appreciate that he said I'm a huge fan

2003
01:39:54,260 --> 01:39:57,949
of the podcast your Dro techniques your

2004
01:39:55,969 --> 01:40:00,260
advice and your Irie Rasta way of life

2005
01:39:57,948 --> 01:40:01,908
I'm an aspiring cannabis enthusiast

2006
01:40:00,260 --> 01:40:03,769
myself and I'm working on getting my

2007
01:40:01,908 --> 01:40:06,078
foot in the door of the cannabis

2008
01:40:03,769 --> 01:40:07,639
industry here in Connecticut for the fat

2009
01:40:06,078 --> 01:40:09,439
past few years I've been learning as

2010
01:40:07,639 --> 01:40:10,909
much about cannabis as I can before I

2011
01:40:09,439 --> 01:40:13,578
enter either the medical or recreational

2012
01:40:10,908 --> 01:40:16,339
side of the industry when we establish a

2013
01:40:13,578 --> 01:40:18,018
rec side that is and I have to thank you

2014
01:40:16,340 --> 01:40:20,029
your friends and your podcast for

2015
01:40:18,019 --> 01:40:23,179
supplying me with a massive amount of

2016
01:40:20,029 --> 01:40:24,649
cannabis information and grow tips dude

2017
01:40:23,179 --> 01:40:26,149
that's a huge compliment I hope that our

2018
01:40:24,649 --> 01:40:27,920
podcast has put you on the right path

2019
01:40:26,149 --> 01:40:29,879
tour when you're able to get into a

2020
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,199
facility you could be a leader

2021
01:40:29,880 --> 01:40:34,650
maybe you could be one of the bosses the

2022
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:36,210
cultivation directors maybe since that's

2023
01:40:34,649 --> 01:40:37,559
new maybe you can just invent the phrase

2024
01:40:36,210 --> 01:40:39,000
you're like I'm cultivation director

2025
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:40,739
tell them so and do that so I hope we

2026
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:42,060
can get you your foot in the door when

2027
01:40:40,738 --> 01:40:44,250
the time comes

2028
01:40:42,060 --> 01:40:45,870
Connecticut huh I don't think I've ever

2029
01:40:44,250 --> 01:40:48,149
been to Connecticut I've been to a lot

2030
01:40:45,869 --> 01:40:50,510
of places and I cannot remember ever

2031
01:40:48,149 --> 01:40:53,369
going to Connecticut for any reason I

2032
01:40:50,510 --> 01:40:54,510
don't think no fish would be the only

2033
01:40:53,369 --> 01:40:56,429
thing that would take me that direction

2034
01:40:54,510 --> 01:40:58,440
I've never seen fish and Connecticut so

2035
01:40:56,429 --> 01:41:00,149
I remember that let's see I'm gonna

2036
01:40:58,439 --> 01:41:01,529
continue with the email he says on a

2037
01:41:00,149 --> 01:41:03,329
separate note and the episode you put

2038
01:41:01,529 --> 01:41:05,880
out this morning you asked to correct

2039
01:41:03,329 --> 01:41:09,210
you if you got the THC THC a conversion

2040
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:10,889
raw from what I remember the THC is what

2041
01:41:09,210 --> 01:41:13,010
the trichomes start off as and they

2042
01:41:10,889 --> 01:41:15,810
transform into THC when heating through

2043
01:41:13,010 --> 01:41:17,400
decarboxylation through curing most

2044
01:41:15,810 --> 01:41:19,949
likely increases the psychoactive

2045
01:41:17,399 --> 01:41:22,488
potency of the trichomes since THC D

2046
01:41:19,948 --> 01:41:27,119
carboxylates sorry I gotta spin the page

2047
01:41:22,488 --> 01:41:29,129
since TTT carboxylates where lie now in

2048
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:30,809
the form of water vapor let me know if

2049
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:33,239
that was the solid knowledge man I'm not

2050
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:35,730
a scientist I hope the rest of your day

2051
01:41:33,238 --> 01:41:37,769
is Irie brother take a phat dab and give

2052
01:41:35,729 --> 01:41:39,779
your mom a hug for me dude you are

2053
01:41:37,770 --> 01:41:41,639
totally correct what you said is

2054
01:41:39,779 --> 01:41:43,408
completely correct so thanks for the

2055
01:41:41,639 --> 01:41:45,060
correction yes don't be afraid to

2056
01:41:43,408 --> 01:41:46,619
correct me if I say something stupid on

2057
01:41:45,060 --> 01:41:49,409
the podcast if I say something wrong

2058
01:41:46,619 --> 01:41:50,789
please send me an email and let me know

2059
01:41:49,408 --> 01:41:52,019
that I don't [ __ ] up because it's the

2060
01:41:50,789 --> 01:41:53,300
only way that I can correct it and I

2061
01:41:52,020 --> 01:41:55,920
don't want to teach people the wrong way

2062
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:57,900
that's a big part of why I started this

2063
01:41:55,920 --> 01:41:59,550
podcast you guys I would be on the

2064
01:41:57,899 --> 01:42:00,809
forums I'd be on the internet I'd be in

2065
01:41:59,550 --> 01:42:02,070
facebook groups and then I would see

2066
01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:04,139
people give the shittiest

2067
01:42:02,069 --> 01:42:06,029
advice people would be like I'm in Week

2068
01:42:04,139 --> 01:42:07,230
five in Flour and I've got spider mites

2069
01:42:06,029 --> 01:42:09,719
what do I do and somebody to be like

2070
01:42:07,229 --> 01:42:12,000
going there and spray floral might just

2071
01:42:09,719 --> 01:42:13,198
cringe like I just now slapped myself in

2072
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,179
the face when I read that I was like oh

2073
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:18,149
yeah I just did the Macaulay Culkin like

2074
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:20,069
no so that's part of what inspired me to

2075
01:42:18,149 --> 01:42:22,379
do this podcast was not trying not to

2076
01:42:20,069 --> 01:42:24,988
pass along fake information and try to

2077
01:42:22,380 --> 01:42:27,690
give useful information from experience

2078
01:42:24,988 --> 01:42:30,059
because I'm kind of uh I'm kind of a

2079
01:42:27,689 --> 01:42:31,589
crazy grower if I have an idea and I

2080
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:33,120
think that something might improve my

2081
01:42:31,590 --> 01:42:35,010
crop the only way to find out if it's

2082
01:42:33,119 --> 01:42:36,479
gonna improve it is to do it and I

2083
01:42:35,010 --> 01:42:38,520
figure I've been growing long enough to

2084
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:39,569
where I've got a good foundation you

2085
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:41,429
know I'm saying I can skateboard I

2086
01:42:39,569 --> 01:42:42,559
cannot skateboard this is an analogy I

2087
01:42:41,429 --> 01:42:43,970
can skateboard real well

2088
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,320
time to hit the halfpipe so sometimes

2089
01:42:43,970 --> 01:42:47,240
I'll go in the grow room and do halfpipe

2090
01:42:45,319 --> 01:42:49,519
tricks I'll be like what if I just

2091
01:42:47,239 --> 01:42:51,229
totally do this and occasionally I [ __ ]

2092
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,170
up and kill plants you guys but that's

2093
01:42:51,229 --> 01:42:55,939
all part of learning and experimenting

2094
01:42:53,170 --> 01:42:57,500
I'm way sidetracked I'm Way off my topic

2095
01:42:55,939 --> 01:42:58,729
but if I do something wrong if I say

2096
01:42:57,500 --> 01:43:00,140
something wrong please do correct me

2097
01:42:58,729 --> 01:43:02,689
jesse corrected me a couple of times

2098
01:43:00,140 --> 01:43:04,820

emails the Facebook messages the

2112
01:43:26,539 --> 01:43:30,289
Instagram messages that I've got there

2113
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:31,820
are so many of them but I picked a few

2114
01:43:30,289 --> 01:43:34,250
for this episode I'll do a few more in

2115
01:43:31,819 --> 01:43:35,689
the next couple of episodes alright I

2116
01:43:34,250 --> 01:43:36,979
feel like I'm talking really fast you

2117
01:43:35,689 --> 01:43:38,960
guys I could probably use a drink of

2118
01:43:36,979 --> 01:43:40,789
water and of course I need a big fat dab

2119
01:43:38,960 --> 01:43:42,409
so I'm just gonna press pause I'm gonna

2120
01:43:40,789 --> 01:43:46,180
medicate myself I'm gonna hydrate myself

2121
01:43:42,409 --> 01:43:46,180
I'll be back in just a couple of seconds

2122
01:43:49,770 --> 01:43:53,850
cats world I am back I just took a

2123
01:43:51,869 --> 01:43:56,010
couple of fat dabs of some Jack flash

2124
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:58,740
shatter from our friends at TR

2125
01:43:56,010 --> 01:44:00,030
concentrates super shatter II it's kind

2126
01:43:58,739 --> 01:44:01,349
of like the I said this before on a

2127
01:44:00,029 --> 01:44:04,109
previous episode it's kind of like the

2128
01:44:01,350 --> 01:44:05,520
consistency of a Jolly Rancher if you

2129
01:44:04,109 --> 01:44:07,049
tried to break Jolly Ranchers with your

2130
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,890
fingers it would just go popping and

2131
01:44:07,050 --> 01:44:10,380
fly-in everywhere

2132
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:12,060
it's kind of that hard consistency that

2133
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:14,159
hard texture but it tastes really good

2134
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:15,840
and obviously it gets me really rambley

2135
01:44:14,159 --> 01:44:17,639
high because I've been freaking talking

2136
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:18,900
a million miles an hour in this episode

2137
01:44:17,640 --> 01:44:21,060
I want to thank you guys for listening

2138
01:44:18,899 --> 01:44:23,429
to my rambles so I promised you guys

2139
01:44:21,060 --> 01:44:24,750
some crow tips and grow tricks but

2140
01:44:23,430 --> 01:44:27,690
before I get that far I want to talk

2141
01:44:24,750 --> 01:44:29,189
about my most recent breeding project of

2142
01:44:27,689 --> 01:44:31,619
course if you listen to the podcast you

2143
01:44:29,189 --> 01:44:34,859
know I made some arise f2s I also

2144
01:44:31,619 --> 01:44:36,180
crossed a rise f12 Lemon skunk all of

2145
01:44:34,859 --> 01:44:38,069
those seeds have been harvested they've

2146
01:44:36,180 --> 01:44:40,770
all been dried out properly they're all

2147
01:44:38,069 --> 01:44:41,939
in jars our friend Jessie was given a

2148
01:44:40,770 --> 01:44:43,770
few of those last time he was here

2149
01:44:41,939 --> 01:44:45,839
barefoot grower was given a few of those

2150
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:48,180
when he was here for the podcast so some

2151
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:50,039
of those have gone out I'm working some

2152
01:44:48,180 --> 01:44:52,350
of the new seeds into my growth schedule

2153
01:44:50,039 --> 01:44:54,390
so that I can grow some of those really

2154
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:56,970
really want to know what the arize f2

2155
01:44:54,390 --> 01:44:59,070
does but I really want to know what that

2156
01:44:56,970 --> 01:45:00,780
arise - lemon skunk is gonna do for me

2157
01:44:59,069 --> 01:45:03,359
because everything I've crossed my lemon

2158
01:45:00,779 --> 01:45:06,359
skunk female everything has been amazing

2159
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:07,829
I also did arise to grateful dog I'm

2160
01:45:06,359 --> 01:45:09,779
super curious about that that one will

2161
01:45:07,829 --> 01:45:11,369
probably not be released for a while I

2162
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:12,840
wonder why I want to play with that one

2163
01:45:11,369 --> 01:45:14,130
for a little bit by myself and then I'll

2164
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:16,260
put it out in seed form I have to make

2165
01:45:14,130 --> 01:45:18,000
more of it I only have a small handful

2166
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:20,579
of seed that that one others I have a

2167
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,989
lot of seeds so they'll go out so my new

2168
01:45:20,579 --> 01:45:23,309
breeding project ladies and gentlemen

2169
01:45:21,989 --> 01:45:25,349
let me talk more about that I am using

2170
01:45:23,310 --> 01:45:27,630
the same arise male I've gotten a rise

2171
01:45:25,350 --> 01:45:29,070
male he is a stud if you follow me on

2172
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:31,409
instagram you've seen this dude on

2173
01:45:29,069 --> 01:45:32,969
instagram he grows for a male plant he

2174
01:45:31,409 --> 01:45:35,220
grows some of the biggest colas the

2175
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:37,680
biggest male flowers I've ever seen

2176
01:45:35,220 --> 01:45:40,320
he puts resin out he smells terrible

2177
01:45:37,680 --> 01:45:42,690
he's got this really funky stank to him

2178
01:45:40,319 --> 01:45:45,689
which is a good thing for a male a rise

2179
01:45:42,689 --> 01:45:48,059
is golden coat was the female and

2180
01:45:45,689 --> 01:45:48,659
Daybreaker from gage green genetics was

2181
01:45:48,060 --> 01:45:53,010
the male

2182
01:45:48,659 --> 01:45:55,260
Daybreaker is Kim D and Joseph og so

2183
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:57,420
those are the ones that the Joseph o G

2184
01:45:55,260 --> 01:45:59,460
chem D cross - golden goat which is

2185
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:02,310
Island sweet skunk Hawaiian sativa and

2186
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:04,529
Romulan so it's such a good combo

2187
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:06,780
but Rises a great strain I made I took

2188
01:46:04,529 --> 01:46:10,139
the mail and now the Mail's are in

2189
01:46:06,779 --> 01:46:11,699
flower this podcast will come out for

2190
01:46:10,140 --> 01:46:13,340
quite some time but the Mail's are now

2191
01:46:11,699 --> 01:46:16,889
in flower they went into flower

2192
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:19,380
yesterday and I've got two huts with

2193
01:46:16,890 --> 01:46:22,560
other plants in them two five by five

2194
01:46:19,380 --> 01:46:24,510
huts with two gallon pots the huts are

2195
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:26,070
crammed pretty tight there's two gallon

2196
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:27,350
pot stuff in those huts and there are

2197
01:46:26,069 --> 01:46:29,909
cookies and cream

2198
01:46:27,350 --> 01:46:31,590
females cookies and cream females white

2199
01:46:29,909 --> 01:46:33,859
widow females there's lemon skunk

2200
01:46:31,590 --> 01:46:36,869
females there's a lemon Jeffrey in there

2201
01:46:33,859 --> 01:46:37,889
there is there are a couple others in

2202
01:46:36,869 --> 01:46:39,479
there that I don't even need to mention

2203
01:46:37,890 --> 01:46:41,010
yet but we'll talk about those later in

2204
01:46:39,479 --> 01:46:42,139
the future those are probably going to

2205
01:46:41,010 --> 01:46:45,690
go into flour

2206
01:46:42,140 --> 01:46:47,010
maybe Monday but anyway pretty soon

2207
01:46:45,689 --> 01:46:48,299
those are gonna go into flour here I'm

2208
01:46:47,010 --> 01:46:50,340
letting I need the male to get ahead

2209
01:46:48,300 --> 01:46:51,659
just a little tiny bit but I don't want

2210
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:55,050
my girls to get too big and they're

2211
01:46:51,659 --> 01:46:55,920
starting to kind of get tall so just

2212
01:46:55,050 --> 01:46:57,989
right but I'm gonna keep the male

2213
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,789
separate I'm gonna let em flour out

2214
01:46:57,989 --> 01:47:01,139
other two male plants it's the same

2215
01:46:59,789 --> 01:47:03,210
stream but I just need enough pollen to

2216
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:05,970
do two huts so I've got two male plants

2217
01:47:03,210 --> 01:47:07,560
in there they're flowering but I keep

2218
01:47:05,970 --> 01:47:09,659
them separate to keep that pollen in

2219
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:11,460
there and then around day twenty five

2220
01:47:09,659 --> 01:47:14,099
ish depending on how the plants look I'm

2221
01:47:11,460 --> 01:47:16,020
gonna go and pollinate twenty-five of a

2222
01:47:14,100 --> 01:47:18,360
flower for the girls I'm gonna go in and

2223
01:47:16,020 --> 01:47:20,160
pollinate both of the 5x5 Hut's worth of

2224
01:47:18,359 --> 01:47:21,630
plants and then we'll make a bunch of

2225
01:47:20,159 --> 01:47:25,409
new crosses so that's what's going on my

2226
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:26,909
breeding projects some you guys really

2227
01:47:25,409 --> 01:47:28,559
care some of you guys probably don't

2228
01:47:26,909 --> 01:47:30,539
care at all so let's move on to some

2229
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:32,490
grow tips like I talked about you guys

2230
01:47:30,539 --> 01:47:36,390
I've been talking about growing in coco

2231
01:47:32,489 --> 01:47:39,059
coir a whole bunch several brands of

2232
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:39,600
coco with different nutrient feeds in

2233
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:43,320
Coco

2234
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:44,670
I do love Coco I love the Coco but one

2235
01:47:43,319 --> 01:47:46,619
thing that sucks is if you don't make

2236
01:47:44,670 --> 01:47:48,300
something in with it it kind of

2237
01:47:46,619 --> 01:47:50,039
compresses a little bit it kind of gets

2238
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:52,770
to be too much around your roots and I

2239
01:47:50,039 --> 01:47:54,960
feel like the plants that I did in all

2240
01:47:52,770 --> 01:47:57,570
Coco could have harvested better had I

2241
01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:59,100
mixed something into that soil I don't

2242
01:47:57,569 --> 01:48:01,380
like the Coco that I used I think the

2243
01:47:59,100 --> 01:48:03,060
plants probably could have been a little

2244
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:06,930
bit better so if you're gonna grow in

2245
01:48:03,060 --> 01:48:10,170
cocoa mix in maybe 50% soil or maybe mix

2246
01:48:06,930 --> 01:48:12,659
in a whole bunch of perlite because I've

2247
01:48:10,170 --> 01:48:14,190
used a couple brands of cocoa and some

2248
01:48:12,659 --> 01:48:15,590
of them compress a whole bunch some of

2249
01:48:14,189 --> 01:48:17,000
them don't

2250
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:18,469
it's hard to tell when they're in the

2251
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,939
bag and I'm not gonna call out brands

2252
01:48:18,469 --> 01:48:22,939
I've just learned that I want to mix my

2253
01:48:19,939 --> 01:48:25,308
cocoa with some soil and/or some perlite

2254
01:48:22,939 --> 01:48:27,408
so that's something I would recommend my

2255
01:48:25,309 --> 01:48:29,090
babies my clones hated going into cocoa

2256
01:48:27,408 --> 01:48:30,288
they just died they were like no [ __ ]

2257
01:48:29,090 --> 01:48:31,849
you that's too much pressure on the

2258
01:48:30,288 --> 01:48:35,328
roots there's no air in here I'm going

2259
01:48:31,849 --> 01:48:37,190
to die so I make some 5050 with soil and

2260
01:48:35,328 --> 01:48:39,380
threw it in there and they grew but they

2261
01:48:37,189 --> 01:48:42,558
weren't happy and then I put some just

2262
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:46,219
into street soil soilless mix that I

2263
01:48:42,559 --> 01:48:48,949
make for babies and those plants took

2264
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:51,078
off so start your babies in some soil

2265
01:48:48,948 --> 01:48:52,250
maybe unless you get them really going

2266
01:48:51,078 --> 01:48:53,689
unless you're coming from rock wool then

2267
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:55,189
it might work I'm coming out of an easy

2268
01:48:53,689 --> 01:48:58,399
corner of course this is what happened

2269
01:48:55,189 --> 01:49:00,799
from the easy cloner so I think soil or

2270
01:48:58,399 --> 01:49:02,779
a 50/50 mix is better than just

2271
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,070
straight-up cocoa so that's something I

2272
01:49:02,779 --> 01:49:06,710
wanted to mention to you guys through

2273
01:49:04,069 --> 01:49:08,509
experience let's see one of our friends

2274
01:49:06,710 --> 01:49:09,920
that listens to the podcast was posting

2275
01:49:08,510 --> 01:49:11,989
on Facebook that he's got a stream that

2276
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:14,300
takes a really long time to flower and

2277
01:49:11,988 --> 01:49:15,979
it's way laid into flour already and it

2278
01:49:14,300 --> 01:49:19,070
does not show any signs of slowing down

2279
01:49:15,979 --> 01:49:21,138
and being done and he was just asking

2280
01:49:19,069 --> 01:49:22,460
questions you want to know WTF said what

2281
01:49:21,139 --> 01:49:25,219
the [ __ ] is going on with this plant

2282
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:27,710
dude and so my guidance my advice was to

2283
01:49:25,219 --> 01:49:30,380
reduce the lights on that plant to speed

2284
01:49:27,710 --> 01:49:32,750
up the flowering cycle that plant is

2285
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:34,639
waiting for a signal to say hey are you

2286
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:36,198
done yet just waiting for something to

2287
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:38,868
hint at it that the season is over

2288
01:49:36,198 --> 01:49:40,279
wherever that plant it's hard to even

2289
01:49:38,868 --> 01:49:41,630
guess where that plant came from I don't

2290
01:49:40,279 --> 01:49:45,288
know what strain you're working with but

2291
01:49:41,630 --> 01:49:49,368
that plant comes from an area or the day

2292
01:49:45,288 --> 01:49:52,550
and night cycle between the winter and

2293
01:49:49,368 --> 01:49:55,788
summer seasons does not vary very much

2294
01:49:52,550 --> 01:49:57,469
so the what it takes to make those

2295
01:49:55,788 --> 01:49:59,300
plants flower they're very sensitive

2296
01:49:57,469 --> 01:50:00,800
they'll flower very easily sometimes

2297
01:49:59,300 --> 01:50:02,389
those plants those type of plants if

2298
01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:04,250
they get root bound they'll flower if

2299
01:50:02,389 --> 01:50:06,230
they get crowded they're not getting

2300
01:50:04,250 --> 01:50:07,969
enough light gentle flower so those

2301
01:50:06,229 --> 01:50:09,529
they're cool because they'll start

2302
01:50:07,969 --> 01:50:10,550
flowering very easily when you're ready

2303
01:50:09,529 --> 01:50:11,750
if you put them in the flower room

2304
01:50:10,550 --> 01:50:14,119
you'll notice sometimes those will show

2305
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:15,859
flower earliest but also they don't want

2306
01:50:14,118 --> 01:50:17,238
to finish so since the season doesn't

2307
01:50:15,859 --> 01:50:19,460
change let me get back on track here my

2308
01:50:17,238 --> 01:50:20,808
mind is racing today since the season

2309
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:22,189
doesn't change very much those plants

2310
01:50:20,809 --> 01:50:23,538
can pretty much just go on until they

2311
01:50:22,189 --> 01:50:25,578
wither up and die is what would happen

2312
01:50:23,538 --> 01:50:26,809
in nature and that's what they want to

2313
01:50:25,578 --> 01:50:28,158
do they're gonna keep going until they

2314
01:50:26,809 --> 01:50:29,300
receive pollen there's like hey

2315
01:50:28,158 --> 01:50:30,500
pollinate me pollinate

2316
01:50:29,300 --> 01:50:32,180
please please please and there's gonna

2317
01:50:30,500 --> 01:50:34,310
grow until they fry themselves out so

2318
01:50:32,180 --> 01:50:36,079
you've got to reduce the whites it give

2319
01:50:34,310 --> 01:50:38,240
them a hint that oh [ __ ] grow season's

2320
01:50:36,079 --> 01:50:39,409
over I better finish up and that's what

2321
01:50:38,239 --> 01:50:42,529
you got to do turn the life you're on

2322
01:50:39,409 --> 01:50:43,729
1212 turn the lights down to maybe just

2323
01:50:42,529 --> 01:50:47,329
give them ten hours of light a day

2324
01:50:43,729 --> 01:50:48,649
instead of twelve oh 1014 aye and just

2325
01:50:47,329 --> 01:50:50,119
do that for two weeks and I'm sure

2326
01:50:48,649 --> 01:50:52,009
they'll start finishing up they may be

2327
01:50:50,119 --> 01:50:53,689
finished up in two weeks from doing that

2328
01:50:52,010 --> 01:50:55,250
so maybe start flushing reduce the

2329
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:57,319
lights that's something that will

2330
01:50:55,250 --> 01:50:58,460
certainly help you with a strain that is

2331
01:50:57,319 --> 01:50:59,989
taking way too long

2332
01:50:58,460 --> 01:51:02,689
I had a Durbin poison strain that took

2333
01:50:59,989 --> 01:51:03,949
like 16 weeks to flower properly when I

2334
01:51:02,689 --> 01:51:04,369
started chopping down the lights a

2335
01:51:03,949 --> 01:51:06,289
little bit

2336
01:51:04,369 --> 01:51:08,989
it certainly sped up the time I cut off

2337
01:51:06,289 --> 01:51:11,359
two full weeks if I did it two weeks if

2338
01:51:08,989 --> 01:51:12,500
I timed it properly leg rope is a long

2339
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:14,210
time ago I don't even [ __ ] with that

2340
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:17,420
nervin poison anymore was kind of a mess

2341
01:51:14,210 --> 01:51:19,100
no need for that share my garden you may

2342
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:22,329
have a good urban poison cut no no

2343
01:51:19,100 --> 01:51:26,030
offense to yours but the one I had

2344
01:51:22,329 --> 01:51:27,829
alright so another thing everybody got

2345
01:51:26,029 --> 01:51:30,889
not everybody a lot of people got

2346
01:51:27,829 --> 01:51:31,930
powdery mildew last winter and the

2347
01:51:30,890 --> 01:51:33,980
winter is coming

2348
01:51:31,930 --> 01:51:35,450
and I don't want you to get powdery

2349
01:51:33,979 --> 01:51:37,359
mildew again so let's talk about some

2350
01:51:35,449 --> 01:51:40,069
ways that you can prevent powdery mildew

2351
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:41,329
that's going to it possibly happens

2352
01:51:40,069 --> 01:51:42,949
because it's winter time you guys when

2353
01:51:41,329 --> 01:51:44,809
it gets cold outside and it stays warm

2354
01:51:42,949 --> 01:51:46,340
inside so you're growing grown cannabis

2355
01:51:44,810 --> 01:51:48,320
indoors right a lot of you are in a

2356
01:51:46,340 --> 01:51:50,300
basement a lot of you are in a warehouse

2357
01:51:48,319 --> 01:51:51,679
you've probably got one concrete wall

2358
01:51:50,300 --> 01:51:53,869
somewhere that your plants are really

2359
01:51:51,680 --> 01:51:55,610
close to the outside of that wall is

2360
01:51:53,869 --> 01:51:58,609
going to get temperatures that are

2361
01:51:55,609 --> 01:52:00,349
really ridiculously low the opposite

2362
01:51:58,609 --> 01:52:02,659
side of that wall you got a beautiful

2363
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:04,460
grow environment so when that moisture

2364
01:52:02,659 --> 01:52:06,170
builds up on the outside makes that

2365
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:08,539
weird cold wall and then the heat hits

2366
01:52:06,170 --> 01:52:10,340
it a lot of a lot of grow rooms I see it

2367
01:52:08,539 --> 01:52:11,869
happen it's happened to me the first

2368
01:52:10,340 --> 01:52:13,430
time I moved into this one house that

2369
01:52:11,869 --> 01:52:15,140
I'm like drew in this one basement they

2370
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:16,310
had a concrete wall the plant we've

2371
01:52:15,140 --> 01:52:17,720
talked about it before that plant in

2372
01:52:16,310 --> 01:52:20,150
that corner where the concrete corner

2373
01:52:17,720 --> 01:52:22,310
was it got completely powdery mildew all

2374
01:52:20,149 --> 01:52:24,589
up that one side I was at another

2375
01:52:22,310 --> 01:52:26,180
facility that had a garage door type of

2376
01:52:24,590 --> 01:52:27,770
thing and right there in that area those

2377
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:30,590
plants started getting powdery mildew on

2378
01:52:27,770 --> 01:52:32,330
the first snowfall so something you can

2379
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:33,739
do something you're gonna need to think

2380
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:36,140
about is how to heat those areas

2381
01:52:33,739 --> 01:52:37,639
properly maybe build a separate wall I

2382
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:39,829
know this sounds extreme but if you've

2383
01:52:37,640 --> 01:52:42,130
got a wall if your grow facility has a

2384
01:52:39,829 --> 01:52:43,420
wall that is on the edge

2385
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:45,550
tear of the building and it is concrete

2386
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:47,980
or it is not well insulated you may want

2387
01:52:45,550 --> 01:52:49,539
to build a six-inch gap in there and put

2388
01:52:47,979 --> 01:52:51,759
some insulation in there so that when it

2389
01:52:49,539 --> 01:52:53,019
snows you've got a buffer zone so that

2390
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:54,670
you're not freezing your plants

2391
01:52:53,020 --> 01:52:56,500
something else you can do to help

2392
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:58,420
prevent powdery mildew and this is just

2393
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:59,979
for all seasons when the plants start

2394
01:52:58,420 --> 01:53:01,569
going into flower and getting a little

2395
01:52:59,979 --> 01:53:05,379
bit of chunky buds I like to go in and

2396
01:53:01,569 --> 01:53:06,969
take off most of the big fan leaves most

2397
01:53:05,380 --> 01:53:08,079
of those water leaves the Sun leaves

2398
01:53:06,970 --> 01:53:10,360
whatever you want to call them I like to

2399
01:53:08,079 --> 01:53:11,949
pull the majority of those off some

2400
01:53:10,359 --> 01:53:14,019
people think that I'm crazy some people

2401
01:53:11,949 --> 01:53:16,659
think I'm nuts for doing it but go in

2402
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:18,850
there about week three a flower and take

2403
01:53:16,659 --> 01:53:20,829
off all those pea deals and watch them

2404
01:53:18,850 --> 01:53:22,300
grow back you'll freak out because they

2405
01:53:20,829 --> 01:53:24,100
come back your plants will be way more

2406
01:53:22,300 --> 01:53:25,510
productive you'll see production and

2407
01:53:24,100 --> 01:53:27,550
what you're doing is you're letting the

2408
01:53:25,510 --> 01:53:29,140
light penetrate a little bit more you

2409
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:31,119
can get light down to the bottom buds

2410
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:33,039
that's where you don't have to lollipop

2411
01:53:31,119 --> 01:53:34,899
is high and you're also creating more

2412
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:37,029
air space and at the same time you're

2413
01:53:34,899 --> 01:53:39,129
removing places for powdery mildew to

2414
01:53:37,029 --> 01:53:40,779
land and build up and a lot of times

2415
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:43,180
what happens you guys in a warm humid

2416
01:53:40,779 --> 01:53:44,979
grow room you've got one leaf and

2417
01:53:43,180 --> 01:53:48,039
another leaf resting right on top of

2418
01:53:44,979 --> 01:53:49,539
each other now imagine if you imagine

2419
01:53:48,039 --> 01:53:51,250
you're on the bus and the dude next to

2420
01:53:49,539 --> 01:53:52,750
you just rests his [ __ ] hand right on

2421
01:53:51,250 --> 01:53:56,170
yours on the bus in the middle of the

2422
01:53:52,750 --> 01:54:00,000
summer and his sweat and sweat and you

2423
01:53:56,170 --> 01:54:02,440
got a ride all day twelve hours

2424
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:04,210
sometimes the fans don't hit every

2425
01:54:02,439 --> 01:54:05,979
single leaf so you got to write in there

2426
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:09,699
for 12 hours with the lights on you

2427
01:54:05,979 --> 01:54:11,409
imagine how sticky and funky your hand

2428
01:54:09,699 --> 01:54:14,739
is gonna be after 12 hours of that [ __ ]

2429
01:54:11,409 --> 01:54:16,059
the top leaf is sweating from on the

2430
01:54:14,739 --> 01:54:17,590
bottom because all that leaf pressed

2431
01:54:16,060 --> 01:54:19,240
against it the bottom leaf is sweating

2432
01:54:17,590 --> 01:54:20,890
from the top is all that leaf against it

2433
01:54:19,239 --> 01:54:22,569
and you're just creating funk inside of

2434
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:25,539
there powdery mildew will pop up from

2435
01:54:22,569 --> 01:54:27,969
that so if you pull off all these extra

2436
01:54:25,539 --> 01:54:29,680
leaves you eliminate the opportunity for

2437
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:31,119
that powdery mildew to develop under

2438
01:54:29,680 --> 01:54:32,950
your leaves so that's something that's

2439
01:54:31,119 --> 01:54:34,510
really helpful I think also there's less

2440
01:54:32,949 --> 01:54:36,489
places for bugs if you go in there and

2441
01:54:34,510 --> 01:54:38,230
you pull off all the leaves it's way

2442
01:54:36,489 --> 01:54:40,659
less opportunity for bugs to hide the

2443
01:54:38,229 --> 01:54:41,859
bugs prefer those leaves with longer pee

2444
01:54:40,659 --> 01:54:43,569
deals that stick out a little bit

2445
01:54:41,859 --> 01:54:45,369
further they like to go right underneath

2446
01:54:43,569 --> 01:54:46,599
those real big-ass leaves and hang out

2447
01:54:45,369 --> 01:54:48,519
it's the first place you're gonna see

2448
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:50,369
bug damages on the low larger leaves I

2449
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:52,440
think most of the time

2450
01:54:50,368 --> 01:54:54,569
eliminate that [ __ ] get rid of it don't

2451
01:54:52,439 --> 01:54:56,158
even give the bugs an opportunity to get

2452
01:54:54,569 --> 01:54:58,799
their also clean up the bottoms of your

2453
01:54:56,158 --> 01:55:02,670
plants you guys nothing should touch the

2454
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:03,840
pot or the floor or the dirt like it's

2455
01:55:02,670 --> 01:55:05,279
hanging off the bottom your plant should

2456
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,599
really touch that clean that up if you

2457
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:08,189
can get in there with some scissors

2458
01:55:06,599 --> 01:55:10,199
early start a flower just clean it up

2459
01:55:08,189 --> 01:55:12,269
you want depending on the size of pot

2460
01:55:10,198 --> 01:55:13,859
and size apply you're using I usually

2461
01:55:12,270 --> 01:55:17,159
have at least six to eight inches

2462
01:55:13,859 --> 01:55:19,259
between the pot and the first two stalks

2463
01:55:17,158 --> 01:55:21,000
that come off my branch I will clean

2464
01:55:19,260 --> 01:55:22,820
that up sometimes if I'm going a larger

2465
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:24,960
pot girl larger plants I'll clean a foot

2466
01:55:22,819 --> 01:55:26,519
sometimes a green and healthy when I had

2467
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:28,469
the large warehouse we would over veg

2468
01:55:26,520 --> 01:55:31,020
for too long and then we would just

2469
01:55:28,469 --> 01:55:32,880
trellis everything out didn't reach I

2470
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:34,320
would just chop off all the branches

2471
01:55:32,880 --> 01:55:36,449
that didn't reach to the trellis and

2472
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:38,549
we'd have a foot and a half or just

2473
01:55:36,448 --> 01:55:41,189
naked shave leg sometimes two feet but

2474
01:55:38,550 --> 01:55:43,199
just naked bear shave legs but that

2475
01:55:41,189 --> 01:55:44,939
promotes better air flow and again it

2476
01:55:43,198 --> 01:55:46,618
gives you less opportunity for bugs to

2477
01:55:44,939 --> 01:55:48,388
get in there less places for powdery

2478
01:55:46,618 --> 01:55:50,670
mildew and we're not trying to grow

2479
01:55:48,389 --> 01:55:52,949
leaves we're trying to go grow buds so

2480
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:55,109
get in there about week three excuse me

2481
01:55:52,948 --> 01:55:56,609
about week three take off most of your

2482
01:55:55,109 --> 01:55:58,408
families if not all of them I like to

2483
01:55:56,609 --> 01:55:59,880
leave the two on the top of the but you

2484
01:55:58,408 --> 01:56:01,679
know you got that top cola I like to

2485
01:55:59,880 --> 01:56:03,179
leave two or four leaves up there so you

2486
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:05,190
can grab some white treat some energy

2487
01:56:03,179 --> 01:56:06,840
but that lower stuff just go mad I take

2488
01:56:05,189 --> 01:56:08,879
most of that lower [ __ ] right off I

2489
01:56:06,840 --> 01:56:10,319
don't even think about it then I get in

2490
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,449
there about week five and do it again

2491
01:56:10,319 --> 01:56:14,519
I'll feed it a bloom booster I will feed

2492
01:56:12,448 --> 01:56:18,719
it a root pack and a foliar pack to make

2493
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:22,679
it explode guys shout out the tiara

2494
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:24,960
concentrates with their Chad flash maybe

2495
01:56:22,679 --> 01:56:26,579
a little choked up but I like to take

2496
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:28,469
off the leaves feed it a root pack

2497
01:56:26,579 --> 01:56:29,939
feeder to follow your pack feed it a

2498
01:56:28,469 --> 01:56:31,859
strong bloom booster about week five

2499
01:56:29,939 --> 01:56:34,289
week six and then go there and pull off

2500
01:56:31,859 --> 01:56:36,000
the leaves you'll really notice it bulk

2501
01:56:34,289 --> 01:56:38,908
up that's my opinion indica strains

2502
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,319
really like it flow blueberry that type

2503
01:56:38,908 --> 01:56:42,000
of stuff really appreciates it some of

2504
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:44,189
the sativa dominant strains don't go

2505
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,800
super heavy but good still get in there

2506
01:56:44,189 --> 01:56:48,658
and take off some leaves alright that's

2507
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,699
what I think about defoliation also

2508
01:56:48,658 --> 01:56:52,138
Jessie and I did an episode we talked

2509
01:56:50,698 --> 01:56:55,259
about cleaning up your outdoor garden

2510
01:56:52,139 --> 01:56:57,630
clean up your indoor garden you guys get

2511
01:56:55,260 --> 01:56:59,070
a broom and sweep up just why not sweep

2512
01:56:57,630 --> 01:56:59,550
up at the end of the day you've got to

2513
01:56:59,069 --> 01:57:01,139
be there

2514
01:56:59,550 --> 01:57:03,119
spend an extra five or ten minutes and

2515
01:57:01,139 --> 01:57:04,199
sweep up that place pick up all the

2516
01:57:03,118 --> 01:57:06,179
little litter

2517
01:57:04,199 --> 01:57:07,679
in the grow room maybe there's a zip tie

2518
01:57:06,180 --> 01:57:09,390
that you used for something that you cut

2519
01:57:07,680 --> 01:57:10,890
down clean that [ __ ] up there's no need

2520
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:12,539
to leave extra stuff sitting around put

2521
01:57:10,890 --> 01:57:14,070
all your tools away put all your

2522
01:57:12,539 --> 01:57:15,989
equipment away clean out your sprayers

2523
01:57:14,069 --> 01:57:17,519
clean out your pumps clean out anything

2524
01:57:15,989 --> 01:57:18,809
maybe clay can be clean so that it's

2525
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:20,910
ready for you the next time you need to

2526
01:57:18,810 --> 01:57:23,160
use it just take a couple minutes at the

2527
01:57:20,909 --> 01:57:24,479
end of the day and clean [ __ ] up if your

2528
01:57:23,159 --> 01:57:26,579
drone at home you guys have dedicated

2529
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:28,819
stuff have a dedicated broom have a

2530
01:57:26,579 --> 01:57:31,920
dedicated dustpan for your grow rooms

2531
01:57:28,819 --> 01:57:33,389
try to have a dedicated trash can when

2532
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:35,789
you clean up when you sweep up if you've

2533
01:57:33,390 --> 01:57:37,170
got dead leaves on the floor if you find

2534
01:57:35,789 --> 01:57:39,269
that you've got some dead bugs on the

2535
01:57:37,170 --> 01:57:40,649
floor sometimes you'll find randomly

2536
01:57:39,270 --> 01:57:42,000
just to be a little pilot dead like

2537
01:57:40,649 --> 01:57:43,559
white flies or fungus gnats or some

2538
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:44,819
maybe you sprayed and then few days

2539
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:46,590
later all these bugs that they stole

2540
01:57:44,819 --> 01:57:48,599
landed over there by that fan when you

2541
01:57:46,590 --> 01:57:50,520
clean that stuff up sweep it all up into

2542
01:57:48,600 --> 01:57:52,020
a trash can and take that trash can out

2543
01:57:50,520 --> 01:57:54,090
of the grow room don't leave it in the

2544
01:57:52,020 --> 01:57:55,860
grow if you got dead leaves in there

2545
01:57:54,090 --> 01:57:57,840
don't leave those in the grow either you

2546
01:57:55,859 --> 01:57:59,219
don't want that stuff in there every

2547
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:01,470
dead leave and piece of stuff on the

2548
01:57:59,220 --> 01:58:03,420
floor is another place for a bug to hide

2549
01:58:01,470 --> 01:58:04,920
and I said this to somebody the other

2550
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:06,930
day I said if you got five spider mites

2551
01:58:04,920 --> 01:58:08,609
hiding underneath one leaf two of them

2552
01:58:06,930 --> 01:58:10,110
are gonna hook up - we're gonna [ __ ] and

2553
01:58:08,609 --> 01:58:12,479
they're gonna make a million spider my

2554
01:58:10,109 --> 01:58:14,759
babies and if you do the math on that

2555
01:58:12,479 --> 01:58:16,139
cuz it's just gonna keep going so I mean

2556
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:17,489
I'm right right if you got five people

2557
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:19,470
at a party by the end of the night two

2558
01:58:17,489 --> 01:58:21,269
people are hooking up that's how these

2559
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:22,980
spider mites are gonna be and if you

2560
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:24,900
leave one leaf and you got five spider

2561
01:58:22,979 --> 01:58:26,309
mites under there and five days you're

2562
01:58:24,899 --> 01:58:27,629
gonna have that multiply it by whatever

2563
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:29,550
spider mites breed out which is a

2564
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:30,989
ridiculous rate so clean up that one

2565
01:58:29,550 --> 01:58:32,489
leaf just pick it up there's no need for

2566
01:58:30,989 --> 01:58:34,829
all that [ __ ] around there get out the

2567
01:58:32,489 --> 01:58:36,960
shopvac and clean up the corners dust

2568
01:58:34,829 --> 01:58:38,430
the tops of the lights go in you will be

2569
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:40,109
amazed at how many bugs are in the

2570
01:58:38,430 --> 01:58:41,970
crevices in your Gavita lights if you've

2571
01:58:40,109 --> 01:58:43,259
got a large commercial facility and you

2572
01:58:41,970 --> 01:58:45,060
get up top and you clean out your lights

2573
01:58:43,260 --> 01:58:46,619
there's a bunch of bugs up there clean

2574

2656
02:05:31,189 --> 02:05:35,269
before we get that far we've got a few

2657
02:05:32,930 --> 02:05:36,890
things we want to chatter about let's

2658
02:05:35,270 --> 02:05:38,180
see where should I start people like to

2659
02:05:36,890 --> 02:05:39,650
hear about my breeding updates you guys

2660
02:05:38,180 --> 02:05:44,030
remember I was talking about

2661
02:05:39,649 --> 02:05:46,189
I had a arise f1 male and I had

2662
02:05:44,029 --> 02:05:47,449
pollinated a bunch of stuff and they had

2663
02:05:46,189 --> 02:05:48,769
gone for a long time those have since

2664
02:05:47,449 --> 02:05:51,260
been harvested those are all harvested

2665
02:05:48,770 --> 02:05:53,210
all the seeds are taken out the bud

2666
02:05:51,260 --> 02:05:55,070
material is in a container getting ready

2667
02:05:53,210 --> 02:05:57,230
to be turned into hash and the seeds are

2668
02:05:55,069 --> 02:05:59,239
all in separate containers they're being

2669
02:05:57,229 --> 02:06:02,209
distributed to friends of mine for test

2670
02:05:59,239 --> 02:06:03,769
growth I am growing a large number of

2671
02:06:02,210 --> 02:06:06,079
them myself I'm pretty excited about

2672
02:06:03,770 --> 02:06:07,670
that I see some sprouts gone and it

2673
02:06:06,079 --> 02:06:10,579
makes me smile to see some stuff sprout

2674
02:06:07,670 --> 02:06:11,989
again yeah so those are being tested but

2675
02:06:10,579 --> 02:06:13,399
since those are done I cleaned up

2676
02:06:11,989 --> 02:06:14,659
everything I sprayed everything down

2677
02:06:13,399 --> 02:06:16,939
with hot water and a little bit of

2678
02:06:14,659 --> 02:06:18,229
bleach and I cleaned up real well and I

2679
02:06:16,939 --> 02:06:20,149
got all the pollen out of the room and

2680
02:06:18,229 --> 02:06:22,549
I'm at it again I have got some stuff in

2681
02:06:20,149 --> 02:06:23,929
flower it is about I'd say it's by the

2682
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:26,960
time this comes out it'll be three weeks

2683
02:06:23,930 --> 02:06:29,590
into flower nice there I am putting the

2684
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:33,140
arize male 2 girls cookies-and-cream

2685
02:06:29,590 --> 02:06:34,489
female and that cookies-and-cream i was

2686
02:06:33,140 --> 02:06:36,710
one of the most resinous plants I've

2687
02:06:34,489 --> 02:06:39,139
ever grown it produced more remember

2688
02:06:36,710 --> 02:06:41,180
they'll give us some frosty [ __ ] but it

2689
02:06:39,140 --> 02:06:43,190
just made little pinky sized buds all

2690
02:06:41,180 --> 02:06:44,539
the way up to stick yep and I could not

2691
02:06:43,189 --> 02:06:46,488
figure out how to make it produce better

2692
02:06:44,539 --> 02:06:48,560
so I'm thinking if I hit it with pollen

2693
02:06:46,488 --> 02:06:50,750
from the arize maybe that big ass of

2694
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:53,060
rice Cola is gonna fix my problem with

2695
02:06:50,750 --> 02:06:54,770
the cookies and cream we can hope and

2696
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:56,180
it's gonna improve that yeah so that's

2697
02:06:54,770 --> 02:06:57,680
what I'm hoping for I also put a white

2698
02:06:56,180 --> 02:07:00,110
wit a bunch of white widow in the room

2699
02:06:57,680 --> 02:07:02,180
to get bread - there's a grateful dog to

2700
02:07:00,109 --> 02:07:05,119
get pollinated there's a lemon Geoffrey

2701
02:07:02,180 --> 02:07:07,310
to get pollinated so here they won't get

2702
02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:09,170
pollinated for I'm trying to predict the

2703
02:07:07,310 --> 02:07:11,210
future right now at this time they're

2704
02:07:09,170 --> 02:07:13,130
about ten days into flour hopefully then

2705
02:07:11,210 --> 02:07:15,920
I'll get pollinated for another 16 days

2706
02:07:13,130 --> 02:07:18,890
ish and then about 50 days from there

2707
02:07:15,920 --> 02:07:21,680
the seeds should be ready so then I have

2708
02:07:18,890 --> 02:07:24,170
to harvest dry and remove the seeds and

2709
02:07:21,680 --> 02:07:28,280
then I'll have more stuff to give out to

2710
02:07:24,170 --> 02:07:29,449
my friends to be tested and keeps on

2711
02:07:28,279 --> 02:07:30,829
going and then we find out what's the

2712
02:07:29,449 --> 02:07:32,840
best what's worth making a whole bunch

2713
02:07:30,829 --> 02:07:34,760
more of and I'll continue those lines

2714
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:36,319
and things that aren't super impressive

2715
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:38,840
since space is limited time is limited

2716
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:41,509
resources are limited I just try to make

2717
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:42,890
the best of the best yeah so we don't

2718
02:07:41,510 --> 02:07:44,360
have to go calling things in the future

2719
02:07:42,890 --> 02:07:45,770
so that's where I am with breeding I'll

2720
02:07:44,359 --> 02:07:47,179
keep you guys updated as it gets further

2721
02:07:45,770 --> 02:07:48,680
along we're only a few days in so

2722
02:07:47,180 --> 02:07:50,360
there's not a lot of stuff to talk about

2723
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:52,880
the male plants are a little bit ahead

2724
02:07:50,359 --> 02:07:54,589
because I like their like their male

2725
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:56,029
flowers to develop a little bit further

2726
02:07:54,590 --> 02:07:57,110
so they can start dropping a lot of

2727
02:07:56,029 --> 02:07:58,550
pollens and then when the girls are

2728
02:07:57,109 --> 02:08:00,710
ready I got plenty of pollen for all

2729
02:07:58,550 --> 02:08:02,869
those plants that's pretty much where we

2730
02:08:00,710 --> 02:08:05,329
are welcome you guys updated speaking of

2731
02:08:02,869 --> 02:08:06,439
a breeding program the dank team comm if

2732
02:08:05,329 --> 02:08:07,789
you guys want to know where to get these

2733
02:08:06,439 --> 02:08:10,569
seeds that have been tested that are

2734
02:08:07,789 --> 02:08:13,488
viable that are that are reliable

2735
02:08:10,569 --> 02:08:17,179
they're ready to go their Rasta Jeff

2736
02:08:13,488 --> 02:08:18,949
approved a team calm they have got

2737
02:08:17,180 --> 02:08:22,250
archived seeds there I'm pretty sure

2738
02:08:18,949 --> 02:08:25,130
they've got rules they have they've got

2739
02:08:22,250 --> 02:08:27,140
cage beam genetics mile high they have

2740
02:08:25,130 --> 02:08:28,250
got Sin City seeds they've got I read

2741
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:29,239
genetics seeds they're a whole bunch of

2742
02:08:28,250 --> 02:08:30,859
great brands err I can't think of them

2743
02:08:29,238 --> 02:08:33,349
at the top of my head cuz Mike and I

2744
02:08:30,859 --> 02:08:38,210
took a massive list and we took an

2745
02:08:33,350 --> 02:08:41,159
impressive list of tabs as well yes nice

2746
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:44,250

more content available I've had more

2752
02:08:56,550 --> 02:09:00,510
friends and I've noticed that sometimes

2753
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:01,920
episodes are kind of time-sensitive like

2754
02:09:00,510 --> 02:09:03,270
this one we want to get out probably the

2755
02:09:01,920 --> 02:09:04,500
Monday after the election not the

2756
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:06,120
Thursday because I want everyone to

2777
02:09:44,760 --> 02:09:55,350
was great great show I'm looking forward

2778
02:09:51,658 --> 02:09:56,609
to 3 yeah yeah well spoiler alert but I

2779
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:58,739
don't want to talk about how it ends but

2780
02:09:56,609 --> 02:10:01,259
okay no spoiler alert I guess he you

2781
02:09:58,738 --> 02:10:03,119
can't have work we're safe that's been a

2782
02:10:01,260 --> 02:10:05,429
couple of months but yes spoiler alert

2783
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:07,559
if you haven't watched narcos do hit

2784
02:10:05,429 --> 02:10:11,190
pause and go watch two seasons and

2785
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:13,590
narcos yeah I think that's enough for

2786
02:10:11,189 --> 02:10:15,960
people to prepare for the spoiler be

2787
02:10:13,590 --> 02:10:19,860
good go for it well I was familiar with

2788
02:10:15,960 --> 02:10:22,260
the this story before narcos yeah it's

2789
02:10:19,859 --> 02:10:24,329
gonna go so every time they hit a major

2790
02:10:22,260 --> 02:10:26,429
plot point or a major event and I was

2791
02:10:24,329 --> 02:10:28,920
like okay I know where that falls in the

2792
02:10:26,429 --> 02:10:30,989
time line how are they gonna get more

2793
02:10:28,920 --> 02:10:32,190
than two seasons out of this and I like

2794
02:10:30,988 --> 02:10:33,299
where they're headed for season 3 I

2795
02:10:32,189 --> 02:10:35,219
think it's a good transition they're

2796
02:10:33,300 --> 02:10:37,139
gonna do like arts a Cali cartel is

2797
02:10:35,219 --> 02:10:39,600
gonna be the focus yeah that's that's a

2798
02:10:37,139 --> 02:10:41,310
great spot to go from there it's uh it's

2799
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:43,380
a really interesting part of history

2800
02:10:41,310 --> 02:10:45,630
that you don't often see portrayed

2801
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:49,440
anywhere

2802
02:10:45,630 --> 02:10:52,140
other than I mean even a little bit in

2803
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:53,759
class if you take like a really good

2804
02:10:52,140 --> 02:10:54,900
history class in college maybe other

2805
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:55,320
than that you've gotta learn this [ __ ]

2806
02:10:54,899 --> 02:10:56,729
on your own

2807
02:10:55,319 --> 02:10:59,460
narcos actually did a nice job

2808
02:10:56,729 --> 02:11:02,339
presenting in a fun entertaining way

2809
02:10:59,460 --> 02:11:03,689
okay I know the story and I've read very

2810
02:11:02,340 --> 02:11:05,069
little but it sounds like they did a

2811
02:11:03,689 --> 02:11:07,229
good job that's right I didn't know that

2812
02:11:05,069 --> 02:11:08,369
yeah no they did a really nice ooh I

2813
02:11:07,229 --> 02:11:16,139
don't know about all the little stuff

2814
02:11:08,369 --> 02:11:19,319
but this story line of they follow is

2815
02:11:16,140 --> 02:11:21,720
accurate nice so I know that Murphy is

2816
02:11:19,319 --> 02:11:24,210
gonna be in the car Cali cartel show are

2817
02:11:21,720 --> 02:11:25,470
they gonna bring Pina back I hope me too

2818
02:11:24,210 --> 02:11:26,819
because those two together it's like the

2819
02:11:25,470 --> 02:11:28,230
beavis and butt-head it's a perfect duo

2820
02:11:26,819 --> 02:11:31,199
you need both of them because that show

2821
02:11:28,229 --> 02:11:32,819
balanced I think yeah I like both of

2822
02:11:31,199 --> 02:11:33,869
them together and I was glad that that

2823
02:11:32,819 --> 02:11:36,269
was one of the things they did in the

2824
02:11:33,869 --> 02:11:38,340
season finale was tease that there bring

2825
02:11:36,270 --> 02:11:39,600
a pen you back I'm pulling up an article

2826
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:41,520
that I've got on my phone here something

2827
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:44,370
we wanted to talk about to keep the show

2828
02:11:41,520 --> 02:11:46,020
moving here um just really random fun

2829
02:11:44,369 --> 02:11:47,849
story injection for the marijuana

2830
02:11:46,020 --> 02:11:50,250
community I saw this headline this week

2831
02:11:47,850 --> 02:11:53,789
there's a band somewhere attempting to

2832
02:11:50,250 --> 02:11:55,319
write a song in 420 time and when I saw

2833
02:11:53,789 --> 02:11:57,239
that I thought of you specifically

2834
02:11:55,319 --> 02:11:59,399
because you you're one of the people in

2835
02:11:57,239 --> 02:12:02,130
my world that knows what that means I

2836
02:11:59,399 --> 02:12:03,719
can already see he's got the expression

2837
02:12:02,130 --> 02:12:05,670
like he wants to laugh but he can't

2838
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:08,310
quite figure out that how funny this is

2839
02:12:05,670 --> 02:12:10,289
or how insane this is you know something

2840
02:12:08,310 --> 02:12:12,360
about me I did there's a reason I didn't

2841
02:12:10,289 --> 02:12:15,000
click play and like you're there attempt

2842
02:12:12,359 --> 02:12:16,649
so far because I know just enough to

2843
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:25,199
about music to know what a nightmare

2844
02:12:16,649 --> 02:12:27,899
that might be yeah how long does it have

2845
02:12:25,199 --> 02:12:29,309
to be to count as a song I have no idea

2846
02:12:27,899 --> 02:12:31,229
because that's what I like I can

2847
02:12:29,310 --> 02:12:33,570
probably play you six Matt four measures

2848
02:12:31,229 --> 02:12:34,769
for four or five measures that's not a

2849
02:12:33,569 --> 02:12:37,199
problem but after that you're almost

2850
02:12:34,770 --> 02:12:41,750
thinking three versus two choruses Oh

2851
02:12:37,199 --> 02:12:45,479
God at least the bridge in there yeah

2852
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:47,069
man in 420 times it four beats per

2853
02:12:45,479 --> 02:12:49,699
measure you got to do the whole bit

2854
02:12:47,069 --> 02:12:51,880
right when he counts per

2855
02:12:49,699 --> 02:12:54,460
[Music]

2856
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:56,199
yeah I saw that I was likewise for

2857
02:12:54,460 --> 02:12:57,670
measuring each beat gets 20 counts that

2858
02:12:56,199 --> 02:12:59,409
was one of those stories that came

2859
02:12:57,670 --> 02:13:01,180
through right before the election that I

2860
02:12:59,409 --> 02:13:02,649
was like thank God there's some some

2861
02:13:01,180 --> 02:13:05,320
people out there that are willing to do

2862
02:13:02,649 --> 02:13:07,329
[ __ ] insane enough to make the press to

2863
02:13:05,319 --> 02:13:08,219
just change the top of your conversation

2864
02:13:07,329 --> 02:13:10,569
even for a minute

2865
02:13:08,220 --> 02:13:12,550
yeah I could still see you trying to

2866
02:13:10,569 --> 02:13:14,170
wrap your head around it I remembered

2867
02:13:12,550 --> 02:13:16,180
the stories he said a couple cool ways

2868
02:13:14,170 --> 02:13:17,380
are they just gonna count 20 beats on

2869
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:19,750
the bottom are they gonna break it down

2870
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:24,340
to like a basic like a like a five or

2871
02:13:19,750 --> 02:13:27,189
four or five or something yeah okay my

2872
02:13:24,340 --> 02:13:29,610
head I just went one two three four five

2873
02:13:27,189 --> 02:13:29,609
six

2874
02:13:33,449 --> 02:13:39,399
this went way too far all right so a

2875
02:13:37,659 --> 02:13:42,279
while back this has been a continuing

2876
02:13:39,399 --> 02:13:43,779
story ongoing story ongoing story a long

2877
02:13:42,279 --> 02:13:45,309
time ago it feels like this feels like

2878
02:13:43,779 --> 02:13:47,739
it happened damned forever

2879
02:13:45,310 --> 02:13:49,930
it happened in May of 2015 to be more

2880
02:13:47,739 --> 02:13:51,489
precise which in a pothead mind like

2881
02:13:49,930 --> 02:13:52,659
mine that was damned forever back when

2882
02:13:51,489 --> 02:13:57,849
we learned not to watch movies on the

2883
02:13:52,659 --> 02:14:02,439
podcast there was a raid in the city of

2884
02:13:57,850 --> 02:14:04,360
Santa Ana yes the the police department

2885
02:14:02,439 --> 02:14:05,859
came in and destroyed the dispensary

2886
02:14:04,359 --> 02:14:06,729
they illegally raided the dispensary

2887
02:14:05,859 --> 02:14:09,309
they came in they destroyed the

2888
02:14:06,729 --> 02:14:11,079
dispensary they needlessly destroyed a

2889
02:14:09,310 --> 02:14:12,789
bunch of TVs they destroyed the cash

2890
02:14:11,079 --> 02:14:14,890
register they destroyed the display

2891
02:14:12,789 --> 02:14:16,119
counters they basically vandalized the

2892
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:17,710
[ __ ] out of this place imagine if a

2893
02:14:16,119 --> 02:14:19,420
bunch of teenagers broke into somewhere

2894
02:14:17,710 --> 02:14:21,640
and were pissed off and just wanted to

2895
02:14:19,420 --> 02:14:24,119
[ __ ] [ __ ] up that's what they did in

2896
02:14:21,640 --> 02:14:28,660
there yep and in the process they also

2897
02:14:24,119 --> 02:14:32,019
stole and consumed cannabis infused

2898
02:14:28,659 --> 02:14:35,319
edibles while on the clock while

2899
02:14:32,020 --> 02:14:37,930
conducting a raid slash investigation

2900
02:14:35,319 --> 02:14:40,479
while in possession of a firearm while

2901
02:14:37,930 --> 02:14:42,789
taxpayer money was paying their salary

2902
02:14:40,479 --> 02:14:45,489
while illegally conducting a raid of a

2903
02:14:42,789 --> 02:14:48,909
legally functioning operating facility

2904
02:14:45,489 --> 02:14:52,079
as far as I'm concerned that's exactly

2905
02:14:48,909 --> 02:14:54,840
what the security video shows

2906
02:14:52,079 --> 02:14:59,739
unfortunately most of that wasn't

2907
02:14:54,840 --> 02:15:03,400
eventually proved in a court of law the

2908
02:14:59,739 --> 02:15:05,800
fallout from this has been a year or

2909
02:15:03,399 --> 02:15:07,448
more in the making

2910
02:15:05,800 --> 02:15:10,929
it looks like they're finally done with

2911
02:15:07,448 --> 02:15:13,478
this I think all of the officers that

2912
02:15:10,929 --> 02:15:16,269
are portrayed in the video

2913
02:15:13,479 --> 02:15:20,229
his main characters let's say that the

2914
02:15:16,269 --> 02:15:23,019
nasty female cop who says she was gonna

2915
02:15:20,229 --> 02:15:25,360
kick the one-legged old woman who was

2916
02:15:23,019 --> 02:15:28,869
volunteering at the dispensary quote in

2917
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:33,308
her [ __ ] nub your mom and then the

2918
02:15:28,868 --> 02:15:35,198
cop that was handing out snack foods and

2919
02:15:33,309 --> 02:15:38,949
the other cop that was eating snack

2920
02:15:35,198 --> 02:15:42,069
foods all of resigned and the city's now

2921
02:15:38,948 --> 02:15:46,089
paying out what's the total okay

2922
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:48,219
city of Santa Ana will pay $100,000 to

2923
02:15:46,090 --> 02:15:51,489
settle losses over infamous dispensary

2924
02:15:48,219 --> 02:15:53,109
raid yes of taxpayer money and if I

2925
02:15:51,488 --> 02:15:57,308
remember the article right that money's

2926
02:15:53,109 --> 02:15:59,319
getting split up three ways between two

2927
02:15:57,309 --> 02:16:01,719
of the main volunteers in the dispensary

2928
02:15:59,319 --> 02:16:06,670
and then legal counsel basically that's

2929
02:16:01,719 --> 02:16:09,038
a good business plan it's not a bad way

2930
02:16:06,670 --> 02:16:12,038
to disperse the settlement as far as I

2931
02:16:09,038 --> 02:16:13,300
can tell it's uh I'm glad that the city

2932
02:16:12,038 --> 02:16:15,368
got hit with this though there's

2933
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:17,590
dispensary raids all over the place this

2934
02:16:15,368 --> 02:16:20,589
raid was clearly out of line from

2935
02:16:17,590 --> 02:16:22,510
beginning to end and it should have cost

2936
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:25,510
the police some money it should it

2937
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:27,729
should sting totally unacceptable from

2938
02:16:25,510 --> 02:16:29,920
start to finish you know how I found out

2939

3004
02:18:36,309 --> 02:18:43,609
it's been highly contentious for man

3005
02:18:41,450 --> 02:18:47,930
I've been actively working this election

3006
02:18:43,610 --> 02:18:51,831
since April yeah just just wrapping my

3007
02:18:47,930 --> 02:18:55,520
own head around that hurts mic episode I

3008
02:18:51,831 --> 02:18:58,581

3011
02:19:00,950 --> 02:19:05,270
listeners owe you a shout-out you came

3012
02:19:02,630 --> 02:19:07,699
on here and kind of reminded us several

3013
02:19:05,270 --> 02:19:11,360
times go [ __ ] vote so they did sinks

3014
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:12,890
dude that's the first takeaway from last

3015
02:19:11,360 --> 02:19:14,841
night's election it's kind of a weird

3016
02:19:12,889 --> 02:19:18,260
way to jump into to the main topic

3017
02:19:14,841 --> 02:19:21,200
tonight but really you you you have to

3018
02:19:18,260 --> 02:19:23,270
vote that's I mean it's the one thing

3019
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:26,030
that we all do as Americans other than

3020
02:19:23,270 --> 02:19:27,921
pay taxes and die that really unites all

3021
02:19:26,030 --> 02:19:29,180
of us under the same thing we got right

3022
02:19:27,921 --> 02:19:30,079
here one of my notes it's the one on the

3023
02:19:29,180 --> 02:19:31,700
bottom but I'm gonna ask

3024
02:19:30,079 --> 02:19:33,888
at first since you're here do you feel

3025
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:37,730
like your vote made an actual difference

3026
02:19:33,888 --> 02:19:39,619
Oh big time okay look at the numbers I

3027
02:19:37,729 --> 02:19:43,309
mean there's there's a million different

3028
02:19:39,620 --> 02:19:45,740
ways to rationalize I didn't vote

3029
02:19:43,309 --> 02:19:48,649
because my vote didn't matter but if you

3030
02:19:45,739 --> 02:19:51,489
actually pull up the numbers look at

3031
02:19:48,649 --> 02:19:53,719
your area look at the different races

3032
02:19:51,489 --> 02:19:56,600
thousands and thousands and thousands of

3033
02:19:53,719 --> 02:19:58,549
people voted and a lot of these races I

3034
02:19:56,600 --> 02:20:00,560
mean even here in Pueblo races around

3035
02:19:58,549 --> 02:20:04,250
the country come down to thirty votes a

3036
02:20:00,560 --> 02:20:07,399
hundred votes Pueblo Colorado has been a

3037
02:20:04,250 --> 02:20:09,379
strong Democratic they call it a

3038
02:20:07,399 --> 02:20:12,560
democratic stronghold back when Colorado

3039
02:20:09,379 --> 02:20:18,469
was a hard Republican state Denver and

3040
02:20:12,560 --> 02:20:21,619
Pueblo were democratic in at this thick

3041
02:20:18,469 --> 02:20:24,520
Republican state and I mean for 40 years

3042
02:20:21,620 --> 02:20:26,300
Pablo's been a democratic stronghold and

3043
02:20:24,521 --> 02:20:30,260
in this election

3044
02:20:26,299 --> 02:20:32,810
Trump won by like 240 votes and

3045
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:35,739
literally the our vote for president

3046
02:20:32,810 --> 02:20:37,909
down here was decided by 240 votes a

3047
02:20:35,739 --> 02:20:39,799
couple of that County Commissioners

3048
02:20:37,909 --> 02:20:41,899
seats which would directly impact both

3049
02:20:39,799 --> 02:20:44,329
of our lives and any number of things

3050
02:20:41,899 --> 02:20:47,510
locally were decided by a few hundred

3051
02:20:44,329 --> 02:20:50,780
votes a few thousand votes and this is

3052
02:20:47,510 --> 02:20:52,340
nationally when you look at the stuff if

3053
02:20:50,780 --> 02:20:55,329
you look at the polling data from this

3054
02:20:52,340 --> 02:20:57,560
election if Gary Johnson wasn't a thing

3055
02:20:55,329 --> 02:20:59,021
the conversation we're about to have

3056
02:20:57,560 --> 02:21:02,000
tonight would be very different

3057
02:20:59,021 --> 02:21:04,989
Gary Johnson running and the little tiny

3058
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:09,521
percent of the vote he got changed vote

3059
02:21:04,989 --> 02:21:11,600
results all across the country and that

3060
02:21:09,521 --> 02:21:13,909
changed the outcome of the election in

3061
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:16,610
major major ways right there it's not

3062
02:21:13,909 --> 02:21:19,069
just President it's so easy to I don't

3063
02:21:16,610 --> 02:21:20,960
like the two candidates that the main

3064
02:21:19,069 --> 02:21:23,600
parties before for president I'm not

3065
02:21:20,959 --> 02:21:25,429
voting just because you don't like the

3066
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:28,550
president you just gave up all of your

3067
02:21:25,430 --> 02:21:30,771
decisions on your Senate Senators your

3068
02:21:28,549 --> 02:21:32,979
House of Representatives members your

3069
02:21:30,771 --> 02:21:35,840
local election

3070
02:21:32,979 --> 02:21:38,000
politicians your local election issues

3071
02:21:35,840 --> 02:21:39,500
your local ballot issue and a lot of

3072
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,450
those are really important some of those

3073
02:21:39,500 --> 02:21:42,950
I didn't know how important they were to

3074
02:21:41,450 --> 02:21:44,960
me until I got my

3075
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:46,939
and discovered that it was like oh [ __ ]

3076
02:21:44,959 --> 02:21:48,919
this needs to be voted on yeah when I

3077
02:21:46,939 --> 02:21:50,600
first started going through what was

3078
02:21:48,920 --> 02:21:52,520
finally gonna be on this elections

3079
02:21:50,600 --> 02:22:00,350
ballot here in Colorado I was like what

3080
02:21:52,520 --> 02:22:03,739
the [ __ ] the microphone we literally

3081
02:22:00,350 --> 02:22:06,079
voted on abolishing essentially

3082
02:22:03,739 --> 02:22:10,760
indentured servitude or slavery in

3083
02:22:06,079 --> 02:22:12,978
Colorado's penal system last night if I

3084
02:22:10,760 --> 02:22:15,500
if I caught that vote right we voted to

3085
02:22:12,978 --> 02:22:19,010
end being able to force prisoners to

3086
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:21,260
work while they're in jail it's an

3087
02:22:19,010 --> 02:22:23,719
option not not something you have to do

3088
02:22:21,260 --> 02:22:26,450
for or we throw you in isolation or beat

3089
02:22:23,719 --> 02:22:28,219
you or don't feed you or whatever which

3090
02:22:26,450 --> 02:22:30,530
is kind of nuts that that's what we were

3091
02:22:28,219 --> 02:22:33,559
doing beforehand but when you see that

3092
02:22:30,530 --> 02:22:35,300
on the ballot you're like wow I've heard

3093
02:22:33,559 --> 02:22:36,829
so much about Hillary and I've heard so

3094
02:22:35,299 --> 02:22:39,500
much about Donald and I've heard so much

3095
02:22:36,829 --> 02:22:43,670
about Gary but I've heard nothing about

3096
02:22:39,500 --> 02:22:45,829
Weesa slavery here marijuana was on the

3097
02:22:43,670 --> 02:22:48,228
vote in nine states yesterday that's

3098
02:22:45,829 --> 02:22:50,360
another subject I wanted to hit I was

3099
02:22:48,228 --> 02:22:52,399
gonna say wait two days well that's our

3100
02:22:50,360 --> 02:22:56,270
main our main focus of tonight's

3101
02:22:52,399 --> 02:22:58,639
election is is tonight's podcast is the

3102
02:22:56,270 --> 02:23:01,909
election basically and how it relates to

3103
02:22:58,639 --> 02:23:03,879
marijuana I've been on here I can't even

3104
02:23:01,909 --> 02:23:06,469
tell you how many times talking about

3105
02:23:03,879 --> 02:23:09,529
different marijuana votes this election

3106
02:23:06,469 --> 02:23:11,000
locally and nationally I mean so this is

3107
02:23:09,530 --> 02:23:15,350
the wrap-up episode for everybody

3108
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:16,939
welcome locally we can just brush this

3109
02:23:15,350 --> 02:23:18,380
out of the way for those of you who've

3110
02:23:16,939 --> 02:23:20,569
been waiting on pins and needles to

3111
02:23:18,379 --> 02:23:23,989
figure out if I still have a job

3112
02:23:20,569 --> 02:23:26,539
I do 200 and 300 failed here in Pueblo

3113
02:23:23,989 --> 02:23:29,299
so under on the ballot war initiatives

3114
02:23:26,540 --> 02:23:33,620
to pretty much dismantle and shut down

3115
02:23:29,299 --> 02:23:35,599
the recreational and medical cannabis

3116
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:37,880
industries in the City and County of

3117
02:23:35,600 --> 02:23:40,239
Pablo Colorado if this initiative were

3118
02:23:37,879 --> 02:23:43,009
to have passed there would be no more

3119
02:23:40,239 --> 02:23:44,930
growing man you're processing which is

3120
02:23:43,010 --> 02:23:46,069
hash making and edible making there

3121
02:23:44,930 --> 02:23:47,809
would have gotten rid of all of the

3122
02:23:46,069 --> 02:23:49,219
regulated and licensed business all the

3123
02:23:47,809 --> 02:23:50,329
retail stores would have been gone how

3124
02:23:49,219 --> 02:23:52,489
many people were employed by that

3125
02:23:50,329 --> 02:23:54,439
industry's thirteen hundred is the low

3126
02:23:52,489 --> 02:23:56,280
ballpark number okay thirteen hundred

3127
02:23:54,439 --> 02:23:58,530
people would not have had jobs fortune

3128
02:23:56,280 --> 02:24:00,480
enough people did go out and vote that's

3129
02:23:58,530 --> 02:24:04,320
part of what gives me faith that my vote

3130
02:24:00,479 --> 02:24:07,020
counted because I voted one of them was

3131
02:24:04,319 --> 02:24:10,379
like 5,000 and changed the only 7,000 it

3132
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:14,250
changed both yes and no on these

3133
02:24:10,379 --> 02:24:17,129
questions got over 20,000 votes okay

3134
02:24:14,250 --> 02:24:19,680
so literally every vote counted this

3135
02:24:17,129 --> 02:24:24,269
election every door that got knocked

3136
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:26,700
mattered had we not done the work that

3137
02:24:24,270 --> 02:24:28,260
we did on this these two issues this

3138
02:24:26,700 --> 02:24:30,210
vote could easily gone the other way

3139
02:24:28,260 --> 02:24:31,979
the other team kind of started

3140
02:24:30,209 --> 02:24:35,250
floundering at the end there they ran a

3141
02:24:31,979 --> 02:24:36,989
very bizarre campaign I don't really

3142
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:40,440
want to get into the ins and outs of our

3143
02:24:36,989 --> 02:24:42,899
local fight and why we won but thank God

3144
02:24:40,440 --> 02:24:45,810
we won but it was a weird election here

3145
02:24:42,899 --> 02:24:48,149
in Pueblo 2 we uh so questions 200 and

3146
02:24:45,809 --> 02:24:52,079
300 were voting to ban all the voice ins

3147
02:24:48,149 --> 02:24:55,399
businesses but we also had questions to

3148
02:24:52,079 --> 02:24:58,049
be in to see which we're going to allow

3149
02:24:55,399 --> 02:25:01,229
we currently allow all marijuana

3150
02:24:58,049 --> 02:25:05,219
businesses except retail stores under

3151
02:25:01,229 --> 02:25:07,590
amendment 64 Licensing in the city so we

3152
02:25:05,219 --> 02:25:10,079
allow medical all the medical businesses

3153
02:25:07,590 --> 02:25:12,389
and we allow every type of recreational

3154
02:25:10,079 --> 02:25:15,239
business except the retail storefront

3155
02:25:12,389 --> 02:25:17,129
locations and that was on the ballot

3156
02:25:15,239 --> 02:25:20,010
down here in Pueblo this time to do we

3157
02:25:17,129 --> 02:25:23,489
want the storefronts in Pueblo in voters

3158
02:25:20,010 --> 02:25:24,840
said no and that question lost by like

3159
02:25:23,489 --> 02:25:28,379
1,100 votes

3160
02:25:24,840 --> 02:25:31,229
wow that's not much no that's one an

3161
02:25:28,379 --> 02:25:33,000
apartment building yeah right that's two

3162
02:25:31,229 --> 02:25:35,729
or three city blocks worth of votes it's

3163
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:38,610
not it's not a big number it's easily

3164
02:25:35,729 --> 02:25:40,799
swing a bull the other way with a hard

3165
02:25:38,610 --> 02:25:43,620
work and focus but I mean unfortunately

3166
02:25:40,799 --> 02:25:45,750
here in Pueblo the entire marijuana

3167
02:25:43,620 --> 02:25:47,490
community had a hundred percent of their

3168
02:25:45,750 --> 02:25:50,760
efforts invested in two hundred and

3169
02:25:47,489 --> 02:25:53,579
three hundred being defeated and clearly

3170
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:57,000
from these results we let to be and to

3171
02:25:53,579 --> 02:26:00,479
see just sit ignored and because of that

3172
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:02,489
they lost by a very very small margin

3173
02:26:00,479 --> 02:26:05,850
was one of those the the new cannabis

3174
02:26:02,489 --> 02:26:08,280
tax yep then the city was asking if they

3175
02:26:05,850 --> 02:26:10,140
could have if they could allow stores

3176
02:26:08,280 --> 02:26:12,030
and if they could tax

3177
02:26:10,140 --> 02:26:14,489
stores at a special rate and both of

3178
02:26:12,030 --> 02:26:17,400
those questions failed as well

3179
02:26:14,489 --> 02:26:19,819
the anti-pot group theory on this is

3180
02:26:17,399 --> 02:26:22,649
that people just voted no on everything

3181
02:26:19,819 --> 02:26:24,390
and if you look at the election results

3182
02:26:22,649 --> 02:26:27,149
a lot of the other questions that were

3183
02:26:24,390 --> 02:26:28,829
asked people also voted now I'm the

3184
02:26:27,149 --> 02:26:30,091
public safety taxes and things like that

3185
02:26:28,829 --> 02:26:32,940
that were on the ballot here in Pablo

3186
02:26:30,091 --> 02:26:34,710
all got voted down I'm so no more money

3187
02:26:32,940 --> 02:26:36,030
for cops no more money for police no

3188
02:26:34,709 --> 02:26:38,879
more money for the District Attorney's

3189
02:26:36,030 --> 02:26:42,061
Office how did the cigarette tax do

3190
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:44,039
failed statewide okay which is where I

3191
02:26:42,060 --> 02:26:45,690
voted against my own interest in that

3192
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:48,891
when we voted for it I voted for it I

3193
02:26:45,690 --> 02:26:51,210
know a lot of people who voted for it

3194
02:26:48,890 --> 02:26:52,920
increasing that tax revenue would have

3195
02:26:51,209 --> 02:26:54,629
been good for the state but so I know

3196
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:55,681

3201
02:27:02,819 --> 02:27:11,220
of marijuana election news is Denver's

3202
02:27:07,050 --> 02:27:15,899
issue 300 Webelos issue 300 was bad

3203
02:27:11,220 --> 02:27:17,369
Denver Zushi 300 was good that this is

3204
02:27:15,899 --> 02:27:20,959
the question about allowing public

3205
02:27:17,370 --> 02:27:22,950
consumption clubs in bars restaurants

3206
02:27:20,959 --> 02:27:24,930
taverns and then clubs that are

3207
02:27:22,950 --> 02:27:28,221
specifically set up to be private

3208
02:27:24,931 --> 02:27:30,210
consumption clubs in Denver County

3209
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:31,890
basically the right to consume marijuana

3210
02:27:30,209 --> 02:27:33,840
in public with your friends in an

3211
02:27:31,890 --> 02:27:37,350
enclosed space designed for that purpose

3212
02:27:33,841 --> 02:27:40,079
and right now it's winning but by a tiny

3213
02:27:37,351 --> 02:27:42,989
tiny percentage it's like fifty point

3214
02:27:40,079 --> 02:27:44,700
two percent to forty nine point nine or

3215
02:27:42,989 --> 02:27:46,979
some [ __ ] like it's incredibly close

3216
02:27:44,700 --> 02:27:49,230
it's one of those races that really

3217
02:27:46,979 --> 02:27:51,329
hammers home the point that every single

3218
02:27:49,229 --> 02:27:52,829
vote if somebody would have broken down

3219
02:27:51,329 --> 02:27:54,601
on the way to vote it could have gone a

3220
02:27:52,829 --> 02:27:56,341
different way yep I mean there was

3221
02:27:54,601 --> 02:27:58,650
traffic that night that vote changes

3222
02:27:56,341 --> 02:28:00,360
someone's uber didn't show up it's I

3223
02:27:58,649 --> 02:28:02,279
mean it was very very close and they're

3224
02:28:00,360 --> 02:28:04,560
still counting those with the absentee

3225
02:28:02,280 --> 02:28:07,620
ballots that vote won't be a hundred

3226
02:28:04,560 --> 02:28:09,989
percent finalized for another day or two

3227
02:28:07,620 --> 02:28:11,641
now okay and there's another race that's

3228
02:28:09,989 --> 02:28:14,399
like that that we're gonna get to hear

3229
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:17,069
in a minute so let's jump onto national

3230
02:28:14,399 --> 02:28:18,479
news guys did your uh did your issues

3231
02:28:17,069 --> 02:28:20,761
win to this stuff that you voted for

3232
02:28:18,479 --> 02:28:22,289
locally what percentage of those would

3233
02:28:20,761 --> 02:28:23,720
you say came out in your favor

3234
02:28:22,290 --> 02:28:28,550
almost all

3235
02:28:23,719 --> 02:28:29,629
okay it was the National stuff that

3236
02:28:28,549 --> 02:28:33,318
didn't go my way

3237
02:28:29,629 --> 02:28:35,839
but we're gonna get to that here in a

3238
02:28:33,318 --> 02:28:40,010
few minutes as well but most of the

3239
02:28:35,840 --> 02:28:41,359
stuff I voted for everybody if we're not

3240
02:28:40,010 --> 02:28:44,170
everybody Republic but the majority of

3241
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:46,488
voters in public to agree on okay um

3242
02:28:44,170 --> 02:28:47,988
which was nice it's always nice to know

3243
02:28:46,488 --> 02:28:50,420
it's like oh yeah you are in the

3244
02:28:47,988 --> 02:28:51,859
majority I'm so relieved about two

3245
02:28:50,420 --> 02:28:53,659
hundred and three hundred man I had no

3246
02:28:51,859 --> 02:28:56,090
idea how to vote when it asked me about

3247
02:28:53,659 --> 02:28:58,219
judges do you want this judge to retain

3248
02:28:56,090 --> 02:29:00,500
his position I was like what you know I

3249
02:28:58,219 --> 02:29:03,709
know there's an answer for that they no

3250
02:29:00,500 --> 02:29:08,350
one does okay and so in every state

3251
02:29:03,709 --> 02:29:13,519
there is a group of people made up of

3252
02:29:08,350 --> 02:29:18,189
not judges but lawyers prosecutors

3253
02:29:13,520 --> 02:29:21,170
district attorneys defense attorneys

3254
02:29:18,189 --> 02:29:22,609
will and probate lawyers like all kinds

3255
02:29:21,170 --> 02:29:25,520
of different legal professionals that

3256
02:29:22,609 --> 02:29:27,680
are practicing in that state kind of the

3257
02:29:25,520 --> 02:29:30,380
best of the best get put together and

3258
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:33,200
then come up with a retain or don't

3259
02:29:30,379 --> 02:29:36,108
retain this Wow okay and so if you

3260
02:29:33,200 --> 02:29:38,569
google your state and then like judge

3261
02:29:36,109 --> 02:29:41,149
retention or whatever you should be able

3262
02:29:38,568 --> 02:29:44,420
to find that group in your area and then

3263
02:29:41,148 --> 02:29:47,329
they tell you judge Billy Bob you should

3264
02:29:44,420 --> 02:29:49,189
you should retain him because X Y &amp; Z or

3265
02:29:47,329 --> 02:29:52,068
you shouldn't retain him because of X Y

3266
02:29:49,189 --> 02:29:54,159
&amp; Z but the way it works in practice is

3267
02:29:52,068 --> 02:29:56,659
nobody knows so everybody just votes yes

3268
02:29:54,159 --> 02:29:58,430
and so judge retention rates are like

3269
02:29:56,659 --> 02:30:00,049
ninety-three percent right for an

3270
02:29:58,430 --> 02:30:01,729
acrostic I'm the only judge I've had

3271
02:30:00,049 --> 02:30:04,129
interaction with and I'm knocking on

3272
02:30:01,728 --> 02:30:05,629
wood prison jaw for this one the only

3273
02:30:04,129 --> 02:30:07,309
judge I've had interaction with over the

3274
02:30:05,629 --> 02:30:10,159
past few years was the guy that resided

3275
02:30:07,309 --> 02:30:11,719
over my jury duty selection and I don't

3276
02:30:10,159 --> 02:30:13,728
remember his name but if I remembered it

3277
02:30:11,719 --> 02:30:15,648
he'd get it yeah he was cool like mad

3278
02:30:13,728 --> 02:30:17,329
nothing wrong he that guy was polite to

3279
02:30:15,648 --> 02:30:19,099
me he was he treated me like the old

3280
02:30:17,329 --> 02:30:20,779
lady in a blouse next to my know the

3281
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:22,790
judge you're talking about I'm spacing

3282
02:30:20,779 --> 02:30:24,409
his name but he's a really nice human

3283
02:30:22,790 --> 02:30:25,840
being and he's a pretty good judge he's

3284
02:30:24,409 --> 02:30:28,549
a cool dude

3285
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:32,489
but a lot of people in my world are in

3286
02:30:28,549 --> 02:30:35,759
the that live in the legal world and so

3287
02:30:32,489 --> 02:30:37,379
I always have an earful of judge this or

3288
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:40,530
this judge is great this judge is in

3289
02:30:37,379 --> 02:30:42,810
yeah how about you man did the election

3290
02:30:40,530 --> 02:30:45,061
go your way yeah for the most part for

3291
02:30:42,810 --> 02:30:46,529
what for the you basically just told me

3292
02:30:45,060 --> 02:30:48,239
that all the stuff I was mostly worried

3293
02:30:46,530 --> 02:30:49,380
but the tax the cannabis tax sucks

3294
02:30:48,239 --> 02:30:50,760
that's not cool

3295
02:30:49,379 --> 02:30:52,500
I don't think that we should be adding

3296
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:54,390
extra taxes to cannabis it's already

3297
02:30:52,500 --> 02:30:55,979
expensive enough I think taxing it just

3298
02:30:54,390 --> 02:30:58,109
encourages more of the black market sale

3299
02:30:55,979 --> 02:31:00,420
I kind of figured it was gonna fail for

3300
02:30:58,110 --> 02:31:02,250
that reason yeah that's silly thing and

3301
02:31:00,420 --> 02:31:03,750
considering that the tax rate that our

3302
02:31:02,250 --> 02:31:06,271
retail stores pay already

3303
02:31:03,750 --> 02:31:10,229
I mean it's deep enough and obviously

3304
02:31:06,271 --> 02:31:12,271
I'm not excited about the president that

3305
02:31:10,229 --> 02:31:13,829
represents us now but other than that I

3306
02:31:12,271 --> 02:31:16,710
guess I can live with everything else

3307
02:31:13,829 --> 02:31:18,629
that happened the the national election

3308
02:31:16,709 --> 02:31:21,239
could have some serious implications for

3309
02:31:18,629 --> 02:31:24,209
from marijuana nationally I'm willing to

3310
02:31:21,239 --> 02:31:26,819
trade our shitty cannabis taxes and our

3311
02:31:24,209 --> 02:31:29,430
lack of recreational dispensaries and

3312
02:31:26,819 --> 02:31:32,610
Pueblo city limits to allow the other

3313
02:31:29,431 --> 02:31:34,829
states to have a jump on cannabis yeah

3314
02:31:32,610 --> 02:31:36,630
I'll go for that we're covered here in

3315
02:31:34,829 --> 02:31:38,431
public like I feel bad for the city of

3316
02:31:36,629 --> 02:31:40,680
Pueblo is who I feel bad for later I'm

3317
02:31:38,431 --> 02:31:44,040
self-sufficient so a lot of that just

3318
02:31:40,681 --> 02:31:46,530
kind of a lot of us here are but I mean

3319
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:48,750
honestly the city's had three years but

3320
02:31:46,530 --> 02:31:51,391
and also they limited our plant count

3321
02:31:48,750 --> 02:31:53,280
yep yes in the city of Pueblo we were

3322
02:31:51,390 --> 02:31:55,020
allowed to grow we had a hundred square

3323
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:59,340
feet that's still the rule in the city

3324
02:31:55,021 --> 02:32:00,480
it's the county that okay okay County

3325
02:31:59,340 --> 02:32:02,729
just did that is a county commissioner

3326
02:32:00,479 --> 02:32:04,049
rule you guys know that sounds strange

3327
02:32:02,729 --> 02:32:05,399
but the city of Pueblo is like a

3328
02:32:04,049 --> 02:32:09,140
different part of the county the county

3329
02:32:05,399 --> 02:32:09,140
is the outer area that's not like

3330
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:21,849
[Music]

3331
02:32:23,181 --> 02:32:28,351
falling apart yeah so the county is a

3332
02:32:26,370 --> 02:32:30,030
different area so they have a little bit

3333
02:32:28,351 --> 02:32:32,400
different rules and they actually we did

3334
02:32:30,030 --> 02:32:35,370
vote on uniting them there was an option

3335
02:32:32,399 --> 02:32:38,399
Ono's know that that was question one

3336
02:32:35,370 --> 02:32:41,700
see in question one see here in Pueblo

3337
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:45,359
County asked if the county commissioners

3338
02:32:41,700 --> 02:32:49,051
had voter approval to take our

3339
02:32:45,360 --> 02:32:51,989
our current plant cap of 18% property if

3340
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:54,899
they could have our support going to the

3341
02:32:51,989 --> 02:32:57,511
state legislature and arguing to make

3342
02:32:54,899 --> 02:33:00,119
that rule statewide and the only reason

3343
02:32:57,511 --> 02:33:01,890
they put that on the ballot is because

3344
02:33:00,120 --> 02:33:03,841
when county commissioners go to the

3345
02:33:01,890 --> 02:33:07,109
state legislature and say please make

3346
02:33:03,841 --> 02:33:09,750
this rule if they're able to say we put

3347
02:33:07,110 --> 02:33:12,030
it on the ballot and a majority of our

3348
02:33:09,750 --> 02:33:13,920
constituents supported us bringing this

3349
02:33:12,030 --> 02:33:16,920
question to you and asking you to do

3350
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:20,250
this the legislature listens a little

3351
02:33:16,920 --> 02:33:22,771
more closely and that's all question

3352
02:33:20,250 --> 02:33:25,229
once he did was give the county

3353
02:33:22,771 --> 02:33:28,500
commissioners permission to say and the

3354
02:33:25,229 --> 02:33:30,841
voters support us asking this of okay a

3355
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:32,431
lot of people freaked out about that one

3356
02:33:30,841 --> 02:33:33,630
and obviously and all of them fly last

3357
02:33:32,431 --> 02:33:35,370
night

3358
02:33:33,629 --> 02:33:38,220
today when somebody asked me about

3359
02:33:35,370 --> 02:33:40,620
question 1c i spayed I couldn't even

3360
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:42,239
remember what number it was I was

3361
02:33:40,620 --> 02:33:44,490
impressed that you have known as many

3362
02:33:42,239 --> 02:33:47,579
numbers as quickly as you have I've been

3363
02:33:44,489 --> 02:33:49,739
breaking down data all day looking

3364
02:33:47,579 --> 02:33:52,319
because there was a big screw-up you've

3365
02:33:49,739 --> 02:33:55,610
got data eyes you've got that like

3366
02:33:52,319 --> 02:33:58,020
computer screen face when he showed up I

3367
02:33:55,610 --> 02:34:00,181
there was a screw-up in public County

3368
02:33:58,021 --> 02:34:02,641
our our ballot was really really long

3369
02:34:00,181 --> 02:34:04,380
this year it was four pages and so when

3370
02:34:02,640 --> 02:34:06,539
they started running through these

3371
02:34:04,379 --> 02:34:08,520
ballots through the servers for the the

3372
02:34:06,540 --> 02:34:10,860
election department the servers got

3373
02:34:08,521 --> 02:34:12,601
overwhelmed because there was like just

3374
02:34:10,860 --> 02:34:14,790
each chunk of information for each

3375
02:34:12,601 --> 02:34:16,409
ballot was a little bit larger than

3376
02:34:14,790 --> 02:34:19,230
usual because the ballot was twice as

3377
02:34:16,409 --> 02:34:21,360
long and they they're reporting that

3378
02:34:19,229 --> 02:34:23,879
they filled up a server and that the

3379
02:34:21,360 --> 02:34:26,641
State Election Commission had to put a

3380
02:34:23,879 --> 02:34:29,369
server in a van and floor it down here

3381
02:34:26,640 --> 02:34:31,800
yesterday afternoon install the server

3382
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:34,641
run test software on it half the evening

3383
02:34:31,800 --> 02:34:36,899
and fire to back up our local election

3384
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:39,869
department people went home at 3:00 a.m.

3385
02:34:36,899 --> 02:34:43,591
with instructions to report back at 9:00

3386
02:34:39,870 --> 02:34:45,420
Wow yep and so we were crunching as much

3387
02:34:43,591 --> 02:34:48,601
data as we could last night and I've

3388
02:34:45,420 --> 02:34:50,190
been looking at it all day and I still

3389
02:34:48,601 --> 02:34:51,450
hadn't looked at one see with everything

3390
02:34:50,190 --> 02:34:53,460
else that happened last night it was

3391
02:34:51,450 --> 02:34:56,670
such a bizarre election the data is

3392
02:34:53,459 --> 02:34:58,589
really really weird we're seeing

3393
02:34:56,670 --> 02:35:01,889
demographic changes in Colorado

3394
02:34:58,590 --> 02:35:05,719
that we haven't seen in our lifetime the

3395
02:35:01,889 --> 02:35:08,250
population is growing here rapidly

3396
02:35:05,719 --> 02:35:11,250
people that are from here are moving

3397
02:35:08,250 --> 02:35:13,260
there are huge numbers of people from

3398
02:35:11,250 --> 02:35:15,180
around the country that are moving here

3399
02:35:13,260 --> 02:35:17,309
for a variety of reasons and that's

3400
02:35:15,180 --> 02:35:21,840
changing the demographics all over the

3401
02:35:17,309 --> 02:35:24,090
state in ways nobody predicted and then

3402
02:35:21,840 --> 02:35:27,989
nationally no one expected marijuana to

3403
02:35:24,090 --> 02:35:29,939
do this good everybody was hopeful but

3404
02:35:27,989 --> 02:35:32,369
nationally marijuana just crushed it

3405
02:35:29,939 --> 02:35:33,510
so I want to ask one more local just a

3406
02:35:32,370 --> 02:35:34,890
quick one and then we'll get off the

3407
02:35:33,510 --> 02:35:36,000
local stuff you guys I know we probably

3408
02:35:34,889 --> 02:35:37,099
bore the [ __ ] out you guys were just

3409
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:39,659
local but then we're gonna talk about

3410
02:35:37,100 --> 02:35:40,920
well they do shout out hashtag we like

3411
02:35:39,659 --> 02:35:42,689
it when they like it when you ramble

3412
02:35:40,920 --> 02:35:45,319
we're gonna talk about new states in

3413
02:35:42,689 --> 02:35:48,389
just one second but on the Colorado

3414
02:35:45,319 --> 02:35:50,010
option yet mic signal isn't gonna kill

3415
02:35:48,389 --> 02:35:52,559
me I'm gonna take a DAB before we get to

3416
02:35:50,010 --> 02:35:54,889
the national stuff now there you go on

3417
02:35:52,559 --> 02:35:57,779
the the ballot was a question about

3418
02:35:54,889 --> 02:35:59,789
basically assisted suicide what the law

3419
02:35:57,780 --> 02:36:01,439
basically said was if a person is deemed

3420
02:35:59,790 --> 02:36:03,810
excuse me I'm gonna birth let me just

3421
02:36:01,439 --> 02:36:04,200
get it out of the way okay I'm better

3422
02:36:03,809 --> 02:36:06,750
now

3423
02:36:04,200 --> 02:36:08,700
way better excuse me it smells like dank

3424
02:36:06,750 --> 02:36:11,459
ass pizza - I apologize if that hits you

3425
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:13,680
Mike cuz it was ripe so on the on the

3426
02:36:11,459 --> 02:36:16,099
ballot there was I'm calling it the

3427
02:36:13,680 --> 02:36:21,720
assisted suicide

3428
02:36:16,100 --> 02:36:22,859
totally fair description if you're

3429
02:36:21,719 --> 02:36:24,510
terminally ill and you're gonna die

3430
02:36:22,859 --> 02:36:27,090
within six months and I think it takes

3431
02:36:24,510 --> 02:36:29,939
two doctors to verify this and you can't

3432
02:36:27,090 --> 02:36:32,280
be mentally ill you have to be like this

3433
02:36:29,939 --> 02:36:34,409
I'm sound mind to say that this is what

3434
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:37,109
you want we're only the third or fourth

3435
02:36:34,409 --> 02:36:39,898
maybe the fifth state to do anything

3436
02:36:37,109 --> 02:36:42,960
like this and so the law is very very

3437
02:36:39,898 --> 02:36:47,250
careful and meticulous about the process

3438
02:36:42,959 --> 02:36:49,349
for this and there was a lot of anti I

3439
02:36:47,250 --> 02:36:51,299
can't remember the note that the ballot

3440
02:36:49,350 --> 02:36:54,960
issue for this one but the opposition

3441
02:36:51,299 --> 02:36:57,329
campaign their main argument was if your

3442
02:36:54,959 --> 02:37:00,719
shitty children will euthanize you to

3443
02:36:57,329 --> 02:37:02,760
get their inheritance quicker was the

3444
02:37:00,719 --> 02:37:04,920
argument and when people were like but

3445
02:37:02,760 --> 02:37:07,590
the doctors part they were like well

3446
02:37:04,920 --> 02:37:10,049
they'll just pay the doctor more no no

3447
02:37:07,590 --> 02:37:11,850
not okay did you silly side note we

3448
02:37:10,049 --> 02:37:13,250
can't get a doctor to write an extended

3449
02:37:11,850 --> 02:37:15,720
play

3450
02:37:13,250 --> 02:37:17,010
they're not gonna risk their license for

3451
02:37:15,719 --> 02:37:18,478
a plant they're definitely not gonna

3452
02:37:17,010 --> 02:37:20,850
risk their license to [ __ ] kill you

3453
02:37:18,478 --> 02:37:23,699
that is not gonna it was just a silly

3454
02:37:20,850 --> 02:37:26,909
argument and I know everybody's belief

3455
02:37:23,700 --> 02:37:28,319
saw on this are gonna vary but I mean

3456
02:37:26,909 --> 02:37:30,090
because you brought it up I don't mind

3457
02:37:28,318 --> 02:37:32,129
telling the listeners that I 100%

3458
02:37:30,090 --> 02:37:34,260
support I had filled in that bubble yes

3459
02:37:32,129 --> 02:37:36,478
really strong I was in let's do that I

3460
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:37,800
watched a family member a shot it's my

3461
02:37:36,478 --> 02:37:39,269
grandma my grandma had a stroke my

3462
02:37:37,799 --> 02:37:41,099
grandma was a very dignified woman

3463
02:37:39,270 --> 02:37:43,260
choose bad as [ __ ] she raised six kids

3464
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:44,520
she worked until pretty much the day she

3465
02:37:43,260 --> 02:37:46,380
fell down and had a stroke she had a

3466
02:37:44,520 --> 02:37:47,909
solid job she took care of the family

3467
02:37:46,379 --> 02:37:49,679
she took good care of her husband she

3468
02:37:47,909 --> 02:37:52,170
did good care of the grandkids that's me

3469
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:54,568
one day she had a stroke she was

3470
02:37:52,170 --> 02:37:56,430
paralyzed on her left side she hated

3471
02:37:54,568 --> 02:37:58,680
that she wanted to get up and do laundry

3472
02:37:56,430 --> 02:38:00,450
and [ __ ] cook for us and do what

3473
02:37:58,680 --> 02:38:00,750
grandma did how she couldn't do it

3474
02:38:00,450 --> 02:38:04,050
anymore

3475
02:38:00,750 --> 02:38:05,850
I swear that why I'd go visit her in the

3476
02:38:04,049 --> 02:38:07,289
nursing home she looked me straight now

3477
02:38:05,850 --> 02:38:09,090
and then look at the plug for her

3478
02:38:07,290 --> 02:38:11,970
machines like you're the only one that

3479
02:38:09,090 --> 02:38:13,978
would have the plug for me Jeff that's

3480
02:38:11,969 --> 02:38:15,840
what my grandma was saying to me she was

3481
02:38:13,978 --> 02:38:18,239
she did not want to live and she

3482
02:38:15,840 --> 02:38:20,780
couldn't speak she could speak there's

3483
02:38:18,239 --> 02:38:23,299
so many instances in this country where

3484
02:38:20,780 --> 02:38:25,710
for one reason or another we

3485
02:38:23,299 --> 02:38:31,049
significantly prolonged suffering here

3486
02:38:25,709 --> 02:38:32,789
for absolutely no it's almost like of

3487
02:38:31,049 --> 02:38:35,728
course I wanted my grandma still but I

3488
02:38:32,790 --> 02:38:38,460
did not want to have to have grandma

3489
02:38:35,728 --> 02:38:40,228
miserable right if I would if she could

3490
02:38:38,459 --> 02:38:42,079
speak if I would have [ __ ] held

3491
02:38:40,228 --> 02:38:46,739
something up say grandma unplug or plug

3492
02:38:42,079 --> 02:38:50,609
[ __ ] momentum she could generate with

3493
02:38:46,739 --> 02:38:55,020
whatever yeah member with Parkinson's

3494
02:38:50,609 --> 02:38:57,989
and part of them coming to terms and

3495
02:38:55,020 --> 02:39:01,770
kind of figuring out how to live after

3496
02:38:57,989 --> 02:39:03,449
that diagnosis was setting up basically

3497
02:39:01,770 --> 02:39:07,050
with a number of people in their life

3498
02:39:03,450 --> 02:39:09,630
that if the time comes that I want to go

3499
02:39:07,049 --> 02:39:11,688
like will you help me acquire whatever I

3500
02:39:09,629 --> 02:39:14,339
have to acquire to get that done

3501
02:39:11,689 --> 02:39:16,680
because this law didn't exist right

3502
02:39:14,340 --> 02:39:19,799
because their only option was to

3503
02:39:16,680 --> 02:39:21,030
continue to wither away while they were

3504
02:39:19,799 --> 02:39:22,529
a hundred percent aware of their body

3505
02:39:21,030 --> 02:39:26,700
collapsing around them I mean it was

3506
02:39:22,530 --> 02:39:28,409
it's an incredibly brutal diagnosis

3507
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:30,319
this issue was closed to me and I was

3508
02:39:28,409 --> 02:39:32,549
glad I was thrilled that it passed with

3509
02:39:30,318 --> 02:39:34,199
crushed it last night it passed with

3510
02:39:32,549 --> 02:39:36,989
two-thirds of the vote okay

3511
02:39:34,200 --> 02:39:38,520
it would just win a one in a landslide

3512
02:39:36,989 --> 02:39:40,648
that's that's one that I strongly

3513
02:39:38,520 --> 02:39:42,450
supported because I'm gonna get old one

3514
02:39:40,648 --> 02:39:43,920
day and I don't need anybody I don't

3515
02:39:42,450 --> 02:39:47,279

an option you were doing that yeah yeah

the right to live free freedom alright

3535
02:40:36,840 --> 02:40:39,719

3536
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:41,880
hinting at we didn't even mention the

3537

3541
02:40:52,978 --> 02:40:58,709
in 2017 we've got coming out of the gate

3542
02:40:56,129 --> 02:41:01,589
with fresh cannabis um the first big

3543
02:40:58,709 --> 02:41:04,019

spent together Florida welcome to the

3548
02:41:13,920 --> 02:41:19,200
club Florida it's about time it was nice

3549
02:41:17,879 --> 02:41:21,509
to see a lot of the stuff we're talking

3550
02:41:19,200 --> 02:41:25,140
about tonight was East Coast yeah yeah

3551
02:41:21,510 --> 02:41:27,630
even Bible Belt a Rhode Island past a

3552
02:41:25,139 --> 02:41:29,519
marijuana initiative didn't they have

3553
02:41:27,629 --> 02:41:34,839
one I mean mean is who I'm thinking of

3554
02:41:29,520 --> 02:41:37,229
Maine Maine is amazing okay right now

3555
02:41:34,840 --> 02:41:41,559
they're a recreational legalization

3556
02:41:37,229 --> 02:41:44,319
state right now that question is winning

3557
02:41:41,559 --> 02:41:46,529
by a tiny tiny percentage so it's been

3558
02:41:44,319 --> 02:41:50,229
24 hours they're still counting [ __ ] yep

3559
02:41:46,530 --> 02:41:52,420
[ __ ] Maine this is back to every

3560
02:41:50,229 --> 02:41:54,340
single vote counts they're counting

3561
02:41:52,420 --> 02:41:56,350
absentee ballots they're counting the

3562
02:41:54,340 --> 02:41:59,799
military ballots counting the fishermen

3563
02:41:56,350 --> 02:42:02,020
ballots and in a lot of places for no

3564
02:41:59,799 --> 02:42:04,379
reason whatsoever people waited till

3565
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:07,270
yesterday to vote when they had

3566
02:42:04,379 --> 02:42:08,469
significant other onions and so I mean

3567
02:42:07,270 --> 02:42:10,810
people were still voting at 8 o'clock

3568
02:42:08,469 --> 02:42:12,639
last night and then it's at 8 o'clock or

3569
02:42:10,809 --> 02:42:15,389
7 o'clock or whatever the polls close

3570
02:42:12,639 --> 02:42:18,939
they start counting the ballots then

3571
02:42:15,389 --> 02:42:21,099
they don't start like it'll get it

3572
02:42:18,940 --> 02:42:23,829
[ __ ] funny for the most part they

3573
02:42:21,100 --> 02:42:25,899
don't even get a jump on it and that's

3574
02:42:23,829 --> 02:42:29,670
part of the reason and the history are

3575
02:42:25,899 --> 02:42:33,340
they [ __ ] that's part of the reason why

3576
02:42:29,670 --> 02:42:34,960
this stuff is so slow and it's part of

3577
02:42:33,340 --> 02:42:38,649
the reason why you don't see early vote

3578
02:42:34,959 --> 02:42:41,229
totals for votes cast anywhere like I

3579
02:42:38,649 --> 02:42:42,819
vote he's like three weeks ago yeah like

3580
02:42:41,229 --> 02:42:44,909
two days after my ballot arrived I

3581
02:42:42,819 --> 02:42:47,680
mailed it in tonight at the third debate

3582
02:42:44,909 --> 02:42:50,110
my wife had some wine I enjoyed some

3583
02:42:47,680 --> 02:42:51,760
cannabis we watched the debate we just

3584
02:42:50,110 --> 02:42:54,010
talked about a half an hour to process

3585
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:55,899
what the [ __ ] we just watched and then

3586
02:42:54,010 --> 02:42:57,250
we went through our ballot and it was a

3587
02:42:55,899 --> 02:42:58,840
long ballot so it took like two hours

3588
02:42:57,250 --> 02:43:01,209
and there was a lot of freaking out

3589
02:42:58,840 --> 02:43:02,889
while we did it but I they make it real

3590
02:43:01,209 --> 02:43:04,209
easy in Colorado and then there was this

3591
02:43:02,889 --> 02:43:06,519
like two and a half three week period

3592
02:43:04,209 --> 02:43:08,229
where you know they [ __ ] got votes

3593
02:43:06,520 --> 02:43:10,479
they just won't tell you what they say

3594
02:43:08,229 --> 02:43:12,279
yet it's real frustrating when you're

3595
02:43:10,479 --> 02:43:13,930
doing election work because that's

3596
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:16,000
information that you could use I was

3597
02:43:13,930 --> 02:43:17,290
gonna say they don't want to sway any

3598
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:19,510
yeah that's part of the reason they

3599
02:43:17,290 --> 02:43:22,060
don't do it is because if I say Jeff's

3600
02:43:19,510 --> 02:43:24,159
winning over Mike by 10 votes all of a

3601
02:43:22,059 --> 02:43:28,239
sudden Mike's supporters have a rallying

3602
02:43:24,159 --> 02:43:29,680
try to get more people vote and that's I

3603
02:43:28,239 --> 02:43:31,239
think that's part of what we saw

3604
02:43:29,680 --> 02:43:33,340
nationally last night how many people

3605
02:43:31,239 --> 02:43:36,549
saw things saying Hillary was 85 percent

3606
02:43:33,340 --> 02:43:39,250
to win two or three days ago on national

3607
02:43:36,549 --> 02:43:40,719
media so when when is the next we got

3608
02:43:39,250 --> 02:43:42,280
four years to the next election when it

3609
02:43:40,719 --> 02:43:44,349
when can I start getting people to

3610
02:43:42,280 --> 02:43:45,970
register to vote again I know I just

3611
02:43:44,350 --> 02:43:47,620
totally tried right your idea yeah they

3612
02:43:45,969 --> 02:43:49,270
go immediately they could do that now

3613
02:43:47,620 --> 02:43:51,460
for the next for the 2020 election

3614
02:43:49,271 --> 02:44:01,630
Michael Franti runs for president yep

3615
02:43:51,459 --> 02:44:03,100
the Franti warned Michael Franti from

3616
02:44:01,629 --> 02:44:23,439

3631
02:45:01,780 --> 02:45:09,851
went medical like this is spreading in

3632
02:45:06,489 --> 02:45:13,030
ways that are were unheard of five years

3633
02:45:09,851 --> 02:45:15,940
ago yeah states that were guaranteed to

3634
02:45:13,030 --> 02:45:21,190
never liberalize their marijuana laws

3635
02:45:15,940 --> 02:45:24,069
are now doing so I mean it ending

3636
02:45:21,190 --> 02:45:26,530
numbers that are shocking so those are

3637

that live in California that are on both

3653
02:46:06,819 --> 02:46:10,299
sides of the industry the big business

3654
02:46:08,379 --> 02:46:13,810
side the small business side the last

3655
02:46:10,299 --> 02:46:16,229
two months saw the existing industry

3656
02:46:13,810 --> 02:46:20,319
pairing up with national anti marijuana

3657
02:46:16,229 --> 02:46:23,289
forces to fight amendment 64 or

3658
02:46:20,319 --> 02:46:25,690
proposition 64 in California the the the

up with projects am bucking Kevin Sabet

3662
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:34,209
and Patrick Kennedy's nightmare of an

3663
02:46:32,260 --> 02:46:37,210
anti marijuana group to fight

3664
02:46:34,209 --> 02:46:40,209
legalization in California largely for

3665
02:46:37,209 --> 02:46:42,699
economic reasons if marijuana is legal

3666
02:46:40,209 --> 02:46:44,709
in in real companies can invest real

3667
02:46:42,700 --> 02:46:46,329
money and open real businesses and it's

3668
02:46:44,709 --> 02:46:48,939
really regulated and it's really lab

3669
02:46:46,329 --> 02:46:53,379
tested I can't grow weed in my basement

3670

guys that happened to it I know a lot of

3674
02:46:58,780 --> 02:47:03,610
people a balloon caller made us have to

3675
02:47:00,790 --> 02:47:05,801
become master growers at facilities and

3676
02:47:03,610 --> 02:47:07,120
and always have income it's like I'm

3677
02:47:05,800 --> 02:47:09,390
sorry but that's the point of

3678
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:12,820
legalization

3679
02:47:09,390 --> 02:47:13,750
we're not legalizing marijuana because

3680
02:47:12,819 --> 02:47:17,319
we can't get it

3681
02:47:13,750 --> 02:47:20,319
we're not legalizing marijuana because

3682
02:47:17,319 --> 02:47:23,351
it's hard to find or because it was too

3683
02:47:20,319 --> 02:47:25,750
difficult to to call my [ __ ] dealer

3684
02:47:23,351 --> 02:47:28,540
on my way to work and make sure he was

3685
02:47:25,750 --> 02:47:31,290
gonna be around after work we're doing

3686
02:47:28,540 --> 02:47:34,410
it because we're sick of that

3687
02:47:31,290 --> 02:47:36,240
we want legal we want lab tested we want

3688
02:47:34,409 --> 02:47:37,829
to be able to swing by this store on our

3689
02:47:36,239 --> 02:47:39,899
way home just like we do for the milk

3693
02:47:43,110 --> 02:47:48,510
friend when I want to buy sneakers like

3694

he's not answering my texts right now

3696

cuz he's with some hot new chick so I

3697
02:47:52,290 --> 02:47:56,311
can buy a jacket I don't know why people

3698
02:47:55,079 --> 02:48:01,829
are still willing to do this at a

3699
02:47:56,310 --> 02:48:03,840
concert that marijuana it can be on like

3700
02:48:01,829 --> 02:48:06,239
the reddit marijuana forums and stuff

3701
02:48:03,840 --> 02:48:08,489
you see people bitching about dealer

3702
02:48:06,239 --> 02:48:13,409
etiquette customer etiquette constantly

3703
02:48:08,489 --> 02:48:16,110
that's its Lea its I would have to if I

3704
02:48:13,409 --> 02:48:17,729
didn't keep up with parts of the online

3705
02:48:16,110 --> 02:48:20,101
community that are still in illegal

3706
02:48:17,729 --> 02:48:22,350
states um that still have to deal with

3707
02:48:20,101 --> 02:48:24,630
it do you remember when you were always

3708
02:48:22,351 --> 02:48:27,060
wondering if the person you were meeting

3709
02:48:24,629 --> 02:48:29,489
up with was gonna have either the money

3710
02:48:27,060 --> 02:48:31,020
or the pot product they told you they

3711
02:48:29,489 --> 02:48:34,079
were you have to you if they were gonna

3712
02:48:31,021 --> 02:48:36,989
have two homies in a knife or a gun you

3713
02:48:34,079 --> 02:48:38,640
just never know yeah oh that's gone like

3714
02:48:36,989 --> 02:48:40,860
when you buy jeans you don't wander if

3715
02:48:38,640 --> 02:48:43,020
you're gonna get robbed when you go buy

3716
02:48:40,860 --> 02:48:44,880
a Big Mac you don't have to arrange it

3717
02:48:43,021 --> 02:48:46,170
first and then wait outside and then

3718
02:48:44,879 --> 02:48:48,629
hang out for two hours so you don't look

3719
02:48:46,170 --> 02:48:50,610
like foot traffic have exact change yep

3720
02:48:48,629 --> 02:48:52,079
you don't have to carry drumsticks in

3721
02:48:50,610 --> 02:48:53,579
and out with you every time pretending

3722
02:48:52,079 --> 02:48:56,010
like you're taking [ __ ] drum lessons

3723
02:48:53,579 --> 02:48:58,351
you can just go to the store buy your

3724
02:48:56,010 --> 02:49:00,899
marijuana know that it's not filled with

3725
02:48:58,351 --> 02:49:04,829
pesticides or spider mite eggs go home

3726
02:49:00,899 --> 02:49:06,029
and enjoy it and it's that's why we're

3727
02:49:04,829 --> 02:49:07,860
doing it and it comes with a lot of

3728
02:49:06,030 --> 02:49:10,110
benefit if you are a weirdo looking dude

3729
02:49:07,860 --> 02:49:12,300
and you're carrying around portions of

3730
02:49:10,110 --> 02:49:14,280
things that you need concealed a guitar

3731
02:49:12,299 --> 02:49:16,770
case is my favorite way to do that type

3732
02:49:14,280 --> 02:49:19,610
of [ __ ] out in the open [ __ ] got a

3733
02:49:16,771 --> 02:49:21,840
big ol guitar case filled with whatever

3734
02:49:19,610 --> 02:49:24,720
well mine's usually a little more

3735
02:49:21,840 --> 02:49:26,880
peaceful I used to put a lot of good

3736
02:49:24,719 --> 02:49:28,529
shoot in there drumsticks and stuff oh

3737
02:49:26,879 --> 02:49:30,180
yeah yeah but if you've got a lot of

3738
02:49:28,530 --> 02:49:31,620
drumsticks that you need like vacuum

3739
02:49:30,181 --> 02:49:33,000
seal and wrap real tight you could fit a

3740
02:49:31,620 --> 02:49:33,990
lot of them in a guitar case and it just

3741
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:36,090
looks normally you can just walk around

3742
02:49:33,989 --> 02:49:38,879
with it like a [ __ ] hippie with a

3743
02:49:36,090 --> 02:49:40,739
guitar case it's no question unless

3744
02:49:38,879 --> 02:49:43,819
someone wants to steal your guitar or or

3745
02:49:40,739 --> 02:49:43,819
a chick wants you to play a song

3746

recreational marijuana state

02:50:03,780 --> 02:50:11,300
Massachusetts bringing up our first

3751
02:50:05,940 --> 02:50:14,610
Eastcote East Coast [ __ ] yep this

3752
02:50:11,299 --> 02:50:16,469
mass was a really really contested race

3753
02:50:14,610 --> 02:50:19,140
there were there's a lot of outside

3754
02:50:16,469 --> 02:50:20,670
money there were a lot of outside it's

3755
02:50:19,139 --> 02:50:23,219
high marijuana groups throwing their

3756
02:50:20,670 --> 02:50:24,420
their two cents and their reefer madness

3757
02:50:23,219 --> 02:50:26,819
at the issue there

3758
02:50:24,420 --> 02:50:28,260
I've spent a little bit of time in

3759
02:50:26,819 --> 02:50:30,750
Massachusetts one of my best friends on

3760
02:50:28,260 --> 02:50:33,030
the planet so I went to high school and

3761
02:50:30,750 --> 02:50:35,940
after high school I went on Phish tour

3762
02:50:33,030 --> 02:50:37,110
and then did some panic shows and 90% of

3763
02:50:35,940 --> 02:50:38,460
that time sitting next to me in the

3764
02:50:37,110 --> 02:50:39,989
passenger seat or the driver's seat

3765
02:50:38,459 --> 02:50:42,419
occasionally it was my buddy robbed the

3766
02:50:39,989 --> 02:50:44,639
dude shoutout to rob the dude and he is

3767
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:45,960
in Massachusetts he's a Masshole one

3768
02:50:44,639 --> 02:50:49,260
summer we did a bunch of widespread

3769
02:50:45,959 --> 02:50:51,719
panic shows from New Mexico all the way

3770
02:50:49,260 --> 02:50:53,729
to Boston and we missed a couple shows

3771
02:50:51,719 --> 02:50:56,670
cuz the car broke but we had a good ass

3772
02:50:53,729 --> 02:50:57,840
time but he moved to Quincy mass I think

3773
02:50:56,670 --> 02:51:00,030
was kind of where he moved to

3774
02:50:57,840 --> 02:51:01,799
and we went to Boston and we went all

3775
02:51:00,030 --> 02:51:03,810
over Massachusetts and that's a

3776
02:51:01,799 --> 02:51:05,129
conservative place I'm a LOB's at the

3777
02:51:03,809 --> 02:51:07,170
time I didn't have dreadlocks I just had

3778
02:51:05,129 --> 02:51:08,879
long filthy hair and I was weren't a

3779
02:51:07,170 --> 02:51:10,860
Phish t-shirt and like patchwork pants

3780
02:51:08,879 --> 02:51:12,329
and I probably either had skate shoes or

3781
02:51:10,860 --> 02:51:14,940
no shoes because that's how I used to

3782
02:51:12,329 --> 02:51:19,829
roll and Abell massachusetts gave me the

3783
02:51:14,940 --> 02:51:25,440
like man's one big cherry creek like was

3784
02:51:19,829 --> 02:51:27,860
like not for sure all of the places my

3785
02:51:25,440 --> 02:51:30,030
buddy Rob took me to felt very uh

3786
02:51:27,860 --> 02:51:31,290
everything was overpriced and the cars

3787
02:51:30,030 --> 02:51:33,480
were a little nicer than I should be

3788
02:51:31,290 --> 02:51:35,010
driving and yeah I felt out of place at

3789
02:51:33,479 --> 02:51:36,119
the time but anyway shout out to rob the

3790
02:51:35,010 --> 02:51:38,280
dieter Brock I'm glad that you can get

3791
02:51:36,120 --> 02:51:40,230
yourself some some legal cannabis here

3792
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:42,329
next year we do a shout out for mass

3793
02:51:40,229 --> 02:51:45,059
joining the club and bike shut up the

3794
02:51:42,329 --> 02:51:47,610
bike also Nevada

3795
02:51:45,059 --> 02:51:50,209
now they've got legal casinos legal

3796
02:51:47,610 --> 02:51:52,440
prostitution and legal weed

3797
02:51:50,209 --> 02:51:57,179
congratulations Nevada that's awesome

3798
02:51:52,440 --> 02:52:00,300
yeah and Nevada's law their wreck now

3799
02:51:57,180 --> 02:52:02,760
but their medical law really pushed the

3800
02:52:00,299 --> 02:52:05,009
envelope as far as what's allowed what's

3801
02:52:02,760 --> 02:52:07,139
not allowed okay with reciprocity they

3802
02:52:05,010 --> 02:52:08,670
were one of the few places you could

3803
02:52:07,139 --> 02:52:11,519
take your med card from any other

3804
02:52:08,670 --> 02:52:15,030
medical state walk into a Nevada medical

3805
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:17,909
marijuana shop and purchase medical

3806
02:52:15,030 --> 02:52:19,650
marijuana in Nevada like I can't do that

3807
02:52:17,909 --> 02:52:20,879
in California with my Colorado card you

3808
02:52:19,649 --> 02:52:23,729
can't do that in Colorado with the

3809
02:52:20,879 --> 02:52:25,889
California card nice reciprocity is rare

3810
02:52:23,729 --> 02:52:27,719
in Nevada was the first one to step up

3811
02:52:25,889 --> 02:52:31,529
so I was not surprised to see them go

3812
02:52:27,719 --> 02:52:33,929
legal marijuana um a lot of the anti

3813
02:52:31,530 --> 02:52:36,810
marijuana money spent in this campaign

3814
02:52:33,930 --> 02:52:41,309
came from casinos I'm not necessarily

3815
02:52:36,809 --> 02:52:44,489
those in Nevada but that's one of those

3816
02:52:41,309 --> 02:52:47,459
anti marijuana funding points that's

3817
02:52:44,489 --> 02:52:48,750
common and that's gonna start changing

3818
02:52:47,459 --> 02:52:54,239
into that and now why wouldn't they want

3819
02:52:48,750 --> 02:52:55,770
me to get super blazed and Gamble common

3820
02:52:54,239 --> 02:52:58,030
wisdom is because you'd spend more if

3821
02:52:55,770 --> 02:53:00,850
you were drinking

3822
02:52:58,030 --> 02:53:04,659
yes I wouldn't I don't go because I

3823
02:53:00,850 --> 02:53:06,790
can't get blazed in yeah if I can if I

3824
02:53:04,659 --> 02:53:08,619
could just safely go to my own like

3825
02:53:06,790 --> 02:53:12,250
Vegas until now either if there was a

3826
02:53:08,620 --> 02:53:15,010
place where I could go like either smoke

3827
02:53:12,250 --> 02:53:20,649
a joint or take a couple dabs away from

3828
02:53:15,010 --> 02:53:22,750
the casino floor right for that much

3829
02:53:20,649 --> 02:53:24,369
last time I was in the casino they kept

3830
02:53:22,750 --> 02:53:28,319
bringing me a new ashtray like every

3831
02:53:24,370 --> 02:53:30,490
four minutes and [ __ ] smokers that was

3832
02:53:28,319 --> 02:53:32,590
like we're all gonna get cancer and die

3833
02:53:30,489 --> 02:53:34,000
together a little stronghold stabbing at

3834
02:53:32,590 --> 02:53:35,469
the slot machine would just get reckless

3835
02:53:34,000 --> 02:53:36,790
for me because there's that couple of

3836
02:53:35,469 --> 02:53:38,619
minutes right after you take it bad

3837
02:53:36,790 --> 02:53:40,030
where the world is like spinning and

3838
02:53:38,620 --> 02:53:41,170
you're like oh [ __ ] I don't need to be

3839
02:53:40,030 --> 02:53:43,150
right at the machine there I need to

3840
02:53:41,170 --> 02:53:44,649
check out that's part of why I go off

3841
02:53:43,149 --> 02:53:46,029
and dab somewhere so I can just check

3842
02:53:44,649 --> 02:53:46,479
out what's going on so you taking a

3843
02:53:46,030 --> 02:53:49,030
lunch break

3844
02:53:46,479 --> 02:53:51,010
yep just go [ __ ] be somewhere that's

3845
02:53:49,030 --> 02:53:52,420
not loud and [ __ ] happen in that you can

3846
02:53:51,010 --> 02:53:54,670
just [ __ ] shut your brain up take

3847
02:53:52,420 --> 02:54:01,750
couple dabs and then you got a slowly

3848
02:53:54,670 --> 02:54:02,950
reenter I would love to if I had a place

3849
02:54:01,750 --> 02:54:04,899
where I could just go take a couple

3850
02:54:02,950 --> 02:54:06,550
dad's you're smoking joint and then go

3851
02:54:04,899 --> 02:54:08,409
back to the tables I'd actually go back

3852
02:54:06,549 --> 02:54:09,849
up to Blackhawk and stuff again or Vegas

3853
02:54:08,409 --> 02:54:11,950
would hold a little more interest for me

3854
02:54:09,850 --> 02:54:13,720
write it as it is now it's like yeah I

3855
02:54:11,950 --> 02:54:16,870
get to go drive all my drunk friends

3856
02:54:13,719 --> 02:54:19,029
around so that's a nice change I'm proud

3857
02:54:16,870 --> 02:54:21,910
of Nevada and then the last one on the

3858
02:54:19,030 --> 02:54:23,530
lid the the maybe list is Maine and we

3859
02:54:21,909 --> 02:54:25,780
choose this one a little bit earlier the

3860
02:54:23,530 --> 02:54:30,100
state of Maine is currently in a very

3861
02:54:25,780 --> 02:54:32,680
very tight race the anti marijuana focus

3862
02:54:30,100 --> 02:54:34,390
in Maine have already sworn to take this

3863
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:37,329
one there you know they're gonna take it

3864
02:54:34,389 --> 02:54:38,289
to court and ask for a recount and make

3865
02:54:37,329 --> 02:54:41,379
sure that the votes were tallied

3866
02:54:38,290 --> 02:54:42,460
correctly that's step one and then

3867
02:54:41,379 --> 02:54:44,199
they'll go from there

3868
02:54:42,459 --> 02:54:46,239
that's how close it is because it's it's

3869
02:54:44,200 --> 02:54:51,100
within a I think it's within 3,000 votes

3870
02:54:46,239 --> 02:54:54,819
total in the last news report I saw said

3871
02:54:51,100 --> 02:54:58,350
one of the counties that had gone I'm

3872
02:54:54,819 --> 02:55:01,989
under majority no vote for legalization

3873
02:54:58,350 --> 02:55:03,670
they found like another 2700 ballots at

3874
02:55:01,989 --> 02:55:06,610
like absentee ballots that might have

3875
02:55:03,670 --> 02:55:08,079
not been counted and so there's little

3876
02:55:06,610 --> 02:55:09,400
things like that that they're squeezing

3877
02:55:08,079 --> 02:55:11,409
through and making sure everything gets

3878
02:55:09,399 --> 02:55:15,069
cleaned up that could put

3879
02:55:11,409 --> 02:55:17,351
in the no column anti legalization

3880
02:55:15,069 --> 02:55:20,260
people are anti marijuana people are

3881
02:55:17,351 --> 02:55:22,120
already calling Maine a win because the

3882
02:55:20,260 --> 02:55:25,450
big bad marijuana industry didn't win in

3883
02:55:22,120 --> 02:55:27,430
a landslide because it's a tight race

3884
02:55:25,450 --> 02:55:29,141
because they can legally contest it and

3885
02:55:27,430 --> 02:55:32,079
ask for a recount they're putting that

3886
02:55:29,140 --> 02:55:33,940
one in the win column unfortunately

3887
02:55:32,079 --> 02:55:36,760
they're putting it next to Arizona which

3888
02:55:33,940 --> 02:55:40,090
belongs in their win column legalization

3889
02:55:36,760 --> 02:55:43,479
got crushed in Arizona yeah lost by a

3890
02:55:40,090 --> 02:55:45,930
good chunk of the vote my guess is it

3891
02:55:43,479 --> 02:55:49,060
had to do specifically with that issue

3892
02:55:45,930 --> 02:55:52,450
like we just group these is medical

3893
02:55:49,060 --> 02:55:55,209
states and rec states every law in all

3894
02:55:52,450 --> 02:55:57,010
the states we listed is different they

3895
02:55:55,209 --> 02:56:00,579
do the same thing in very very different

3896
02:55:57,010 --> 02:56:04,329
ways and the success of the vote often

3897
02:56:00,579 --> 02:56:06,579
depends on the nuances there had

3898
02:56:04,329 --> 02:56:08,560
Colorado's amendment 64 been worded

3899
02:56:06,579 --> 02:56:10,659
differently might not have passed right

3900
02:56:08,560 --> 02:56:11,219
I'm same thing with all the votes last

3901
02:56:10,659 --> 02:56:13,569
night

3902
02:56:11,219 --> 02:56:15,670
and I think that's part of what we're

3903
02:56:13,569 --> 02:56:17,920
seeing in Arizona they also had a

3904
02:56:15,670 --> 02:56:22,149
shitload of money thrown at they're an

3905
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:24,101
anti legalization campaign I want to say

3906
02:56:22,149 --> 02:56:27,459
half a million from discounts higher in

3907
02:56:24,101 --> 02:56:30,280
two million from Sheldon Adelson guys I

3908
02:56:27,459 --> 02:56:31,810
usually don't I do endorse companies I

3909
02:56:30,280 --> 02:56:35,340
don't dis endorse companies very often

3910
02:56:31,810 --> 02:56:35,340
other than this [ __ ] headphone amp

3911
02:56:35,729 --> 02:56:39,609
I've got one that works now this one is

3912
02:56:38,079 --> 02:56:41,969
why I'm not gonna curse it never mind

3913
02:56:39,610 --> 02:56:44,110
but discount tire can eat my ass

3914
02:56:41,969 --> 02:56:45,670
discount tire is a place where you go to

3915
02:56:44,110 --> 02:56:46,659
get discount Tires just pay regular

3916
02:56:45,670 --> 02:56:47,649
price with [ __ ] tires because a

3917
02:56:46,659 --> 02:56:48,700
discount tire isn't giving you a

3918
02:56:47,649 --> 02:56:50,409
discount anyway they just put the word

3919
02:56:48,700 --> 02:56:52,450
discount in there to trick you they

3920
02:56:50,409 --> 02:56:55,090
contributed heavily to keep you cannabis

3921
02:56:52,450 --> 02:56:56,680
illegal they make tires why don't they

3922
02:56:55,090 --> 02:57:01,030
give a [ __ ] if cannabis is illegal or

3923
02:56:56,680 --> 02:57:04,840
not if you if this is for everybody keep

3924
02:57:01,030 --> 02:57:06,730
an eye out for who supports what um

3925
02:57:04,840 --> 02:57:09,280
you'll be shocked how many companies

3926
02:57:06,729 --> 02:57:13,119
that you spend money out money at

3927
02:57:09,280 --> 02:57:15,280
actively take your money shake your hand

3928
02:57:13,120 --> 02:57:19,271
turn around and spend the money you just

3929
02:57:15,280 --> 02:57:22,760
put in their pocket against you here

3930
02:57:19,271 --> 02:57:25,400
locally we had a number of companies

3931
02:57:22,760 --> 02:57:27,860
the marijuana industry was actively

3932
02:57:25,399 --> 02:57:30,289
supporting like by choice kinda as a

3933
02:57:27,860 --> 02:57:34,040
group that is it turns out have been

3934
02:57:30,290 --> 02:57:37,101
actively trying to dismantle us and so

3935
02:57:34,040 --> 02:57:40,550
industry-wide there's been shifts and

3936
02:57:37,101 --> 02:57:42,771
who we advertise with here who use for

3937
02:57:40,549 --> 02:57:45,859
trash service here who we use for

3938
02:57:42,771 --> 02:57:48,800
construction work here we [ __ ] shop

3939
02:57:45,860 --> 02:57:51,730
for meat there's a I mean a couple of

3940
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:55,520
people came out actively against us and

3941
02:57:51,729 --> 02:57:57,680
I mean elections have consequences your

3942
02:57:55,521 --> 02:58:01,579
your public support and announcement of

3943
02:57:57,681 --> 02:58:03,950
things have consequences and this is

3944
02:58:01,579 --> 02:58:06,379
true in your area as well as smears pay

3945
02:58:03,950 --> 02:58:11,840
attention to politics this stuff affects

3946
02:58:06,379 --> 02:58:13,879
everything you do so we've got all of

3947
02:58:11,840 --> 02:58:16,579
these states that just went wreck and

3948
02:58:13,879 --> 02:58:18,979
medical bringing our national total to

3949
02:58:16,579 --> 02:58:21,289
eight full legal medical or legal

3950
02:58:18,979 --> 02:58:24,049
marijuana states where any adult can buy

3951
02:58:21,290 --> 02:58:26,720
marijuana if they're over 21 in a

3952
02:58:24,049 --> 02:58:29,629
licensed and regulated store eight legal

3953
02:58:26,719 --> 02:58:30,879
states and twenty eight medical

3954
02:58:29,629 --> 02:58:34,640
marijuana States

3955
02:58:30,879 --> 02:58:36,289
I'm one in five Americans lives in an

3956
02:58:34,640 --> 02:58:40,310
area where they can buy marijuana

3957
02:58:36,290 --> 02:58:43,070
legally it's like three and five when

3958
02:58:40,310 --> 02:58:46,879
you do the medical uhm and now some of

3959
02:58:43,069 --> 02:58:49,729
that 28 is CBD only oil laws and places

3960
02:58:46,879 --> 02:58:52,699
like Utah but I mean with numbers like

3961
02:58:49,729 --> 02:58:55,760
that those give me hope for our national

3962
02:58:52,700 --> 02:58:59,681
our national news because as all as you

3963
02:58:55,760 --> 02:59:02,239
know now or have had the chance to learn

3964
02:58:59,681 --> 02:59:03,739
Trump is now our president or our

3965
02:59:02,239 --> 02:59:07,399
president-elect he'll take over in

3966
02:59:03,739 --> 02:59:10,819
January and this election also gave

3967
02:59:07,399 --> 02:59:14,539
control of the Senate to the GOP and the

3968
02:59:10,819 --> 02:59:18,020
House of Representatives to the GOP and

3969
02:59:14,540 --> 02:59:20,271
in all likelihood that group of people

3970
02:59:18,021 --> 02:59:23,659
will be replacing three Supreme Court

3971
02:59:20,271 --> 02:59:25,940
justices in the next four years so the

3972
02:59:23,659 --> 02:59:28,459
shape of American politics that

3973
02:59:25,940 --> 02:59:31,120
landscape is all shifting drastically

3974
02:59:28,459 --> 02:59:31,119
under our feet

3975
02:59:31,309 --> 02:59:36,199
one of the reasons President Obama

3976
02:59:33,440 --> 02:59:39,140
wasn't able to do a lot of the things he

3977
02:59:36,200 --> 02:59:41,060
had campaigned on trying to do was

3978
02:59:39,139 --> 02:59:44,119
because the opposition party the

3979
02:59:41,059 --> 02:59:45,529
Republicans held a large majorities in

3980
02:59:44,120 --> 02:59:48,050
either the house of the Senate during

3981
02:59:45,530 --> 02:59:50,030
his presidency so when the president

3982
02:59:48,049 --> 02:59:53,019
wanted to do something the opposition

3983
02:59:50,030 --> 02:59:55,190
party would make it as hard as possible

3984
02:59:53,020 --> 02:59:57,020
that's not gonna be true for President

3985
02:59:55,190 --> 03:00:00,770
Trump it lists for the first two years

3986
02:59:57,020 --> 03:00:03,890
he's got party majority in all of

3987
03:00:00,770 --> 03:00:07,220
government which means Trump wanted

3988
03:00:03,889 --> 03:00:11,180
Trump probably get to Dewey yeah for

3989
03:00:07,219 --> 03:00:14,840
marijuana legalization that before last

3990
03:00:11,180 --> 03:00:17,260
night the picture was a lot darker on

3991
03:00:14,840 --> 03:00:19,540
the campaign trail some of

3992
03:00:17,260 --> 03:00:22,040
president-elect Trump

3993
03:00:19,540 --> 03:00:24,470
sorry listeners I fear conservative

3994
03:00:22,040 --> 03:00:27,410
that's just saying that does weird

3995
03:00:24,469 --> 03:00:30,949
things in my brain but president-elect

3996
03:00:27,409 --> 03:00:34,989
Trump has spent a lot of time working

3997
03:00:30,950 --> 03:00:37,970
very closely with some strong

3998
03:00:34,989 --> 03:00:39,860
prohibitionists politicians chris

3999
03:00:37,969 --> 03:00:41,719
Christie is a big Trump supporter has

4000
03:00:39,860 --> 03:00:44,060
been on the campaign campaign trail

4001
03:00:41,719 --> 03:00:46,459
stumping for Trump since he dropped out

4002
03:00:44,059 --> 03:00:47,659
of the presidential race himself I mean

4003
03:00:46,459 --> 03:00:49,489
he was one of the people that was

4004
03:00:47,659 --> 03:00:53,869
promising to send the army to shut us

4005
03:00:49,489 --> 03:00:59,719
down on day one attorney John meaning

4006
03:00:53,870 --> 03:01:03,380
the legal marijuana industry period from

4007
03:00:59,719 --> 03:01:08,510
the federal government can basically

4008
03:01:03,379 --> 03:01:12,049
immediately void the Cole memo and the

4009
03:01:08,510 --> 03:01:13,760
Ogden memo and begin doing what's

4010
03:01:12,049 --> 03:01:17,719
necessary to enforce the Controlled

4011
03:01:13,760 --> 03:01:20,389
Substances Act call Colorado up and say

4012
03:01:17,719 --> 03:01:22,250
hey easy either you stop all this legal

4013
03:01:20,389 --> 03:01:25,309
marijuana bullshitter we yank all your

4014
03:01:22,250 --> 03:01:27,049
road funding Colorado doesn't survive

4015
03:01:25,309 --> 03:01:30,109
without federal dollars no Street does

4016
03:01:27,049 --> 03:01:33,559
yeah that's how they got coast to coast

4017
03:01:30,110 --> 03:01:37,060
alcohol laws in line and that's been the

4018
03:01:33,559 --> 03:01:39,289
threat all along his states have kind of

4019
03:01:37,059 --> 03:01:41,869
crafted their own marijuana industries

4020
03:01:39,290 --> 03:01:43,610
in their own way like we've been doing

4021
03:01:41,870 --> 03:01:47,540
for the last twenty years now

4022
03:01:43,610 --> 03:01:50,030
that at any point someone in federal

4023
03:01:47,540 --> 03:01:52,341
government would yank that leash and the

4024
03:01:50,030 --> 03:01:56,141
entire industry we've built would have

4025
03:01:52,341 --> 03:01:58,729
crumbled back into the black market and

4026
03:01:56,140 --> 03:02:01,220
honestly with eight legal states twenty

4027
03:01:58,729 --> 03:02:06,850
eight medical states in an election last

4028
03:02:01,220 --> 03:02:10,699
night where eight of nine succeeded that

4029
03:02:06,851 --> 03:02:13,190
that says a lot we had Republicans and

4030
03:02:10,700 --> 03:02:17,570
Democrats turnout in big numbers last

4031
03:02:13,190 --> 03:02:20,210
night and vote for legalization both

4032
03:02:17,569 --> 03:02:22,520
parties were talking about whoever gets

4033
03:02:20,209 --> 03:02:23,810
elected job one is trying to bring the

4034
03:02:22,521 --> 03:02:28,120
nation back together

4035
03:02:23,810 --> 03:02:30,949
try to heal some of the divisiveness and

4036
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:34,400
this is an issue that we're now agreeing

4037
03:02:30,950 --> 03:02:36,200
on as a majority population not just the

4038
03:02:34,399 --> 03:02:38,149
majority of Democrats not just the

4039
03:02:36,200 --> 03:02:39,891
majority of Republicans not just the

4040
03:02:38,149 --> 03:02:42,529
majority of young people or black people

4041
03:02:39,890 --> 03:02:46,459
or Hispanic people but the majority of

4042
03:02:42,530 --> 03:02:49,880
Americans agree on now I think it would

4043
03:02:46,459 --> 03:02:52,669
be incredibly costly for a future Trump

4044
03:02:49,879 --> 03:02:54,770
administration to to really go after

4045
03:02:52,670 --> 03:02:56,030
legal marijuana at this point yes

4046
03:02:54,771 --> 03:02:58,250
there's just too much support

4047
03:02:56,030 --> 03:03:01,400
coast-to-coast now at last night's

4048
03:02:58,250 --> 03:03:04,640
election had one state join RAC and

4049
03:03:01,399 --> 03:03:08,629
maybe to join medical that mandate isn't

4050
03:03:04,640 --> 03:03:12,949
there like I keep coming back to every

4051
03:03:08,629 --> 03:03:16,129
vote really counts I mean when we really

4052
03:03:12,950 --> 03:03:19,880
digest what happened on Tuesday that's

4053
03:03:16,129 --> 03:03:21,800
gonna be what's clear is that if you're

4054
03:03:19,879 --> 03:03:24,170
not participating in this you're [ __ ]

4055
03:03:21,800 --> 03:03:26,829
yeah the people that disagree with you

4056
03:03:24,170 --> 03:03:26,829
get to make those decisions

4057
03:03:27,710 --> 03:03:34,279
and I mean where we go from here is is

4058
03:03:31,040 --> 03:03:37,590
kind of anyone's guess what happens

4059
03:03:34,280 --> 03:03:40,590
starting in January I mean

4060
03:03:37,590 --> 03:03:43,500
the difference between president-elect

4061
03:03:40,590 --> 03:03:45,120
Trump on the campaign trail and in last

4062
03:03:43,500 --> 03:03:50,340
night's concession speech was night and

4063
03:03:45,120 --> 03:03:53,579
day that speech alone changed the

4064
03:03:50,340 --> 03:03:59,310
conversation nationally from oh [ __ ]

4065
03:03:53,579 --> 03:04:01,799
who's got a good bunker to maybe we all

4066
03:03:59,310 --> 03:04:04,351
survived this I mean literally in one

4067
03:04:01,799 --> 03:04:06,149
speech and a lot of the national media

4068
03:04:04,351 --> 03:04:07,710
do you think somebody grabbed him by the

4069
03:04:06,149 --> 03:04:10,470
collar and sent him down and was like

4070
03:04:07,709 --> 03:04:15,119
it's clear that for the last couple of

4071
03:04:10,470 --> 03:04:18,209
weeks several important people have have

4072
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:21,061
been in conversations with Donald Trump

4073
03:04:18,209 --> 03:04:23,669
explaining that President of the United

4074
03:04:21,060 --> 03:04:27,619
States isn't a game it isn't a joke it

4075
03:04:23,670 --> 03:04:33,149
isn't funny I real repercussions

4076
03:04:27,620 --> 03:04:34,650
billions of lives we just gave who's

4077
03:04:33,149 --> 03:04:36,629
accurate someone whose accurate

4078
03:04:34,649 --> 03:04:40,039
accurately been described as orange

4079
03:04:36,629 --> 03:04:42,989
Hitler all of our nuclear launch codes

4080
03:04:40,040 --> 03:04:45,050
that's happening in the next couple of

4081
03:04:42,989 --> 03:04:45,049
weeks

4082
03:04:46,840 --> 03:04:51,130
I mean immediately would the when the

4083
03:04:48,760 --> 03:04:53,228
election results came in last night like

4084
03:04:51,129 --> 03:04:56,199
10 o'clock 11 o'clock at night when we

4085
03:04:53,228 --> 03:04:58,299
knew okay Hillary lost Donald Trump won

4086
03:04:56,200 --> 03:05:02,470
she's calling him to concede the race

4087
03:04:58,299 --> 03:05:05,500
this is real international stock markets

4088
03:05:02,469 --> 03:05:06,969
all over the world sort of crashing an

4089
03:05:05,500 --> 03:05:10,279
hour and a half later he made his

4090
03:05:06,969 --> 03:05:13,369
concession speech in the crash stopped

4091
03:05:10,279 --> 03:05:16,210
Wow the world is watching one of the one

4092
03:05:13,370 --> 03:05:19,819
of the things that we forget is that

4093
03:05:16,209 --> 03:05:23,209
planet Earth is a big idea it's a very

4094
03:05:19,818 --> 03:05:25,930
small place right now we're 20 hours

4095
03:05:23,209 --> 03:05:29,299
apart from every human on earth at most

4096
03:05:25,930 --> 03:05:30,770
that means in 20 hours the person that's

4097
03:05:29,299 --> 03:05:32,358
farthest away on this planet from

4098
03:05:30,770 --> 03:05:34,189
wherever you are right now

4099
03:05:32,359 --> 03:05:38,359
you'll be shaking your hand where you're

4100
03:05:34,189 --> 03:05:42,000
standing it's a very very small place we

4101
03:05:38,359 --> 03:05:45,870
are a leader in every way globally

4102
03:05:42,000 --> 03:05:48,829
and when we give the keys to a reality

4103
03:05:45,870 --> 03:05:52,050
TV show contestant or host or whatever

4104
03:05:48,829 --> 03:05:55,250
the world takes notice and it's clear

4105
03:05:52,049 --> 03:05:58,679
that someone's been in his ear for weeks

4106
03:05:55,250 --> 03:06:00,389
emphasizing this because his entire

4107
03:05:58,680 --> 03:06:03,090
demeanor was different last night and

4108
03:06:00,389 --> 03:06:04,680
and even his supporters were running him

4109
03:06:03,090 --> 03:06:09,238
good to run it onstage and kick the

4110
03:06:04,680 --> 03:06:11,450
podium down and be like like grab bricks

4111
03:06:09,238 --> 03:06:14,010
people of some mortar we can start now

4112
03:06:11,450 --> 03:06:15,390
like that's what people were expecting

4113
03:06:14,010 --> 03:06:17,609
and when it didn't happen and he came

4114
03:06:15,389 --> 03:06:20,849
off as presidential the entire world

4115
03:06:17,609 --> 03:06:23,059
noticed the entire world noticed nine

4116
03:06:20,850 --> 03:06:27,180
states voting on marijuana last night

4117
03:06:23,059 --> 03:06:28,709
other nations are looking at legalizing

4118
03:06:27,180 --> 03:06:31,439
marijuana from the government down

4119
03:06:28,709 --> 03:06:34,019
because they see what's happening in the

4120
03:06:31,439 --> 03:06:36,238
United States they see the headache of

4121
03:06:34,020 --> 03:06:41,760
voter put forth value that ballot

4122
03:06:36,238 --> 03:06:45,478
efforts and how hard it is to regulate

4123
03:06:41,760 --> 03:06:47,909
in tax a voter initiative law rather

4124
03:06:45,478 --> 03:06:50,639
than craft a legalization law from the

4125
03:06:47,909 --> 03:06:53,068
ground up that works well in the system

4126
03:06:50,639 --> 03:06:54,719
they've already got in place places like

4127
03:06:53,068 --> 03:06:57,389
Uruguay they're not waiting for the

4128
03:06:54,719 --> 03:07:00,090
voters right and there's a couple other

4129
03:06:57,389 --> 03:07:01,829
countries that we're watching Florida

4130
03:07:00,090 --> 03:07:03,719
last night they were watching California

4131
03:07:01,829 --> 03:07:08,010
last night they're they're watching

4132
03:07:03,719 --> 03:07:10,139
Maine now in thinking we signed the same

4133
03:07:08,010 --> 03:07:13,609
conventions the United States did that

4134
03:07:10,139 --> 03:07:16,010
prohibit us from legalizing marijuana

4135
03:07:13,609 --> 03:07:20,899
these laws have been just as destructive

4136
03:07:16,010 --> 03:07:24,619
here as they are there are people here

4137
03:07:20,898 --> 03:07:27,049
deserve the same opportunity to free of

4138
03:07:24,619 --> 03:07:29,180
the problems these laws cause that the

4139
03:07:27,049 --> 03:07:32,958
people in Colorado do and so they're

4140
03:07:29,180 --> 03:07:36,199
doing it themselves because elections

4141
03:07:32,959 --> 03:07:39,859
matter elections have consequences and

4142
03:07:36,199 --> 03:07:42,050
if you can do this smartly from the top

4143
03:07:39,859 --> 03:07:44,328
down it can go a little smoother

4144
03:07:42,049 --> 03:07:46,809
part of the reason this process is so

4145
03:07:44,328 --> 03:07:49,279
ugliness so messy and so [ __ ] slow

4146
03:07:46,809 --> 03:07:50,958
I'm sorry for cussing so much tonight

4147
03:07:49,279 --> 03:07:52,998
guys dress it out Frazee well it's

4148
03:07:50,959 --> 03:07:54,319
[ __ ] crazy I'm so proud of myself I

4149
03:07:52,998 --> 03:07:58,189
haven't thrown anything in the last 48

4150
03:07:54,318 --> 03:08:03,109
hours part of that's because I'm always

4151
03:07:58,189 --> 03:08:05,408
holding a rig but still I mean it's it's

4152
03:08:03,109 --> 03:08:07,939
been really really stressful and and

4153
03:08:05,408 --> 03:08:10,818
honestly with what we're left looking at

4154
03:08:07,939 --> 03:08:13,939
right now we're where we go from here is

4155
03:08:10,818 --> 03:08:16,328
anyone's guess a lot of where we go from

4156
03:08:13,939 --> 03:08:18,949
here is totally up to Donald Trump

4157
03:08:16,328 --> 03:08:20,779
because we honestly honest-to-god just

4158
03:08:18,949 --> 03:08:25,129
gave that man the the driver's seat of

4159
03:08:20,779 --> 03:08:27,529
the planet and where he takes us is

4160
03:08:25,129 --> 03:08:29,390
really anyone's guess

4161
03:08:27,529 --> 03:08:31,039
I mean if it's pretty clear if you've

4162
03:08:29,389 --> 03:08:34,208
been paying attention to reality's a lot

4163
03:08:31,039 --> 03:08:36,979
of his campaign promises are not at all

4164
03:08:34,209 --> 03:08:38,539
realistic or feasible they're Bigley

4165
03:08:36,978 --> 03:08:40,639
crazy yes

4166
03:08:38,539 --> 03:08:42,409
it's sort of like him promising that if

4167
03:08:40,639 --> 03:08:47,568
we elected him aliens would finally

4168
03:08:42,408 --> 03:08:49,430
introduce themselves but he's still

4169
03:08:47,568 --> 03:08:51,498
gonna be president for four years he's

4170
03:08:49,430 --> 03:08:53,300
still gonna point a cabinet he's still

4171
03:08:51,498 --> 03:08:55,549
gonna replace Supreme Court justices

4172
03:08:53,299 --> 03:09:00,590
he's gonna do something he's gonna

4173
03:08:55,549 --> 03:09:02,568
govern does he decide to to yank our

4174
03:09:00,590 --> 03:09:05,478
federal funding and so all 50 states

4175
03:09:02,568 --> 03:09:07,278
fall back in line with prohibition does

4176
03:09:05,478 --> 03:09:09,288
he finally crack the whip and say it's

4177
03:09:07,279 --> 03:09:12,199
time to legalize nationally or at least

4178
03:09:09,289 --> 03:09:14,359
let the states do it I mean literally

4179
03:09:12,199 --> 03:09:17,510
every decision is a [ __ ] coin flip at

4180
03:09:14,359 --> 03:09:20,029
this point no one knows we hope that

4181
03:09:17,510 --> 03:09:21,709
somebody's screaming look look how

4182
03:09:20,029 --> 03:09:24,140
popular it is it did better than almost

4183
03:09:21,709 --> 03:09:26,220
every candidate on the ballot you can't

4184
03:09:24,139 --> 03:09:31,139
come out strongly against marijuana

4185
03:09:26,219 --> 03:09:32,219
it would kill you but who knows he could

4186
03:09:31,139 --> 03:09:34,379
be sitting down with Chris Christie

4187
03:09:32,219 --> 03:09:35,818
right now having a scotch and a prozac

4188
03:09:34,379 --> 03:09:38,219
talking about how they gonna round up

4189
03:09:35,818 --> 03:09:39,930
all the hippies I'm one of the really

4190
03:09:38,219 --> 03:09:44,188
scary things that happened last night

4191
03:09:39,930 --> 03:09:46,800
was private prison stocks skyrocketed

4192
03:09:44,189 --> 03:09:47,579
yep Jess eyebrow just went through the

4193
03:09:46,799 --> 03:09:50,009
top of his head

4194
03:09:47,579 --> 03:09:51,689
I've been joking for days now that I

4195
03:09:50,010 --> 03:09:53,930
hope me and all my friends end up in the

4196
03:09:51,689 --> 03:09:56,639
same FEMA camps um

4197
03:09:53,930 --> 03:09:58,260
FEMA camps very unlikely that was one of

4198
03:09:56,639 --> 03:10:02,449
the more fun rumors about Obama's

4199
03:09:58,260 --> 03:10:02,450
presidency but uh

4200
03:10:03,549 --> 03:10:06,879
I mean it's a possibility yeah I'm the

4201
03:10:05,228 --> 03:10:09,459
type of people that those people are

4202
03:10:06,879 --> 03:10:12,129
that they do not like well it's a

4203
03:10:09,459 --> 03:10:14,409
hundred percent possible that a new

4204
03:10:12,129 --> 03:10:17,799
administration goes a very different

4205
03:10:14,409 --> 03:10:19,930
direction then the Obama administration

4206
03:10:17,799 --> 03:10:22,449
has gone and there's a reason

4207
03:10:19,930 --> 03:10:24,280
legalization advocates of have pushed

4208
03:10:22,450 --> 03:10:28,960
the Obama administration as hard as they

4209
03:10:24,280 --> 03:10:30,909
have for more on legalization every

4210
03:10:28,959 --> 03:10:33,159
chance we've gotten we've begged for

4211
03:10:30,909 --> 03:10:36,129
movement and we've gotten a little bit

4212
03:10:33,159 --> 03:10:37,359
very very little and because we've only

4213
03:10:36,129 --> 03:10:40,719
gotten a little bit of movement

4214
03:10:37,359 --> 03:10:42,250
federally the next administration can do

4215
03:10:40,719 --> 03:10:43,119
whatever they want they can put an end

4216
03:10:42,250 --> 03:10:47,889
to all of this

4217
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:51,700
um with a couple of meetings a strategy

4218
03:10:47,889 --> 03:10:55,659
and like thirty five phone calls or

4219
03:10:51,700 --> 03:10:58,569
press release is really all it would

4220
03:10:55,659 --> 03:11:00,010
take yeah I'm sure there would be a lot

4221
03:10:58,568 --> 03:11:02,219
of kicking there'd be a lot of screaming

4222
03:11:00,010 --> 03:11:05,318
there'd be a lot of hell no we won't go

4223
03:11:02,219 --> 03:11:10,420
but in the end you're talking about

4224
03:11:05,318 --> 03:11:12,818
stoners versus drones the way to change

4225
03:11:10,420 --> 03:11:16,239
the laws is to participate in the system

4226
03:11:12,818 --> 03:11:18,579
and vote right and hopefully the people

4227
03:11:16,239 --> 03:11:20,199
that are about to take power caught the

4228
03:11:18,579 --> 03:11:23,978
mandate from last night and we're paying

4229
03:11:20,200 --> 03:11:26,710
attention the only group of people that

4230
03:11:23,978 --> 03:11:28,929
are really happy right now that I see in

4231
03:11:26,709 --> 03:11:30,818
my social media feeds are the marijuana

4232
03:11:28,930 --> 03:11:32,648
people yeah the hardcore marijuana

4233
03:11:30,818 --> 03:11:35,409
people know that marijuana had a huge

4234
03:11:32,648 --> 03:11:36,898
night last night liberals are

4235
03:11:35,409 --> 03:11:39,280
disappointed and confused

4236
03:11:36,898 --> 03:11:43,629
conservatives are really confused and

4237
03:11:39,280 --> 03:11:45,670
kind of shocked stoners are happy but I

4238
03:11:43,629 --> 03:11:50,019
honestly think that it's a little early

4239
03:11:45,670 --> 03:11:51,969
to be super happy for those of you in

4240
03:11:50,020 --> 03:11:55,149
states that just passed either medical

4241
03:11:51,969 --> 03:11:58,000
Iraq get involved immediately get to

4242
03:11:55,148 --> 03:12:00,728
City Council get on your computer when

4243
03:11:58,000 --> 03:12:03,010
you hear this and figure out what area

4244
03:12:00,728 --> 03:12:05,170
you live in whether it's governed by a

4245
03:12:03,010 --> 03:12:07,540
city council or a County Commission or

4246
03:12:05,170 --> 03:12:10,030
whatever figure out when those meetings

4247
03:12:07,540 --> 03:12:11,800
are and start going figure out when your

4248
03:12:10,030 --> 03:12:13,300
state legislature meets and what they're

4249
03:12:11,799 --> 03:12:14,649
talking about and if you can attend

4250
03:12:13,299 --> 03:12:16,479
those meetings

4251
03:12:14,649 --> 03:12:18,550
because if your state like if you're in

4252
03:12:16,479 --> 03:12:20,649
California right now those rules are

4253
03:12:18,550 --> 03:12:22,359
just being written all of those cities

4254
03:12:20,649 --> 03:12:24,279
that have been passing marijuana vans

4255
03:12:22,360 --> 03:12:27,040
leading bands leading up into the

4256
03:12:24,280 --> 03:12:31,030
election we're doing so that they had

4257
03:12:27,040 --> 03:12:33,580
time to write rules for 64 so that they

4258
03:12:31,030 --> 03:12:35,409
could pick the zoning and pick the

4259
03:12:33,579 --> 03:12:38,110
buffer distances and pick the tax

4260
03:12:35,409 --> 03:12:41,950
numbers you need to be participating in

4261
03:12:38,110 --> 03:12:43,659
those hearings if you want to want any

4262
03:12:41,950 --> 03:12:46,780
kind of say in it otherwise the people

4263
03:12:43,659 --> 03:12:50,530
who do care are gonna get what they want

4264
03:12:46,780 --> 03:12:53,681
in those laws just go put your face in

4265
03:12:50,530 --> 03:12:55,570
that mix go be seen humans no matter

4266
03:12:53,681 --> 03:12:56,950
what your job if you're a councilman if

4267
03:12:55,569 --> 03:12:58,899
you're a zoning commissioner if you make

4268
03:12:56,950 --> 03:13:01,391
the laws if you're the judge if you go

4269
03:12:58,899 --> 03:13:02,890
to whatever meeting it is at the end of

4270
03:13:01,390 --> 03:13:04,239
the meeting there's always that fifteen

4271
03:13:02,890 --> 03:13:05,350
minutes where everybody just stands

4272
03:13:04,239 --> 03:13:07,750
around in [ __ ]

4273
03:13:05,351 --> 03:13:09,431
maybe if you're the guy like Mike that

4274
03:13:07,750 --> 03:13:11,290
goes to every single City Council

4275
03:13:09,431 --> 03:13:13,659
meeting that he can maybe one of the

4276
03:13:11,290 --> 03:13:14,860
guys that are running that is on the

4277
03:13:13,659 --> 03:13:17,200
fence about how they feel about you

4278
03:13:14,860 --> 03:13:18,610
maybe I'll actually walk up and actually

4279
03:13:17,200 --> 03:13:20,261
speak to you because they just want

4280
03:13:18,610 --> 03:13:21,551
someone to talk to for that next ten

4281
03:13:20,261 --> 03:13:23,170
minutes till they have to go to the next

4282
03:13:21,550 --> 03:13:24,250
meeting if they want to blend in like

4283
03:13:23,170 --> 03:13:26,229
everyone else they don't want to seem

4284
03:13:24,250 --> 03:13:27,729
like a dick and it's socially acceptable

4285
03:13:26,229 --> 03:13:30,459
to just walk up and talk to the other

4286
03:13:27,729 --> 03:13:33,130
guy at that council meeting you may end

4287
03:13:30,459 --> 03:13:34,959
up putting the right bug in his ear he

4288
03:13:33,130 --> 03:13:36,579
may talk to you and realize man that

4289
03:13:34,959 --> 03:13:38,409
guy's six five with dreadlocks and his

4290
03:13:36,579 --> 03:13:40,569
eyes are red and he wears a red golden

4291
03:13:38,409 --> 03:13:42,640
green t-shirt every day but when I spoke

4292
03:13:40,569 --> 03:13:43,569
to him he was intelligent he sounded

4293
03:13:42,640 --> 03:13:44,979
like you knew what he was talking about

4294
03:13:43,569 --> 03:13:46,300
maybe I'm not so afraid of these

4295
03:13:44,979 --> 03:13:48,011
cannabis guys because that guy's

4296
03:13:46,300 --> 03:13:49,689
compassionate and that guy's telling me

4297
03:13:48,011 --> 03:13:51,640
about his friend with cancer that he's

4298
03:13:49,690 --> 03:13:53,409
helping take care of with cannabis he

4299
03:13:51,640 --> 03:13:55,690
might spark something in somebody and he

4300
03:13:53,409 --> 03:13:58,060
may accidentally put them on your team I

4301
03:13:55,690 --> 03:14:00,370
I was at a couple different watch

4302
03:13:58,060 --> 03:14:02,880
parties on election night and when I

4303
03:14:00,370 --> 03:14:05,561
stopped by the Democratic watch party

4304
03:14:02,880 --> 03:14:08,409
one of our local representatives in the

4305
03:14:05,560 --> 03:14:11,011
city was asking me if I thought eight

4306
03:14:08,409 --> 03:14:13,931
stores would be enough to dedicate a

4307
03:14:11,011 --> 03:14:16,601
hard stream of revenue revenue to law

4308
03:14:13,931 --> 03:14:19,301
enforcement and so I quickly turned the

4309
03:14:16,601 --> 03:14:20,771
conversation into production facilities

4310
03:14:19,300 --> 03:14:22,869
that we already allow or where you want

4311
03:14:20,771 --> 03:14:24,610
that money to come from because it's a

4312
03:14:22,870 --> 03:14:26,829
more stable revenue source and it was

4313
03:14:24,610 --> 03:14:28,600
just a quick two minute conversation but

4314
03:14:26,829 --> 03:14:31,090
it was somebody in City

4315
03:14:28,600 --> 03:14:34,238
men who knew me from these meetings who

4316
03:14:31,090 --> 03:14:35,738
just they were bored at a party and so

4317
03:14:34,238 --> 03:14:38,049
they came wandering over to me to chat

4318
03:14:35,738 --> 03:14:39,459
for your face yep and so now when

4319
03:14:38,049 --> 03:14:42,278
they're looking at the budget next week

4320
03:14:39,459 --> 03:14:43,959
and they see that our to our two ballot

4321
03:14:42,279 --> 03:14:46,600
questions about more money for law

4322
03:14:43,959 --> 03:14:48,250
enforcement failed they've got an option

4323
03:14:46,600 --> 03:14:50,290
that they might be able to fill some of

4324
03:14:48,250 --> 03:14:52,779
that hole with now that might not have

4325
03:14:50,290 --> 03:14:54,670
been on the table before and honestly

4326
03:14:52,779 --> 03:14:58,300
that's down the road for the the states

4327
03:14:54,670 --> 03:15:00,309
that just voted on it if you live in

4328
03:14:58,299 --> 03:15:02,858
California or Massachusetts or Nevada

4329
03:15:00,309 --> 03:15:04,959
right now your city or your county is

4330
03:15:02,859 --> 03:15:07,689
talking about or it's about to be

4331
03:15:04,959 --> 03:15:09,969
talking about zoning rules what type of

4332
03:15:07,689 --> 03:15:12,340
land and what type of areas in our

4333
03:15:09,969 --> 03:15:14,408
community do we want to allow production

4334
03:15:12,340 --> 03:15:17,619
facilities we want to allow growth or

4335
03:15:14,408 --> 03:15:20,318
extraction labs or stores how many feet

4336
03:15:17,619 --> 03:15:22,090
from school should they be um what kind

4337
03:15:20,318 --> 03:15:24,488
of labeling should we require what kind

4338
03:15:22,090 --> 03:15:25,960
of testing should we require and the

4339
03:15:24,488 --> 03:15:27,969
people that are about to make those

4340
03:15:25,959 --> 03:15:30,789
decisions don't have a [ __ ] clue

4341
03:15:27,969 --> 03:15:32,978
about any of this they know cannabis is

4342
03:15:30,790 --> 03:15:34,810
a weed they know that it needs water and

4343
03:15:32,978 --> 03:15:37,118
sunlight to grow and then I guess you

4344
03:15:34,809 --> 03:15:39,398
can grow it under lights and that it's

4345
03:15:37,119 --> 03:15:42,430
probably bad for your brain and that's

4346
03:15:39,398 --> 03:15:45,579
all they know yep and if you don't show

4347
03:15:42,430 --> 03:15:48,488
up to these meetings and and bring

4348
03:15:45,579 --> 03:15:51,459
reality to them they're never gonna see

4349
03:15:48,488 --> 03:15:54,488
it they're gonna pass rules to regulate

4350
03:15:51,459 --> 03:15:56,289
what's in their head um and you're gonna

4351
03:15:54,488 --> 03:15:59,648
get stuck with some of the rules that we

4352
03:15:56,290 --> 03:16:02,380
get and you're left explaining them to

4353
03:15:59,648 --> 03:16:05,439
people with just it's just a crazy rule

4354
03:16:02,379 --> 03:16:07,179
that we follow like what why do we have

4355
03:16:05,439 --> 03:16:09,130
to bleach our trash it's just one of

4356
03:16:07,180 --> 03:16:11,350
those things is bleach good for the

4357
03:16:09,129 --> 03:16:13,929
environment bucket it's a rule so yeah

4358
03:16:11,350 --> 03:16:15,699
let me talk about that one oh I ran a

4359
03:16:13,930 --> 03:16:19,090
big grow we had over a hundred lights

4360
03:16:15,699 --> 03:16:21,310
and people would climb a barbed wire

4361
03:16:19,090 --> 03:16:23,170
fence well this is a statewide rule

4362
03:16:21,309 --> 03:16:24,789
because the legislature kind of saw this

4363
03:16:23,170 --> 03:16:26,469
committee would climb oh and they would

4364
03:16:24,790 --> 03:16:27,909
put carpets old-school style like they

4365
03:16:26,469 --> 03:16:32,528
just do back in the day throw a carpet

4366
03:16:27,908 --> 03:16:34,000
over graffiti style throw the carpet

4367
03:16:32,529 --> 03:16:36,310
over the fence jump the fence and then

4368
03:16:34,000 --> 03:16:38,889
climb up a big pole above the trash can

4369
03:16:36,309 --> 03:16:40,809
and jump off this pole through the play

4370
03:16:38,889 --> 03:16:42,459
we had plastic trash can lids the giant

4371
03:16:40,809 --> 03:16:43,000
dumpster they weren't plastic they were

4372
03:16:42,459 --> 03:16:45,189
that thing

4373
03:16:43,000 --> 03:16:47,020
like that real hard heavy plas yeah yeah

4374
03:16:45,190 --> 03:16:48,790
yeah and they would smash their bodies

4375
03:16:47,020 --> 03:16:50,979
through it and then they'd get in there

4376
03:16:48,790 --> 03:16:54,400
and steal our trash bags which was look

4377
03:16:50,979 --> 03:16:56,500
why would we throw away weed we didn't

4378
03:16:54,399 --> 03:16:58,809
do that it was sticks and stems and

4379
03:16:56,500 --> 03:17:00,549
mainly like office trash we had an

4380
03:16:58,809 --> 03:17:01,420
office it was a bathroom there was

4381
03:17:00,549 --> 03:17:02,920
bathroom trash

4382
03:17:01,420 --> 03:17:05,110
there was Thai food trash because I ate

4383
03:17:02,920 --> 03:17:08,049
lunch there okay the people breaking

4384
03:17:05,110 --> 03:17:11,290
into marijuana dump business dumpsters

4385
03:17:08,049 --> 03:17:13,619
don't know about the rules eventually we

4386
03:17:11,290 --> 03:17:16,390
had dollar eventually we had to put a

4387
03:17:13,620 --> 03:17:18,100
stainless steel do these lids were so

4388
03:17:16,389 --> 03:17:19,239
heavy that it I had to get on a chair to

4389
03:17:18,100 --> 03:17:21,340
lift him up because I couldn't get

4390
03:17:19,239 --> 03:17:23,409
enough leverage from the one and they

4391
03:17:21,340 --> 03:17:25,840
were so heavy and they they found a way

4392
03:17:23,409 --> 03:17:27,579
to cut the poles the hinges off of the

4393
03:17:25,840 --> 03:17:29,170
ends now to get into that trash can yep

4394
03:17:27,579 --> 03:17:30,430
and they're on camera doing it they've

4395
03:17:29,170 --> 03:17:31,780
been pulled over and busted it's the

4396
03:17:30,430 --> 03:17:34,180
same guy that does it repeatedly but

4397
03:17:31,780 --> 03:17:36,190
anyway you guys I'm off for like we've

4398
03:17:34,180 --> 03:17:39,159
had a lot of weird rules here mainly

4399
03:17:36,190 --> 03:17:41,560
because when it came time to pass these

4400
03:17:39,159 --> 03:17:43,719
rules to write a lot of them the

4401
03:17:41,559 --> 03:17:45,189
marijuana community was busy scrambling

4402
03:17:43,719 --> 03:17:47,979
trying to start a business before the

4403
03:17:45,190 --> 03:17:50,470
rules got in place so that they can open

4404
03:17:47,979 --> 03:17:52,209
it their way if their location and

4405
03:17:50,469 --> 03:17:55,689
hopefully get grandfather didn't later

4406
03:17:52,209 --> 03:17:57,189
when rules finally did get passed the

4407
03:17:55,690 --> 03:18:00,040
grandfather [ __ ] didn't work out too

4408
03:17:57,190 --> 03:18:04,300
well for a lot of us did it um at one

4409
03:18:00,040 --> 03:18:07,240
point we had over a thousand marijuana

4410
03:18:04,299 --> 03:18:10,509
retail locations in Colorado and that

4411
03:18:07,239 --> 03:18:13,000
was the week before real regulations

4412
03:18:10,510 --> 03:18:15,340
came down the pipe for the first time um

4413
03:18:13,000 --> 03:18:18,459
at the same time that first regulation

4414
03:18:15,340 --> 03:18:21,190
set hit the feds came in and said all

4415
03:18:18,459 --> 03:18:23,349
right any of you that aren't a thousand

4416
03:18:21,190 --> 03:18:25,899
feet from the school and we're gonna

4417
03:18:23,350 --> 03:18:29,829
make that thousand feet as long as

4418
03:18:25,899 --> 03:18:31,899
possible like if there's the grand

4419
03:18:29,829 --> 03:18:34,420
canyon between me and you it doesn't

4420
03:18:31,899 --> 03:18:36,520
matter before only nine hundred ninety

4421
03:18:34,420 --> 03:18:38,590
five feet apart at the opposite sides of

4422
03:18:36,520 --> 03:18:40,600
the Grand Canyon it's as the crow flies

4423
03:18:38,590 --> 03:18:42,399
is what they called it or you stood by

4424
03:18:40,600 --> 03:18:44,079
the foot and they recently changed it

4425
03:18:42,399 --> 03:18:45,969
and I've [ __ ] a lot of people you know

4426
03:18:44,079 --> 03:18:47,500
when they changed that rule like a third

4427
03:18:45,969 --> 03:18:50,859
of our shops had to move or close down

4428
03:18:47,500 --> 03:18:52,450
and all the shops that were near like it

4429
03:18:50,860 --> 03:18:53,850
nine hundred and eighty feet from

4430
03:18:52,450 --> 03:18:56,520
whatever school

4431
03:18:53,850 --> 03:18:59,520
the feds said you have to close and that

4432
03:18:56,520 --> 03:19:01,408
was the only big closure of shops we had

4433
03:18:59,520 --> 03:19:04,260
in Colorado

4434
03:19:01,408 --> 03:19:07,738
the feds closed down about 50 of them

4435
03:19:04,260 --> 03:19:10,199
for being too close to schools and then

4436
03:19:07,738 --> 03:19:13,920
the rules being put in place closed

4437
03:19:10,199 --> 03:19:15,899
almost 500 um and since then like

4438
03:19:13,920 --> 03:19:18,270
another 150 have dropped out of the

4439
03:19:15,898 --> 03:19:18,868
running because it's it's just too much

4440
03:19:18,270 --> 03:19:21,210
of a headache

4441
03:19:18,869 --> 03:19:23,460
what really uh what what bothered me

4442
03:19:21,209 --> 03:19:28,738
about a lot of the rulemaking was it

4443
03:19:23,459 --> 03:19:30,299
created a scenario where guys like okay

4444
03:19:28,738 --> 03:19:32,068
I can use Scott reaches an example

4445
03:19:30,299 --> 03:19:34,019
because he's gone full circle back in

4446
03:19:32,068 --> 03:19:35,760
the day Scott reach from rare Dan rare

4447
03:19:34,020 --> 03:19:36,960
dankness opened up a dispensary I think

4448
03:19:35,760 --> 03:19:40,408
it was called White Mountain medicine

4449
03:19:36,959 --> 03:19:42,118
that dispensary was the [ __ ] example

4450
03:19:40,408 --> 03:19:43,648
that's what dispensaries should have

4451
03:19:42,119 --> 03:19:45,149
been back then but that was the Wild

4452
03:19:43,648 --> 03:19:47,430
Wild West when there weren't any rules

4453
03:19:45,148 --> 03:19:49,439
if they were what's called vertically

4454
03:19:47,430 --> 03:19:51,449
integrated before vertical integration

4455
03:19:49,439 --> 03:19:53,250
was a thing they were growing everything

4456
03:19:51,449 --> 03:19:53,579
they were selling they were producing it

4457
03:19:53,250 --> 03:19:55,079
all

4458
03:19:53,579 --> 03:19:57,090
they were packaging it everything was

4459
03:19:55,079 --> 03:19:59,010
happening in house it was all like a

4460
03:19:57,090 --> 03:20:01,260
one-man show basically it was not in a

4461
03:19:59,010 --> 03:20:02,850
couple of homies and then they started

4462
03:20:01,260 --> 03:20:04,529
implementing all these new systems all

4463
03:20:02,850 --> 03:20:06,479
these new rules all these new laws and

4464
03:20:04,529 --> 03:20:07,920
the guys that were putting their heart

4465
03:20:06,478 --> 03:20:09,658
into the grow these guys were sleeping

4466
03:20:07,920 --> 03:20:11,579
in the grow you know what I mean they

4467
03:20:09,658 --> 03:20:12,779
had cots between the rows of plants

4468
03:20:11,579 --> 03:20:14,728
where these guys would take a nap when

4469
03:20:12,779 --> 03:20:16,408
the lights went off for the 1212 cycle

4470
03:20:14,728 --> 03:20:17,519
they'd sleep in there they'd wake up and

4471
03:20:16,408 --> 03:20:19,350
sneak out and go in the other room and

4472
03:20:17,520 --> 03:20:20,880
work on that after they had a nap they

4473
03:20:19,350 --> 03:20:24,149
were killing it but all the new rules

4474
03:20:20,879 --> 03:20:25,709
forced cameras and so much other

4475
03:20:24,148 --> 03:20:28,349
[ __ ] that they couldn't afford and

4476
03:20:25,709 --> 03:20:30,028
so the guys with heart they would love

4477
03:20:28,350 --> 03:20:32,520
these plants got forced out and the guys

4478
03:20:30,029 --> 03:20:35,579
that own car dealerships and own

4479
03:20:32,520 --> 03:20:37,680
whatever other random business that it

4480
03:20:35,579 --> 03:20:39,689
went to business school and just saw an

4481
03:20:37,680 --> 03:20:41,430
opportunity in Colorado they came in and

4482
03:20:39,689 --> 03:20:43,079
they're like well I got money and they

4483
03:20:41,430 --> 03:20:44,699
bought [ __ ] up and now unfortunately a

4484
03:20:43,079 --> 03:20:45,988
lot of those types of folks are who are

4485
03:20:44,699 --> 03:20:48,270
running the cannabis industry and the

4486
03:20:45,988 --> 03:20:53,850
heart gaps there's doubt there's still a

4487
03:20:48,270 --> 03:20:55,590
weird lack of quality in large portions

4488
03:20:53,850 --> 03:20:57,119
of the legal market here that lets me

4489
03:20:55,590 --> 03:20:59,100
let me wrap up because I want to I

4490
03:20:57,119 --> 03:21:00,989
started with Scott reach I gotta give

4491
03:20:59,100 --> 03:21:03,359
Scott a shout out and finished that now

4492
03:21:00,988 --> 03:21:05,250
Scott owns the most high-tech most

4493
03:21:03,359 --> 03:21:07,229
sophisticated most impressive [ __ ]

4494
03:21:05,250 --> 03:21:07,500
girl facility in the state of Colorado

4495
03:21:07,228 --> 03:21:09,599
that I

4496
03:21:07,500 --> 03:21:12,420
ever seen and he is now producing once

4497
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:14,670
again some of the best quality cannabis

4498
03:21:12,420 --> 03:21:18,299
in a very large scale and it's available

4499
03:21:14,670 --> 03:21:19,440
for retail purchase he does the

4500
03:21:18,299 --> 03:21:21,329
wholesale thing so it ends up in

4501
03:21:19,440 --> 03:21:22,920
dispensaries so he's back at it now I

4502
03:21:21,329 --> 03:21:24,870
just had to be went full circle

4503
03:21:22,920 --> 03:21:27,120
I'm starting to see a lot of a lot more

4504
03:21:24,870 --> 03:21:30,750
of the the people who were doing it from

4505
03:21:27,120 --> 03:21:31,590
their heart finally getting up and

4506
03:21:30,750 --> 03:21:34,770
running again

4507
03:21:31,590 --> 03:21:37,559
but for a year and a half two years

4508
03:21:34,770 --> 03:21:40,710
three years all of them have been

4509
03:21:37,559 --> 03:21:42,959
looking for money and the people running

4510
03:21:40,709 --> 03:21:44,729
the big production facilities are the

4511
03:21:42,959 --> 03:21:48,299
people that have money and not the

4512
03:21:44,729 --> 03:21:51,260
people that have talent and that's led

4513
03:21:48,299 --> 03:21:55,590
to a lot of like wow solid c-plus right

4514
03:21:51,260 --> 03:21:58,860
a million dollar loan oh man I had

4515
03:21:55,590 --> 03:22:03,420
somebody like excitedly show me some bud

4516
03:21:58,860 --> 03:22:05,400
that was 2.2 percent THC 7.7% CBD like

4517
03:22:03,420 --> 03:22:08,489
excitedly like this is on our shelf now

4518
03:22:05,399 --> 03:22:10,619
bro and I kind of looked at him and he

4519
03:22:08,489 --> 03:22:13,350
kind of looked at me and then he was

4520
03:22:10,620 --> 03:22:15,480
like but why are you excited you've been

4521
03:22:13,350 --> 03:22:18,500
asking for CBD flower for a while now

4522
03:22:15,479 --> 03:22:21,539
and I was like yeah that ain't it though

4523
03:22:18,500 --> 03:22:26,459
like I got more CBD like stuck to my oil

4524
03:22:21,540 --> 03:22:29,220
slick um sorry like I hate it I hate to

4525
03:22:26,459 --> 03:22:31,269
rush you get up above 10 get closer to

4526
03:22:29,219 --> 03:22:34,358
15

4527
03:22:31,270 --> 03:22:37,720
if you've got passion and talent and

4528
03:22:34,359 --> 03:22:40,869
skill producing marijuana you know what

4529
03:22:37,719 --> 03:22:43,298
quality is you've got a passion for

4530
03:22:40,869 --> 03:22:46,390
helping share your love of marijuana

4531
03:22:43,299 --> 03:22:48,189
with other people it's really time to

4532
03:22:46,389 --> 03:22:51,189
bite the bullet and start spending

4533
03:22:48,189 --> 03:22:53,100
Mondays at City Council um you're gonna

4534
03:22:51,189 --> 03:22:57,068
hate it it's gonna take you two years

4535
03:22:53,100 --> 03:22:58,809
I'm of really boring meetings that don't

4536
03:22:57,068 --> 03:23:01,298
have anything to do with marijuana and

4537
03:22:58,809 --> 03:23:04,148
I've sat through that long public

4538
03:23:01,299 --> 03:23:05,739
testimony sessions where one person gets

4539
03:23:04,148 --> 03:23:07,689
up and said marijuana is the devil's

4540
03:23:05,738 --> 03:23:10,238
lattice is gonna make everybody commit

4541
03:23:07,689 --> 03:23:11,889
suicide and then somebody gets up and

4542
03:23:10,238 --> 03:23:13,748
say no we're gonna pave the streets with

4543
03:23:11,889 --> 03:23:17,228
gold and everybody's gonna get to cute

4544
03:23:13,748 --> 03:23:19,658
redheads to go home with and you just

4545
03:23:17,228 --> 03:23:22,748
argue back and forth all night long but

4546
03:23:19,658 --> 03:23:25,298
if you don't go and there isn't someone

4547
03:23:22,748 --> 03:23:26,889
there to make rational arguments to the

4548
03:23:25,299 --> 03:23:29,770
people that finally make these decisions

4549
03:23:26,889 --> 03:23:31,358
in your area you're gonna wake up one

4550
03:23:29,770 --> 03:23:33,009
morning and it's gonna be a two and a

4551
03:23:31,359 --> 03:23:34,720
half hour drive to the pot store and

4552
03:23:33,009 --> 03:23:36,850
you're gonna have done that to yourself

4553
03:23:34,719 --> 03:23:39,009
when you get to that posture that's two

4554
03:23:36,850 --> 03:23:41,259
and a half hours away it's gonna be

4555
03:23:39,009 --> 03:23:43,180
mediocre quality and twice as expensive

4556
03:23:41,259 --> 03:23:44,619
is your old dealer back kind of purchase

4557
03:23:43,180 --> 03:23:46,209
limit so that you have to do it once a

4558
03:23:44,619 --> 03:23:47,890
damn week instead of once a month yep

4559
03:23:46,209 --> 03:23:50,199
and it's gonna be your fault for

4560
03:23:47,889 --> 03:23:52,028
skipping out on these meetings and for

4561
03:23:50,199 --> 03:23:56,319
hoping that somebody else goes down and

4562
03:23:52,029 --> 03:23:58,060
fights for you and that's I mean that's

4563
03:23:56,318 --> 03:24:00,368
my takeaway from this election is you

4564
03:23:58,059 --> 03:24:02,019
got a yes participate if you do not vote

4565
03:24:00,369 --> 03:24:03,369
in this election you cannot [ __ ] about

4566
03:24:02,020 --> 03:24:04,658
anything for the next four years that's

4567
03:24:03,369 --> 03:24:06,640
why it's something that I want to say

4568
03:24:04,658 --> 03:24:08,469
Mike we've been going for a long time so

4569
03:24:06,639 --> 03:24:10,868
let's say let's wrap it up if you got

4570
03:24:08,469 --> 03:24:12,698
any fun last that's what I'm giving you

4571
03:24:10,869 --> 03:24:15,569
the chance for buddy with rate with most

4572
03:24:12,699 --> 03:24:20,498
political issues we're talking about

4573
03:24:15,568 --> 03:24:23,439
changing what is a little bit we're

4574
03:24:20,498 --> 03:24:25,389
gonna raise the age or whatever from

4575
03:24:23,439 --> 03:24:28,838
this to that it's just a little tiny

4576
03:24:25,389 --> 03:24:30,548
insignificant change we're gonna give

4577
03:24:28,838 --> 03:24:33,219
people five more years if they commit

4578
03:24:30,549 --> 03:24:35,470
whatever crime most of what we're

4579
03:24:33,219 --> 03:24:37,538
changing is already laid out when it

4580
03:24:35,469 --> 03:24:41,378
comes to stuff like marijuana

4581
03:24:37,539 --> 03:24:42,550
legalization we're changing to a whole

4582
03:24:41,379 --> 03:24:48,280
new system

4583
03:24:42,549 --> 03:24:50,769
nothing is laid out when you're crafting

4584
03:24:48,280 --> 03:24:54,909
stuff for people to vote on how you

4585
03:24:50,770 --> 03:24:56,920
write the issue matters once it's passed

4586
03:24:54,909 --> 03:25:00,520
in the law and your stay and it passes

4587
03:24:56,920 --> 03:25:03,040
by popular vote it that feels like the

4588
03:25:00,520 --> 03:25:06,040
win um and it's not that's getting

4589
03:25:03,040 --> 03:25:08,010
invited to the game it just feels like a

4590
03:25:06,040 --> 03:25:10,870
win and don't get me wrong

4591
03:25:08,010 --> 03:25:13,059
boating on legalization as a state is

4592
03:25:10,870 --> 03:25:15,910
amazing I remember that feeling in

4593
03:25:13,059 --> 03:25:19,689
Colorado I was thinking about it a lot

4594
03:25:15,909 --> 03:25:22,209
last night actually but it's very much

4595
03:25:19,689 --> 03:25:26,170
the beginning of the game you have not

4596
03:25:22,209 --> 03:25:28,358
won yet right now or again I'm seeing

4597
03:25:26,170 --> 03:25:32,590
that a huge number of towns cities and

4598
03:25:28,359 --> 03:25:36,159
counties band rec sales some of those

4599
03:25:32,590 --> 03:25:37,659
are doing it to wait and see some of

4600
03:25:36,159 --> 03:25:39,340
them are doing it because they [ __ ]

4601
03:25:37,659 --> 03:25:41,079
hate marijuana and they don't understand

4602
03:25:39,340 --> 03:25:42,670
whether state legalize it

4603
03:25:41,079 --> 03:25:44,109
some of them are doing it because they

4604
03:25:42,670 --> 03:25:47,559
want a little more time to finish

4605
03:25:44,109 --> 03:25:49,390
crafting the rules but all of them are

4606
03:25:47,559 --> 03:25:50,619
doing it because not enough pro-america

4607
03:25:49,389 --> 03:25:54,159
lot of people are showing up to meetings

4608
03:25:50,620 --> 03:25:55,569
and voicing their support for allowing

4609
03:25:54,159 --> 03:25:58,450
legal marijuana the legal marijuana

4610
03:25:55,568 --> 03:25:59,949
industry in their area Oregon's a big

4611
03:25:58,450 --> 03:26:03,700
legalization state they've been on the

4612
03:25:59,950 --> 03:26:05,979
list for a minute now and they've they

4613
03:26:03,700 --> 03:26:07,870
they don't have nearly the access we do

4614
03:26:05,978 --> 03:26:08,978
here and part of that is because they

4615
03:26:07,870 --> 03:26:11,260
don't have the community that we have

4616
03:26:08,978 --> 03:26:12,760
here they don't have the activists that

4617
03:26:11,260 --> 03:26:15,068
we have here that are fighting for it I

4618
03:26:12,760 --> 03:26:18,670
mean for places like Massachusetts

4619
03:26:15,068 --> 03:26:21,219
Nevada Maine Florida North Dakota

4620
03:26:18,670 --> 03:26:23,020
Arkansas you guys need to start hitting

4621
03:26:21,219 --> 03:26:25,889
those meetings you need to figure out

4622
03:26:23,020 --> 03:26:28,510
how these rules get made in your area

4623
03:26:25,889 --> 03:26:31,029
it's gonna take a lot of time I know a

4624
03:26:28,510 --> 03:26:33,609
lot of you should be at work and don't

4625
03:26:31,030 --> 03:26:36,130
have time to dedicate to this but that's

4626
03:26:33,609 --> 03:26:37,989
kind of how I became me I was the guy

4627
03:26:36,129 --> 03:26:41,438
that didn't have work on Monday nights I

4628
03:26:37,989 --> 03:26:45,309
was the guy who already had a background

4629
03:26:41,439 --> 03:26:46,689
in law and politics and was willing to

4630
03:26:45,309 --> 03:26:48,340
bite the bullet and go to a couple of

4631
03:26:46,689 --> 03:26:52,720
