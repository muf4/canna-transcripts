31
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:17,570
medicated with me on the podcast I like

32
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:19,429
to start the show off by telling

33
00:01:17,569 --> 00:01:20,389
everybody what I've been smoking on let

34
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,740
me reach over here and turn down this

35
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,540
music just a little bit more what am i

36
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:26,030
smoking on today I have been smoking on

37
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,040
some Clementine live resin batter and

38
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,960
I've been taking the dabs of Clementine

39
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,850
I get it on the dabber and I've got this

40
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:33,919
Gotham high cannabinoid full-spectrum

41
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:36,559
extract it's the crystals the diamonds

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,540
it's hard to stick that to the dabber so

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,500
I just push a little to the side and

44
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:43,940
then I stick the Clementine dab dab on

45
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,469
the dabber and then I dip that like a

46
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:47,719
paintbrush into the crystals and just

47
00:01:45,469 --> 00:01:49,280
pick up enough kind of like just uh to

48
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:51,019
season a little a little bit there and

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,930
then the Gotham crystals of course

50
00:01:51,019 --> 00:01:56,719
tested 96 or 98 percent THC I'm pretty

51
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:58,368
sure is 96% THC so the Clementine gives

52
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,129
you a great flavor it's a nice head buzz

53
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,780
I doesn't do a lot for me to get me high

54
00:02:01,129 --> 00:02:04,819
but the flavor is great but those Gotham

55
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,950
crystals they really put you in another

56
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:08,750
place so the Clementine makes it taste

57
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,299
amazing the Gotham gets me super high

58
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,039
really great combo obviously it's got me

59
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:16,640
in a good mood it's got me chatty so

60
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:17,599
hopefully it's good podcast dabs thanks

61
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,089
for joining me everybody I hope you're

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,449
as lit up as I am ah something I want to

63
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,009
talk about um I've been trying to be a

64
00:02:23,449 --> 00:02:27,619
cheap ass I've been trying to buy cheap

65
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:28,759
hash usually the hash that I smoke and

66
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,629
I'm not trying to brag or anything I'm

67
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:31,729
just telling you something that I

68
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:34,069
realized lately the hash that I smoked

69
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:35,659
from most of the time the live resins

70
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:37,699
and the batters depending on where you

71
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:39,590
go some places have sales some places

72
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:41,810
have specials it's gonna run you

73
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:44,569
somewhere between usually thirty five

74
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:47,329
and fifty maybe sixty dollars a gram for

75
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:49,189
top-shelf super quality hash the high

76
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:52,700
cannabinoid full spectrum extracts if

77
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:54,439
you go to some places it'll be 40

78
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:56,030
dollars a gram maybe thirty five dollars

79
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,709
a gram sometimes you can find it on sale

80
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,079
for a little bit cheaper but not much

81
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:01,549
cheaper if you're on the recreational

82
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:03,079
side it's gonna be harder to find and

83
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,090
it's probably going to be fifty or sixty

84
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:06,770
dollars maybe seventy or eighty dollars

85
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,319
a gram I don't shop on the recreation

86
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,580
I've got a medical marijuana card but I

87
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:13,219
know it's way more expensive on that

88
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,920
side of the store what I'm getting at is

89
00:03:13,219 --> 00:03:18,020
um I was trying to be a cheap ass I've

90
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,909
been smoking too much of this expensive

91
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:22,010
hash I thought what if I go to a

92
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:23,359
dispensary and I buy some of this cheap

93
00:03:22,009 --> 00:03:25,669
hash they're advertising there was a

94
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,850
shop advertising ten and $15 grams of

95
00:03:25,669 --> 00:03:29,899
shatter and $15 grams alive resin and so

96
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:31,669
I was like I should go check this out

97
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,870
I'm not gonna say any strain names I'm

98
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:34,699
not gonna say any brand names I'm not

99
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,990
gonna say any dispensary names but I did

100
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,250
a little bit of shopping just to see if

101
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:39,110
there was anything out there affordable

102
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:40,879
bit so that I didn't have to keep buying

103
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,690
these 40 and 50 are grams and dabbing

104
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,889
them all day I was like I'm just gonna

105
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:44,389
go get some cheap [ __ ] that we can take

106
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,809
some big old fat dabs and just keep

107
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:46,849
moving

108
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:48,680
cuz there's something about a big dab I

109
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,930
could take a hundred little dabs and not

110
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:53,360
get as much effect as I would offer from

111
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:55,129
one big dab so I like a big dab just

112
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,380
something about the head rush the lung

113
00:03:55,129 --> 00:03:59,419
expansion I enjoy that so I like to be

114
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,620
able to take a big dab occasionally so I

115
00:03:59,419 --> 00:04:02,899
wanted to go find some cheap [ __ ] I was

116
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,539
being a cheap ass I found some $10 grams

117
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,460
they're acceptable for $10 grams I would

118
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,250
have been mad if it was a 15 or $20 gram

119
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:12,860
I found some $15 grams they're exactly

120
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:15,800
what you would expect from a $15 gram it

121
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,780
I can tell it was made from trim I can

122
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,340
tell that the material was kind of dry

123
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:22,309
and old because it tastes like Keith and

124
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,469
it smells like dusty Keith both of these

125
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:26,780
cheap grams they get me high but I gotta

126
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,340
smoke a lot of it to get any effect from

127
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:32,239
it like a quarter or a half of the gram

128
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:34,310
so I guess it was cost-effective but my

129
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,410
complaint is that all of this cheap hash

130
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,620
kind of tastes like [ __ ]

131
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:42,680
I would rather pay the extra funds and

132
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,259
not have to make this face after I take

133
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,850
my medicine and smoke my dad it's

134
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:48,500
supposed to be enjoyable when I take a

135
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,080
fat dab it's not supposed to taste like

136
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,160
pesticides or nutrients or funk or mold

137
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:54,168
or [ __ ]

138
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,419
it should be oh that was oranjee and

139
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:59,029
delicious or who that was lemony or who

140
00:04:56,418 --> 00:05:01,399
that tastes like OG Kush but a lot of

141
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:03,159
these cheap dads if they kind of does

142
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:05,810
taste like boo boo and it's because ah

143
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,760
my theory is that it's because

144
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:10,040
everybody's making high cannabinoid full

145
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,250
spectrum extracts live resins batters

146
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,140
butters all these other fancy hashes and

147
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,240
the shatter is made from the lowest

148
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:19,558
cheapest quality trim in most situations

149
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,319
I can't speak for every place I know

150
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:23,819
if the girl I run we sent we are very

151
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,158
picky about the trim that we send out to

152
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,289
are actually an instruction company sent

153
00:05:26,158 --> 00:05:30,058
us an email saying that they get more

154
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:32,038
returns and highest tests off of our

155
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:34,349
hash material because we pick through it

156
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,728
clean out the [ __ ] leaves and we it is

157
00:05:34,348 --> 00:05:37,199
trim we make hash out of the trim

158
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:39,568
there's a lot of popcorn but in there

159
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,949
that gives it better quality and we

160
00:05:39,569 --> 00:05:43,848
don't spray with any funky [ __ ] we're

161
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:46,019
mostly switching all the way over to

162
00:05:43,848 --> 00:05:47,759
predator bugs so there's no spray on our

163
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:49,199
plants now it's all predator so the

164
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,968
plants don't taste like [ __ ] nothing's

165
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,038
funky but some of these other places I'm

166
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:55,228
shopping some of the other extractions

167
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,928
it's it tastes terrible something's

168
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:59,459
funky I think they're using the bottom

169
00:05:57,928 --> 00:06:01,738
quality [ __ ] I think they're probably

170
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:03,838
using problematic buds a joke that I

171
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:06,118
used to make when hash started getting

172
00:06:03,838 --> 00:06:07,798
real popular again like BHO my joke was

173
00:06:06,119 --> 00:06:09,749
now that we know how to make pho nobody

174
00:06:07,798 --> 00:06:11,728
gets powdery mildew anymore so I think a

175
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:13,019
lot of the powdery mildew buds that

176
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:14,608
people grow in Colorado because we have

177
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:15,809
huge battery mildew problems in Colorado

178
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,028
it's hard to control the indoor

179
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:20,399
environment when the outdoor environment

180
00:06:17,028 --> 00:06:22,168
changes 30 degrees from day to day it

181
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,968
was 8 o'clock or it was 8 degrees when I

182
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:25,588
got to work at 8 o'clock today and it

183
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:27,718
was 32 degrees when I went to lunch at

184
00:06:25,588 --> 00:06:29,368
noon and now it's probably back down

185
00:06:27,718 --> 00:06:31,468
it's dark time it's nighttime

186
00:06:29,369 --> 00:06:34,139
it's probably back down in like the 16

187
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:35,668
15 degree area so you have to adjust

188
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,978
your HVAC you have to get [ __ ] dialed in

189
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:39,748
and get humidity that does create a lot

190
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:41,278
of powdery mildew so I'm sure that a lot

191
00:06:39,749 --> 00:06:43,860
of the products that I bought for cheap

192
00:06:41,278 --> 00:06:46,408
or powdery mildew or some sign up some

193
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,509
sort of pesticide ridden buds that

194
00:06:46,408 --> 00:06:51,088
people just had to get rid of on the

195
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:52,229
cheap what I'm getting at I know I've

196
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:53,759
just been ranting for a long time you're

197
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:55,769
like what the [ __ ] your point here my

198
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,329
point is remember back in the day when

199
00:06:55,769 --> 00:07:00,179
you had the choice of buying what they

200
00:06:57,329 --> 00:07:01,889
called schwag weed or commercial weed or

201
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:03,418
you could buy people called it kind bud

202
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,359
or there were different words but there

203
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:07,649
was [ __ ] weed and good weed I was always

204
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:08,728
the guy trying to convince my friends

205
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:11,338
quit buying that [ __ ] weed him buy the

206
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:13,318
good weed my theory is that if I took a

207
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:14,699
gram of and I'm just gonna be

208
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,629
hypothetical with numbers here if I took

209
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:21,359
a gram of $15 hash and I took a gram of

210
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:23,278
$45 hash I think the $45 gram lasts me

211
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:25,558
three times as long and gets me three

212
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:28,348
times as medicated and is doesn't it

213
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:30,179
tastes 3 times better so I feel like I

214
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:32,218
learned my lesson I tried I spent a few

215
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:33,349
bucks I didn't waste it because I got

216
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:35,659
some medicine but you should

217
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:37,340
the face I made after I took a couple of

218
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,439
these dad's one of them tastes like fish

219
00:07:37,339 --> 00:07:40,969
oil one of them kind of tastes like

220
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:42,410
broccoli or Brussels sprouts or

221
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:44,570
something but I think I learned my

222
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:46,100
lesson quit trying to be a cheap ass and

223
00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:47,449
quit buying the cheapest concentrates I

224
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,970
can buy and stick with what I know and

225
00:07:47,449 --> 00:07:51,229
what I trust but something else that I

226
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,820
was gonna mention is it seems like

227
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,220
Shatter is being pushed out of the

228
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,500
market so that they can make space for

229
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,090
all of the fancy the acronym

230
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,889
concentrates the high cannabinoid

231
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:03,079
full-spectrum extracts the high terpene

232
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:05,089
full-spectrum extracts the batter's the

233
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:07,219
butters and of course some places are

234
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:09,649
carrying rosen's but I see shatter kind

235
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,570
of becoming kind of the old school stuff

236
00:08:09,649 --> 00:08:12,979
like how a lot of us look at the bubble

237
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:14,449
hash and stuff like that like the old

238
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,680
hash at the old guys smoked we look at

239
00:08:14,449 --> 00:08:17,509
it like that's hash old guys smoked

240
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,069
pretty soon that's what shatter is gonna

241
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:21,500
be and I'm gonna be an old guy smoking

242
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,819
shatter it's really interesting to me

243
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,040
the way things come and go from this

244
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,500
industry so quickly now before it was

245
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,750
legal it took a long time for things to

246
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:32,120
evolve and travel around the world and

247
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,070
around the country if you were doing if

248
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,168
you're doing dads in California before

249
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,550
the internet before legalization it

250
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:39,168
would have taken years for people in New

251
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:42,049
York to catch on how to do dad's the

252
00:08:39,168 --> 00:08:44,120
same now with legalization in places now

253
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:45,889
with the internet you could do a DAB in

254
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,539
California on Facebook live and teach

255
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:49,250
your buddy in New York exactly how to do

256
00:08:47,539 --> 00:08:50,719
a dad and you guys can teach each other

257
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,879
the same lingo and now you're saying the

258
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,800
same [ __ ] on both coasts both doing dads

259
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,439
all this new [ __ ] is just across the

260
00:08:54,799 --> 00:09:00,079
country instantly and now with

261
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,910
legalization we're able to do so much

262
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,400
more learning so much more testing so

263
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:06,079
much more R&amp;D and we have are indeed

264
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,610
ourselves up to the top with these

265
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,200
crystals with all these batters and

266
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:12,019
butters tour we have are indeed

267
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,580
ourselves so quickly that shatter is

268
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:18,799
becoming an antiquity I think it was

269
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:21,830
2010-2011 maybe 2009 when I took my

270
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,120
first dab that was my first dab out of a

271
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,800
rig and I'll tell you where that was in

272
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,500
a second but the first time anybody gave

273
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,909
me any BHO was a friend of mine just

274
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,919
gave me a little piece of parchment with

275
00:09:28,909 --> 00:09:32,480
some snuff folded in it and a little

276
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:33,740
sappy stuff folded up in there and he's

277
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,629
like give that a hit when you get home

278
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,919
and so I went home and I scraped it into

279
00:09:35,629 --> 00:09:38,539
a brand new pipe that had never been

280
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:40,549
smoked out and I just put it on the bowl

281
00:09:38,539 --> 00:09:42,139
and my doesn't let that shut up and gave

282
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:44,029
it a hit and I was supposed to go

283
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:45,250
somewhere and wherever I was supposed to

284
00:09:44,029 --> 00:09:47,799
go I remember just texting

285
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:49,389
I'm gonna be late cuz I just laid face

286
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,849
down on the couch and I was like holy

287
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:54,490
[ __ ] I was so high I didn't been that

288
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:55,810
high that instantly high that fast cuz I

289
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,209
went from I haven't smoked all day I

290
00:09:55,809 --> 00:10:00,518
want to get high - oh [ __ ] I need a nap

291
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:03,518
and some food and maybe some cartoons

292
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:05,139
like just instantly so that was my first

293
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,389
time smoking concentrates and that was

294
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:09,100
I'm gonna say that was not smoking

295
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:11,409
concentrate smoking BHO made

296
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:14,079
concentrates I'm gonna say that was 2008

297
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,938
or 2009 because of the person that gave

298
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:18,818
it to me and where I was and how we were

299
00:10:15,938 --> 00:10:20,588
associated I was involved with met amar

300
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,669
at the dispensary at that time and

301
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:24,009
that's where I met the guy and I'm

302
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:27,039
pretty sure that's where I got it so it

303
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:29,769
was like 2008-2009 is probably when I

304
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,448
started smoking vho and then I told you

305
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,179
I tell you about my first real dab I've

306
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:38,859
talked about it on this podcast I was at

307
00:10:34,179 --> 00:10:41,229
the um the Denver Medical the Denver

308
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:43,120
High Times medical cannabis cup at the

309
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,319
Expo Events Center there's a lot of

310
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,870
words in that title because they had to

311
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:48,250
put medical in there ah at the Cannabis

312
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:52,269
Cup the High Times Cannabis Cup in

313
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:54,339
Denver at the expo and the Broadway

314
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:56,799
wellness booth had a booth set up and

315
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:58,750
they were giving out dabs and Daniel de

316
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,240
Syal so known as Big D from top-shelf

317
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,970
extracts was giving out dabs and I had

318
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,688
talked to him online we had uh

319
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:07,509
correspondent through Facebook a few

320
00:11:04,688 --> 00:11:08,769
times we'd never met in person and we

321
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:09,879
saw each other's faces and I was like

322
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,778
dude you're the guy from the internet

323
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,938
he's like dude you're the guy from the

324
00:11:10,778 --> 00:11:14,318
internet so I walked up and got in line

325
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,938
it took a dad and we introduced each

326
00:11:14,318 --> 00:11:17,438
other and then I bought a dad rig from

327
00:11:15,938 --> 00:11:19,719
Dan that day it was actually one of the

328
00:11:17,438 --> 00:11:21,370
old-school swingarm skillets but I stood

329
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,689
in line and I went up and got my turn I

330
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:24,250
took a dad and I was like man that was

331
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:25,448
amazing and he's like this kind of oil

332
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:27,159
and he told me I don't remember what he

333
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:28,240
said but I was like I'm gonna come back

334
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,649
and buy one of those and he kind of

335
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,058
looked at me like yep I bet you will cuz

336
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:32,679
you look like you really like that and

337
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:34,120
so I thought about it for the next

338
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:35,138
couple hours I was like should I do it

339
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,459
should I do it I was like [ __ ] I can't

340
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:37,959
even quit thinking about and I went

341
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:39,638
bought my first a brick and I still have

342
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:42,458
it I still have to skill it and I still

343
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,169
have the little dub they call it a cough

344
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:46,750
less bong it's just a real to beaker

345
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:48,278
style bong we've got a little beaker

346
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:50,139
bass and it's just real tall and skinny

347
00:11:48,278 --> 00:11:50,470
it doesn't make you cough it's pretty

348
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,299
nice

349
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:55,540
then I brought that home and I smoked

350
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:58,449
dads with little keV and pops and Tony

351
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:00,279
and probably Mike and myself and I

352
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:02,320
remember who else was there but I

353
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,110
remember we all took our first eye they

354
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,700
took their first dads in my basement

355
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:09,070
doing it that 70 show style down in the

356
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,290
basement getting stoned back then and

357
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:13,210
they think everybody went home and took

358
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:15,159
a nap I think I called everybody I

359
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,330
texted everybody like four hours later

360
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:17,769
Isaac what's up and they're all like I

361
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:19,600
just [ __ ] woke up from a nap dude

362
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:23,019
that [ __ ] was funny I remember that that

363
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,090
was like 2010 or 2011 when that first

364
00:12:23,019 --> 00:12:26,500
High Times Cannabis Cup came to Colorado

365
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:27,850
I believe the medical one that wasn't

366
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,129
recreational before we allowed

367
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,810
recreational cannabis so that's the

368
00:12:30,129 --> 00:12:35,799
amount of time it's now 2,000 barely

369
00:12:31,809 --> 00:12:37,479
2018 dad's lasted Shatter lasted like

370
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:40,029
eight years before it started becoming

371
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,789
the old school [ __ ] it was all the rage

372
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:43,990
for a minute and now it's like the yeah

373
00:12:42,789 --> 00:12:45,250
maybe we'll smoke some shatter if you

374
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:47,200
got some but I'd rather smoke all this

375
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,330
other [ __ ] first it's really neat how

376
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,740
it's evolving I've predicted and I don't

377
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,660
know how long this will be I don't know

378
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:56,289
that we'll actually see this but I think

379
00:12:52,659 --> 00:12:58,269
that eventually you'll be able to go to

380
00:12:56,289 --> 00:13:00,519
maybe it'll be like a budtender slash

381
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:04,000
pharmacist slash coke dispenser machine

382
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:06,759
and you'll be like oh I like I like this

383
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,759
much THC this much CBD this much CBG

384
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,470
this much cbn my cannabinoid ratios

385
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,720
now for my terpenes I like this much

386
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:15,639
trip inyline this much piney all this

387
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,889
much whichever trip I'm gonna talk about

388
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:19,600
and then your bud tinder or your

389
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:20,980
pharmacist or the machine that you're

390
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,300
pressing the buttons on and ordering

391
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,279
everything from because it's the future

392
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:26,679
and everything will be automated you

393
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:28,600
just type in your your ratios and it

394
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:30,309
basically has a bunch of it's got those

395
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,810
ingredients in the back and it whips I'm

396
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,069
up for it

397
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,849
it spits it out like a Coke machine and

398
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,860
it's like here's your grandma

399
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,540
concentrate custom-tailored for you it's

400
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,639
perfectly mixed up so that every time

00:13:37,539 --> 00:13:44,349
you take a dab you get that perfect this

402
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:46,000
much THC this much CBD CBD CBN whichever

403
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,040
cannabinoids you're looking for and also

404
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,960
the perfect ratio an amount of terpenes

405
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:51,399
tor that it tastes perfect for you and

406
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,810
those terpenoids work with the

407
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:56,169
cannabinoids it'll be your perfect

408
00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:58,119
tailored mix ah maybe you'll have a USB

409
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,159
card that you can stick into a machine

410
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,810
and it can bring up your options that

411
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,279
you've bought before so that you can

412
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:04,719
have your different variety mixes saved

413
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,459
on that USB card so you can just stick

414
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,590
USB in and it goes oh you need mix

415
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,150
number 3752 will spit it out for your

416
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,649
palm then you could just save it on a

417
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:13,328
USB you've always got your

418
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:15,879
your mix right there that it that way it

419
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:17,558
never changes that's something I not

420
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,938
exactly but that's sort of what I see

421
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:21,159
coming in the future you will be able to

422
00:14:18,938 --> 00:14:22,058
custom tailor your own concentrate for

423
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,828
your own needs

424
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:26,049
what kind of mix do you think you would

425
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:28,299
make you should tweet me tell me tweet

426
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:30,308

427
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:31,688
can send me a Facebook message or you

00:14:30,308 --> 00:14:33,428
can email me it's growth from your heart

429
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:35,169
at hotmail.com let me know if you can

430
00:14:33,428 --> 00:14:37,208
make up your own custom mix what would

431
00:14:35,169 --> 00:14:38,498
you make do you know what percentage of

432
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:40,208
which cannabinoid interpreting

433
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:42,069
terpenoids you would put in there do you

434
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:44,469
know let me know what you think I would

435
00:14:42,068 --> 00:14:47,948
probably make myself a really high THC

436
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:49,660
mix with a lot of limonene and lemony

437
00:14:47,948 --> 00:14:52,859
flavored Terps or Beecher pennilyn and

438
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:55,568
limonene it would be really candy lemony

439
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:57,249
lemony flavored maybe a lint of orange

440
00:14:55,568 --> 00:14:59,049
so maybe like some pineapple in there

441
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:01,269
oranges lemons pineapples would be

442
00:14:59,049 --> 00:15:03,188
really like that flavor a super high THC

443
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:06,249
and it would just make my head spin and

444
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:08,799
then I would have another one that what

445
00:15:06,249 --> 00:15:11,110
had like a real cushy chem flavor and it

446
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,609
would have something in there would make

447
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:14,350
me just want to be chilled out kind of

448
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,720
sedated kind of lazy maybe kind of

449
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,339
creative maybe a little bit giggly but I

450
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,110
would have two different opposite kinds

451
00:15:18,339 --> 00:15:22,360
of ends of the spectrum from my uh my

452
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,339
custom-tailored concentrates that's what

453
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,509
I would do alright that's just big hopes

454
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,999
and dreams that's a long time in the

455
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:29,949
future I hope to see that day and I hope

456
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,959
you guys are there with me man that was

457
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:33,998
a long fun rant these dads must be

458
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:37,208
working you guys let's talk about

459
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:38,740
something more cannabis related how

460
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,909
about a breeding update you guys I keep

461
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,769
telling you about the breeding update

462
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:43,749
that I'm working on I of course in

463
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:45,490
breeding with my male its King Solomon

464
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:46,600
that isn't a rise male it's golden go

465
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:49,120
across the Daybreaker

466
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,920
I mentioned previously on the show that

467
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,778
around Christmastime or around the new

468
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:55,599
year I would be pollinating and the

469
00:15:52,778 --> 00:15:58,088
pollination has happened those plants

470
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,980
are all filled with pollen the seeds are

471
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:02,470
forming the seeds are starting to get

472
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,149
hard I can see them they're large and

473
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,160
green the calyx is are getting swollen

474
00:16:04,149 --> 00:16:08,139
that are obviously seeded the pistils

475
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,669
have curled up the plants are bright

476
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:11,350
bright green and the pistils are bright

477
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:14,378
red and the trichomes are developing

478
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:17,319
they look really good let me look at the

479
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:19,389
date today we're recording on why can't

480
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:21,490
I find the date anywhere today is this

481
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:22,659
the 4th we're recording on January 4th

482
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:24,149
that means that those plants have been

483
00:16:22,659 --> 00:16:26,549
into flower for a

484
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,409
about 36 days which means they need

485
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:30,719
about twenty five more days ish to

486
00:16:28,409 --> 00:16:33,839
finish up and then those seeds should be

487
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,279
ready they look really nice I posted one

488
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,389
or two pictures to Instagram so if

489
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,149
you're not following me on Instagram you

490
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:43,139
should check that out it's i reaiiy rie

491
00:16:39,149 --> 00:16:44,789
underscore GE and ET ICS I read genetics

492
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,649
on Instagram check out my cannabis

493
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:49,589
photography but I'm super excited about

494
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:51,299
the Durbin poison cross to arise for

495
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,759
some reason I feel like that's going to

496
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:56,099
be a really good cross I see a lot of

497
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,750
potential in mating those two also the

498
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,659
star dog I feel like that's gonna be an

499
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:02,190
amazing cross and also platinum tangi is

500
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:04,379
in there I'm hoping that's just gonna

501
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,870
make big Spears that smell like oranges

502
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,490
and candy and are just coated in resin

503
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:10,469
the Platinum tangi is already a great

504
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,670
strain it's just kind of small and I

505
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,049
want to make it bigger and I want to

506
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,000
make something in my own that has that

507
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:16,559
orange flavor want to have that orange

508
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,420
to my lineup because I love orange

509
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,509
flavored concentrates so I'm really

510
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:23,190
excited about those three crosses they

511
00:17:21,509 --> 00:17:25,140
should be finished up here toward the

512
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,700
end of January and I'll keep giving you

513
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,580
guys updates and I'll keep posting

514
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:31,590
pictures all right speaking of strains

515
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,149
that I bred I've got an email from a

516
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:35,549
listener that starts off by giving me a

517
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:37,830
compliment and then they asked me to

518
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:40,019
give advice on growing strains that I

519
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:41,730
have bred so I'm gonna press pause I'm

520
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,710
gonna take a drink I'm gonna take a

521
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,539
couple of more dabs I might check my

522
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:47,430
Instagram and then I'm gonna come back

523
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:50,700
and read this email and talk about

524
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:54,779
growing strains that I have bred I'll be

525
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:57,090
right back take a DAB you guys all right

526
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,009
podcast world I am back I am well

527
00:17:57,089 --> 00:18:00,959
medicated I took a dab of some of the

528
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:03,180
cheap hash I was talking about kind of

529
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,069
taste like ah I don't know maybe cream a

530
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:08,490
broccoli soup or maybe some creamed corn

531
00:18:05,069 --> 00:18:11,700
had sort of a vegetable E soft smooth

532
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,620
flavor that I don't know proof of

533
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,509
goddammit I bought it got a damn it got

534
00:18:13,619 --> 00:18:16,919
to do something with it

535
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:18,230
anybody need a dad I got a dad if you

536

you guys I told you I was gonna read an

539
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,500
email I printed it out I've got it right

540
00:18:23,819 --> 00:18:27,720
here in my hand I'm gonna read it it

541
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,519
goes like this it says what's up Rasta

542

Prohibition land so you can call me to

544
00:18:31,589 --> 00:18:35,519
the roach which is my dude grows crew

545
00:18:33,509 --> 00:18:37,460
name went up to the roach good to meet

546
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:38,779
you they call me Rasta Jeff

547
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:40,970
glad to make friends with anybody from

548
00:18:38,779 --> 00:18:42,500
the dude grows crew on the email goes on

549
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,269
to say I heard of your show from the

550
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,289
guys over at the dude Rose show been

551
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:46,940
hooked ever since

552
00:18:45,289 --> 00:18:49,039
I've caught up on the majority of your

553
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:50,690
episodes and I love it hey man thanks

554
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,670
for listening to the podcast I'm glad

555
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:54,950
I've got you hooked and I'm glad you

556
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:56,269
love the show he also says I was lucky

557
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:58,370
enough to take advantage of the Black

558
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:00,619
Friday sale on your genetics that's

559
00:18:58,369 --> 00:19:02,299
right you guys the hella dank seed bank

560
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,739
did a really great Black Friday sale

561
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:05,539
they're doing another sale right now

562
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,390
making sure you check them out at dank

563
00:19:05,539 --> 00:19:10,789
seed dot store you can grab yourself

564
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,740
some IRA genetics he says I just popped

565
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:15,379
some piranha seeds I also picked up some

566
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,120
morning dew and storm shadow my question

567
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,100
is have you ever done a show with

568
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,439
detailed information or tips on growing

569
00:19:19,099 --> 00:19:23,169
said strains thank you for your time and

570
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,670
for the knowledge and entertainment I

571
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,380
will give my mom a big hug for you and

572
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:29,660
take it to the next level and smoke a

573
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,450
fat dab with her and that sounds good

574
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,610
man you are going above above and beyond

575
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,410
with that one I thanks again to the

576
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:39,139
roach 8 - the roach thanks for the great

577
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:41,450
great email that's a really good idea I

578
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,130
have actually thought about doing

579
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,660
podcasts about strains that I've read

580
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,130
but it felt kind of I don't know

581
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,450
self-centered or egotistical or

582
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,980
something spinning a whole podcast

583
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:51,080
talking about something that I created

584
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,819
but since you asked for it and you

585
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:55,009
actually sent a list of strains that you

586
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:56,750
purchased and wanted tips on I've

587
00:19:55,009 --> 00:19:58,160
decided that I will start doing this and

588
00:19:56,750 --> 00:20:00,019
I'll try to get through a few strains

589
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,460
over a few episodes I'll just do one

590
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,680
strain per episode and I'll probably do

591
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,049
I'll space them out pretty far but I did

592
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:08,539
make a few notes the strain that I chose

593
00:20:06,049 --> 00:20:10,700
to start with is morning dew I probably

594
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:12,500
would have chosen a rise but since you

595
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,240
sent the email that inspired this and

596
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,170
you said that you had piranhas morning

597
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,059
dew and Storm Shadow

598
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:18,890
I felt that morning dew would be a good

599
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:20,929
place to start out of those three and

600
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:23,630
then we will work our way through a lot

601
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:25,039
of the other IRA genetics lineup um the

602
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,350
reason I chose morning dew out of those

603
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,899
three is because it's got the Grateful

604
00:20:27,349 --> 00:20:31,579
dog which was kind of my debut strain

605
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,380
that was one of the first strains that I

606
00:20:31,579 --> 00:20:35,029
released I had made plenty before that

607
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:36,710
but I never put anything out The

608
00:20:35,029 --> 00:20:39,109
Grateful dog was the thing that I passed

609
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,529
out I gave a bunch of pack to those away

610
00:20:39,109 --> 00:20:45,349
at the cannabis cups in Denver the first

611
00:20:42,529 --> 00:20:46,910
one that was at the the Denver Mart

612
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:49,009
outdoors I just walked around and gave

613
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:51,330
tons of five packs of seeds away to

614
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:53,519
people I gave away the heart of

615
00:20:51,329 --> 00:20:55,649
and I gave away the grateful dog and the

616
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,389
grateful dog was a hit people seemed to

617
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,280
really love the grateful dog the

618
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:01,590
genetics of the grateful dog is of

619
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,680
course the chem 91 also known as the s

620
00:21:01,589 --> 00:21:07,379
BK cut cross to San Fernando Valley og

621
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,970
cush it's also known as the deadhead OG

622
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,500
but it's a little bit inbred and kind of

623
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,690
worked a little bit so it's the Grateful

624
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,269
dog FEM C because I put it out an only a

625
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:17,220
feminized version and that was crossed

626
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:19,799
to the arise which is golden goat

627
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:21,059
crossed a day breaker and I know I'm

628
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:23,129
breaking down the family tree kind of

629
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:24,750
far but I like to do that because it

630
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,040
explains why plants grow the way that

631
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,529
they do and what traits you're looking

632
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:31,500
for the golden goat of course is Island

633
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:32,819
sweet skunk Hawaiian and Romulan so

634
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:35,460
that's where you get that tropical

635
00:21:32,819 --> 00:21:37,169
flavor from then Hawaiian gives it the

636
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,759
tropical flavor the island sweet skunk

637
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,529
of course gives it that sweet tangy

638
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,960
thing and then the Romulan is what makes

639
00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,210
it grow so well I think the combination

640
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,009
of those made a really great combo the

641
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:49,620
Hawaiian probably gives it the sativa

642
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:51,059
punch that it's got I think the golden

643
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:52,829
goat is a great strain and then I bred

644
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:55,470
that to the day breaker I used to day

645
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:59,849
break or mail day breaker of course is

646
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:01,860
CEM D crossed to the Joseph og the Kim D

647
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:05,039
female was pollinated by a male known as

648
00:22:01,859 --> 00:22:07,740
Joseph og Joseph og is an OG Kush male

649
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,359
that day breaker cross was made by our

650
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,430
friends gage Green genetics

651
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,589
I got seeds from gage green I found a

652
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:15,960
marvelous male and female of the day

653
00:22:13,589 --> 00:22:17,459
breaker in there I made a breaker f2s

654
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,500
that's where the black cherry Kim came

655
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:21,360
from quite a few great crosses came out

656
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,539
of that batch of breeding but I made the

657
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:27,449
day break or I made the the arise there

658
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:29,339
then I took the arise male which is

659
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:32,580
known as King Solomon and I crossed him

660
00:22:29,339 --> 00:22:34,500
to my grateful dog and the progeny of a

661
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:36,269
rise cross the grateful dog was known as

662
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:39,119
morning dew of course that's named after

663
00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:41,129
a Grateful Dead song because it's got

664
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,929
the arise so it's the morning I kind of

665
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:44,820
thought of and then the grateful dog

666
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:46,950
which is the Grateful Dead offshoot

667
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:49,799
named after a Grateful Dead song about

668
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,480
morning dew so I'm fairly proud and was

669
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:53,909
fairly excited of morning dew because of

670
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:55,559
course arises as a strain I created

671
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,990
grateful dog was the first rain I

672
00:22:55,559 --> 00:22:59,609
created and now they are put together so

673
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,200
it's kind of a timeline put together to

674
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:02,519
show a little bit of progress in my

675
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,130
breeding I

676
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:06,809
and they're two of my best uh best known

677
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:08,640
products other than the lemon Jeffrey

678
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:10,079
the Grateful dog in the Arizer probably

679
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
and the lemon Jeffrey would be the top

680
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,559
three most popular strains I've made so

681
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,029
it's fun to have them put together now

682
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,039
I've told you a lot about how they were

683
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:18,809
bred or why they were bred how the names

684
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,930
came about and what they are let's talk

685
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:24,960
a little bit about growing these plants

686
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:27,210
what should you expect from morning dew

687
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,789
now keep in mind that morning dew is an

688
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:31,620
f1 hybrid and there will be Fino typical

689
00:23:29,789 --> 00:23:34,230
variation you will see differences in

690
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:36,119
your plants but this is basically what I

691
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,190
think will work for every phenotype

692
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,469
although there will be some outliers and

693
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,509
also your conditions your environment

694
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:44,700
your lights your nutrients all of those

695
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:46,410
things will play a part in everything

696
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,350
that I'm about to tell you if you have

697
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:51,269
LEDs or HIDs you may take you a little

698
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:53,459
bit longer or shorter flowering time if

699
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:55,259
you're using hydroponics or soilless

700
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,329
mixes it may take you a little longer a

701
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:58,710
little shorter but here's a basic

702
00:23:57,329 --> 00:24:00,839
guideline and some things that I have

703
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:02,640
found by running a lot of seeds here are

704
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:05,759
things that I found you can expect from

705
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,430
morning dew seeds most of them are going

706
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,859
to take you about 55 to 65 days of

707
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:13,950
flowering to finish usually nine weeks

708
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:15,959
is just about right morning dew plants

709
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:18,210
are going to get medium tall and they'll

710
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,490
be kind of bushy if you top it if you

711
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:22,049
let it grow to about two feet tall and

712
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:23,640
then take out that main node right out

713
00:24:22,049 --> 00:24:25,500
of the middle then it'll start pushing

714
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,480
out real nice I think it'll Bush out and

715
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,220
get kind of semi medium tall it'll get a

716
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,500
lot of heads that way that will really

717
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:34,170
increase your production when you do

718
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,849
that it's gonna need some supports right

719
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,259
before you put it into flour don't put

720
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,179
the supports on too early

721
00:24:37,259 --> 00:24:41,129
leave the tomato cage off leave the

722
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:42,930
sticks off leave the cage off leave the

723
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:44,520
netting off so that you can put some

724
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,950
fans on it and let these plants blow

725
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,119
around also going there in super crop

726
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,680
stuff so that it gets a little bit

727
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,809
stronger give it the pop and twist I

728
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,430
talked about that on another episode

729
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:54,539
when you pop it or you grab it and then

730
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:56,789
you give it a little twist right above

731
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,379
your finger pop and it goes pop makes a

732
00:24:56,789 --> 00:25:00,450
little stronger do that it will like

733
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,920
that but do that stuff before you put

734
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:04,230
supports on and then right before you

735
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,210
flour it go ahead and put your support

736
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:08,819
if it's trellising if it's a tomato cage

737
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:10,559
if it sticks it'll need that in flour

738
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:12,419
but don't do it too early because you

739
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,099
don't want to make it weak morning dew

740
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:15,660
is going to produce buds that its own

741
00:25:14,099 --> 00:25:16,349
branches can't support it'll need some

742
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,509
so

743
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:21,240
two supports if you do it right so it's

744
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:23,460
gonna be medium tall it's gonna need

745
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,359
some supports I would top it and get it

746
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,798
kind of bushy um let's see I'm trying to

747
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,750
figure out which order we should go in

748
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,250
it's gonna need some cages or some nets

749
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,220
or sticks I think I've talked about that

750
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:38,119
so now let's talk about it's gonna be

751
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,410
stinky you guys this one is going to be

752
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:42,659
stinky you're gonna need some carbon

753
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,279
filtration or something if you're gonna

754
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,808
grow this in an apartment or a house

755
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,519
next door to somebody else or in an

756
00:25:45,808 --> 00:25:50,129
illegal state if you're going to grow

757
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:53,579
morning dew I highly suggest plenty of

758
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,590
carbon filtration maybe something else

759
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:57,658
around the house that smells good also

760
00:25:55,589 --> 00:26:00,240
that distracts from the smell it's gonna

761
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:03,360
stink also if you want to increase that

762
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,669
stank-ass aroma in the morning do feed

763
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:07,798
it some kelp type products it really

764
00:26:05,669 --> 00:26:10,200
likes liquid karma that's one thing I've

765
00:26:07,798 --> 00:26:12,269
noticed it really enjoys liquid Karma

766
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,548
it likes veg bloom products it likes

767
00:26:12,269 --> 00:26:17,908
shine very well so feed it

768
00:26:14,548 --> 00:26:21,450
kelp products and also seems to like the

769
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:23,250
pH semi low in late flour I've noticed

770
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,860
that it kind of it goes a little better

771
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,390
it goes faster it keeps growing if later

772
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:28,918
and flower-like around when it starts

773
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,210
purple and out you'll see the morning

774
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,669
dew will start to purple out and change

775
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,110
colors on you maybe lower the pH just a

776
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:36,509
little bit if you're going six four or

777
00:26:34,109 --> 00:26:38,579
six five already maybe try six three or

778
00:26:36,509 --> 00:26:40,169
six to just go one or two points lower

779
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:42,538
than you normally would and I've noticed

780
00:26:40,169 --> 00:26:44,940
that the morning dew tends to like the

781
00:26:42,538 --> 00:26:47,250
lower pH another thing I have learned

782
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,320
about the morning dew is that it can use

783
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,750
a little more cal-mag than most of your

784
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,250
plants i wouldn't do i wouldn't increase

785
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:55,230
the dosage i would increase the

786
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,669
frequency I would just speed if you're

787
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:58,620
doing cal-mag once a week I would maybe

788
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:00,960
do cal-mag twice a week maybe add some

789
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:03,599
epsom salts in there but be careful with

790
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,460
the nutrients because you don't want to

791
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,740
go too hard you don't want to push it

792
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:09,179
this is an OG Kush kind of a plant going

793
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,569
too hard with the nutrients could cause

794
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,519
you problems don't over water but make

795
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:17,220
sure you have plenty of water

796
00:27:14,519 --> 00:27:19,319
I think Jorge Jorge Cervantes taught us

797
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,169
we want water to be abundant but not

798
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,629
excessive so if you've got like a three

799
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:26,340
gallon pot probably pour about half of a

800
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:28,169
gallon on the top of there and let it

801
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:30,189
saturate through it's probably gonna

802
00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:31,809
take depending on the size of your plant

803
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:34,509
day maybe two or three days for that

804
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:36,700
water to dry up and need water again let

805
00:27:34,509 --> 00:27:38,950
it get fairly dry before you water it

806
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,139
again these plants will enjoy that the

807
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:43,750
morning dew the grateful dog likes a

808
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:46,209
little bit of a dry period um cooler

809
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:47,798
temps will help you bring out the purple

810
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,759
I said that these plants change colors

811
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:50,859
later in flower

812
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,378
some of them will turn really cool

813
00:27:50,859 --> 00:27:55,240
Purple's lower temps will certainly help

814
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:56,798
with that that helps with most plants

815
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,359
and the thing I said about the cal-mag

816
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:01,000
about it wanting a little extra cal-mag

817
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:03,250
most of your og style plants are going

818
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,288
to want a little more cal-mag it's gonna

819
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:06,730
give your leaves a really sweet serrated

820
00:28:05,288 --> 00:28:08,288
look they're gonna stand up strong

821
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,679
they're gonna enjoy it

822
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:12,669
so cooler temps add some cal-mag

823
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:14,950
unfortunately you guys the morning dew

824
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:16,870
there are some freak-ass mutant

825
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:19,120
phenotypes in there they're rare I've

826
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:21,099
ran a lot of these seeds and I only came

827
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,599
across a few mutants there was one

828
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:24,128
mutant that was [ __ ] cool it looked

829
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:27,459
like I had topped it and he drew four

830
00:28:24,128 --> 00:28:28,480
equal tops right away I didn't finish it

831
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,860
because I didn't have room for that

832
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,679
mutant I did not want to see what it did

833
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:34,508
I couldn't waste space on it it got big

834
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:36,278
enough to see that it was a freak I went

835
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:38,110
had to get thrown away it got cold but I

836
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:40,480
saw that there were a couple other odd

837
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:43,028
leaf shape plants in there but I

838
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,058
finished a lot of those and I found that

839
00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:49,000
the fat early phenotypes of morning do

840
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:50,950
have this stank if you've got one with

841
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,659
the broader the leaf the more the stank

842
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,100
it seemed like and if the ones the ones

843
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:55,600
that got black when they started

844
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,668
finishing the ones that turned real dark

845
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,548
in the leaves almost a black color those

846
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:03,070
had the stank kind of like an OG Kush

847
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:04,720
dirty feet sort of make your nose

848
00:29:03,069 --> 00:29:07,148
crinkle up but in a good way sort of

849
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,429
stink but those were also the slower

850
00:29:07,148 --> 00:29:11,739
grower phenotypes they were lankier they

851
00:29:09,429 --> 00:29:13,419
grew a little bit slower but they had

852
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:16,899
the stink they didn't produce as much

853
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:19,870
herb they produced uh further space to

854
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:22,000
golf balls instead of Spears but it was

855
00:29:19,869 --> 00:29:24,008
such good quality herb that it was worth

856
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,079
it so the fat leafed one is gonna be a

857
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:28,419
smaller producing slower growing plant

858
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,918
but it's gonna put out the stink if you

859
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:31,629
just want some weed that you can smell

860
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,490
six blocks away when you light a joint

861
00:29:31,628 --> 00:29:35,980
that's the phenotype you're looking for

862
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,259
there is a skinnier leaf phenotype it's

863
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:39,669
got fairly skinny leaves I'm not sure if

864
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:41,950
those skinny leaves are coming from the

865
00:29:39,669 --> 00:29:43,389
golden goat or the chem 91 but there's

866
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,630
skinny leaves and you'll see it if you

867
00:29:43,388 --> 00:29:44,979
get

868
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,020
skinny leaf when you ago I think that's

869
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:49,900
what he's talking about it gets kind of

870
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:52,720
tall but it makes just long skinny buds

871
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,700
and it's just coated and resin and it's

872
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,079
got that it's got the stink to it but

873
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:58,569
not this stink like the other phenotypes

874
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:00,609
do it's got more like the cam with some

875
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:01,990
sweet going on is what I noticed it was

876
00:30:00,609 --> 00:30:04,899
like cam but it had the golden goat

877
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:06,880
background is like if you put golden

878
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,610
goat in a jar that had chem dog in it

879
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,550
before but had more it seemed to be more

880
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:14,619
of the THC dominant planet had more

881
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:16,779
trichomes it had a better just ahead

882
00:30:14,619 --> 00:30:18,219
ripping high the fatter leafed one was

883
00:30:16,779 --> 00:30:19,539
kind of got you high but it was more

884
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:22,660
like in the face more like in the

885
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:23,889
eyeballs but the skinny leaf one it just

886
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:26,140
made my brain spin around

887
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,670
it had feels like it's got more more of

888
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,160
a THC punch so those are two different

889
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,380
phenotypes you can look for I said

890
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:34,090
earlier to top him when you taught

891
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:35,290
morning dew or if you trellis morning

892
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:37,269
dew out give her plenty of time to

893
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:39,279
recover because she's kind of a slower

894
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,509
growing plant and you don't want to top

895
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,879
a plant and then put her right into

896
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:44,680
flower so if you do top her give her

897
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,270
plenty of time to recover from that

898
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,009
let those hormones move back up to the

899
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:49,660
tops let the hormones decide where

900
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:51,640
they're gonna be before he flower I say

901
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,350
ten days some people say a week is

902
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,600
enough I would go 10 to 14 days if it

903
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:57,039
were up to me just let your top to plant

904
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:58,329
recover before he put it in the flower

905
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,490
and that's a good idea with any strain

906
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:02,169
but the morning dew sometimes you've got

907
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:03,339
a slower growing phenotype so make sure

908
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:05,050
you give it plenty of time to recover

909
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:06,579
let it stretch back out before you

910
00:31:05,049 --> 00:31:08,589
flower it or you'll just end up with a

911
00:31:06,579 --> 00:31:09,970
bunch of little tiny buds at the top and

912
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:11,289
that's no fun you want to Cola up there

913
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:13,269
at the top you want to take good picture

914
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:16,000
and brag on Instagram so top them let

915
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:17,049
them recover put some cages or some Nets

916
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,579
or some sticks on them

917
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,980
it can take some bending it can take

918
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:23,169
some trails sing morning dew is also

919
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:25,150
very powdery mildew resistant we have

920
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,560
learned we had some plants outdoors not

921
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:28,269
myself but a friend had some plants

922
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:30,970
outdoors all of them except the morning

923
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:32,619
dew got powdery mildew on them over the

924
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,299
last outdoor harvest so that's something

925
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:35,559
that you can you can think about if

926
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:37,240
you're gonna grow outdoors and you get

927
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:39,069
powdery mildew maybe the morning dew is

928
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:41,620
one that will do well for you it won't

929
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:43,509
get the powdery mildew it's definitely

930
00:31:41,619 --> 00:31:47,199
one of the faster finishers and it's one

931
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:49,180
of my most liked chem dog Kimi sort of

932
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,650
scented strains that I've made available

933
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,049
so if you're into something that's got

934
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:54,850
that chem sort of funk to it it's kind

935
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:57,399
of got some like dirty feet and sort of

936
00:31:54,849 --> 00:31:59,409
cami and it smells disgust

937
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,110
delicious and I love it it's pungent

938
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:04,240
it's definitely funky there's hints of

939
00:32:02,109 --> 00:32:06,219
gas in there there's fuel there's funk

940
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,349
there's OG Kush there's chem dog and

941
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,880
then sometimes because if the golden

942
00:32:08,349 --> 00:32:12,399
goat you end up with these like real

943
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:13,990
sweet tropical tones that mix in with

944
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,050
that there's some great phenotypes in

945
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:19,599
there so that's a quick breakdown of

946
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:21,490
morning dew man to the roach that was a

947
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,099
really good email a really good question

948
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:26,500
I appreciate it I feel like that was a

949
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:28,359
lot of fun I haven't had the opportunity

950
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,130
to talk about a strain I've bred

951
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,750
it's something I've proud I'm proud of

952
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:34,300
it's something I've got passionate about

953
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,309
so that was honestly a lot of fun I plan

954
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:38,289
on doing more episodes about more

955
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:39,970
strains I'll probably do the three you

956
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:42,579
asked about first and then we'll branch

957
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,620
off to other stuff but dude I appreciate

958
00:32:42,579 --> 00:32:46,720
that I thank you to the roach I look

959
00:32:44,619 --> 00:32:48,219
forward to your next email and if

960
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,420
anybody else out there has a question or

961
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,860
something they'd like to say I would

962
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,210
love to hear from you you can reach out

963
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:55,750
to me it's grow from your heart and

964
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:58,269
hotmail.com maybe I will read your email

965
00:32:55,750 --> 00:33:01,509
on a future episode I really do enjoy

966
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:03,160
doing the listener generated content all

967
00:33:01,509 --> 00:33:05,650
right and also don't forget the morning

968
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,910
dew seeds are available at dank seed dot

969
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,980
store

970

youtube channel there are about a

990
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:52,299
hundred and forty old episodes up on

991
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,690
YouTube I am making more I keep telling

992
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:54,039
you guys that

993
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:55,360
they're coming if you're paying

994
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,829
attention I'm sure you can see that

995
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,509
they're slowly trickling up there

996
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:59,889
I just ties up my computer and it takes

997
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:01,480
a long time to make those it takes a lot

998
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,009
of bandwidth to upload them so they're

999
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,440
going up slowly but they will all get

1000
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:06,509
there eventually I'll get caught up to

1001
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,250
276 episodes on YouTube

1002
00:34:06,509 --> 00:34:11,079
also don't forget about patreon patreon

1003
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:13,690

1004
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:15,039
to support podcast content providers if

1005
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,139
you'd like to learn more on how to

1006
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:25,359
support this podcast I invite you to go

1007
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:27,128
to patreon.com/scishow spew have been

1008
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,078
contributing four dollars and 20 cents

1009
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:31,538
per month I recently learned that there

1010
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:33,879
was a cannabis advocate who has a

1011
00:34:31,539 --> 00:34:36,849
podcast or a news show somewhere and

1012
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:39,098
they encouraged their listeners to go

1013
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:41,499
find another cannabis advocate or

1014
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:43,568
podcast or a show that supported the

1015
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:45,368
legalization of cannabis and contribute

1016
00:34:43,568 --> 00:34:47,228
four dollars and 20 cents to that show

1017
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:49,200
and it seems like a few people listened

1018
00:34:47,228 --> 00:34:52,898
so thank you guys I appreciate that

1019
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,788
patreon.com slash grow from your heart I

1020
00:34:52,898 --> 00:34:56,949
think I mentioned it on the last episode

1021
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:59,200
but through patreon contributions I was

1022
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:01,778
able to cover the cost of my website

1023
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:03,639
this year my website I read genetics

1024
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:05,349
Colorado comm is where I host the

1025
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:07,389
podcast it's then uploaded through an

1026
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:08,859
RSS feed to iTunes and stitcher and all

1027
00:35:07,389 --> 00:35:10,929
the other podcast services that you

heard on and without that website I

1029
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:15,728

1030
