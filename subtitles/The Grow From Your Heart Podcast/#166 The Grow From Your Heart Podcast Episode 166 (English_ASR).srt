114
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,829
glass pendant you're rocking there that

115
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:38,810
is do that is gobo I don't know how to

116
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:41,209
say he's wearing a pendant that actually

117
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:45,139
has cannabis seeds inside of it and then

118
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:48,049
it's got a little B on the outside cross

119
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:49,789
nice nice I've got one with silver 99

120
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:51,470
seeds in it nice it doesn't have the

121
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,600
drips or the stuff on it's just the

122
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,770
straight-up pindy with the seeds yeah

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,930
these are nice these are a nice little

124
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:58,189
like pinata and it's because like worst

125
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:11,600
comes the worst of it breaks you have

126
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:12,978
like a present afterwards like oh it's

127
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,750
got some a little bit of water nearby

128
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:16,639
that I can take the salt out of and we

129
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:22,399
got some soil that I can put some salts

130
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:23,870
into well we can make this happen one

131
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,829
thing if it's got a hole in it because

132
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:26,180
I'm pretty sure it's got a hole in it

133
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:27,649
because the way that he makes his glass

134
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,769
don't wear it in the shower because your

135
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:32,418
seeds will germinate oh man for real

136
00:05:30,769 --> 00:05:33,560
well all that moisture the humidity in

137
00:05:32,418 --> 00:05:35,060
the shower you'll get water in there

138
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,439
eventually and it just takes a little

139
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,978
tiny bit of water to germinate some

140
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:43,069
seeds and that'll be the C to actually

141
00:05:39,978 --> 00:05:44,478
watch you see what I do see you know

142
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:47,349
somehow try to grow out of it alright

143
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,538
Joey you gotta send us another one so

144

microphone smack against my forehead let

158
00:06:21,778 --> 00:06:25,379

159
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,649
two hundred and fifteen thousand it

160
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:30,629

161
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:32,218
I had an account with nineteen thousand

162
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,778
it got deleted now I'm almost back to

she's like notes for Breast Cancer Month

236
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:30,870
here we do yes we did it was probably

237
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:33,419
one of the most painful things I've been

238
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,399
through in a while these lovely ladies

239
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:38,519
went and got their nipples pierced

240
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:40,230
to raise awareness for breast cancer you

241
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,838
guys that is some dedication these are

242
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,730
some badass women okay this is truly I

243
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,500
didn't do it for like oh let's go get a

244
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,899
tattoo or a piercing this way I thought

245
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,360
about it because I know some people that

246
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:52,889
had breast cancer and I thought it's

247
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,690
Breast Cancer Awareness Month and

248
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:57,480
somebody shared some stories with me and

249
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:58,800
I thought you know what if you have

250
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,730
breast cancer and you're going through

251
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,219
chemotherapy

252
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:05,460
goddang life probably sucks and every

253
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:08,430
day is a battle just having your

254
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,560
mammogram done is enough uncomfortable

255
00:10:08,429 --> 00:10:12,329
experience or any woman it just is

256
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,649
you'll get your boobs squished heard

257
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,480
about that and so I was like come on

258
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:17,129
Lindsey let's do it what's a few minutes

259
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,539
of pain compared to someone how do they

260
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:20,159
do it if you don't have a boot like if

261
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:25,588
you're lacking in the boob region what

262
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:27,329
do they squish I don't know for yeah I

263
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:28,589
know I just took a weird turn on this I

264
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,000
was just like wow how do you I thought

265
00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:30,930
you were for the piercing for a second

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:42,330
oh no no no

267
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:48,059
I don't know you think we did but you're

268
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:54,120
higher than me okay sorry of course that

269
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:56,278
you were on a path you didn't want to go

270
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,649
get a tattoo or no I didn't want to get

271
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,778
his hat too I mean really I didn't and I

272
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:03,740
will share something personal I've been

273
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:08,480
married to my husband for over 40 years

274
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:11,250
almost 45 I know my husband very well I

275
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,050
knew he would not prove some of you or

276
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:14,970
be like oh but wouldn't every man like

277
00:11:13,049 --> 00:11:16,769
their woman's nipples pierced no my

278
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:20,700
husband is very conservative about your

279
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:22,470
Bible so I didn't tell him he knew I was

280
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,899
hanging out with Lindsay he knew what

281
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,850
was going on but I did not tell him and

282
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:29,309
I thought if I tell him immediately

283
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,980
he'll say take him out so I waited a few

284
00:11:29,309 --> 00:11:32,489
days and he knows how bad a piercing

285
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,519
hurts

286
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:37,709
so this is how I told him he was sitting

287
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,789
in his chair and I had fun band-aids

288
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:46,679
didn't I travelling stoner okay so I put

289
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:50,759
on I had little round sad face emoji and

290
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:52,859
AZ's and was kinda graphic but the round

291
00:11:50,759 --> 00:11:55,379
part fits over a woman's areola

292
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,000
perfectly and so he is sitting in his

293
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:00,600
chair and I said I have something to

294
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,159
tell you and he said what oh my god I

295
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,990
know you're not gonna like it and he was

296
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:08,969
like what did you do now can I lifted my

297
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,509
shirt and there was them two sad faces

298
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:14,790
looking at him and he said you are not

299
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:16,620
25 years old like those kids you're

300
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:18,838
hanging out with that I said but it was

301
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,560
to raise breast cancer awareness he said

302
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,250
I don't want to hear your

303
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:27,569
rationalization no I don't like it but

304
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:28,708
yeah that's what kind of cute it's a

305
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:30,209
win-win for everybody

306
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:37,919
Lindsay wouldn't let me give her a hug

307
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:39,149
for like a week and a half the couch for

no I don't what have I really got you

326
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:29,759
know secrets are bad that means

327
00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:31,169
something dirtier or bad and I don't

328
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:33,088
think anything I've done in my life is

329
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:34,528
really dirty or bad

330
00:13:33,089 --> 00:13:36,600
everything's been a learning experience

331
00:13:34,528 --> 00:13:38,610
and I'll share it with you and hopefully

332
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,800
you'll learn if I did I was young and

333
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:43,139
dumb once I did some stupid things that

334
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:46,139
young and young people do dumb not dumb

335
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:47,639
and I'll share that with you hopefully

336
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:49,439
you'll learn from the things I say

337
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,159
because they do have a lot of experience

338
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,650
behind me I'll try to learn you know

339
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:57,750
exactly what I do i do I completely do

340
00:13:55,649 --> 00:13:59,399
yeah I find well being a podcaster and I

341
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,169
also used to put myself on periscope a

342
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,088
lot I don't seem to be I don't like

343
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:04,708
sitting down as much I like to be on my

344
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:06,390
feet doing [ __ ] periscope makes me feel

345
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:09,088
like I get anxious for some reason after

346
00:14:06,389 --> 00:14:11,338
work look how much you're dabbing right

347
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:12,810
right I look up at his building 20 to 30

348
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:14,430
minutes and I'm like oh should I only

349
00:14:12,809 --> 00:14:17,309
meant to spend five minutes here

350
00:14:14,429 --> 00:14:19,469
time does get away quickly wise but

351
00:14:17,309 --> 00:14:21,838
putting that much of myself out I'm

352
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,519
accountable for what I say I can't fit

353
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,230
at all because however many listeners

354
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,720
were listening listened and it's on

355
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:29,009
record and the pod every episode is

356
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:30,509
available like I've said before I'm

357
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:33,870
gonna start putting on old episodes even

358
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:36,000
have you learned that the power of your

359
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,889
words you really sometimes have to stop

360
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,990
and think I because people take things

361
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:44,879
literally I'm really lucky that I had a

362
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,470
starter podcast I had another friend

363
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,208
that had kind of a comedy slash

364
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:49,500
community based podcast shout out to

365
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:51,269
wait really you guys check out wait

366
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,559
really he's a comedian we had a podcast

367
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:55,049
together

368
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,568
and I kind of got to be his co-host so I

369
00:14:55,049 --> 00:15:00,088
got to say a couple of dumb things on

370
00:14:57,568 --> 00:15:02,759
episodes and realize oh I can't say that

371
00:15:00,089 --> 00:15:03,990
kind of dumb [ __ ] like it you have to

372
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,249
figure it out but that's how I learned

373
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:06,299
it was by it [ __ ] it up that's why I

374
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:07,409
was laughing when I said I'll try to

375
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:10,620
learn from you but I mean the way I

376
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:12,149
learned I have to fall in crash that

377
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,799
sucked you know I'll try to learn from

378
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,749
that one I've learned I'm very

379
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,269
accountable for the things I say because

380
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,740
so many people do watch me we have to be

381
00:15:18,269 --> 00:15:21,629
and you said something on your social

382
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:25,079
media this morning about when you become

383
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:26,789
as known as you are you will you are you

384
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:27,870
way more than myself but everybody at

385
00:15:26,789 --> 00:15:30,208
this table has a little bit of notice

386
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:32,519
but you've got times we've got when you

387
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:34,828
get to your level of insta celebrity or

388
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:37,318
insulted instafamous it's slightly

389
00:15:34,828 --> 00:15:39,599
instafamous you've got to pay attention

390
00:15:37,318 --> 00:15:41,429
to what you say and who you talk to and

391
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:45,540
what you share and why did you get

392
00:15:41,429 --> 00:15:47,058
caught up in yes yes it's so much easier

393
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:50,219
to get caught up in [ __ ] when you've got

394
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:52,198
250,000 people in your hair oh just in

395
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,089
our cannabis community alone just in

396
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:55,909
this small community absolutely I catch

397
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,110
myself in it they catch myself

398
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:59,429
everybody's choosing sides all the time

399
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:00,778
in this industry and it seems like we're

400
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:03,888
all just a bunch of potheads having fun

401
00:16:00,778 --> 00:16:03,889
but that's how it should seem

402
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:10,588
backstabbing and I don't have time for

403
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:12,269
pettiness no no we're getting too old

404
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,639
these kids are too old for that [ __ ] too

405
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:17,039
already and I think I think all these

406
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,019
young people will learn don't get just

407
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,240

408

414
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:36,389
personal vendetta because some girl you

415
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,730

416
00:16:36,389 --> 00:16:41,879

to your [ __ ] I'm always a bold

426
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,568
enough and wise enough to make my own

427
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:02,039
decisions about people you told me

428
00:17:00,568 --> 00:17:03,928
earlier that you just trust your gut and

429
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:05,690
you're 90% of the time you're right is

430
00:17:03,928 --> 00:17:07,519
what I think you said I agree with that

431
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:09,230
usually is a pretty good judge of what I

432
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,359
shouldn't shouldn't do with other folks

433

468
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:46,220

469
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,700

the one of the places that will list off

471
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:55,130
you can get a and each place is doing

472
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:58,190
something different so you'll have to

473
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:01,400
ask the specific place what they're

474
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:04,070
going to you know do for it but we will

475

we'll have a flier and everything for it

476
00:19:04,069 --> 00:19:10,069

477
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:13,069
place that we have so we have seventeen

478
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:15,879
places right now confirmed and we have

479
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:19,289
three spots open four places

480
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,420

481
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:23,759
we are going to be the ones that will be

482
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:27,029
going by the dispensaries picking stuff

483
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:30,420
up I have a warehouse to store things in

484
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:32,759
until we distribute them and I think we

485
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,430
picked a good organization you know we

486
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:37,319
we wanted we wanted to somehow keep it

487
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,970
in the cannabis community but this year

488
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:39,720
on such short notice that's just not

489
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,019
going to happen

490
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,480
so what we have decided to do is I got

491
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,400
into contact with the Marian house and

492
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,670
the Marian house is down on Bijou and

493
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:52,620
they feed and they clothe a lot of our

494
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:56,279
homeless community and to me that's a

495
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:59,369
lot of veterans it's also a lot of young

496
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:01,889
people moving here because of cannabis

497
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:05,429
um you see a lot of young people down

498
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:07,830
there yes so I reached out to them they

499
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:10,500
will be happy to take anything we have

500
00:20:07,829 --> 00:20:12,210
and then there's second organization

501
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:15,089
that under the Marian house is called

502
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:17,250
the Family Resource Center and they deal

503
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:19,230
with families that are totally displaced

504
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:22,289
homeless families that they're getting

505
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:23,789
set up in apartments and stuff and these

506
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,589
are why we're saying we'll take toys

507
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:29,309
because there's children involved in

508
00:20:25,589 --> 00:20:31,349
most of these cases and so that's why we

509
00:20:29,309 --> 00:20:34,109
decided you know so many people think oh

510
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:36,449
people that smoke cannabis they're bad

511
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:38,669
they don't do anything well guess what

512
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:41,400
you're wrong we love giving back to our

513
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:42,779
community yes and we want to start small

514
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:44,430
this year we just want to do it in

515
00:20:42,779 --> 00:20:46,170
Colorado Springs but we're hoping to

516
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,610
have a really big turnout this year and

517
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:50,250
be able to make it into something even

518
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:52,109
bigger for next year whether that means

519
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,690
we stay in the springs and just make it

520
00:20:52,109 --> 00:20:58,079
bigger next year or we you know try to

521
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,850
do something even bigger but we're

522
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,319
really excited about this and the

523
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:02,579
different plate do you want to list off

524
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:04,200
the different places that we have I'm

525
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:05,909
just gonna throw one more thing in there

526
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,860
now we at first we were just going to do

527
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:09,690
we we had talked about money and stuff

528
00:21:07,859 --> 00:21:12,659
when we decided no but what we are going

529
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:14,400
to do all the different places that the

530
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:17,009
20 places we're going to put a gallon

531
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,259
mason jar there and you can drop off

532
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:22,349
gift certificates because like I say the

533
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,359
Family Resource Center say we get enough

534
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:26,939
a meal together we get everything

535
00:21:24,359 --> 00:21:28,679
further and this is for Christmas we get

536
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,600
their Christmas meal together what if

537
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,640
they don't have a roasting pan guess

538
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:35,279
what the Family Resource Center can say

539
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,340
here take this gift certificate go get

540
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:39,960
what else you need four or I think the

541
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:43,859
other thing we might want to include is

542
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:47,279
diapers yeah I mean diapers are really

543
00:21:43,859 --> 00:21:49,349
really expensive yeah so I think we

544
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:52,859
could expand you know the toy yeah

545
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:57,259
diaper and food yeah absences looking at

546
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:59,669
me like god we didn't discuss this no I

547
00:21:57,259 --> 00:22:02,809
as long as we're doing good things right

548
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:05,820

549
00:22:02,809 --> 00:22:08,069

something that you can actually open and

556
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,050
consume instead of like some green beans

557

558

gift card yep if we had more time we

569
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:49,950
could probably solicit grocery stores

570
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:52,080

571

I say not wrap well let the Family

576
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,910
Resource Center do that I think we'll do

577
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:07,410
this and then turn it over if you want

578
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:09,000
to donate wrapping paper so that they

579
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,740
can be wrapped to go for that but don't

580
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,910

we could make this and do like a little

601
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:22,269

603
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:28,029

00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,290
be in Colorado Springs yes you do you do

622
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:14,080

collect canned foods a high-traffic area

624

625
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:19,089
the cannabis community and be proud of

626
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:20,590
the cannabis community if you've got any

627
00:25:19,089 --> 00:25:22,329
fear or hatred for the candidate or

628

635
00:25:38,049 --> 00:25:42,399
because you get you get free publicity

636
00:25:39,849 --> 00:25:43,419
on my social media that's one of the

637
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,790
things I was gonna say you have to be

638
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:48,190
okay with granny publicizing your area

639
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:49,869
your your facility or store wherever it

640
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,900
is if it's a head shop if it's a gross

641
00:25:49,869 --> 00:25:54,639
store if it's a dispensary if it's a

642
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,930
glass shop I think I said head shot but

643
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,080
I'm high as [ __ ] so I might not have

644
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:59,830
anything anywhere the cannabis consumers

645
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:01,960
or

646
00:25:59,829 --> 00:26:05,679
counterculture folk Millennials may roam

723
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,869
first time we met at the first podcast

724
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,569

725
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:26,519
yeah and you said well I very rarely

726
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:28,889
caught because you own your lungs you

727
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,660
can tell them what to do so when I feel

728
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,460
that tickle and you all know what I mean

729
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,980
when I say it feel that tickle huh I

730
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,860
hear that your voice in my head and I

731
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,860
almost meditate with my eyes open but I

732
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,779
am NOT going to cough yep yeah

733
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:44,399
all right I've never talked about this

734
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:46,079
on a podcast I've only told like four

735
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,000
people in my whole life this granny was

736
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,500
one of them I take giant dad you guys

737
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,480
when you feel like you're gonna cough

738
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,829
when you feel that thing that goes like

739
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,710
you you blow up the dab you sort of go

740
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:57,210
do you feel that [ __ ] when you're when

741
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,170
you're walking at the mall if you get a

742
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,559
little cramping or like you know this

743
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:02,039
[ __ ] fall down something you do I'm

744
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:04,019
sorry

745
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:10,409
she's got a condition most people don't

746
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:11,579
just fall down but most normal folk if

747
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,930
you get a cramp you know just [ __ ]

748
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:14,279
fall down and spaz out in the middle of

749
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:15,360
the mall in my opinion that's what my

750
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:16,920
lungs are doing I'm coughing they're

751
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,379
throwing a fit like a [ __ ] mad child

752
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,690
to cramp ah I feel that cough come in

753
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,910
and I either inhale or exhale as hard as

754
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,500
I can distract them like when your dogs

755
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:26,640
trying to run away to cat you just pull

756
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,049
the leash and put a treat in front of it

757
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,240
it forgets about the cat it looks at the

758
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:32,930
tree goes on tree I liked it I just

759
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,740
breathe in real hard my lungs like air

760
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,509
instead of trying to cough I don't know

761
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,859
if that's good for me or bad for me but

762
00:30:36,509 --> 00:30:39,450
it works cuz it's got to be better than

763
00:30:37,859 --> 00:30:41,959
to coughing so hardened blowing out my

764
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:49,620
face and get red eyed and I've cops all

765
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:51,059
blown up [ __ ] blood vessels little

766
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:56,849

771

make quality cannabis concentrates with

773
00:31:11,099 --> 00:31:15,269
propane if you do it properly but it

774
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:16,919
comes out like live resin it comes out

775

00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,970
yes there are several locations

841
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:05,058
okay well wherever they are we're gonna

842
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:10,039
have boxes in all their locations

843
00:34:05,058 --> 00:34:13,769

845
00:34:13,769 --> 00:34:19,980
spots get in touch with me DM me on

846
00:34:17,608 --> 00:34:21,779
Instagram dabbing underscore granny I

847
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,179
think those spots will fill up quickly

848
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,710
though and not just this spot we'll

849
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,628
probably have those filled this comes

850
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,610
out and like seven or ten days from now

851
00:34:27,628 --> 00:34:29,989
so these seven

852
00:34:28,610 --> 00:34:32,390
and is it probably be filled up

853
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:34,069
hopefully with much faith what we need

854
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:36,769
now is people to go to these locations

855
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:38,210
with a non-perishable canned good that

856
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:39,860

882
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,730

886
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,579
you might have been one of the people

887
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:04,309
that hopefully was benefiting from our

888
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:05,750
little food drive most people

889
00:36:04,309 --> 00:36:08,210
unfortunately are right at that line

890
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:10,190
where they don't need the help but they

891
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,960
can't afford to give any help I'm saying

892
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,119
it's like we're both yeah the folks are

893
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,010
right now making crucial decisions do I

894
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,929
need this or do we want to eat at the

895
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:21,440
end of the week my ass we get high this

896
00:36:17,929 --> 00:36:26,089
week I can walk to work not get gas

897
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:29,240
let's figure this out just give me a

898
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:32,650
sinking feeling recreational cannabis oh

899
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:34,369
I'm gonna do when you said Medicaid or

900
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,440
wipe your butt

901
00:36:34,369 --> 00:36:38,869
I'm afraid that's what Californians are

902
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,210
facing yeah I tried to stay out of a lot

903
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:44,449
of California yeah

904
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,650
I yeah I I see both sides of it and I

905
00:36:44,449 --> 00:36:47,239
try to stay that's California so

906
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:49,340
Colorado we did all the things right we

907
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:51,289
did it right here in my usual we thought

908
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:53,329
that we had lost we thought that we had

909
00:36:51,289 --> 00:36:55,309
lost an initiative here in Pueblo and

910
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:56,690
they are recounting and still counting

911
00:36:55,309 --> 00:36:59,110
and it turns out that we may have

912
00:36:56,690 --> 00:37:01,369
actually won three of the four major

913
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:03,289
cannabis initiatives we may actually get

914
00:37:01,369 --> 00:37:04,639
to open recreational cannabis facilities

915
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:06,860
within the city limits as well though

916
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,480

about them damn suppositories even I was

1020
00:41:32,579 --> 00:41:36,840
kind of skeptical but I have a pretty

1021
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:38,340
sick husband so I thought okay this is

1022
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,579
really gonna help waning them off the

1023
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:43,800
morphine and all that with this pain

1024
00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:46,469
okay what I have discovered is most most

1025
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,960
of you men are homophobic you met you

1026
00:41:46,469 --> 00:41:50,849
mentioned suppositories and I see you

1027
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,150
visibly squeezing your butt cheeks

1028
00:41:50,849 --> 00:42:00,259
together she's right am i it's true

1029
00:41:54,150 --> 00:42:03,240
exact women on the other hand you know

1030
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:07,200
we spit 10-pound babies out our vaginas

1031
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:20,429
so what's a suppository let's use no not

1032
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:21,839
me I took these home for my husband and

1033
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:25,129
I was like what I brought you their

1034
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:28,710
fifty percent THC fifty percent come

1035
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:33,090
DVDs thank you had a brain fart and he

1036
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:39,030
said you stick that up your ass like no

1037
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:42,269
problem and I did it is at least twelve

1038
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:44,550
hours of euphoria is the best way to put

1039
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:48,050
it you can function you can drive you're

1040
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:50,250
not intoxicated but you're euphoric I

1041
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:53,550
used one the night we had our girls

1042
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:55,409
taken care of and it ease the pain okay

1043
00:42:53,550 --> 00:42:57,780
so my thought was alright now these

1044
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:58,549
things are really wonderful if you are

1045
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:01,810
truly in my

1046
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:04,160
the patient for real if you're

1047
00:43:01,809 --> 00:43:08,269
especially cancer patient if you're

1048
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,750
vomiting right skip that whole part of

1049
00:43:08,269 --> 00:43:11,329
the body

1050
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:13,550
exactly and you and I know that the

1051
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:15,170
divine creator did not make our lungs to

1052
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,970
ingest irritants some of us like to

1053
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:19,760
smoke we know it's really not the best

1054
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:22,789
way to medicate no way offends our butts

1055
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,190
I like to smoke though if you truly need

1056
00:43:22,789 --> 00:43:28,849
to medicate there are so many membranes

1057
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:31,369
in your anus using these suppositories

1058
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:33,139
is a wonderful way to medicate cannabis

1059
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:35,599
isn't the first medicine they've used as

1060
00:43:33,139 --> 00:43:37,309
a suppository no this is just the newest

1061
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,989
and it's just on our realm so now it's

1062
00:43:37,309 --> 00:43:40,549
what we're talking about now it's been

1063
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:42,199
used for hah I'm gonna say hundreds of

1064
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:43,940
years I'm not certain but I'm sure

1065
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:47,899
people have been boof and things for way

1066
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:50,240
longer the best way to medicate so the

1067
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,980
next week we'll skip okay so I I had no

1068
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,309
problem with it I stick one up my butt I

1069
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:57,050
stuck a couple of them up my butt by now

1070
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:58,849
my husband had to have a colonoscopy the

1071
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,890
next week and he came home he's a grumpy

1072
00:43:58,849 --> 00:44:02,420
after his colonoscopies and pain is

1073
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,920
grouchy and I was like your butt holes

1074
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,710
already stretched out try one of them

1075
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:09,280
suppositories oh my god if he I'm so

1076
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:11,990
glad he does not listen to this podcast

1077
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,140
he tried one and he was like you're

1078
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:17,809
right my lower back pain is gone

1079
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:20,179
I don't feel the nauseousness in my

1080
00:44:17,809 --> 00:44:22,029
belly that I feel when I take a morphine

1081
00:44:20,179 --> 00:44:24,379
for pain

1082
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,910
yeah I'm swimming from that dab I might

1083
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,450
have put a little too much Terps but I'm

1084
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:28,449
not complaining

1085
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:38,599
just put a little wine across the dab

1086
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,720
and uh it made my brain swim around in

1087
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:44,860
my head okay like it should I tell the

1088
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:44,859
story about the great and craic

1089
00:44:45,139 --> 00:44:48,239
[Music]

1090
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:53,639
okay okay we're smoking on this stuff

1091
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:56,040
called Green crack which is a pretty

1092
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:59,519
sativa dominant strain when you all

1093
00:44:56,039 --> 00:45:03,630
agree I just took absolutely okay and

1094
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:05,670
I'm not a real sativa but listen I'm

1095
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:08,070
getting there looks like Oh okay

1096
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,139
wouldn't you buy this um distilled hash

1097
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:12,660
it solvent less it comes in a little

1098
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:15,900
syringe it's not very big it's glass

1099
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:17,819
it's glass it has a very small part

1100
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,619
where you the medicine actually comes

1101
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:26,420
out of the syringe like where a needle

1102
00:45:19,619 --> 00:45:26,420
would be I guess there's no no we don't

1103
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:31,759
maybe if you have children you've used

1104
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:36,329
them for pulling up amoxicillin or

1105
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,730
antibiotic to get to your baby it'd be

1106
00:45:36,329 --> 00:45:40,170
good to feed a baby bird it would be yes

1107
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:41,670
it's probably a really good description

1108
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:43,230
to put the idea in his head it'd be

1109
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:45,559
perfect to feed a baby bird if you had

1110
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:48,119
rodents or mice or something like that

1111
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:51,570
okay so I really do like these

1112
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:53,309
suppositories for medicating and I'm not

1113
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:56,640
gonna say where but about tender said

1114
00:45:53,309 --> 00:46:00,599
well have you tried that hash and I was

1115
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:16,469
like no suitably you should try that

1116
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:18,269
Green crack Emily okay she squirted so

1117
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:20,339
when I went back to that bug tender I

1118
00:46:18,269 --> 00:46:23,610
was like my god I was bouncing off the

1119
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:25,559
walls like I had consumed huge amounts

1120
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:27,840
of caffeine and lots of other things and

1121
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:39,659
he said granny you didn't do the whole

1122
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:41,430
gram did you don't try that that's like

1123
00:46:39,659 --> 00:46:42,719
when I did all those edibles after the

1124
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:44,159
secret session sure you don't have to

1125
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:46,289
discourage too many people sticking too

1126
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:50,369
much hash in their ass on the show but

1127
00:46:46,289 --> 00:46:52,800
if they were to try it how much of I

1128
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:59,088
really wouldn't suggest doing that no no

1129
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:02,028
okay however

1130
00:46:59,088 --> 00:47:03,739
I do them record okay I've given some do

1131
00:47:02,028 --> 00:47:05,599
the traveling stoner we can ask her what

1132
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:11,239
her effect was I watched her put her

1133
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:13,130
head down in blushes why I believe we're

1134
00:47:11,239 --> 00:47:15,769
talking about true medication the first

1135
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:20,088
time I ever did one um I actually did

1136
00:47:15,768 --> 00:47:22,909
the foria once so I had gotten the for a

1137
00:47:20,088 --> 00:47:23,929
one's a sample that's so long ago and I

1138
00:47:22,909 --> 00:47:26,179
never used them

1139
00:47:23,929 --> 00:47:28,699
and then once Gayle started doing them

1140
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:31,818
was talking about them I was supposed to

1141
00:47:28,699 --> 00:47:36,949
go to Denver and meet up with one of our

1142
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:38,420
friends for her birthday and I was in a

1143
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:40,368
lot of pain that morning and I was like

1144
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:42,440
[ __ ] I really need to go to Denver like

1145
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:45,140
you know we have plans and I really

1146
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:47,900
can't let this like [ __ ] up our plant

1147
00:47:45,139 --> 00:47:49,400
you know plans for her birthday so I

1148
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:50,778
said to Christ I'm like I don't know

1149
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,460
what to do he's like you need to put one

1150
00:47:50,778 --> 00:47:54,920
of those suppositories and then just try

1151
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,478
it the first time I ever took one the

1152
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:59,269
forty ones are a lot stronger they're

1153
00:47:56,478 --> 00:48:01,608
like the 50/50 ones so the first time I

1154
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:03,409
ever took it I was like Gumby and I

1155
00:48:01,608 --> 00:48:06,528
think I think because I was in a lot of

1156
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:09,199
pain like I just I'm like immediately

1157
00:48:06,528 --> 00:48:12,829
was out of pain I don't know it was

1158
00:48:09,199 --> 00:48:14,449
weird but yeah like you can ask Chris I

1159
00:48:12,829 --> 00:48:18,700
was like I couldn't really move my lower

1160
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:20,439
half and she's like I don't feel great

1161
00:48:18,699 --> 00:48:25,098
[Music]

1162
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:30,259
pain medication how long does it take to

1163
00:48:25,099 --> 00:48:32,630
kick in Oh granny gave me some drops and

1164
00:48:30,259 --> 00:48:35,298
oral sublingual drops today and I felt

1165
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:36,829
those within like 10 minutes and they're

1166
00:48:35,298 --> 00:48:39,498
pretty good for a tincture cuz a lot of

1167
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:41,989
tinctures they're very ashy medicine it

1168
00:48:39,498 --> 00:48:45,048
was very it was a very clean almost like

1169

a green tea but very light diluted green

1170
00:48:45,048 --> 00:48:48,380
tea flavor I actually enjoyed it and

1171
00:48:46,728 --> 00:48:53,659
then Lindsay was kind enough to throw me

1172

edible bag band was needed to clean out

1178
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:10,970
I had to kind of wash the edible system

1179
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,880

1180

1234
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:48,440
to her it was white it wasn't red it was

1235
00:51:46,429 --> 00:51:50,568
white I was like let it cool and he goes

1236
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,670
no just hit it and I was like no let it

1237
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:54,048
cool and so I like hesitated like as

1238
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:56,150
long as I could but then I just went in

1239
00:51:54,048 --> 00:51:57,349
cuz he was pushing it on there and I

1240
00:51:56,150 --> 00:51:58,608
pulled the whole thing then I blew it

1241
00:51:57,349 --> 00:51:59,809
out and he's like damn this guy's a

1242
00:51:58,608 --> 00:52:02,210
champ and it was like can you do a

1243
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:04,009
bigger dad than him and people like yes

1244
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,999
they would come up on stage and we would

1245
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:07,099
dab together

1246
00:52:04,998 --> 00:52:08,868
you kept dabbing oh yeah yeah they

1247
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:11,539
couldn't finish their dabs and I would

1248
00:52:08,869 --> 00:52:13,309
grab the rig from them and then I would

1249
00:52:11,539 --> 00:52:14,630
finish their dad for them and set the

1250
00:52:13,309 --> 00:52:17,390
rig down like now what's up

1251
00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:19,309

1324
00:55:48,530 --> 00:55:55,040

1325

1328
00:56:03,349 --> 00:56:11,089
Victoria's Secret's it was but it's not

1329
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:13,279
that's when I told tater that he is I

1330
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:14,710
said I've never been in the Victoria's

1331
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,120
Secret but you know what he said

Victoria's Secrets truthfully I think

1337
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,110
they're very expensive it is expensive

1338
00:56:30,739 --> 00:56:37,059
and naked always worked for me so why do

1339
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:37,059

00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,619
so that you can see it you guys

1364
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,329
periscope and Facebook live because she

1365

does a lot of stuff there she smokes

1366
00:57:56,329 --> 00:58:01,639
down there's a new app that I've been on

1367
00:57:59,059 --> 00:58:03,409
talked with and and this is kind of

1368
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:06,139
because it's just people in the cannabis

1369
00:58:03,409 --> 00:58:07,818
community and what the end goal of this

1370
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:10,250
app is they want to be able to have

1371
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:12,920
multicam users so it wouldn't just be

1372
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:14,778
