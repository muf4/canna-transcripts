and yours I have a massive pet peeve

48
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:00,719
that I think uh serious Growers know all

49
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,919
too well yes I have pre screen this pet

50
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:05,839
peeve and I completely agree with you

51
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,038
the pet peeve says one of my biggest pet

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,239
peeves is Growers who cannot keep track

53
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,598
of their clones and they mislabel their

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
clones with the wrong name or they just

55
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:17,679
make up new names because they can't

56
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,080
remember their plants lineage at all oh

57
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,920
man that is aggravating this person says

58
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,760
it drives me nuts and absolutely mad

59
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:27,439
when something is supposed to be sherbet

60
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:29,239
or cake and it smells like burnt rubber

61
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:30,359
anyway hope all is well in your world

62
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,319

00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,239

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,439

83
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:13,000
people are selling clones right now like

84
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,359

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,680

93
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,640
to be pissed so if you do give somebody

94
00:03:32,598 --> 00:03:36,679
sell somebody a clone please make sure

95
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:38,598
that that thing is what it is labeled

96
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,080
because people get very excited we grow

97
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:42,878
it we spend a lot of time and then 15

98
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,280
weeks later we find out that you lied to

99
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:46,518
us and gave us something and took money

100
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,878
for it and now we feel slighted we don't

101
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,438
like you anymore we think you're a dick

102
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,759
uh 20 something years ago somebody sold

103
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,519
me a clone and I paid a lot of money for

104
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:57,719
it and it was not what it was supposed

105
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,239
to be and to this day I don't [ __ ] with

106
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:02,239
that guy because he took a lot of money

107
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,280
from me blatantly lied to me uh saw how

108
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
excited I was offered me more cuts of

109
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,759
the same thing for more money and it

110
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,599
none of those cuts were what they were

111
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,639
supposed to be so not going to say his

112
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,560
name not going to say who he is I don't

113
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:16,120
[ __ ] with that guy anymore from a a

114
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,879
small clone transaction 20 years ago

115
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,879
that's how important it was to me so

116
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,319
that's a great pet peeve uh label your

117
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:23,600
[ __ ] especially if you're going to give

118
00:04:21,319 --> 00:04:25,319
it out share it uh distribute it in any

119
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,160
way make sure that [ __ ] is properly

120
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:28,478
labeled it does matter a lot of people

121
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,160
like it shouldn't matter that much it

122
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:32,399
does uh it's like if you you went to a

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,720
restaurant and you were vegan and you

124
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:35,879
ordered a vegan meal and they brought

125
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:37,240
you a steak you'd be pissed just like if

126
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,918
you paid money for a clone that was

127
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,840
labeled diesel they brought you

128
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:42,639
strawberries you would be pissed just

129
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:44,719
like you should be I like to consider

130
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,600
myself sort of a cannabis historian I've

131
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,080
been around a long time in this industry

132
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,000
in this business and this community uh I

133
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:52,519
watched it go from the black market or

134
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,439
the free market whatever you want to

135
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:56,319
call it uh it evolved into the medical

136
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:58,839
marijuana market now we've got the full

137
00:04:56,319 --> 00:05:00,439
recreational Market here I saw a lot of

138
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,879
Brands develop up here I saw a lot of

139
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:04,038
Brands come and go I saw a lot of

140

products happen uh since I was there in

142
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,600
that whole thing as it was happening I

143
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:12,478
kind of took it as part of my

144
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,919
responsibility to become the historian

145
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,399
and make sure that all of that [ __ ] is

146
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,240
proper and if I want the stories and the

147
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,638
history to be proper I need the genetics

good to know that I'm helping somebody

200
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:13,519
out it goes on it says anyway I recently

201
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:16,360
came into contact with my parents old

202
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,519
seed stash what a gift you just found my

203
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,759
friend it says so these are seeds from

204
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:25,439
the 80s is there any chance these seeds

205
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:28,400
are viable or are they way too old uh my

206
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,879
dude Cool J mans you have found a great

207
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,318
uh a great stash there a great

208
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,879
motherload there um there's only one

209
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,680
good way to find out if those seeds are

210
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,240
still any good and that is to germinate

211
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,759
them but before you germinate them have

212
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,720
a grow space ready I don't know if

213
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,360
you've already got a grow environment a

214
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:46,039
grow room built in your house a grow

215
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,479
tent somewhere but before you germinate

216
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,560
these seeds uh have a grow room setup

217
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,959
just in case they do work what if you

218
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,800
germinate them and they sprout and they

219
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:55,439
look super healthy you're going to want

220
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,840
to get them into some dirt into some

221
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,399
pots under some lights get them growing

222
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,878
so uh my advice my first advice is don't

223
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,120
even [ __ ] with them until you've got a

224
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,158
grow environment a grow room a grow

225
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,120
space ready to dedicate to some of these

226
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:09,759
seeds uh doesn't have to be a lot of

227
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,478
room but if you're going to sprout them

228
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,879
grow them make sure it's worth it then

229
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,399
the other piece of advice I've got is uh

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,479
germinate a bunch of them see what

231
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,959
happens if they germinate like I said

232
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,359
get them going get them growing treat

233
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:23,799
them just like any other plant that you

234
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
found uh take clones keep Mother plants

235
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,240
do whatever you can do to preserve it

236
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,960
just in case you find a winner grow that

237
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,280
[ __ ] out sample it smoke it choose the

238
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,799
best one you may have uh you may have

239
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,838
something [ __ ] amazing in there you

240
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,120
also may have a bunch of dud seeds just

241
00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,719
keep that in mind but you may have some

242
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,440
real gold in there so my first step uh

243
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,240
set up a grow space have a grow room

244
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,640
ready to go step number two attempt to

245
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,039
germinate some of these seeds uh the

246
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,720
only thing I can recommend to really

247
00:08:48,039 --> 00:08:52,360
help you out is if they're real thick uh

248
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,600
shelled seeds maybe uh take some light

249
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,080
sandpaper and kind of rough up those

250
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,159
shells just a little bit to make the

251
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,759
water easier to penetrate that shell

252
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,199
make it easier to get that shell open

253
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,200
for when the water hits it it can open

254
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,920
and grow a little bit better also the

255
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,278
other thing I would recommend there is a

256
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,439
product called herb it is spelled urb

257
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,759
herb uh that product will be very

258
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:15,399
beneficial in helping you uh germinate

259
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:18,240
those seeds before warned it is not

260
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:20,039
cheap that is a costly product and I say

261
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,440
follow the instructions on the bottle

262
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:23,599
and use that to help assist in the

263
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,000
germination of your seeds but if you've

264
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,399
got a bunch of them if you've got like

265
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,519
you've got did you say what you found

266
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,679
them in no your parents old seed stash

267
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,440
um they're probably in one of those

268
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:34,359
little black film canisters that's what

269
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,480
I'm assuming that's what all parents

270
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,560
from the 80s and 90s had their seeds in

271
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,560
but um pour a few out pour out 10 20%

272
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:43,078
germinate them see what happens uh if

273
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,119
they don't germinate naturally the way

274
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:46,439
you do it uh then get some of the herb

275
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,639
product and try that way and if they

276
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,200
don't germinate that way they're

277
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:52,159
probably not going to but really have a

278
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,480
room set up have a place for them to go

279
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,799
before you even germinate them because

280
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
what if they they pop what if they

281
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:59,159
sprout you're going to want to grow them

282
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
and if you don't have space uh that's

283
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:02,078
kind kind of you just wasted a bunch of

284
00:10:00,799 --> 00:10:03,359
seeds that I could have ran that could

285
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:05,559
have been hot fire we could have found

286
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,959
the next chem dog we could have been

287
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:08,879
slinging

288
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,159
packs all right oh excuse me for the

289
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:11,439

00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,799
I know I say the website so many times

326
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,799
uh trying to get it programmed in your

327
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:25,078
head is it programmed are you programmed

328
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,679
yet have you assimilated what did I

329
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,319
smoke it's [ __ ] working all right

330
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:31,000
where are we this question came from

331
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,480
Megatron Megatron had a real quick real

332
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,639
short question this short one two 3 4

333
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,399
five six-word question could be a

334
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,600
complete podcast I can answer this with

335
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,200
a complete podcast I'll try to keep this

336
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:44,600
short and sweet so that you understand

337
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,800
what I'm saying but Megatron had a

338
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,800
really good question it says how do you

339
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,519
find stable genetics that is a very good

340
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:53,519
question I think the first thing we

341
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,039
should focus on is the word stable what

342
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,919
do you mean by stable uh in the Cannabis

343
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,879
realm the word stable is kind of thrown

344
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,919
around misused a lot of people think

345
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,559
that stability has something to you to

346
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,399
do with the with the interex trait uh

347
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:09,119
yeah maybe those plants aren't sexually

348
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,839
stable but most of the time when we talk

349
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,839
about stability and agriculture we are

350
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,040
mostly referring to uniformity amongst

351
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,160
progyny amongst phenotypes in a

352
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,319
population what that means in layman's

353
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:24,078
terms is if I grow a 100 plants I want

354
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,959
to see one phenotype amongst those 100

355
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,879
plants that is stability if I grow out a

356
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:32,359
100 seeds all 100 should look just like

357
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:34,159
each other that means that that line is

358
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,199
stable that's what we talk about in

359
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,639
horiculture and agriculture when we mean

360
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:40,439
stability is if we run a population of

361
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,278
seeds how many phenotypes are you going

362
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,000
to get if you're going to get four six

363
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:46,838
12 different phenotypes that is not

364
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,278
considered stable it may be sexually

365
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:51,519
stable it may not be interex but in

366
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:54,360
terms of stability in the Horticultural

367
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:58,159
realm that is not what we refer to so in

368
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,959
this case I'm going to focus on uh the

369
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:03,240
phenotypical ility of a plant let's talk

370
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,518
briefly about sexual stability uh

371
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,159
because I'm sure that that's what a lot

372
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:07,839
of people are thinking of when the word

373
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,120
stable comes up in cultivation in

374
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,880
cannabis sexual stability how do we get

375
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,600
to that uh buy seeds from a reputable

376
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,000
breeder most of those seeds should not

377
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,480
be intersect should not be uh sexually

378
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,399
challenged most of those should be

379
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,680
sexually stable if you want to do it

380
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,639
yourself breed them find a male and a

381
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:27,120
female plant that are both sexually

382
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,600
stable on their own breed them if you

383
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,198
find any interex lines don't or any

384
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,480
intersex plantss in that line don't

385
00:13:31,198 --> 00:13:35,120
breed with those uh find more plants

386
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,199
that don't express intersect traits and

387
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,120
breed more and keep breeding you can go

388
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:41,519
forward in filial Generations you can go

389
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,278
back crosses but breed with plants that

390
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,240
don't express intersect Straits and you

391
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,439
can breed the intersects out you can

392
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,399
create sexually stable plants that's my

393
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,800
brief sexual stability talk we're not

394
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,159
going to focus on that let's talk about

395
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:55,559
main uniformity that is mainly what I

396
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,759
think this question should be about if

397
00:13:55,559 --> 00:13:59,198
we're talking about stability in

398
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,560
cannabis so how do we find stable

399
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,120
genetics first we're going to Define

400
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:04,479
stability in this case I'm going to talk

401
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,799
about uniformity amongst the phenotypes

402
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,759
like I said before we're going to plant

403
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:10,758
50 seeds uh where I said 100 seeds

404
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:13,120
before we'll plant a 100 in this case

405
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,720
they're Rags at this point 50 males have

406
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,799
been removed from the population we've

407
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,079
got 50 females that look just like each

408
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,758
other that is uniformity that is

409
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:23,359
stability amongst that population

410
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,959
amongst those progyny there that's what

411
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,839
we're going to start with how do we get

412
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,439
to that point uh like I talked about

413
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:30,880
earlier breed them breed uh fill

414
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,000
Generations you could start with

415
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,240
whatever plants you like I recommend

416
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,278
plants that are vastly different in a

417
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,000
lot of ways so in this case we're going

418
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,000
to talk about arise we're going to use

419
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,159
arise as our example arise was a cross I

420
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,519
made several years ago I have worked the

421
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,600
arise to F3 since then but let's focus a

422
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:50,639
little more on this arise what I think

423
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,240
made arise successful was I used a

424
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,799
daybreaker male and a Golden Goat female

425
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,879
to make that that cross and those plants

426
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:59,958
are completely vastly different and

427
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:01,799
since I took two plants that had no

428
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:04,119
matching characteristics no traits that

429
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:06,240
were similar when I bred those together

430
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,759
it made a great combination and a rise

431
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,600
was an amazing cross so I recommend

432
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:12,320
finding plants that are vastly different

433
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,800
breed them together create your brand

434
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,278
new cross then here's where we start

435
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,479
working on the stability find the

436
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:22,000
phenotype you like out of that first

437
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,519
cross the F1 find the phenotype that

438
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,958
really gets your attention the male and

439
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,639
the female find that phenotype breed

440
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:29,559
those together now you're going to make

441
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,759
f2s and the f2s you're going to find a

442
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:33,838
lot of different wild phenotypes the f2s

443
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,600
are Pandora's Box you're going to get a

444
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,680
lot of crazy [ __ ] find the phenotype you

445
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,920
really like you've got to really start

446
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,198
thinking about what you you should have

447
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:43,078
already really been thinking about what

448
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,679
you want from this cross now you see

449
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:47,039
what it expresses really think what you

450
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,439
want to narrow down find a phenotype

451
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,879
that has all of the traits you want um

452
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
and we'll talk about another option here

453
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,639
in just a second if I remember I'm going

454
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,119
to write parallel down because that's

455
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,680
another thing to think I spelled it

456
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,120
wrong but it's a note all right so we're

457
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,799
gonna find our f2s um one thing we're

458
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,519
going to do we're going to find a plant

459
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:05,519
that has the traits we want the aroma

460
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,639
the structure the shape the Vigor

461
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,198
hopefully uh resistance to powdery

462
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,000
mildew resistance to bugs find that

463
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:13,758
plant find the male find the female

464
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
breed those together guess what we just

465
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,800
made F3 we're going to repeat that

466
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,318
process finding the perfect phenotype

467
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:23,000
every time if you don't do it right you

468
00:16:21,318 --> 00:16:24,360
will know because when you grow the Next

469
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,679
Generation it's not going to look how

470
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,600
you want don't be afraid to do it over

471
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:31,039
again or go backwards and do a back

472
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,120
cross to the filial generation that has

473
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:36,240
the traits that you're looking for so

474
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,639
what we're going to do basically uh the

475
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,639
easiest way to do this is to uh keep

476
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,959
filial generation breeding this all the

477
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,639
way up to F5 if you do this selection

478
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:48,119
properly it's all about the selection

479
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,799
the male and the female every generation

480
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,919
if you do it properly by the time you

481
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:55,958
get to the F5 definitely the F6 you will

482
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:58,318
have uniform stability amongst the the

483
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,439
phenotypes in that population so if you

484
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:02,679
pop 100 seeds you pull out 50 of the

485
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,919
boys all 50 of those remaining girls

486
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:06,678
will look like you cut clones uh there

487
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,759
are a lot of uh lot of plants that

488
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:09,880
happen that way in the Horticultural

489
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,879
industry a lot of the fruit and

490
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,039
vegetables have been filial generation

491
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,000
or genetically modified to appear that

492
00:17:14,038 --> 00:17:19,160
way but you can make that happen with

493
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,838
your cannabis plants breed them to F5 F6

494
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,279
and you will find uniformity amongst the

495
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,318
population in that population if you

496
00:17:24,279 --> 00:17:28,279
have bred this properly like I said it's

497
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,558
all about the selection breeding is all

498
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:32,960
about selection C uh you could mess this

499
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,200
up very easily and you could also make

500
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,919
this happen perfectly very easily if

501
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,000
you've got a good eye for selection a

502
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,799
good eye for detail and if you're

503
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,558
realistic about what you are looking for

504
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:45,558
um pick a few certain traits and really

505
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,399
narrow those down if you're looking for

506
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:48,720
32 traits to come out of one plant

507
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,480
you're not going to lock that down in

508
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,679
your breeding project uh it's going to

509
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,720
be a mess it's going to take a while now

510
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,759
that's where I'm going to talk about

511
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,919
this other option this is called

512
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,679
parallel breeding we're going to do the

513
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,400
same project just two different

514
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,000
directions now let's just say uh we're

515
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,640
going to focus on Golden Goat to

516
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,599
daybreaker again we're going to make a

517
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,600
rise but we're going to make a rise

518
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:12,558
version a and we're going to make a rise

519
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:15,000
version B now in version a I'm only

520
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,519
going to focus on tric Combs and flavor

521
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
that's all that matters these plants

522
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:20,599
could be ugly they can grow goofy as

523
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,038
long as they taste good and they're

524
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:25,439
fully potent it's all I care about now

525
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,798
in the other project in line B that's

526
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,919
where I need to have the beautiful

527
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:31,200
growth structure uh that's where I need

528
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,200
to have the resistance to pathogens and

529
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,159
resistance to bugs it's really all I'm

530
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,038
looking for and these are just

531
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,120
hypotheticals that I want to breed for

532
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:39,720
in my two different lines so I'm going

533
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,158
to breed both of these lines in

534
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,079
different projects these are totally

535
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,960
different projects different male

536
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:48,519
different female but same seed batches

537
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,640
um I pulled seeds I got an I got a male

538
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:52,558
that really is Frosty I got another male

539
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,200
that's really resistant to bugs two

540
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,158
different breeding projects happening a

541
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,400
female on the other side a female on the

542
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:59,960
other side that match my criteria two

543
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,679
different project so I'm going to breed

544
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:05,159
both of those to F5 or F6 until I've

545
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:07,320
reached the stability that I want then

546
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:10,200
I'm going to breed them together and

547
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:11,798
make my own true F1 that way I can get

548
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,038
whichever if I've got a bunch of traits

549
00:19:11,798 --> 00:19:15,839
I'm looking for I can get that structure

550
00:19:14,038 --> 00:19:17,720
and that resistance and that flavor and

551
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,240
Aroma once I get those both of those

552
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,480
lines to F5 or F6 I can then breed them

553
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,440
together and then I can combine all four

554
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,679
of those traits together in a brand new

555
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,360
F1 because they're both going to be very

556
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,240
dominant traits on both sides of my

557
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:32,319
cross so then when I cross those

558
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,839
together I'll get all the tricomes all

559
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,879
the tpin I'll get all the resistance and

560
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:39,240
all the structure in Vigor breed that

561
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,280
together my new F1 should have a lot of

562
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,440
those traits combined if I've done it

563
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:45,639
properly then you get to play with that

564
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,080
brand new one and keep going in filial

565
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,640
generations with that that is really how

566
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,678
to breed for super stability when you

567
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,640
ask why breeders aren't offering plants

568
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:57,440
that are super stable why a lot of Us

569
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,000
sell f1s f2s uh while we're doing

570
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,960
reversals as ones r1's because it takes

571
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,200
years and years to do these filial

572
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,319
generation projects especially if you

573
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,480
want to run parallel lines and then if

574
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:11,558
you're focused on uh you can kind of

575
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,200
focus on making more seeds or working

576
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:15,240
these lines but it's hard to do both to

577
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,319
put the seeds out for production and

578
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,359
really do what you need to do and focus

579
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:21,319
you get one or the other um I found a

580
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:23,639
really nice line in the middle there

581
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:25,200
I'll do uh two or three seed production

582
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,960
runs and then just a personal run that

583
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,840
is just for me to get data and [ __ ]

584
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,240
around also I've got a few different

585
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:32,798
locations where I'm able to play around

586
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,679
with so that helps me expand but let me

587
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,319
stay focused here if you really want to

588
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:40,000
get dialed in if you really want uh

589
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:44,079
stable seeds uh make them breed them get

590
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,880
to that F5 generation uh breed them um

591
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,918
also you could buy seeds from reliable

592
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,000
breeders I mentioned uh buying seeds

593
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,919
just a moment ago if you want seeds that

594
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,759
have been bred to the F5 generation the

595
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:57,240
only breeder I really know of that is

596
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:58,759
doing that is DJ Short big shout out to

597
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,359
DJ Short for putting those out

598
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:03,319
commercially available I've made arise

599
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,678
f3s but I've not made them available

600
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:06,639
because there are not a lot of them

601
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:08,120
there's not enough of them uh to make it

602
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,520
worth putting out on that sort of a

603
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:13,239
level the f4s and F5s those will hit uh

604
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:15,599
the website but it's those are years

605
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,759
away that's that's a while away uh where

606
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,719
were we now so uh how do you get stable

607
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:23,440
seeds divine define stable we did that

608
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,600
uh breed them to the F5 buy seeds from a

609
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,880
reliable breeder such as DJ Short or uh

610
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,639
if you really want to get involved breed

611
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,240
them do that project yourself so that is

612
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,600
how you find uniform and phenotypically

613
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,880
stable plants if that's what you're

614
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,199
looking for once again we did touch on

615
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:43,159
those sexually stable plants uh I sell

616
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,880
very sexually stable plants if that's

617
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,799
what you're looking for uh and that is

618
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,120
very advantageous to you because you my

619
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,918
friend uh Megatron have got a coupon
