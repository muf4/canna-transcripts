00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,390
flower seeds in your garden I highly

11
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:38,969
recommend seeds here now and you can

find them at www.ctvn.org de Chien punch

13
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,800
on the package the flavor is described

14
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:46,078
as Sitrus berries and frankincense I

15
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:47,788
think we've been over this before I sure

16
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,739
get the citrus I for sure get the

17
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,300
berries not so sure about the

18
00:00:49,738 --> 00:00:53,099
frankincense there's something funky in

19
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,599
the background something must be

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,579
something earthy I'm not sure I would

21
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,198
agree with frankincense either way it is

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,058
a delicious and highly potent

23
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,789
concentrate on the back of the package

24
00:01:00,058 --> 00:01:06,269
the label says this product contains 60

25
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:08,909
7.39 percent THC and non detectable

26
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,158
amounts of CBB I really approve of the

27
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:14,790
cutie berry live batter from our friends

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:16,109

29
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:18,030
episode I'm going to answer an email

30
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:20,640
that asks a question about breeding

31
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,560
before we get there you know I like to

32

52
00:01:58,769 --> 00:02:02,250
patreon if you'd like to learn how to

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,180
support the show you can do so by

54
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:08,180
visiting www.disabilitydenials.com

55
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,369
I think that covers the business part of

56
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,799
the podcast let's jump into the email

57
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,900
portion of the show I was spending most

58
00:02:19,799 --> 00:02:24,269
of my evening packing up seeds for the

59
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,170
Indo Expo I will be at the Indo Expo in

60
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:29,819
Denver on January 25th and 26th the 25th

61
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:32,068
is industry and professionals and

62
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:33,958
business-to-business day but the 26th is

63
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:34,888
open to the general public so I do hope

64
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,870
to see you there

65
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:38,909
do get your tickets before you travel

66
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,539
because it will sell out and come stock

67
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:44,878
up on some fresh I read genetics anyway

68
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:46,468
while I was packing up those seeds I was

69
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,628
thinking about an email that I recently

70
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:50,188
received so I thought it might be a good

71
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:52,620
time to take a break from packing up

72
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:55,078
seeds take way too many dabs and then

73
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,009
knock out a podcast so let's jump into

74
00:02:55,079 --> 00:03:01,319
the email that inspired today's podcast

75
00:02:58,009 --> 00:03:03,239
episode this email starts off with a

76
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:05,039
question about LED lighting but then it

77
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:07,408
does work into a breeding question I'm

78
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,628
going to go quickly over the lighting

79
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:11,878
question but what I want to focus on

80
00:03:09,628 --> 00:03:13,468
this episode is the breeding question so

81
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,750
let's jump right into the email it goes

82
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:18,030
what's up Rasta Jeff Jeff with the G

83
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,408
again I hope this email finds you well

84
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,068
what's up Jeff with the G good to hear

85
00:03:19,408 --> 00:03:22,469
from you again

86
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:24,508
Jeff starts off by saying the reason I

87
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:26,699
am harassing today is about my first

88
00:03:24,508 --> 00:03:29,250
time actually making an honest attempt

89
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:31,259
at growing your grow lesson compilation

90
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,598
was the tits and it has inspired me to

91
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:35,399
pull the trigger that is awesome I love

92
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,500
hearing that you thought my grow lessons

93
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,120
were the tits I don't think anybody has

94
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,489
ever told me that anything I've done was

95
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,379
the tits before so that's cool but I am

96
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:45,359
excited that you are now a grower and I

97
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:47,908
am excited for you let's keep going with

98
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:50,699
the message it says I scored at HBS lamp

99
00:03:47,908 --> 00:03:52,828
and two LEDs I've got a tent a blower

100
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:54,269
and a filter I've got some heating pads

101
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,489
for the floor and a couple of other

102
00:03:54,269 --> 00:03:58,709
things all for three hundred dollars man

103
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,419
that is a good deal I do recommend you

104
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:02,009
clean all of that equipment before you

105
00:04:00,419 --> 00:04:03,780
put any plants in there but I think

106
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:06,149
you've got a good setup for a good price

107
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,919
so far it goes on to say I'm sorry that

108
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:10,139
I don't have all of my specs right now

109
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,750
it's all in a pile in the basement

110
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:14,340
currently that's completely fair on the

111
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,348
first question the message is I've

112
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,718
listened to your filter placement

113
00:04:16,348 --> 00:04:21,449
episode but I want to still ask if I'm

114
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:24,060
good blowing directly into my basement

115
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:27,330
especially since I'm using the LEDs

116
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,220
first now that is sort of an odd way

117
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:31,199
I'm not sure exactly what you were

118
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,030
asking I know that in a previous episode

119
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,889
I've talked about carbon filter

120
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:36,658
placement we want the air to pass

121
00:04:34,889 --> 00:04:38,370
through the carbon filter before it

122
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:41,009
leaves our grow space so that wherever

123
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,810
it goes it doesn't have cannabis aroma

124
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:45,090
in it so with that air is nice and clean

125
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,649
so nobody smells our grow it sounds like

126
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,448
Jeff with the G wants to blow the air

127
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:50,370
through the carbon filter out of his

128
00:04:48,449 --> 00:04:52,169
tent and directly into the basement

129
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:53,908
which is not a problem at all that's a

130
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:55,769
good idea that's mainly what a lot of

131
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:57,329
folks do who are growing in the basement

132
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:59,189
as long as that basement doesn't

133
00:04:57,329 --> 00:05:00,899
overheat as long as you're able to get

134
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:02,699
that heat out of there or as long as it

135
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,008
mixes with enough cool air to stabilize

136
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:07,560
the temperature inside of that tent that

137
00:05:05,009 --> 00:05:10,080
should be fine it's the part about the

138
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,879
LEDs that throws me off here since I'm

139
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,818
especially since I'm running the LEDs

140
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:16,110
first I don't know why that makes a

141
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:18,840
difference I'm not sure what you're

142
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,908
questioning about that part so send me

143
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:22,109
another email and kind of clarify this

144
00:05:20,908 --> 00:05:24,538
question and I'll give you further

145
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,090
advice but this is a great email because

146
00:05:24,538 --> 00:05:28,620
I really like the second half the second

147
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:30,478
question is great and we're going to

148
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,889
spend a lot more time focusing on here

149
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,149
so I'm sorry I skipped over the first

150
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,430
part I'm not even sure what you're

151
00:05:33,149 --> 00:05:37,138
asking there but the second part is gold

152
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,300
so let's get to that part it says also

153
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:41,908
after a few sessions I'd like to breed

154
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,189
and create my own strains can I request

155
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:46,439
an episode of breeding terms and methods

156
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:47,668
some of it is a little esoteric at the

157
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:50,399
moment and I'm getting ahead of myself

158
00:05:47,668 --> 00:05:52,258
but I love learning about this plant

159
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,489
especially if you're the teacher hey

160
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,500
that means a lot to me

161
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:57,329
it also says I will have many more

162
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,930
questions and updates in the future but

163
00:05:57,329 --> 00:06:03,000
this is where I am thus far thanks in

164
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:06,598
advance and keep blazing brother Jeff

165
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,218
with Ag I love the enthusiasm coming

166
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:10,139
from Jeff with the G he just got his

167
00:06:08,218 --> 00:06:12,149
grow equipment it's not set up yet and

168
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,918
he's already asking questions about when

169
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:15,929
I breed how I do it how do I do this

170
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,370
correctly you are getting a little bit

171
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,468
ahead of yourself you were absolutely

172
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,538
correct there but this is a good

173
00:06:19,468 --> 00:06:24,658
opportunity for me to talk about

174
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,009
breeding and breeding labels I'm not

175
00:06:24,658 --> 00:06:28,228
going to focus too much on breeding

176
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,610
methods and too much of my tricks and

177
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:32,250
techniques and stuff like that on this

178
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:33,990
episode I'd like to focus more on the

179
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:36,509
labels and some of the wording that we

180
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,879
see on seed packaging I think that some

181
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:41,249
of the companies use a lot of trickery

182
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,348
and a lot of miss labeling

183
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:44,669
a lot of weird wordplay and I'm not sure

184
00:06:43,348 --> 00:06:47,098
if these companies are doing it because

185
00:06:44,668 --> 00:06:48,959
they're trying to sell more seeds and

186
00:06:47,098 --> 00:06:51,389
they're trying to word things fancily so

187
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,038
that the consumer is kind of fooled and

188
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,408
wants to buy [ __ ] that sounds better or

189
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,058
if they really just they don't know how

190
00:06:55,408 --> 00:06:58,199
to properly label it and those are the

191
00:06:57,059 --> 00:07:00,269
words that they chose for their

192
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,489
packaging so we see a lot of different

193
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:04,348
things on packaging and oftentimes it

194
00:07:02,488 --> 00:07:05,698
all means the same [ __ ] a lot of times

195
00:07:04,348 --> 00:07:07,348
it doesn't mean anything

196
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,288
so let's kind of talk about some of the

197
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:11,728
things we see on seed packaging and we

198
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:13,860
may actually talk about some things that

199
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:16,228
we do not see on seed packaging that

200
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,929
should probably be there let's start off

201
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,699
with some of the very basics labeling we

202
00:07:18,928 --> 00:07:22,228
will often see the name of the strain

203
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,059
today I'm going to pick one of my

204
00:07:22,228 --> 00:07:25,918
strains because it's easy for me we're

205
00:07:24,059 --> 00:07:27,779
going to go with the rise a lot of my

206
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,878
listeners know that arise is one of my

207
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:31,978
favorites I bred the arize I can talk

208
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,689
about it freely I know all the details

209
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:36,418
and I'm not gonna be wrong so let's pick

210
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:39,059
a rise is our strain for the day when I

211
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:40,918
label a rise I write a rise on the seed

212
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:42,449
package that's obvious now you know

213
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:45,658
those are a rise seeds in there

214
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:49,559
underneath the rise in parentheses I put

215
00:07:45,658 --> 00:07:52,048
golden goat X Daybreaker and those are

216
00:07:49,559 --> 00:07:54,809
in a parentheses together why did I put

217
00:07:52,048 --> 00:07:56,848
that there because golden goat is the

218
00:07:54,809 --> 00:08:00,360
female plant that was used to create

219
00:07:56,848 --> 00:08:03,449
arise and Daybreaker was the male plant

220
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,009
it was used to create the arize now

221
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:07,860
you've got an idea of what the genetic

222
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:10,619
parents of the seeds you have purchased

223
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:13,019
are that provides you a little bit of

224
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:16,139
information as to how the plant will

225
00:08:13,019 --> 00:08:18,119
grow possibly what it will taste like it

226
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,189
creates a little bit of familiarity if

227
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:21,749
you know what golden goat is you know

228
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:23,459
who I like golden goat or if you know

229
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:25,049
what Daybreaker is you say oh I like

230
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,548
Daybreaker or if you know what both of

231
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:28,738
them are you go oh I wonder what that's

232
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,138
like when he bred those together so when

233
00:08:28,738 --> 00:08:33,179
we see two strain names in parenthesis

234
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,519
with an X in the middle that indicates

235
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,739
that those were the crossed plants that

236
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,168
created the named strain that's listed

237
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,969
above so again you'll see a rise and

238
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:44,278
then under that you've got parentheses

239
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:46,079
golden goat X Daybreaker

240
00:08:44,278 --> 00:08:48,659
and then a parenthesis to close that and

241
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:50,370
that indicates that a rise is a cross of

242
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:53,159
golden goat to Daybreaker

243
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,899
now here is another detail that is often

244
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,589
overlooked by many see

245
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:01,799
Maker's it is proper practice to list

246
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:03,720
ladies first inside of that parentheses

247
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,919
so it would be proper to list

248
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,389
parentheses mother acts father

249
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,189
parentheses you've got golden goat today

250
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:12,870
breaker now we know that golden goat is

251
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,880
the female and Daybreaker was the male

252
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:17,909
in that cross there is no doubt about

253
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:20,189
that unfortunately that is not standard

254
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:20,730
practice across the board with all

255
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:23,100
breeders

256
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:25,320
it is proper practice in horticulture

257
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:27,629
but not all breeders have adopted this

258
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,300
practice sometimes you have to ask the

259
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:32,639
breeder what was the male used in your

260
00:09:30,299 --> 00:09:35,039
project now we can take this even

261
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:37,139
further sometimes you will see something

262
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,029
in parentheses with the open and close

263
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:41,340
parentheses so you'll have golden goat x

264
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:43,350
Daybreaker in a set of parentheses then

265
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,810
you'll have another X then two other

266
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:48,389
things in a set of parentheses now that

267
00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:50,099
indicates that we have taken this plant

268
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,779
in the set of parentheses that is one

269
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,670
plant so you've probably got golden goat

270
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,589
X Daybreaker and a set of parentheses

271
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:57,089
that may to rise then you've got I'm

272
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,980
just gonna pick something else over here

273
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:01,769
let's say we've got parentheses

274
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:03,960
Strawberry Fields X blueberry cookies

275
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:05,549
and then parentheses to close that so

276
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,620
that would indicate that we have taken

277
00:10:05,549 --> 00:10:09,509
the progeny of the Strawberry Fields

278
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,279
cross two blueberry cookies and we've

279
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:14,159
got a male of that because it is on the

280
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,620
right side of the X then we've got the

281
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,029
golden goat on the left side of the X so

282
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,190
basically that would indicate that we

283
00:10:18,029 --> 00:10:23,189
have now crossed the golden goat to the

284
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:25,230
Rafael is what the Strawberry Fields to

285
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,370
the blueberry cookies cross is so that

286
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,920
would be an indication that we have

287
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,720
crossed the rise to the Rafael and the

288
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:32,479
reason that we do the multiple sets of

289
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,160
parentheses is to kind of show

290
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,110
grandparents because breeder nerds like

291
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,799
myself and like many of you listening

292
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:42,600
want to know oh yeah so it's a rise to

293
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:44,129
Rafael what's a rise now you want to

294
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,269
know that a Rises gold and goats add a

295
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:47,519
breaker and you want to know what's

296
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:49,289
Rafael Rafael is strawberry fields two

297
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,360
blueberry cookies a lot of people like

298
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:53,219
to know a little further back what the

299
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,500
genetics are what the family tree looks

300
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,000
like it's just fun if you're a nerd some

301
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,159
people are into that some people really

302
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,070
do not care some breeders list that on

303
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:03,899
the packages some do not so mainly when

304
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:05,820
you see the parentheses that is one

305
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,860
plant when it has the parentheses and

306
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,870
then a bunch of words and then an X in

307
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,759
the middle and a bunch of word

308
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,769
and then more parentheses that was one

309
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:15,230
plant everything on the left side of

310
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:17,269
your axe is the female everything on the

311
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,129
right side of the X is your male and

312
00:11:17,269 --> 00:11:20,509
then you close that up that's one plant

313
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,009
then you put an X in the middle that

314
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:24,169
means you're crossing that to the other

315
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:25,159
plant which could be just one plant we

316
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,449
don't have to have something in

317
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:29,449
parentheses over there you may have

318
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,810
taken golden goat to Daybreaker

319
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:34,370
in parentheses X blueberry cookies you

320
00:11:32,809 --> 00:11:35,809
can do that so you don't have to have a

321
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:37,669
cross on the other side it could be one

322
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,689
thing hopefully this makes sense the way

323
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:40,610
I'm explaining it

324
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:43,130
the main reason this is done like I said

325
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:45,860
before is to let the purchaser the

326
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:48,679
consumer know the pedigree or the family

327
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:51,050
tree of their seeds now sometimes there

328
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:54,319
may be letters at the ends of those

329
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:55,969
equations we may have F's or s's or ours

330
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,620
and there also may be numbers in there

331
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,330
we'll talk about that in just a minute

332
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:01,278
let's talk about more of the basic

333
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:04,400
things we see on some seed packaging

334
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:07,399
most seed packages will indicate a

335
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:10,250
flowering time if we are working with

336
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,189
photo period seeds that flowering time

337
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:16,220
indicates the estimated time in which

338
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:19,730
those seeds will take to finish

339
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,370
flowering once the flowering stage has

340
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,430
been initiated now if you were growing

341
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:28,370
indoors flowering starts the day you

342
00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:30,139
switch your light cycle to 1212 if you

343
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,060
were growing outdoors you have to pay

344
00:12:30,139 --> 00:12:33,919
attention to your calendar your Farmers

345
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:36,199
Almanac and you also have to keep an eye

346
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:38,569
on the plants but when we are working

347
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,900
with photo period plants from photo

348
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,850
period seeds flowering time means the

349
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:46,579
amount of time that the plants will take

350
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:49,220
to finish flowering from the day we

351
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:51,470
initiate the flowering phase you can veg

352
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,240
them as long as you want these plants

353
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,399
will veg as long as we keep them

354
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,080
properly fed and they don't get root

355
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:59,360
bound and there are no environmental

356
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,060
factors that make them flower we can veg

357
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,120
them as long or as short as we want

358
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:07,579
in some cases I veg my plants for seven

359
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,230
to ten days then I initiate flower by

360
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,730
putting them under twelve twelve or

361
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:13,430
eleven thirteen lighting

362
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:15,800
sometimes I veg my plants for a hundred

363
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:18,169
days it's all about my goal and what I'm

364
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,208
trying to do with those plants but the

365
00:13:18,169 --> 00:13:22,099
estimated flowering time that is printed

366
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:24,768
on seed packaging is an end

367
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:27,350
Asian of how long those seeds will take

368
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:30,500
to finish flowering from the time you

369
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:32,778
initiate the flowering cycle and again

370
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:35,659
if you are indoors day one of your

371
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:38,179
flowering cycle begins the day you turn

372
00:13:35,659 --> 00:13:40,939
that timer to twelve hours on and twelve

373
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:42,979
hours off now we also have to keep in

374
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,560
mind that many breeders give you a range

375
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,870
of when we can expect those plants to be

376
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:49,698
finished we have to keep in mind that we

377
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,289
are working with seeds we've got nature

378
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:53,599
to work with these plants have been

379
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:55,250
selectively bred from phenotypes that

380
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,870
have been tested so we have a good idea

381
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:59,120
of how long they are going to take to

382
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:01,009
finish once they're bred we grow a bunch

383
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,690
of them out we take good notes we see

384
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:04,699
how long they take to finish in several

385
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:06,949
environments but they are plants and

386
00:14:04,698 --> 00:14:08,870
there are different phenotypes in packs

387
00:14:06,948 --> 00:14:11,539
of seeds so we have to give you an

388
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,129
estimated time frame in which those

389
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:15,439
plants will be finished I like to give

390
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:17,389
about a two-week window I say these

391
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,699
plants take eight to nine weeks to

392
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:22,698
finish that means somewhere between that

393
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:25,159
55 and 65 day mark those plants will be

394
00:14:22,698 --> 00:14:27,289
done but there are a lot of factors that

395
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:29,659
contribute to when a plant will be

396
00:14:27,289 --> 00:14:31,610
finished I can take the same clone and

397
00:14:29,659 --> 00:14:33,708
grow it in my grow room and grow that

398
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:36,019
same clone in your grow room and if we

399
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:38,989
pay super close attention we will notice

400
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:40,970
that those plants reach peak ripeness at

401
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,709
different times in our different grow

402
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,920
rooms even if we've got the same

403
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:48,049
phenotype so we offer a time frame in

404
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,938
which we expect those plants to be

405
00:14:48,049 --> 00:14:51,769
finished we are going to find different

406
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:53,870
phenotypes and they're going to be grown

407
00:14:51,769 --> 00:14:56,000
in different environments so we tried to

408
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:58,490
give the best estimate we can based on

409
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,318
what our test results have shown most of

410
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,299
my packages say that the plants will be

411
00:15:00,318 --> 00:15:04,309
finished within eight to nine weeks or

412
00:15:02,299 --> 00:15:06,379
nine to ten weeks or ten to 11 weeks

413
00:15:04,309 --> 00:15:08,599
that's the sort of range that I like to

414
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:10,519
put on my packaging to give the consumer

415
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,589
to give the grower a good idea of what

416
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,419
to expect when you were growing from a

417
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,550
pack of seeds and you don't know how

418
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:19,188
long those plants take to flower I

419
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:22,399
always recommend you go the longest

420
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:24,379
recommended time on the package some

421
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,078
strains really like to beef up the last

422
00:15:24,379 --> 00:15:29,870
seven days some strains really like to

423
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:32,688
beef up the last five days some strains

424
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,970
do really interesting things if you let

425
00:15:32,688 --> 00:15:35,969
them go past that sixty-three day mark

426
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,920
let it go to seven

427
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:40,350
days and see what it does maybe it

428
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,208
really beefs up maybe it really gets an

429
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:43,980
interesting aroma at the end maybe it

430
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:45,719
turns some really cool colors that you

431
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,120
never would have known about if you

432
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,980
didn't let it go that extra week yes the

433
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,539
trichomes are the boss always pay

434
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,938
attention to the trichomes but if you've

435
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,519
got the opportunity to let one plant go

436
00:15:53,938 --> 00:15:58,769
longer just as an experiment let it go

437
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:01,139
see what happens you may be really

438
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:02,879
satisfied with the results so that is

439
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:05,370
what we're talking about when we list

440
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:07,860
the flowering time on the back of a

441
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:10,110
package of seeds another thing that I'm

442
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,850
more often see on websites not as

443
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,318
commonly on the package of seeds because

444
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,879
a package of seeds is very little we

445
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,128
don't have a lot of space to write a lot

446
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,409
of things I occupy most of my space with

447
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:21,560
cool artwork lately something I see on a

448
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:24,179
lot of websites is what is known as

449
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,948
morphology and that means what are these

450
00:16:24,179 --> 00:16:28,109
plants going to look like what type of

451
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:30,539
growth characteristics can we expect

452
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,699
from these plants morphology is an

453
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:34,889
indicator of what types of phenotypes we

454
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,169
can expect from these plants so does it

455
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:39,240
say short squatty plants does it say

456
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:41,308
tall skinny plants does it say wide

457
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,220
bushy plants that is what we mean by

458
00:16:41,308 --> 00:16:46,799
morphology shape and characteristics

459
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,259
growth characteristics and traits we can

460
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,929
expect from these plants I list that in

461
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,300
great detail on my website again I don't

462
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,039
list that on a lot of my packaging but

463
00:16:54,299 --> 00:16:58,378
my packaging is ever-evolving and

464
00:16:56,039 --> 00:17:00,778
ever-changing just like my brand so who

465
00:16:58,379 --> 00:17:03,480
knows I may add morphology in the future

466
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:05,970
let's talk about something I do list on

467
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,699
many of my packages and that is aroma

468
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:11,220
and flavor that is quite obvious what do

469
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,380
I mean by aroma and flavor that is what

470
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,179
these buds what these flowers are going

471
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,220
to smell like and hopefully what they

472
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,679
taste like once you harvest dry and

473
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,390
properly cure them and another thing

474
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,569
that many breeders include on their

475
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:26,730
packaging is expected yield now I think

476
00:17:24,568 --> 00:17:29,158
an expected yield and flavor and aroma

477
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,169
are things that many breeders kind of

478
00:17:29,159 --> 00:17:33,840
get creative with when it comes to

479
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:37,500
typing details on their packaging and

480
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:40,259
their website descriptions I do my best

481
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:43,169
to be completely honest with my

482
00:17:40,259 --> 00:17:45,808
consumers when I am labeling my packages

483
00:17:43,169 --> 00:17:47,580
my flavor descriptions are compilations

484
00:17:45,808 --> 00:17:49,089
of what I have smelled what I have

485
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:51,490
experienced what I have

486
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:54,189
through multiple phenotypes of these

487
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:56,079
plants I also use information from my

488
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:58,240
test growers I've got a lot of friends

489
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,099
out there the tests grow my strains

490
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,720
before they make it to the market big

491
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:03,128
shout outs all my testers thank you for

492
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,129
the great reports lately you guys are

493
00:18:03,128 --> 00:18:08,498
doing great jobs I also have many great

494
00:18:06,128 --> 00:18:10,898
friends around me who some of them are

495
00:18:08,499 --> 00:18:13,659
cannabis snobs and some of them are

496
00:18:10,898 --> 00:18:15,548
honestly cannabis noobs and I keep all

497
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:17,559
those friends around and when we have a

498
00:18:15,548 --> 00:18:19,450
new thing to smoke I get all of their

499
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:21,638
information and I treat the cannabis

500
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,798
noobs better information is just as

501
00:18:21,638 --> 00:18:26,199
important to me as the cannabis schnapps

502
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:28,720
because their palate they say oh that

503
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,700
tastes like this and if a noob says that

504
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,798
tastes just like tangerines and vanilla

505
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:34,899
cream and a snob says that tastes like

506
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,548
tangerines and vanilla cream it must be

507
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:38,648
accurate so both of their opinions

508
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:41,138
matter to me equally I have a lot of

509
00:18:38,648 --> 00:18:42,788
people smoke and sample my products

510
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:45,609
before I put those words on the

511
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,589
packaging I also do the same with the

512
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:48,878
flowering times I've got test growers

513
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:51,220
out there that are growing stuff right

514
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:53,378
now and I ask all of my testers to keep

515
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,899
detailed notes for me I know exactly

516
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:59,528
what day they chopped down these plants

517
00:18:55,898 --> 00:19:01,359
so I know if they're going 55 60 to 72

518
00:18:59,528 --> 00:19:02,950
days I've got a friend out there right

519
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,019
now running a new strain of mine that is

520
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,730
being tested who has been going for 12

521
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:08,859
weeks and he's sending the amazing

522
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:10,450
reports every week so I'm getting

523
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:12,219
detailed reports that's where my

524
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,159
information comes from that I put on the

525
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,379
packages I do my best to be completely

526
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,240
honest with the consumers because you

527
00:19:17,378 --> 00:19:20,949
know who I am if I sell you some [ __ ]

528
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,909
and it doesn't do what you expect you

529
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:24,100
know how to find me

530
00:19:21,909 --> 00:19:26,889
you know who to email it's just me I am

531
00:19:24,099 --> 00:19:28,839
honest I do my best I can't say that for

532
00:19:26,888 --> 00:19:31,719
every seed company and breeder out there

533
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:33,368
but I wish I could so expected yield or

534
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,019
harvest weight that should be obvious

535
00:19:33,368 --> 00:19:37,778
that is how much product you're going to

536
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:40,599
get but like I said not all breeders are

537
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:42,999
completely honest and I try to use like

538
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:45,398
general terms like big yields small

539
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:47,980
yields medium yields sometimes I will

540
00:19:45,398 --> 00:19:48,908
say this may not be the fattest yield er

541
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,980
in my arsenal

542
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:52,869
but the Terps make up for it because

543
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:54,669
sometimes that's how it is with cannabis

544
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:57,009
and I am honest I want you to know that

545
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:58,750
you were getting connoisseur grade super

546
00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:00,819
stinky cannabis but you may not get a

547
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,200
whole bunch of it that may be what some

548
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:04,539
growers want that may not

549
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,519
what you need for your area I am honest

550
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:08,649
as honest as I could be on my packaging

551
00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,599
the flavors and aromas again like I said

552
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,910
we try to do our best when describing

553
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:15,490
flavors and aromas some people get

554
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:17,769
really creative so those are most of the

555
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:20,349
basic things we will see on a seed

556
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:22,420
package now let's talk more about some

557
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:25,149
of those random letters and numbers that

558
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,820
we see in the strain descriptions and in

559
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,860
the genetic listings so let's go back to

560
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:31,839
talking about arise let's talk about

561
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:34,779
that set of parentheses we had earlier

562
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:37,029
with golden goat X day breaker within

563
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:39,220
that set of parentheses so I took a

564
00:20:37,029 --> 00:20:41,589
female golden goat plant and I

565
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,350
pollinated it with a day breaker that

566
00:20:41,589 --> 00:20:46,539
created arise that was the first time

567
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:48,459
that those two plants met and the first

568
00:20:46,539 --> 00:20:50,200
time they hooked up the first time they

569
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:53,740
met babies so that is the first

570
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,620
generation of arise the first filial

571
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:00,579
generation of arise so now that is

572
00:20:56,619 --> 00:21:03,250
technically an arise f1 now some people

573
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:05,259
may argue that that is a poly hybrid and

574
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,630
they may be correct but for this story

575
00:21:05,259 --> 00:21:10,059
we're going to focus on the f1 hybrid

576
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:12,220
being the accurate description the poly

577
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:14,259
hybrid we'll talk about more way in the

578
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,529
future because that is a way deeper

579
00:21:14,259 --> 00:21:20,079
topic but let's focus on the f1 at this

580
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:22,059
point so golden go and Daybreaker they

581
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,009
hook up I'm a matchmaker I introduced

582
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:26,289
these two they do their thing they make

583
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:28,930
some babies those babies I named them

584
00:21:26,289 --> 00:21:32,500
arise that is the first filial

585
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:34,750
generation of arise so they are arise f1

586
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:38,259
now most of the time you are not going

587
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:40,869
to see f1 listed on the packaging unless

588
00:21:38,259 --> 00:21:43,059
there is an f2 or a further generation

589
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:44,949
made and that breeder is known or has

590
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,769
been known to use that filial generation

591
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:50,080
for other work so most of the time if

592
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:54,069
you don't see an F listed on the cross

593
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:57,669
it is an f1 so we have got a rise f1 if

594
00:21:54,069 --> 00:22:00,939
I were to take and a rise male from that

595
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:04,600
f1 batch and in a rise female from that

596
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:08,470
f1 batch and I breed them together their

597
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:10,869
offspring will make the f2 generation

598
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:13,450
and the reason I would do that is to

599
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:16,199
find the traits in the f1 that are most

600
00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:18,450
desirable and stabilize those tray

601
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,950
it's breed them together and make that

602
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,319
f2 have the traits

603
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:24,120
I want even stronger and then at that

604
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:26,548
point we kind of eliminate other traits

605
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:28,949
that we aren't looking for then to

606
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:31,679
stabilize those desirable traits I would

607
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:33,778
find a male from that f2 batch and I

608
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,240
would find a female from the f2 batch

609
00:22:33,778 --> 00:22:39,298
and I would breed them together and that

610
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:42,839
subsequent offspring the progeny would

611
00:22:39,298 --> 00:22:45,148
be known as the f3 filial generation and

612
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,369
it just continues that way most of the

613
00:22:45,148 --> 00:22:49,528
time a breeder will take that to f3 or

614
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:51,418
f4 and they will have locked in the

615
00:22:49,528 --> 00:22:54,089
exact traits they are looking for and

616
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:57,269
most of those seeds will actually grow

617
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:59,398
like clones of each other you will have

618
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:03,329
very stable genetics by the time you are

619
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:06,148
to the f5 or f6 generation now a moment

620
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:08,788
ago I talked about poly hybrids poly

621
00:23:06,148 --> 00:23:11,729
hybrids are quite often overlooked in

622
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:13,888
the world of cannabis breeding many

623
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,960
people including myself are breeding

624
00:23:13,888 --> 00:23:18,359
with poly hybrids that are actually

625
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:22,110
being called F ones let's talk about

626
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:24,719
poly hybrids versus F one's a poly

627
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:27,898
hybrid is basically what most people are

628
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,210
calling an f1 a poly hybrid is when you

629
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:32,668
take a strain like Daybreaker

630
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:35,639
and a strain like golden goat and you

631
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:38,429
breed them together those create a new

632
00:23:35,638 --> 00:23:41,579
cross it could be considered an f1 but

633
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:43,860
it is actually a poly hybrid because the

634
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:47,220
parents were not worked for stability

635
00:23:43,859 --> 00:23:49,439
for singled desirable traits now that

636
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:52,558
it's kind of a vague blanket statement

637
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,019
to cover the term poly hybrid but when I

638
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,079
talk about proper F ones it will make

639
00:23:55,019 --> 00:24:01,620
more sense by breeding with an f1

640
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,839
version of Daybreaker and an f1 version

641
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:06,689
of golden goat I did not have the

642
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:10,349
opportunity to lock in the traits of my

643
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:13,350
parent plants to ensure that I got

644
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:15,869
offspring that showed those plants and

645
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:18,569
not their grandparents so the proper way

646
00:24:15,869 --> 00:24:21,869
to do it would to have taken the golden

647
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:25,528
goat and work the golden goat to f3 f4

648
00:24:21,869 --> 00:24:27,689
or maybe f5 until I locked in the traits

649
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:30,029
that I was searching for on the golden

650
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:31,650
goat side of the breeding project

651
00:24:30,029 --> 00:24:33,930
what was I looking for on the golden

652
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:36,690
goat side I wanted that sweet tropical

653
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:39,000
flavor and that potency but then from

654
00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:42,090
the Daybreaker side I also wanted that

655
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,130
cushy stinkiness my goal was to see what

656
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:46,500
happened when I put two plants that were

657
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:49,290
completely opposite together and I hit

658
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,509
the goal with that but proper breeding

659
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:53,309
would have been to breed the golden goat

660
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:56,190
until I locked in the traits that I

661
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:56,909
wanted and then also breed the

662
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,990
Daybreaker

663
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:02,670
to the f3 the f4 possibly the f5 or f6

664
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:05,490
generation to really lock in the traits

665
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:08,880
I'm looking for there then breed those

666
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:11,069
together and make the arise in theory

667
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,830
that would have made a more stable cross

668
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:16,950
we would have less variation in Fino

669
00:25:13,829 --> 00:25:19,470
typical expression the reality is I only

670
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:21,420
had one golden goat because golden goat

671
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,880
is a clone only so I did not have the

672
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:25,920
opportunity to work that unless I did a

673
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,750
back cross which I have done we will

674
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,880
talk about back crossing in a moment and

675
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:32,009
honestly that was not my goal with this

676
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,800
cross my goal was to put that super

677
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:37,230
tropical golden goat to the super dank

678
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,389
and stanky OG Kush looking Daybreaker

679
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,920
and kind of create that poly hybrid I

680
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:42,990
knew that's what I was doing that was my

681
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,009
intention here but that is often

682
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:49,049
confused as an f1 is the point here

683
00:25:46,009 --> 00:25:52,140
basically crossing to F ones that were

684
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:53,700
not stabilised makes a poly hybrid I'm

685
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:55,259
probably going to get some emails about

686
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,580
that because that was kind of fumbled

687
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:58,079
through that one honestly I don't have a

688
00:25:56,579 --> 00:26:00,149
lot of notes here I didn't plan on

689
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,039
talking about poly hybrids let's keep

690
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:04,380
moving forward I do have a few more

691
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,019
things I did mention BX just a moment

692
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,570
ago what is a BX I did mention that I've

693
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:12,329
made a golden Gobi X so let's focus on

694
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:15,720
that one many people want golden goat

695
00:26:12,329 --> 00:26:17,669
seeds golden goat is only available in a

696
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,890
female plant there was never a male

697
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:21,870
golden goat released golden goat is

698
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:23,640
what's known as a clone only there's

699
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:26,699
only a female the breeder

700
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,190
mr. dank from Topeka Kansas never put

701
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,529
out a mail people want golden goat seeds

702
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,940
I made feminized seeds of golden goat it

703
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:35,490
is available in Femmes

704
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,529
a lot of consumers do not want feminized

705
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:40,380
seeds but they still want a shot at the

706
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:42,269
golden goat so I have created a golden

707
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,410
goat backcross and I'll tell you how I

708
00:26:42,269 --> 00:26:45,359
did that

709
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:48,600
golden goat back cross starts of course

710
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:50,579
with a golden goat female I pollinated

711
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:51,509
that golden goat female with a

712
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:54,720
Daybreaker

713
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:57,329
male yes this is how a rise was made

714
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,819
there is a really good reason for using

715
00:26:57,329 --> 00:27:02,879
the Daybreaker male to create a golden

716
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:04,079
goat back cross the traits of golden

717
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,840
goat and Daybreaker

718
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:10,740
are very obviously visibly different

719
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:13,589
golden goat has long thin skinny pointy

720
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,420
leaves Daybreaker makes big fat white

721
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:18,149
leaves that you could [ __ ] camp under

722
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:20,670
so i bred them together then I grew out

723
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,490
a bunch of the seeds and took very close

724
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:27,390
notes on how these plants grew then I

725
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:30,509
found a male that looked exactly like my

726
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:34,110
female golden goat this male had the

727
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:36,599
exact same plant structure this male

728
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:37,409
took the same amount of time to go into

729
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:40,679
flower

730
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:43,230
this male smelled exactly the same on

731
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:46,560
the stem rub this male smelled exactly

732
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:48,870
like golden goat late and flower the

733
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,409
best part about this male was that the

734
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:55,109
leaves look just like the female golden

735
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:58,170
goat to the extent that it had the exact

736
00:27:55,109 --> 00:28:00,599
same number of serait Shinzon the leaves

737
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,130
and the leaf tips did the same exact

738
00:28:00,599 --> 00:28:04,559
little curling thing that the golden

739
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:08,220
goat female did when I overfed it this

740
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,889
was a beautiful replica of my golden

741
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:14,009
goat female and I could tell that it did

742
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:16,130
not have much of the Daybreaker traits

743
00:28:14,009 --> 00:28:19,170
to it because it did not show any

744
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:21,180
Daybreaker traits at all it didn't smell

745
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:22,710
like it it didn't act like it it didn't

746
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:25,140
grow like it and it certainly did not

747
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:28,140
look like it so I was confident that I

748
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:30,990
had a very golden goat dominant male I

749
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:33,960
took that golden goat dominant male and

750
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:36,870
put that pollen on the original female

751
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:39,090
golden go now I have back crossed

752
00:28:36,869 --> 00:28:40,469
because I have out crossed that golden

753
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:42,990
goat to the Daybreaker

754
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:45,240
and it made seeds then I found a male in

755
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:48,359
there that looks just like the female

756
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,279
and I put that pollen back on the female

757
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,969
the seeds that came out of there are a

758
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:55,799
golden goat back cross 1 which would be

759
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,909
labeled as a bx

760
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,769
1

761
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:01,109
if I were to grow those and find another

762
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:03,509
male it was even a more close

763
00:29:01,108 --> 00:29:06,118
representation of that original female

764
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:08,819
golden go and back cross that on to the

765
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:13,048
original female again that would be a B

766
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:15,898
x2 fortunately for me I did enough work

767
00:29:13,048 --> 00:29:18,808
finding my first male that I feel like

768
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:21,898
that back cross is a very close

769
00:29:18,808 --> 00:29:24,239
representation of the original golden go

770
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:27,178
and everybody who has grown it has been

771
00:29:24,239 --> 00:29:30,899
satisfied with the outcome so that is a

772
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:32,519
back cross indicated as ABX the main

773
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:34,888
reason for that is to make something

774
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,950
available in seed form it was not

775
00:29:34,888 --> 00:29:40,019
available in seed without making it in a

776
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:42,808
feminized form because many people are

777
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:44,339
opposed to feminized seeds now I'm

778
00:29:42,808 --> 00:29:48,028
actually going to work my way into some

779
00:29:44,339 --> 00:29:50,488
feminized seed labels many people have a

780
00:29:48,028 --> 00:29:52,499
strong bias against feminized seeds

781
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:54,028
I make them seeds I understand how

782
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:56,190
feminized seeds are made and how they

783
00:29:54,028 --> 00:29:59,009
work I think they are a great option for

784
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:01,499
a grower who is limited on numbers or a

785
00:29:59,009 --> 00:30:03,778
grower who needs every seed they plant

786
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:05,579
to be a female I understand the need for

787
00:30:03,778 --> 00:30:07,200
feminized seeds let's talk about how

788
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:08,519
they are labeled we're not going to talk

789
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,929
too much about how they're made today

790
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,269
we're going to talk about how we label

791
00:30:09,929 --> 00:30:14,548
them most often when it comes to

792
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:18,239
feminized seeds you will see either an R

793
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:21,148
or an S for a FEM seed let's talk about

794
00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:23,909
s you may see something like a golden

795
00:30:21,148 --> 00:30:27,449
goat s one I make golden goat s ones

796
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:29,729
that s indicates the word self what I

797
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:33,119
have done I have taken a female golden

798
00:30:29,729 --> 00:30:34,769
goat plant and I've made two clones one

799
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:36,720
of them I have decided is going to be

800
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:40,079
treated with a solution that will become

801
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,598
my pollen donor the other one is going

802
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:45,928
to be a female she gets left alone she

803
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:47,939
becomes my pollen receiver I treat the

804
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,369
selected plant with a solution that

805
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:53,070
causes that plant to create pollen it

806
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:55,589
only contains female chromosomes because

807
00:30:53,069 --> 00:30:57,538
there are no male chromosomes in that

808
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:58,288
plant it's a girl I treat it with the

809
00:30:57,538 --> 00:31:00,329
solution

810
00:30:58,288 --> 00:31:03,749
it creates pollen that pollen is all

811
00:31:00,329 --> 00:31:05,189
female I put that female pollen on to

812
00:31:03,749 --> 00:31:08,159
the golden goat so now we have taken

813
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:10,470
golden goat female pollen and put it on

814
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:13,679
a golden goat female plan

815
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:16,259
the outcome is all female golden goat

816
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:18,150
seeds now since there have not been any

817
00:31:16,259 --> 00:31:22,950
other genetics introduced into that

818
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:26,159
project it is known as a self and s1 so

819
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:29,460
golden goat s1 represents a golden goat

820
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,980
selfed seed a female golden goat it was

821
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:34,590
reversed and that pollen was applied to

822
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:37,950
a golden goat plant now we are going to

823
00:31:34,589 --> 00:31:40,109
move forward and talk about an r1 if I

824
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:42,450
were to take that golden goat pollen

825
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:45,569
which I spoke of before and I apply that

826
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:50,669
golden goat pollen to any other female

827
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:54,000
plant the resulting seeds are r1 that is

828
00:31:50,669 --> 00:31:57,690
called a reversal lemon Jeffrey is an R

829
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,808
1 lemon Jeffrey is a female lemon skunk

830
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:04,350
plant which was pollinated by a reversed

831
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:07,589
golden goat plant reversed are reversed

832
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:10,408
1 it's a reversal 1 it is very similar

833
00:32:07,589 --> 00:32:13,918
to the f1 that I spoke of much earlier

834
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:17,220
in the show but I used feminized pollen

835
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,610
so that is an R 1 so s indicates self

836
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,329
and R indicates reverse self means I did

837
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,668
it myself

838
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:26,220
R means reversed pollen that was put on

839
00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:30,179
two different plants to create different

840
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:32,159
hybrids now you may see s 2 and R 2 and

841
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:36,419
things of that nature but those are very

842
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,159
less common than an F 2 and F 3 or a bee

843
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:40,200
x2 or something like that

844
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,330
the most common indicator you're going

845
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,000
to see on a feminized seed is usually

846
00:32:42,329 --> 00:32:48,359
going to be that s 1 if you see

847
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,519
blueberry cookies s 1 or a golden go s 1

848
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:53,158
that means that that plant was simply

849
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:55,288
used reversed pollinated itself there

850
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,840
are no other genetics in there I find

851
00:32:55,288 --> 00:33:00,298
those to be highly desirable if I've got

852
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,548
a strain that I need to preserve let's

853
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:04,740
just pick a strain will say I will say

854
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:06,750
lemon Jie I was growing lemon Jie for a

855
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,909
long time it was very desirable very

856
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,470
sought-after I kind of got bored with it

857
00:33:08,909 --> 00:33:11,580
but I didn't want to give it up forever

858
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:14,130
so what did I do

859
00:33:11,579 --> 00:33:16,288
I reversed it I made a few seeds now

860
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:19,590
I've got lemon Jie feminized seeds

861
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:20,970
stashed away in a stash I've got just

862
00:33:19,589 --> 00:33:24,058
enough of them to where I think when I

863
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:26,729
grow them I will find very close

864
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:29,368
representations of the original lemon G

865
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:31,979
because there are no other genetics

866
00:33:29,368 --> 00:33:34,019
added to that gene pool and every seat

867
00:33:31,979 --> 00:33:37,259
I've got is a female so that is a very

868
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:38,999
great way to preserve a seed line if

869
00:33:37,259 --> 00:33:41,429
there's a reason why you need to get rid

870
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:43,019
of it I chose to get rid of that lemon G

871
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:44,399
of course I gave clones of it to

872
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:45,749
Tennessee I gave clones of it to

873
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,128
everybody around me so that it could

874
00:33:45,749 --> 00:33:49,348
live so that it can survive so that it

875
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:51,388
could get spread but I no longer have it

876
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:53,878
when I choose to have it again I've got

877
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:56,218
the lemon gs1 now here is proper

878
00:33:53,878 --> 00:33:59,069
etiquette when I grow those lemon GS

879
00:33:56,219 --> 00:34:02,969
ones if I share the clone I will label

880
00:33:59,069 --> 00:34:06,269
it lemon gs1 also when I put the buds in

881
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:08,730
a bag they will be labeled lemon gs1

882
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:10,289
that way if there's a variance if

883
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:12,088
there's a difference if there's a

884
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:14,039
medical cannabis patient that smokes

885
00:34:12,088 --> 00:34:15,838
lemon gene it works beautifully for them

886
00:34:14,039 --> 00:34:17,879
I don't want to dupe them into thinking

887
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:20,878
they got lemon G when they just got my

888
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:23,788
lemon gs1 that is proper etiquette as a

889
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:26,460
grower as a pro as a good person so I

890
00:34:23,789 --> 00:34:28,020
feel like we have covered r1 and s1

891
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,000
we've covered most of the feminized

892
00:34:28,019 --> 00:34:32,878
talked we have covered the male and

893
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,028
female talk let's work our way toward

894
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:37,798
talking about a and B lines there's a

895
00:34:36,028 --> 00:34:39,869
breeder that we all know quite well he's

896
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:41,489
dominating the damn seed game right now

897
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,838
I'm not gonna say his name or his brand

898
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:46,368
name he knows who he is big shout out

899
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:49,440
bro he likes to put out a and B lines

900
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:51,210
some people are confused by this I find

901
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,730
it to be a great idea and I understand

902
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,278
what is happening so let me talk a

903
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:57,990
little bit about a and B lines when it

904
00:34:56,278 --> 00:35:00,719
comes to breeding and marketing and

905
00:34:57,989 --> 00:35:02,909
releasing these packages I was talking

906
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:05,250
about poly hybrids and F ones and

907
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:08,190
stabilized strains earlier I used the

908
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,420
word work a lot to work a strain means

909
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,338
that you have either bred it to

910
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:13,409
something or you've taken it a further

911
00:35:11,338 --> 00:35:15,480
generation you've out crossed it you

912
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:18,028
have done some work with it let's talk

913
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:21,150
about really working a strain as a

914
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:23,760
breeder to get sought-after desirable

915
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:27,180
traits as a breeder it is important to

916
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,240
start with a goal sometimes that goal is

917
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:32,278
a couple of traits in a specific plant

918
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:35,399
that we are really trying to narrow down

919
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:37,199
we may have two plants do we see great

920
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,119
potential in and we want to breed them

921
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,669
together

922
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:43,429
but we may not be able to get there by

923
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:46,010
making an f1 or what is more properly

924
00:35:43,429 --> 00:35:48,259
labeled a Poli hybrid the first time we

925
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:52,400
breed that together our phenotypes are

926
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:55,730
going to vary widely 25% will probably

927
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,400
look like the mom 25% will probably look

928
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:01,070
like the dad and the other 50% are going

929
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,230
to be make smashes in between depending

930
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:04,640
on what your goal was you may have hit

931
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:07,550
your goal on this first round of

932
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:10,009
breeding but if we want more reliable

933
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:13,130
seeds there's a better way to go about

934
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:15,530
this but it takes much more work let's

935
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:17,570
talk about it let's say that my new goal

936
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:19,820
is to cross these two plants I just got

937
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:21,710
and I want to get the potency of this

938
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,289
plant and the flavor of this plant into

939
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:26,240
one solid hybrid and I want to put that

940
00:36:24,289 --> 00:36:27,920
to market so that you guys can purchase

941
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,439
it and you can grow it and you can be

942
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,200
completely satisfied with your results

943
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,150
the easy and quick way to doing this is

944
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:37,489
to get a male of one of those strains

945
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:40,460
and another female of the opposite

946
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:44,029
strain and pollinate and now you've made

947
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:46,639
seeds now 25% of that progeny is going

948
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:48,890
to look like the mother 25% of the

949
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:52,339
progeny will look like the father the

950
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:53,779
other 50% are going to be variations of

951
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,220
the mom and dad and different

952
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,769
combinations of possibly the

953
00:36:55,219 --> 00:37:00,199
grandparents and the mom and dad now if

954
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:03,079
I am okay with that my project can be

955
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:05,239
done or I can take it further if I

956
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,219
really want to lock in the potency from

957
00:37:05,239 --> 00:37:10,129
that one strain and the flavor of the

958
00:37:07,219 --> 00:37:12,709
other strain and have reliable offspring

959
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:15,559
I need to work this further now I could

960
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,539
continue just to work the F generations

961
00:37:15,559 --> 00:37:19,579
down the line and hope that I get that

962
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:22,099
potency and that flavor that I'm really

963
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:25,250
looking for and that is just working the

964
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:26,750
f1 and then finding an f1 male and an f1

965
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:28,340
female that look like they're gonna do

966
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,989
what I need done and breathe them

967
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:32,900
together and continue down that path

968
00:37:29,989 --> 00:37:35,229
working for both of those traits another

969
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,360
way to do this would be to work two

970
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:41,360
separate lines of the same project and

971
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,820
focus on the potency in one line and the

972
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:46,640
flavor on the other line so we'll say

973
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:48,890
that line a is the potency and line B is

974
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,420
the flavor but it's the same strain we

975
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:50,889
have still crossed the two parents

976
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:53,470
X

977
00:37:50,889 --> 00:37:55,989
I have selected different offspring and

978
00:37:53,469 --> 00:37:58,629
I'm focusing on different traits in two

979
00:37:55,989 --> 00:38:01,000
completely different breeding projects

980
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:03,309
now depending on how much space how much

981
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,920
time how many plants I can dedicate to

982
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:08,710
this I may be able to do both of these

983
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:11,019
projects simultaneously and fast-track

984
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:13,480
this whole project unfortunately I am

985
00:38:11,018 --> 00:38:16,000
limited by plant counts and space and

986
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,068
time so I may have to run the a line as

987
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,588
one project I can breed that to my

988
00:38:18,068 --> 00:38:22,630
desired uniformity then I can work on

989
00:38:20,588 --> 00:38:24,518
the B line breed that to my desired

990
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:26,440
uniformity then we'll talk about the

991
00:38:24,518 --> 00:38:29,288
next step after that but what I would be

992
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:31,269
doing is I would take the line a I'm

993
00:38:29,289 --> 00:38:32,740
looking for potency over here I'd forgot

994
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:35,709
what I aimed a lion a s but we're gonna

995
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:37,808
say a is potency I would breed f1 I

996
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,670
would find the most potent phenotype out

997
00:38:37,809 --> 00:38:43,028
of there I could find then I would breed

998
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:45,338
that to an f2 then I would find the most

999
00:38:43,028 --> 00:38:47,108
potent phenotype I could find I wouldn't

1000
00:38:45,338 --> 00:38:49,088
worry about the aroma I wouldn't worry

1001
00:38:47,108 --> 00:38:50,469
too much about the structure I wouldn't

1002
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,298
be paying too many attention to the

1003
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:54,068
other details I would only have maybe

1004
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:56,139
one or two things I'm really focused on

1005
00:38:54,068 --> 00:38:58,298
the aroma and probably shape and

1006
00:38:56,139 --> 00:39:00,009
structure or what I'm after on this side

1007
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:02,949
and then I'm gonna breed that all the

1008
00:39:00,009 --> 00:39:04,630
way to like f3 f4 maybe five or six

1009
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:06,639
depending on how long it takes me to

1010
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:10,329
lock in those traits that I'm looking

1011
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:12,608
for I want 75 to 80% of my seeds that I

1012
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:13,509
sprout to come out looking just like

1013
00:39:12,608 --> 00:39:15,909
what I'm after

1014
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:18,429
I need that uniformity once I get there

1015
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:20,889
I'll put that project on hold I'll get a

1016
00:39:18,429 --> 00:39:22,659
bunch of those f5 or f6 seeds and I

1017
00:39:20,889 --> 00:39:24,190
stash them they're on hold they're

1018
00:39:22,659 --> 00:39:26,500
waiting we'll talk about those in a

1019
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:29,019
minute I'll go over here and now we're

1020
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,028
gonna work wine be on line B I am only

1021
00:39:29,018 --> 00:39:33,518
working for that flavor I was searching

1022
00:39:31,028 --> 00:39:36,009
for if I'm looking for today we're just

1023
00:39:33,518 --> 00:39:38,288
gonna say strawberry bubblegum if that's

1024
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:39,909
the flavor I'm seeking any phenotype

1025
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:42,430
that doesn't have that strawberry

1026
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:44,078
bubblegum dominance it's getting cold we

1027
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:46,298
aren't working with it so I'm going to

1028
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,548
find the most strawberry bubblegum

1029
00:39:46,298 --> 00:39:51,429
dominant phenotype I can find I'm gonna

1030
00:39:48,548 --> 00:39:53,949
breed that to an f2 then in that f2

1031
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:56,318
batch find the most strawberry bubblegum

1032
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:58,750
dominant phenotype I can find breed that

1033
00:39:56,318 --> 00:40:02,949
to f3 and keep going until I get

1034
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:04,750
absolute uniformity around f5 f6 however

1035
00:40:02,949 --> 00:40:07,029
far it takes me to get the uniform

1036
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:09,340
I'm looking for then I've got what I

1037
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:12,490
have considered my a line and my B line

1038
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,710
I've got new cross which is super potent

1039
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:16,959
line a and new cross which is super

1040
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:19,059
flavourful line B they're the same cross

1041
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,670
but they've been bred selectively bred

1042
00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:23,500
for different traits some breeders will

1043
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:25,450
release the F ones of those on both

1044
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,110
sides some breeders may release the F

1045
00:40:25,449 --> 00:40:28,149
twos

1046
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,530
some breeders may release one line of

1047
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,840
that and not even let you know that

1048
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:34,930
there's a beeline but in breeding it is

1049
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:38,200
not uncommon to run an A and a B line

1050
00:40:34,929 --> 00:40:41,109
and focus on one or two desirable traits

1051
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:43,989
on both of those lines then here's where

1052
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:47,019
the magic happens we find a phenotype

1053
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:49,299
from line a that holds that potency we

1054
00:40:47,019 --> 00:40:51,849
are looking for then we find a phenotype

1055
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,400
from lion B that holds that flavor we're

1056
00:40:51,849 --> 00:40:57,219
looking for and we breed those f5 or

1057
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,300
those f6 is together and it makes a

1058
00:40:57,219 --> 00:41:04,419
brand new real f1 hybrid that is no

1059
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:07,420
longer a poly hybrid that is a true bred

1060
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:09,010
solid f1 hybrid so I feel like we have

1061
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,809
gone full circle I kind of got lost

1062
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,220
earlier on a ramble about poly hybrids

1063
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:13,420
but there we go I brought it back I feel

1064
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,519
like I wrap that one up with a nice

1065
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,409
little bow for you so that was the long

1066
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,509
rant about the difference in the a line

1067
00:41:17,409 --> 00:41:21,609
and the B line and why sometimes we see

1068
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:23,680
a lines and B lines it is just different

1069
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:25,870
breeding for different traits and then

1070
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:28,539
in the end we combine the a and the B to

1071
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:31,210
create that super hybrid that brand-new

1072
00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:33,190
f1 that has the desirable traits that

1073
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,110
are locked in then if you want to be a

1074
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:37,000
real nerd you can start f2e

1075
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:39,220
that and you can lock in traits even

1076
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,230
further breeding gets fun breeding gets

1077
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:42,909
addictive I've got one more type of

1078
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,440
breeding written down that I really want

1079
00:41:42,909 --> 00:41:46,899
to talk about before I start wrapping up

1080
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:50,079
this episode this one is kind of the

1081
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,630
total opposite of working with an A in a

1082
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,719
bee line or some sort of selection this

1083
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:58,030
is what is called open pollination open

1084
00:41:55,719 --> 00:42:00,639
pollination is basically a big ole plant

1085
00:41:58,030 --> 00:42:03,130
orgy that is when you put multiple males

1086
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:05,589
and multiple females in a room and just

1087
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:07,630
let the pollen fly so you make it

1088
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:10,690
females that have been pollinated by

1089
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:13,210
this male and this male so one female

1090
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:15,429
plant will contain several different

1091
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:18,579
crosses this gives you an opportunity

1092
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:20,349
for a lot of different phenotypes

1093
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:22,539
open pollination can be done with all

1094
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:25,480
the same strain or open pollination can

1095
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:27,070
be done by mixing strains the reason it

1096
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:30,070
would be done with all of the same

1097
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:33,730
strain is to find diversity in your

1098
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:36,130
progeny imagine if I put two males of a

1099
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,289
rise and four females of a rise all

1100
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:40,630
different phenotypes in the room and I

1101
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:42,639
just let those two males pollinate all

1102
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,680
four of those females we're going to

1103
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,480
have a lot of different combinations of

1104
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:48,909
offspring which will give me a lot of

1105
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,849
opportunity to find a lot of great

1106
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:54,849
winners to breed with in the future so

1107
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:56,889
if I put to arise males and four arise

1108
00:42:54,849 --> 00:42:59,049
females in a room and I did a

1109
00:42:56,889 --> 00:43:01,659
pollination that would be known as in a

1110
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:03,519
rise open pollination now if they were

1111
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:06,429
all F ones I put in there there would be

1112
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:08,019
in a rise F two open pollination and it

1113
00:43:06,429 --> 00:43:09,909
would be polite on the packaging or

1114
00:43:08,019 --> 00:43:12,730
somewhere in the description to say hey

1115
00:43:09,909 --> 00:43:14,679
I used to arise males and I pollinated

1116
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:16,360
for females and these are some of the

1117
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:18,669
seeds that came from all of that batch

1118
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,860
that's an open pollination and that is

1119
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:22,329
very acceptable and again the reason

1120
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,059
that is great is because it will create

1121
00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:26,619
a lot of really interesting phenotypes

1122
00:43:25,059 --> 00:43:29,440
who will really open up the gene pool

1123
00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:31,389
and give you a lot of diversity now some

1124
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,700
people will do an open pollination by

1125
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:36,849
putting one or two different males in

1126
00:43:33,699 --> 00:43:38,919
with multiple different females this is

1127
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:40,989
not ideal to me because I'm really picky

1128
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,700
and I like to know what everything was

1129
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:44,559
pollinated with but if you're just

1130
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:46,089
trying to create seeds to play with for

1131
00:43:44,559 --> 00:43:47,769
the future and you're not too worried

1132
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:49,900
about genetics about heritage about

1133
00:43:47,769 --> 00:43:53,559
pedigree that will work you will also

1134
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:55,090
find a lot of great phenotypes again the

1135
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:56,590
only thing I don't like about that is we

1136
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,990
don't know what they are but to some

1137
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,730
people that is not important at all they

1138
00:43:58,989 --> 00:44:02,139
just want to grow good weed there are
