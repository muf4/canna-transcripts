dot-com you know I like to start this

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,250
podcast off by talking about what I'm

23
00:00:50,429 --> 00:00:56,519
smoking today I've been taking dabs of

24
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:59,219
garlic Grove live batter from Green Dot

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,309
labs this is a blend of GMO cookies and

26
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:05,099
Loa f2 on the package the flavor is

27
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:07,829
described as General Tso's garlic and

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,199
orange soda I think I really agree with

29
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:12,209
that flavor description there is not a

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,978
potency label on the back of this

31
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:16,079
package for some reason that sticker did

32
00:01:13,978 --> 00:01:17,969
not get put on here it does not need

33
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:20,069
that sticker what it should have is a

34
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,170
fist there should just be a logo with a

35
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:24,779
fist right there because this was the

36
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,019
most pleasant punch to the face I have

37
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,478
had in a long time when I dabbed this I

38
00:01:28,019 --> 00:01:33,359
was immediately punched with this orange

39
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,938
flavor this orange zestiness hit my face

40
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,459
overwhelmed my mouth then as I exhale

41
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:40,618
that is when the garlic really kicks in

42
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:41,879
it's garlic and orange that's why I get

43
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:44,219
why they're call why they're calling it

44
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:46,408
General Tso's it is really garlic and

45
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:48,328
orange e on the exhale then that garlic

46
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:50,100
and a little bit of funk just hangs out

47
00:01:48,328 --> 00:01:52,078
on your tongue on my tongue at least for

48
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:52,319
a couple of minutes and I really enjoy

49
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,389
it

50
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:56,819
I'm obviously super heavily medicated

51
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,340
from the garlic Grove to be quite honest

52
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,169
with you this is not the first take that

53
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,790
I have tried to do this intro to be

54
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,009
quite honest with you I set up all my

55
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,990
recording gear I had my headphones on I

56
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,699
took a DAB I thought I was gonna record

57
00:02:06,989 --> 00:02:10,799
and I found myself on the couch

58
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:12,539
scrolling through social media trying to

59
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,890
get my [ __ ] together so this is a

60

your support all right now I think it is

110
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:06,420
time to move into the question and email

111
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,879
portion of the show the first question

112
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,708
I've got lined up for today's episode

113
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,180
actually came from YouTube I'm looking

114
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,390
for the screenshot on my phone I

115
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,228
generally do not take questions from

116
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,639
YouTube

117
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,099
I prefer to get the questions off of

118
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,139
patreon or email of course patreon is

119
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,270
the first option that's where I go for

120
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,339
questions if I get all those questions

121
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:27,629
caught up then I go to the email but

122
00:04:26,339 --> 00:04:29,579
sometimes I

123
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,409
good questions on the YouTube I'm not

124
00:04:29,579 --> 00:04:33,959
necessarily looking for them but I found

125
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,580
a good comment there and this one has

126
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:36,930
been coming up on social media quite a

127
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:39,359
bit so I thought I would address this

128
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,819
one it says Rasta Jeff can you tell from

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,600
looking at a seed and see if it is male

130
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:48,420
or female I know that people are passing

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,060
around a chart on social media it shows

132
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,830
that if there is a volcano shape at the

133
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,500
end of part of the seed or if there's a

134
00:04:52,829 --> 00:04:57,180
dimple or a nipple shape or a bottlenose

135
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,009
dolphin shape on part of the seed that

136
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,740
it's a female if it's got another shape

137
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,959
it's a male that is total [ __ ] if

138
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:05,610
that was accurate sea breeders would be

139
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,289
fishing through every scene with the

140
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:09,090
magnifying glass and we would pull out

141
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,620
all the seeds that we wanted and give

142
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,849
you all the seeds we didn't want I

143
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,430
wouldn't do that but that would be a

144
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:18,300
thing that happened nobody can tell a

145
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,740
seeds sex by looking at the seed if

146
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,329
you're going by that chart that you see

147
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:24,870
on social media you're going to be

148
00:05:21,329 --> 00:05:27,449
poorly sadly sorely disappointed don't

149
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,519
do that I do not believe in that chart I

150
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:31,680
don't know any other breeders or growers

151
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:35,009
that believe in that that rely on that

152
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,740
so no I do not believe you can tell a

153
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,779
sex of a seed just by looking at the

154
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,879
seed thanks for the great YouTube

your heart all right let's keep moving

168
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:11,189
the next message came on the email this

169
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:13,709
one came from the this one's actually

170
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:16,350
from the I read genetics email and this

171
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:18,089
is an update and/or a correction and it

172
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,550
says hey brother I wanted to ask about

173
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:22,560
your comments on bTW so in a previous

174
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:25,379
episode I talked a Bennet talked about a

175
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,720
beneficial bacteria I called it bacillus

176
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:29,519
thuringiensis I think I'm saying that

177
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,320
correctly if not I'm saying it close

178
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,909
enough I've never really had to say it

179
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,589
out loud I've only read it on packages

180
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:36,360
and in books it's not a word you throw

181
00:06:34,589 --> 00:06:38,099
out in conversation I think I'm saying

182
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,139
it right if not correct me

183
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,540
I don't mind Corrections in fact we've

184
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,089
got one right here so

185
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,939
says I think BT treatments are actually

186
00:06:44,089 --> 00:06:49,579
BTK which killed Caterpillar type

187
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,800
critters then it goes on to say for

188
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:54,409
fungus gnats I think your listeners

189
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,150
should try using BTI so I've been

190
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:59,720
educated today that there are different

191
00:06:56,149 --> 00:07:02,750
strains of bacillus thuringiensis is how

192
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:07,040
I think it said bacteria there's a bt k

193
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:11,269
and a bt i i can pronounce the BTK it is

194
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:15,860
the K stands for curse tacky and the I

195
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:17,509
is Israel insists Israel insists it's

196
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,080
close enough you guys we're learning in

197
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:20,689
public today

198
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:23,569
um just all about sounding it out but

199
00:07:20,689 --> 00:07:26,120
there are two different bacillus BT

200
00:07:23,569 --> 00:07:28,939
bacterias and I did not realize this so

201
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,100
one is better for Caterpillar type

202
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:33,439
critters and the other one is better for

203
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:37,070
fungus gnats so that'll make it easier

204
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,990
to shop for a more pest specific product

205
00:07:37,069 --> 00:07:41,120
if we are applying the right pesticide

206
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,189
we will have more success getting rid of

207
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,780
the pests and we will do less damage to

208
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:46,879
the plant because some of the pesticides

209
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:48,859
and soaks and sprays they do cause

210
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,689
slight problems and irritations to the

211
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,250
plants although they get rid of the bugs

212
00:07:50,689 --> 00:07:53,660
sometimes they piss the plants off a

213
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:54,920
little bit if we don't have to apply

214
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,900
something or if we're applying something

215
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:58,670
that's unnecessary or the wrong thing

216
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,409
we're causing more problems than we're

217
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:03,140
doing good so if we can dial in the

218
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,210
absolute perfect correct pesticide we

219
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:07,039
can eradicate our problems and not cause

220
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:08,899
any extra stress on the plants that's

221
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,480
what I'm rambling toward at this point

222
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:12,949
um so it says I hope that makes sense

223
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:15,259
and you definitely have more knowledge

224
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:16,969
than me so I just wanted to ask you to

225
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:18,920
make sure hey you sound like you were

226
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:21,290
well educated on this subject so I am

227
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,449
ready to learn from you as well don't

228
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:26,240
feel like I am better than you smarter

229
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:28,039
than you I've been growing more maybe

230
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,780
longer I don't know but I've just got

231
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,280
experience and I've got a big mouth so

232
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:32,959
I've got a show that doesn't mean you

233
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,939
can't teach me something I've got to

234
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,340
keep learning constantly that's how I

235
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:38,510
stay on top that's how I stay ahead how

236
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:40,280
I stay active it's how I stay

237
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:42,500
entertained I wasn't learning I would

238
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,909
just lose my mind imagine this brain not

239
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:46,759
absorbing knowledge and doing something

240
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,649
with it oh that's scary so thank you for

241
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:50,689
educating me and then it wraps up with

242
00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,389
stay Irie brother then they signed it

243
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,400
with baked Baker on cannabis so if

244
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:55,970
you're not already on cannabis join up

245
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:57,769

cannabis and of course please give me a

249
00:09:02,328 --> 00:09:07,789
follow - I'm Irie underscore genetics on

250
00:09:05,028 --> 00:09:09,679
cannabis hey baked Baker thank you for

251
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:11,629
the great message I called this one an

252
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:14,328
update in a correction you guys there

253
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:16,250
are more than one strain of bt

254
00:09:14,328 --> 00:09:18,739
beneficial bacteria there's the BTK

255
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,169
which is better for caterpillars and

256
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,879
there's the BTI which is better for

257
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:26,208
fungus gnats so we all learned something

258
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,100
today big shout out big thank you all

259
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,778
right I want to keep it moving because I

260
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,519
do have a couple of more emails and I

261
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:33,169
don't want to run out of time I don't

262
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,120
want my throat to burn out too quickly

263
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:37,338
you guys know that if I talk too long I

264
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,818
will run out of my voice so let's keep

265
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:40,730
going

266
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:42,378
this one says hey Rasta Jeff thank you

267
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:44,720
for answering my question on the podcast

268
00:09:42,379 --> 00:09:46,579
regarding carbon filter so I'm sure you

269
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,310
guys remember a few episodes back I

270
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:51,318
spoke about carbon filters it says that

271
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:53,208
was cool for some reason I heard that in

272
00:09:51,318 --> 00:09:53,628
a beavis and butthead voice that was

273
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,119
cool

274
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:58,519
ah then it goes real quick one of my em

275
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,649
dog plants has sprouted a pollen sack

276
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:03,019
and germinated I think you say me mean

277
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,750
pollinated some buds on the lower branch

278
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:08,028
near the stem so you've got an EM dog

279
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,100
plant it sprouted a pollen sack so I

280
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:12,019
think it is gone hermaphrodite on you

281
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,839
it's shown us some intersex traits and

282
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,629
it is spread pollen so it's pollinated

283
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:20,930
some buds on the lower branch near the

284
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:23,449
stem the top buds seemed fine I've run

285
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:26,599
this girl many times with no herm issues

286
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:29,000
um my first question is why did it herm

287
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,589
this time then do you know why it harmed

288
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,629
on you this time did I have a light leak

289
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,639
did you overfeed it did you stress it

290
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:36,079
did he get too hot what's the issue they

291
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,329
caused it to her that's the first thing

292
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:41,028
I want to know ah then it goes on to say

293
00:10:38,328 --> 00:10:43,159
question is should I top it in case

294
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:44,808
another one sprouts of pollen sacks oh

295
00:10:43,159 --> 00:10:46,338
you should Utah should you chop this

296
00:10:44,808 --> 00:10:48,528
plant down in case it sprouts another

297
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,790
pond sack you're worried um that's a

298
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:52,250
good question or do you think I could

299
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:53,419
let her finish with no problems it's

300
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:55,688
kind of late for that you've already got

301
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,688
problems

302
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,360
how do I feel about that it depends on

303
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,309
how big the plant is do you need it do

304
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,830
you need that that finished product that

305
00:11:02,309 --> 00:11:06,539
seeded finished product or can you live

306
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,070
without it is it gonna hurt your budget

307
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:10,169
budget is it gonna hurt your medicine

308
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,510
supply is it gonna hurt your stash

309
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:14,549
it's a risky plant it's a problematic

310
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:16,230
plant but is it worth the reward

311
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:18,750
that's when you've gotta weigh the risk

312
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,190
reward the problem - the payoff is it

313
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,559
worth the [ __ ] that it's gonna give

314
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,590
you it's kind of late in already so

315
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,119
you're worried about uh trying to finish

316
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,620
it without problems broad already

317
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,950
pollinated your crop I'm not sure what

318
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:34,230
the rest of your problems could be um

319
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,970
then you say that it in the previous

320
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:37,620
part you said that it pollinated the

321
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,170
lower parts and you don't think the tops

322
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,360
got it I hate to burst your bubble buddy

323
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:44,669
but a lot of times when you see a couple

324
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,279
of seeds that means there are a lot of

325
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:50,159
seeds you do not see as a breeder I know

326
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,899
that the outside seeds are just the tip

327
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:54,000
of the iceberg so to speak and once you

328
00:11:51,899 --> 00:11:56,279
break open those buds there's [ __ ]

329
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,539
seeds in there so you may have a lot

330
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:59,429
more seeds than what you're thinking

331
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:01,289
you've got you want to know if you

332
00:11:59,429 --> 00:12:06,139
should chop it in case it gets more

333
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:07,429
pollen sacks um in

334
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:10,009
they may do that it could make more

335
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:11,870
pollen but is it too late to pollinate

336
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,939
the rest of the room are the plants that

337
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:16,310
are in the room already past their

338
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,170
pollination point have the UH the

339
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,750
pistols that they curled up or the hares

340
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:22,969
are they brown and nasty looking at that

341
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,159
point they're past peak pollination I'm

342
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,589
not sure how far into flower you are

343
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:30,199
wait we can find out because it says I

344
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:32,990
have about ten more days to hit eight

345
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:34,910
weeks so that means you're seven more

346
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,070
days three you're in week the end of

347
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:39,708
week six now you're at a really critical

348
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:42,500
part here um you're gonna have a lot of

349
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:44,539
seeds and the seeds that you made are

350
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,070
probably gonna also and they could

351
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:47,360
possibly be hermaphroditic you could

352
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,110
have some gems in there but that's not

353
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,850
what you're worried about

354
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,769
um you're wondering if you should cut it

355
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:54,680
down you're a week six by the time I

356
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:56,389
read this um you've probably gotten

357
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:58,578
close to the end of harvest right now

358
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:00,649
but I would almost just cut that [ __ ]

359
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:02,359
down cuz it's stressful and make sure it

360
00:13:00,649 --> 00:13:04,519
doesn't cause me more problems but also

361
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:06,589
keep in mind there are probably a lot of

362
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,360
seeds happening in your crop so it says

363
00:13:06,589 --> 00:13:10,190
I'd be happy with one more week or do

364
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,110
you think it's a gamble and just chop

365
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:17,180
her now um do you have a perpetual grow

366
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,639
going if all of your plants are at the

367
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:21,349
same cycle the ones right around this

368
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,179
plant are gonna have some pollen are

369
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,269
some seeds in there hopefully the rest

370
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:29,239
of them aren't to seeded but if you've

371
00:13:26,269 --> 00:13:30,528
got more plants in a earlier stage and

372
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,480
you've got more plants that are coming

373
00:13:30,528 --> 00:13:34,639
in and staggering you do have the

374
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,980
opportunity to keep pollinating your

375
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,139
future crops so if you've got more [ __ ]

376
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,600
going on I would get rid of it because

377
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:42,649
you're just gonna continue the problem

378
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,170
the plants that are in there have

379
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:46,639
probably already been pollinated or are

380
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:48,679
past their peak

381
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,539
pollination point they're past ovulation

382
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:53,028
they probably can't take pollen any

383
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:55,819
further at this point but you're at like

384
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:57,379
week six week seven so I'm not sure what

385
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,379
they look like maybe they can receive

386
00:13:57,379 --> 00:14:02,028
pollen right now I would cut this plant

387
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:03,860
down I would think about what caused it

388
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:06,289
to hermaphrodite why did it flip on you

389
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:07,519
what it's probably something you caused

390
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:08,990
I don't want to point a finger I don't

391
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,299
want to blame you but you say it ran

392
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:13,698
fine a couple of times now it's hurting

393
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:15,198
on you what did you do was there a light

394
00:14:13,698 --> 00:14:17,149
leak was there an issue like I said

395
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:18,870
earlier did you overfeed it we need to

396
00:14:17,149 --> 00:14:20,490
figure out what caused the herm

397
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,289
then you need to think about do you want

398
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:24,389
to risk this same problem in the next

399
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:26,399
grow we know this plant is problematic

400
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:27,778
like this dog bites do you want to keep

401
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,129
putting it on a [ __ ] leash and taking

402
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:31,799
it to the dog park and having to pull it

403
00:14:29,129 --> 00:14:33,509
off other dogs I don't think so I would

404
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,189
[ __ ] get rid of it dude that's what I

405
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:37,080
would do I would just chop it right now

406
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,460
I've got a very different approach to

407
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,310
gardening than a lot of people I also

408
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,629
have access to a lot of genetics when I

409
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:44,129
cut this one down I get to grow

410
00:14:42,629 --> 00:14:45,870
something else in its place something

411
00:14:44,129 --> 00:14:47,850
that is not a hermaphrodite something

412
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,589
that does not give me problems something

413
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,210
I don't want to kick if this plant

414
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:53,220
accidentally pollinated my crop only

415
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,509
kick it I'm mad at it so it would be

416
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,600
gone it would already be in a [ __ ]

417
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:59,309
trashcan if this were me so it depends

418
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,899
on how much you love this plant how much

419
00:14:59,309 --> 00:15:02,519
you need the medicine off of this plant

420
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,769
and how much you want to give yourself a

421
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,269
headache I think I decided halfway

422
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:07,710
through reading this that cut that

423
00:15:06,269 --> 00:15:09,149
[ __ ] thing down get rid of it stop

424
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:10,620
fighting yourself and set yourself up

425
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:12,600
for success that's what I want to say

426
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:14,190
that's the answer that I would go with

427
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,710
but I don't know how bad you need the

428
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:19,290
medicine or the product so um that is my

429
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:20,610
advice cut it down cut your losses quit

430
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:22,289
[ __ ] up the rest of the grow with the

431
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,709
problematic plant and replace it with

432
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:27,509
something that is not problematic all

433
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,729
right let's see if you put your name in

434
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:31,799
there you did not say your name so you

435
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:33,629
know who you are man ah thank you for

436
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:35,639
the great message and let me know how

437
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:37,500
this goes send me a follow-up and I will

438
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,389
read it on the show I want to know what

439
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,389
you chose to do and how the outcome came

440
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:43,679
and how many seeds did you get and what

441
00:15:42,389 --> 00:15:45,600
are you gonna do with the seeds please

442
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,699
don't share these seeds until you've

443
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,899
grown them yourself until you know if

444
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,759
they're problematic or if they're

445
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:53,069
amazing you know what I'm talking about

446
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:54,990
don't share crappy seeds and since they

447
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,278
came from a crappy plant I'm not calling

448
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,230
your plant crappy but it hummed on you

449
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:59,659
that's crappy since they came from a

450
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,089
questionable crappy plant they're

451
00:15:59,659 --> 00:16:04,829
questionable crappy seeds in my mind I

452
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:06,959
think I covered all the notes I wrote on

453
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:09,120
that one why did it herm figure that out

454
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,159
probably a lightly probably over feet it

455
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,620
they're probably more seeds than you

456
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:16,708
think it may keep making pollen it could

457
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,179
pop up more pollen sacks um but it could

458
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:20,039
be too late to pollinate the rest of the

459
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:21,750
room if you've got a perpetual cycle

460
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:24,299
going on the rest of its gonna just keep

461
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:26,129
getting pollinated um I would call that

462
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:28,109
[ __ ] and get rid of it alright that

463
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:31,200
wraps it up thank you for that one let's

464
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:32,639
move forward to another email this one

465
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,710
starts off with good

466
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,330
morning good evening it is definitely

467
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:38,490
not morning time here I hope you're

468
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,970
smoking a fat bull whatever time it is

469
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,980
wherever you are it goes on to say funny

470
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:46,200
story I came down to write you an email

471
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,550
and noticed the new podcast I love that

472
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,379
when people go to write me a message or

473
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:50,819
send me a tweet or something and there's

474
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:53,039
a brand new episode for them to check

475
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,920
out always puts a smile on people's face

476
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,569
it goes on to say I just so happened it

477
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,669
just so happened you answered my last

478
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:01,230
question oh oh that's [ __ ] awesome

479
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:02,789
you went to write me a message and as

480
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,890
you were writing it I answered your last

481
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:06,420
question I love stuff like that

482
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:08,850
synchronicities you guys there is no

483
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,680
that that stuff's supposed to happen it

484
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:12,779
goes on to say I had a small chuckle at

485
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:15,180
the way things work sometimes yes me too

486
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:16,980
my friend one thing I will clarify about

487
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,740
the last email when I was talking about

488
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,400
ro and calcium buildup I meant ro water

489
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,930
in humidifiers oh yeah it says I know if

490
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,850
you put tap water in them they will

491
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:29,190
start to build white powder on the walls

492
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:32,009
from the calcium in the water or so that

493
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:33,509
is what I had read not only will it

494
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,400
start to build up calcium on the walls

495
00:17:33,509 --> 00:17:37,410
possibly but you will ruin the filters

496
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,750
the filters will get clogged up with the

497
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:44,840
calcium quite quickly so it goes on to

498
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,839
say where were we where were we aha

499
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,309
okay the cutting out of the root ball

500
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,319
and living soil was Borah long the lines

501
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:54,289
of what I was looking into and actually

502
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:56,089
found a way with these rapid stack pots

503
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:58,369
so apparently there was another part of

504
00:17:56,089 --> 00:17:59,899
the question about living soil but here

505
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:02,539
is the part that we need to address on

506
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,509
today's episode it says anyway here is

507
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:06,829
my problem venting from my ceiling into

508
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:09,140
my basement

509
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:11,149
unfortunately the excess heat has caused

510
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:13,009
my house to heat up too much yes

511
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,900
sometimes those grow lights will heat up

512
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,940
the house quite a bit it says I have

513
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:19,130
attempted to move it around within the

514
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:21,400
same circuit and use my dryer exhaust

515
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:24,140
but then it started to blow breakers

516
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,690
that puts off so many things I want to

517
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:27,830
talk about in my head um if you're

518
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,630
flipping breakers you are definitely

519
00:18:27,829 --> 00:18:31,069
putting your house in danger you're

520
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,540
putting everybody in risk be careful

521
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:34,369
doing that I shouldn't have to preach

522
00:18:32,539 --> 00:18:35,899
too much about that what's happening is

523
00:18:34,369 --> 00:18:37,789
the breaker is heating up so much that

524
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:39,440
it goes huh I gotta quit running because

525
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,639
I'm pulling way too much electricity and

526
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,830
this could cause a problem so the

527
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,690
breaker flips but every time that

528
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:46,849
happens the wires are heating up hot

529
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,170
enough to flip that breaker eventually

530
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:50,659
the coating on the outside of the wires

531
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,660
the polyurethane stuff will melt two

532
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:55,220
wires will touch you'll have a fire um

533
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,509
that'll take a while but eventually that

534
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,950
sure will happen I don't know how old

535
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,539
your house is I don't know what kind of

536
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,490
wiring you have if you've got old wiring

537
00:18:59,539 --> 00:19:03,529
in a really old house you've got a much

538
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:05,480
more potential for starting a fire if

539
00:19:03,529 --> 00:19:07,460
you got a new house still run a risk but

540
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,110
it's not as bad so be careful if you're

541
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,490
flipping breakers another thing that

542
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:12,799
comes to mind is you said you tried to

543
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:15,349
run it through the dryer exhaust which

544
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,049
makes me think you were tying in your

545
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:20,689
Gro exhaust into the dryer vent exhaust

546
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:22,759
that's not a good idea either it doesn't

547
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:26,029
sound like a big deal but never really

548
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:28,220
modify the exhaust system in a home

549
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:30,379
whether it comes to the dryer exhaust or

550
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,900
the HVAC system those systems were

551
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,550
designed very specifically for the flow

552
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,800
of the house and the heating and cooling

553
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:38,899
equipment if you go tying in another

554
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,730
duct that was not planned for you're

555
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,830
going to create opportunities for

556
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,690
backflow air they shouldn't go a certain

557
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:46,699
way should have never gone a certain way

558
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,860
will now go a certain way you'll disrupt

559
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:51,769
the airflow of everything you've either

560
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:54,109
got the opportunity of blowing the warm

561
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:56,420
air from your grow into cool spaces or

562
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:58,699
blowing the cool air into warm spaces

563
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:59,870
it's gonna go the wrong way because it's

564
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,630
not how it was meant

565
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:04,339
to go also ah you'll end up with dryer

566
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,760
lint in your grow if that [ __ ] goes

567
00:20:04,339 --> 00:20:06,470
wrong

568
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,849
nobody wants a dryer lint in the grow

569
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,600
you don't want to be picking that [ __ ]

570
00:20:07,849 --> 00:20:10,189
out of your buds

571
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:13,129
I don't know that that'll really happen

572
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,570
but don't tie those in and don't [ __ ] up

573
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:17,360
the electricity you gotta be safer than

574
00:20:14,569 --> 00:20:20,480
that so let's keep going where are we I

575
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:22,819
also now can use my I also now cannot

576
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,880
use my dehumidifier as that pumped out

577
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:27,439
too much heat um and you're cranking up

578
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,210
a lot of heat in a little space it says

579
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,820
so now my room is running at 28 degrees

580
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:35,779
Celsius and 45% relative humidity

581
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:38,089
daytime and nighttime is about 23 or 24

582
00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:40,940
degrees Celsius with about 52 percent

583
00:20:38,089 --> 00:20:42,859
relative humidity so you're not dropping

584
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,759
too much for your night temperature but

585
00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:45,169
you're getting a little bit more

586
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:49,160
humidity and they're not extreme it's

587
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:50,929
gonna be okay um you're gonna have to

588
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,120
remove the heat you have to ducted a

589
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:54,470
different way I would duct it outside or

590
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,269
add an air conditioner you're either

591
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:57,920
gonna have to move that duct did you

592
00:20:56,269 --> 00:21:00,289
tried to tie into the dryer you're gonna

593
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,550
have to run it outside somehow um I

594
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:02,839
don't know what your opportunity is do

595
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:04,129
you have a fireplace so we're gonna into

596
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:06,740
the fireplace and we'll go up the

597
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,720
fireplace and out the chimney or use a

598
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,308
window seal up the window put a hole in

599
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,569
a board or a piece of insulation or

600
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:13,399
however you can seal the window then

601
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:14,599
make a six or an eight inch hole we run

602
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,220
a blower out through there and make sure

603
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:18,230
to use a carbon filter but you're gonna

604
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,058
have to get rid of the heat or add an

605
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:22,250
air conditioner you're not just gonna be

606
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:23,869
able to blow heat around um you're just

607
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:25,819
gonna heat up the whole house I don't

608
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:27,259
know how big your house is I do know

609
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:29,178
that it's going to come up and tell me

610
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:31,220
how big the grow is so let's keep going

611
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:34,070
it says I've done a bit of reading on

612
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:36,230
co2 I know with extra co2 they can

613
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:38,169
handle higher heat so I believe this is

614
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,870
the route I'm going to have to take

615
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:43,370
before I read too much further I just

616
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:46,609
want to say that this is probably not

617
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:48,619
the best solution this is more like a

618
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,879
band-aid you're not really fixing the

619
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:51,859
heat problem you're just kind of

620
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,140
covering it up with something else that

621
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:58,159
cost more money and is an experiment you

622
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,770
don't want to rely on co2 bags those

623
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,330
little make your own co2 mushroom bags

624
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:06,679
and [ __ ] those aren't going to provide

625
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:08,119
enough co2 to supplement the to fix the

626
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:09,200
heat problem it's not gonna band-aid

627
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,599
that [ __ ] enough you're gonna have to

628
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,360
get the co2 bottles in a system and turn

629
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,029
it up a real high to get enough co2

630
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,709
there to mitigate that heat issue the

631
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:18,190
issue the solution is to correct the

632
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,740
heat

633
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:22,450
don't go create more problems and spend

634
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,250
more money on the wrong [ __ ] by just

635
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,740
buying a mask and a band-aid we want to

636
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,910
actually solve the problem or at least

637
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,230
that's what I would do you can do

638
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,880
whatever you want but I wouldn't I

639
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,099
wouldn't go that route um

640
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,490
then it says how much would I need for a

641
00:22:33,099 --> 00:22:38,048
four by four and a two by four tent that

642
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:40,660
kind of set off some weird bells in my

643
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:43,750
head how much light are you running in a

644
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:46,419
4x4 and a 2x4 that is heating up your

645
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,579
entire house I've got questions I would

646
00:22:46,419 --> 00:22:50,110
like to see your setup a little bit I

647
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:51,609
would like to see how you've got the

648
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:53,949
tent set up how you're running the

649
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:55,689
ducting where you're running it I want

650
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,000
to see what's going on I can give you a

651
00:22:55,690 --> 00:23:01,390
lot of guidance and advice that's a

652
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,039
really small area of grow space and you

653
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,990
shouldn't have an extreme amount of

654
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:07,149
light in there that the biggest in that

655
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:09,429
4x4 may be you've got a thousand which

656
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,540
is pushing it and in that 2x4 what do

657
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:13,380
you got in there like a four hundred

658
00:23:10,539 --> 00:23:15,668
maybe a six you shouldn't have

659
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:17,020
mm that's a lot of light for that little

660
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,759
bit of space you shouldn't have a whole

661
00:23:17,019 --> 00:23:20,619
lot of bang and light this shouldn't be

662
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:23,589
too hard to cool I'm sure with a little

663
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:24,849
bit of uh knowledge from an experienced

664
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:26,199
grower or someone who has set up a lot

665
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:29,379
of rooms I'm sure we could cool this

666
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:31,600
down quite a bit without doing the co2

667
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:33,640
idea then it says would it be better to

668
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,649
exhaust my flower tent into the lung

669
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:38,559
room or keep the whole thing and closed

670
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:41,019
um I don't think that the co2 is the way

671
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,789
to go but if you're gonna do co2 I'll

672
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:44,379
put the two tents in one room and fill

673
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:46,480
that whole room with co2 and just keep

674
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:48,910
the co2 moving or put the co2 straight

675
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,470
in the tents but it's gonna duct out of

676
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:52,090
there if you've got the tent in a room

677
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,529
so just do the hole you're gonna have to

678
00:23:52,089 --> 00:23:57,459
augment the entire room is what you'll

679
00:23:53,529 --> 00:23:59,200
have to do so um

680
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,180
yeah you're gonna have to I would reduce

681
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,100
the heat don't even do the co2 reduce

682
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,650
the heat work on removing the heat or

683
00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:08,500
adding an air-conditioner the co2 in my

684
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,280
opinion is a band-aid and if it gets a

685
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,539
little bit hotter

686
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,829
how many more band-aids are you gonna

687
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:14,200
put on there you can't just keep adding

688
00:24:11,829 --> 00:24:16,480
co2 the correct thing to do is to fix

689
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,700
the problem in my opinion you can keep

690
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,559
trying to battle the heat or you can get

691
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:22,809
the appropriate equipment to correct the

692
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,879
heat now it says that you're flipping

693
00:24:22,809 --> 00:24:26,829
breakers you're gonna have to be really

694
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,690
careful how much lighter you run it dude

695
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:30,250
I'm really confused and I'm not trying

696
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:31,120
to disrespect your grow that's a four by

697
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,490
four and a two by four

698
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,049
you can't have too many watts going on

699
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:37,000
in there so I'm really curious please

700
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,619
send me an update let me know what's

701
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,150
going on in this grow so I can give you

702
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:41,500
more guidance more advice get you a

703
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,600
little bit more dialed and cool down

704
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:45,009
your room a little bit um maybe we can

705
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:46,659
figure out how to run your equipment

706
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,849
more efficiently off of the electricity

707
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:50,650
that you've got because I'm pretty sure

708
00:24:48,849 --> 00:24:52,659
most people can't augment the

709
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,790
electricity in their house but I look

710
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,920
forward to oh this one's from Tonto also

711

00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:02,410
unclear please let me know and I will

00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:03,909

answered the question about the light

731
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:37,599
leaks on your show a few months ago I

732
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:40,359
think I remember that it says it was

733
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,250
October I think I remember answering a

734
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:44,409
lot of questions about light leaks but

735
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,910
it goes on to say Here I am again still

736
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,220
listening to your awesome show almost

737

739
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:54,129
locked-down [ __ ] I was happier than ever

740
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:55,870
to listen to your show because it is

741
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:59,200
good to have your positivity and

742
00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:01,419
enthusiasm in this time you have helped

743
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,640
a lot dude that means a lot to me thank

744
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:05,830
you I know as a content provider that

745
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,810
people kind of turn to us for just an

746
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:09,009
escape a getaway not only are you

747
00:26:07,809 --> 00:26:10,450
getting some sort of knowledge but

748
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:11,388
you're just escaping you're not thinking

749
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:13,098
about all the the Co

750
00:26:11,388 --> 00:26:14,958
[ __ ] or the dumb [ __ ] that's going on in

751
00:26:13,098 --> 00:26:16,458
your life I won't bring any of it up so

752
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:18,798
you don't think about it right now but

753
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:20,749
thank you for noticing and thank you for

754
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,249
the for mentioning that but I was

755
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:23,989
dealing with kovat and Quarantine and

756
00:26:22,249 --> 00:26:26,868
all that [ __ ] as well but I was using

757
00:26:23,989 --> 00:26:28,639
podcasting as an outlet to communicate

758
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:30,798
with people and keep myself occupied so

759
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:32,838
I'm glad you guys were using my work as

760
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,578
something to entertain yourselves that

761
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:37,128
worked out very well for both of us um

762
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:39,259
it goes on to say my question today is

763
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:41,689
about lighting I've said it so many

764
00:26:39,259 --> 00:26:45,048
times I'm not a lighting expert lighting

765
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:46,729
is where I am the most uneducated when

766
00:26:45,048 --> 00:26:48,588
it comes to cannabis cultivation I am

767
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:50,328
NOT a lighting expert there's a lot for

768
00:26:48,588 --> 00:26:52,368
me to learn when it comes to lighting

769
00:26:50,328 --> 00:26:53,778
keith has taught me a little bit about

770
00:26:52,368 --> 00:26:55,878
lights a couple of other people have

771
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:57,679
tried to teach me a lot about lights my

772
00:26:55,878 --> 00:27:00,069
brain doesn't absorb that stuff the way

773
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,028
that it absorbs the plant stuff so

774
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:03,108
hopefully I can answer your lighting

775
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:04,848
question but I just wanted to be

776
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:07,249
completely honest it goes on to say I

777
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:09,319
grow in a 2 by 2 foot tent with a

778
00:27:07,249 --> 00:27:12,319
hundred and twenty watt LED and it says

779
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:15,048
actual power 120 watts I am pretty

780
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,729
satisfied with it for both flowering and

781
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:18,618
the growth phase but I'd like to add a

782
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:21,528
little boost because sometimes you just

783
00:27:18,618 --> 00:27:23,628
want a little bit more light more growth

784
00:27:21,528 --> 00:27:25,098
and more bud yes we all want more growth

785
00:27:23,628 --> 00:27:27,019
in more bud and a good way to get that

786
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:29,418
is more light it says I'm aiming for

787
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:32,328
something like a 200 watt for the whole

788
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:34,519
tent even though I know that talking in

789
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:36,558
watts is not really accurate I'm really

790
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:37,548
glad you said that there are many ways

791
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,858
to measure

792
00:27:37,548 --> 00:27:41,989
lights and I don't think that watts are

793
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:44,538
the way to measure them accurately for

794
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:46,278
plants I don't think plants know what

795
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:48,108
watts even are they don't care they want

796
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:50,088
on the right spectrum I think you moles

797
00:27:48,108 --> 00:27:51,228
per Joule is the proper measurement all

798
00:27:50,088 --> 00:27:53,148
right let me quit talking out of my ass

799
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:55,429
and we'll get back on track here it says

800
00:27:53,148 --> 00:27:57,828
do you have any advice on supplemental

801
00:27:55,429 --> 00:28:00,349
lighting I thought about adding some

802
00:27:57,828 --> 00:28:02,749
heli D bars something like one bar for

803
00:28:00,348 --> 00:28:05,928
grow and one bar for flowering or maybe

804
00:28:02,749 --> 00:28:08,389
a CFL full-spectrum bulb I wouldn't do

805
00:28:05,929 --> 00:28:09,619
the CFL I would prefer the LEDs but it

806
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:11,689
is pretty difficult to know which

807
00:28:09,618 --> 00:28:14,208
direction to go nowadays with all the

808
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:15,619
information on the web I tried the

809
00:28:14,209 --> 00:28:17,328
forum's but I remembered what you said

810
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:18,539
about Gro advice on the forums in

811
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,639
general

812
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:23,159
there is a lot of [ __ ] on there yes

813
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,690
the people that own light companies go

814
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,759
and they comment like they're just users

815
00:28:24,690 --> 00:28:28,259
and consumers and then people that don't

816
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,819
know anything about growing they say

817
00:28:28,259 --> 00:28:31,619
that they had a problem or a great

818
00:28:29,819 --> 00:28:33,240
success with the certain light and it

819
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:35,459
was just a fluke because something else

820
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:37,410
in their grow was what was magical or

821
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,600
what was wrong so you have to be really

822
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,420
good at fishing through [ __ ] when

823
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:44,939
you were getting advice on forums so he

824
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:47,460
says I figured why not simply ask my

825
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,960
buddy from overseas Rasta Jeff it says

826
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,730
so if by any chance you read this email

827
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,579
I'd be really glad to get some help from

828
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,559
you stay safe your buddy Rick from

829
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:57,299
France what up Rick from France thank

830
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:58,740
you for the great message it's great to

831
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,139
know that I've got people over in France

832
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,170
listening to the podcast let's talk a

833
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:07,890
little bit about some grow light advice

834
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:10,019
for my friend Rick it sounds like you

835
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:12,840
are close to having enough light in that

836
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:14,819
2x2 tent it sounds like you want to

837
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:16,529
almost double up the amount of light I

838
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:18,779
would if you're gonna do it I would

839
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:20,789
double up during veg and flour there's

840
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:22,109
no reason to have certain amount of

841
00:29:20,789 --> 00:29:24,149
light at one point and then not have

842
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:25,500
full power for the whole cycle just go

843
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:27,060
full power the whole time so whatever

844
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,059
you're gonna buy make sure you've got

845
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:31,440
the electricity to run that light both

846
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,909
lights all of the lights make sure

847
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,500
you've got enough power like our

848
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,880
listener before they're flipping

849
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,259
breakers in their house when they try to

850
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:39,810
run all their gear make sure you've got

851
00:29:37,259 --> 00:29:41,640
the electricity the next thing make sure

852
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:43,559
you're able to cool it like our listener

853
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,240
before it's too hot in their house they

854
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,099
can't cool it make sure you're able to

855
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:49,079
cool it with those two things being

856
00:29:47,099 --> 00:29:50,730
thought about and heavily considered

857
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:54,059
let's talk about a couple of lights

858
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:57,599
you've got a two by two I would put one

859
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:59,730
Canon LED from black sale market in that

860
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,459
two by two and it would be [ __ ]

861
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:05,730
awesome it would be more light than you

862
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:07,430
need that's a 325 watt light and I think

863
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,960
it would light up your 2 by 2

864
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:12,269
beautifully I think a cannon is perfect

865
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:13,860
for a 3 by 3 it is going to light up

866
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:15,900
your 2 by 2 and your plants are going to

867
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,209
go kaboom Kapow

868
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:20,910
um so I would shred I would recommend

869
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,799
about 300 watts and that 2 by 2 maybe a

870
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,509
little bit less I think 200 Watts total

871
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,299
will be right about where you want to be

872
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:29,099
the cannons you can dial them down

873
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,869
they've got a little not Inaba it's

874
00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:32,189
hidden but it's there Keith will show

875
00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:33,009
you where it is and maybe in the

876
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:34,480
instruction

877
00:30:33,009 --> 00:30:36,460
I didn't read the instruction book I

878
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,630
apologize and I admit it but there is a

879
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,640
little knob you can use a screwdriver

880
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:41,530
and you can turn down the wattage so you

881
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:43,090
can get it down to 200 watts I think it

882
00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:44,558
goes that low you can play with the

883
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:46,389
wattage and you can get it dialed in for

884
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,039
your plants the only thing to consider

885
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,110
is ceiling height as long as you've got

886
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:52,659
enough height I think a cannon would be

887
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:54,849
wonderful for you if not I would find

888
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,679
something with a good reputation I would

889
00:30:54,849 --> 00:30:59,259
do a lot of research and I would find

890
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,970
something around 200 watts for your

891
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:02,829
space it sounds like 200 watts would be

892
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:06,190
just about perfect for your square

893
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:08,949
footage I honestly do not know enough

894
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,690
about LED lights nobody pays me to

895
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:12,640
recommend lighting nobody pays me to

896
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,299
talk about LEDs I'm not sponsored by an

897
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,460
LED company I do have Canon LEDs I grow

898
00:31:16,299 --> 00:31:20,440
with them and they work beautifully my

899
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:22,569
plants are [ __ ] happy the growth is

900
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,820
beautiful I should have flowered earlier

901
00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:26,259
because they took off in veg I wasn't

902
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:27,730
prepared for that they got kind of tall

903
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:30,160
and flower that was my fault

904
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:32,890
those lights made the plants grow super

905
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:35,590
super quickly so I recommend the canon

906
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:37,090
LED from black sale I think you can get

907
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:39,609
them you said friend from overseas err

908
00:31:37,089 --> 00:31:42,579
in France I think they are available in

909
00:31:39,609 --> 00:31:44,169
France Keith if I am wrong please send

00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:58,450
I've got one more thing to talk about I

948
00:32:56,619 --> 00:33:00,039
almost forgot I got a question on

949
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:01,450
YouTube let's get to this when I got to

950
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:03,700
find it here in the phone this is my

951
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:05,110
version of being organized it says I got

952
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,789
more than one message like this where I

953
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:09,579
would have ignored it but I think it is

954
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:11,680
time to address this one it says man I'd

955
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:13,179
like to see your dreads sometime and I

956
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,799
know it's a pain to get long dreads in

957
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:17,080
the camera but maybe just for a minute

958
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,169
at the end of an episode I just like to

959
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:23,379
see the texture size and shape that is

960
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:25,330
kind of a weird odd request but it's

961
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,770
been asked so many times that I think it

962
00:33:25,329 --> 00:33:27,339
is time to bust out the dreadlocks for

963
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:28,720
you guys

964
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:31,049
feels a little bit weird it's a gross

965
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,549
show but so I've got them tied in a knot

966
00:33:31,049 --> 00:33:35,230
tight untie that part and then I've got

967
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:37,180
a hair tie it's actually a [ __ ]

968
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:39,309
headband that works as a hair tie but

969
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:40,810

hanging down I'm gonna show you the what

982
00:34:01,059 --> 00:34:07,389
did you want to see me the texture size

983
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:08,199
and shape so I got a couple I'm gonna

984
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:10,119
say there's a couple of different

985
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:12,789
textures these are more uniform the

986
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:14,739
smaller ones that's the texture and size

987
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:16,269
and shape I guess these are like my

988
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:18,549
common size ones and then I got a couple

989
00:34:16,269 --> 00:34:20,769
this one that comes from let me get

990
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:22,360
natural direction some of this may get

991
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:24,429
edited more I may just leave all this in

992
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,809
the show I'm getting real comfortable

993
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:27,220
with the video show you guys if you

994
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:30,400
haven't noticed you got a couple of

995
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,750
thick ones like this chick let me get

996
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:36,820
this gone this one's real thick here

997
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:39,159
this one is almost the diameter of a can

998
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:43,720
of butane I guess it's it's thinner but

999
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:45,730
I mean you know it's comparable so and I

1000
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:47,079
measured as a joke I don't know if I'm

1001
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,668
supposed to say this cuz a friend is

1002
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:50,079
doing a giveaway based on the length of

1003
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:52,329
my dreads but I hope your giveaway is

1004
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,969
done before this podcast comes out my

1005
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:57,420
longest dread was 49 inches long we

1006
00:34:54,969 --> 00:35:00,399
measured with the tape measure 49 inches

1007
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,630
so I'll stand up and show you I'll also

1008
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,088
trying to get somebody to snap a photo

1009
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:06,309
for me so that I've got a good stand-up

1010
00:35:04,088 --> 00:35:07,420
from the back kind of a picture sorry to

1011
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:09,700
do it right here with this camera just

1012
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:11,440
on the MacBook but I'm stand up show you

1013
00:35:09,699 --> 00:35:13,449
the dreads you won't be able to hear me

1014
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,579
for a moment but if you're listening on

1015
00:35:13,449 --> 00:35:17,169
iTunes or Apple podcasts or stitcher I

1016
00:35:15,579 --> 00:35:18,430
invite you to come check us out on the

1017
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:18,730
video here we go show the dreads real

1018
00:35:18,429 --> 00:35:21,919
quick

1019
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,920
[Music]

1020
00:35:26,108 --> 00:35:28,170
you

1021
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,059
you

1022
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:44,009
also I'm six five and they go to my

1023
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,150
knees hmm so there's a lot of stuff to

1024
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,440
work with that's why you see him tied up

1025
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:50,070
almost all the time

1026
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,599
I let him down at concerts and I'm when

1027
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,920
I'm not doing stuff you know but it's

1028
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:53,940
hard to have all this hanging from your

1029
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,050
head all the time and you're trying to

1030
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,789
work in a garden or something so they're

1031
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,220
mostly tied up but I appreciate the

1032
00:35:56,789 --> 00:36:00,420
question I was time to address that it

1033
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:01,619
was a little bit awkward felt a little

1034
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:03,480
bit weird as I was swinging him around

1035
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:04,739
there but a lot of people asked about it

1036
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,539
so I guess it was time to show off the

1037
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:08,429
dreadlocks that's the length the texture

1038
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,440
the color the size the shape all the

1039
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:12,389
[ __ ] that you wanted to know not shy

1040
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,889
about it can't be shy haven't rocks her

1041
00:36:12,389 --> 00:36:16,230
this long you get all the questions

1042
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:17,400
eventually so I hope that wraps that up

1043
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,679
for now if anybody else out there has

1044
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,309
any I guess dreadlock questions as well

1045
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:25,980
feel free ask away ah yeah that was fun

1046
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:28,349
um also while I'm thinking about it

1047
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,079
please check out my friends at Operation

1048
00:36:28,349 --> 00:36:32,759
grow I'm part of a thing called

1049
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,500
Operation grow sponsored by pl grow

1050
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,390
systems is also sponsored by new

1051
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,340
millennium nutrients and Auto pot

1052
00:36:36,389 --> 00:36:40,289
systems and of course it is sponsored by

1053
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,390
I read genetics I'll tell you briefly

1054
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:46,380
about what operation grow is on

1055
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:47,849
operation grow I was I gave mmm let me

1056
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,170
correct myself and catch up with my own

1057
00:36:47,849 --> 00:36:49,980
thoughts I'm trying to read my notes and

1058
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,950
my notes threw me off

1059
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:55,740
what operation grow is I donated packs

1060
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:57,449
of seeds to six growers I think six

1061
00:36:55,739 --> 00:36:59,759
growers got the same pack of seeds they

1062
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:01,589
all got orange gasm seeds they were all

1063
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,780
given an auto pot system they were all

1064
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:06,150
given new millennium nutrients they're

1065
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:07,830
all growing on the same schedule we are

1066
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,619
all talking about our progress and

1067
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:12,509
documenting our grow on operation grow

1068
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:15,329
on YouTube I think you can find it under

1069
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:18,600
Operation grow 2019 because of course it

1070
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:22,049
started in 2019 we know it's 2020 now

1071
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:24,179
but it started back then so what I'm

1072
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:26,789
doing here is I am inviting you to check

1073
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:30,659
out the show operation grow on YouTube

1074
00:37:26,789 --> 00:37:33,029
every Saturday ah Mountain time at 2:00

1075
00:37:30,659 --> 00:37:35,009
p.m. we go live on YouTube and we talk

1076
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,930
about the grow everybody that is

1077
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,330
involved in operation grow shows their

1078
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:41,069
progress with the orange gasm plants

1079
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:42,569
they all got seeds they all germinated

1080
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:43,950
at the same time they're all using the

1081
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,630
auto pots they're all using new

1082
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:47,099
millennium nutrients the only

1083
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,920
differences are the lighting and the

1084
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:51,690
environments and some people got sample

1085
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,480
of cocoa as well so I think everybody's

1086
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:57,329
using cocoa there are very few variables

1087
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,088
in this experiment everybody also has

1088
00:37:57,329 --> 00:38:02,910
APL grow minder unit so we're able to

1089
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:05,219
see the the temperature the humidity the

1090
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:07,259
fluctuations the VPD in these rooms

1091
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:09,118
we're getting pictures we're getting a

1092
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,730
lot of documentation it's a really fun

1093
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:13,769

learning about my own genetics I'm

1111
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,118
getting data that I never would have had

1112
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:53,639
access to before and in today's modern

1113
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,630
world data is everything and I just got

1114
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:57,000
to figure out what the [ __ ] to do with

00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:58,500
the data all right so it is time to wrap

1116
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,969
