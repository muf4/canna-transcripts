the podcast where we talk about

29
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:19,679
something that just may drive you crazy

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,280
in a grow room maybe you see it in other

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
people's grows maybe you see it in

32
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,599
pictures on the internet maybe you work

33
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,640
at a commercial grow where some weird

34
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,919
[ __ ] happens this is the section of the

35

going to share with you one of my major

38
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,240
pet peeves about growing about the

39
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:37,599
Cannabis industry it is something very

40
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,239
simple it is when a breeder gives

41
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,319
somebody seeds and those seeds go into a

42
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,199
collection box and never make it into

43
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:47,959
any dirt or into any Grow rooms you guys

44
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,719
you gals you Growers you smokers uh we

45
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:52,000
put a lot of work we as breeders put a

46
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:53,559
lot of work into producing those seeds

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,478
when we give you seeds we're like hey

48
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,600
bro you want some new [ __ ] it's cool

49
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:57,879
that you want to keep it you want to

50
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:59,280
cherish it you want to keep it like a

51
00:01:57,879 --> 00:02:01,718
Keepsake or something put it in that

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,599
treasure box and keep it forever but as

53
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:05,519
a breeder it would be really cool if you

54
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,879
grew at least a couple of those seeds

55
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:09,758
that I gave you anyway that's my pet

56
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:11,239
peeve I understand you they're like

57
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,399
Pokemon cards you want to catch them all

58
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:13,920
you want to collect them all you want to

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,319
have them in that Vault but as the

60
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,759
breeder grow that [ __ ] man grow it we

61
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:19,399
want to see what it does we want to see

62
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:21,518
what you do with it that's why we gave

63
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,840
it to you so one of my pet peeves is

64
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:25,400
seeds sitting in a box I wish I could

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,159
start giving my friends seeds that are

66
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,319
already folded in paper towels you guys

67
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,799
did order tester seeds on the internet I

68
00:02:29,318 --> 00:02:32,878
wish I could send those to you already

69
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,480
folded up in a wet paper towel so it's

70
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,000
like hey they're started for you now

71
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,799
you're on a timeline you've got to get

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
them going now that way we know you're

73
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,040
going to grow them I wish I could do

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,959
that with the testers it's not realistic

75
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,679
I understand not everybody's able to

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,560
grow them right away I understand you do

77
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,640
have other things lined up I do

78
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
understand that you've got a grow room

79
00:02:47,639 --> 00:02:52,079
plan a grow room strategy but still it

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
would be cool if you grew that [ __ ] that

81

we jump into the email portion of

119
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,360
today's podcast you may have noticed

120
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,079
that for a short while I was posting

121
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,919
shorts on YouTube maybe you didn't

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
notice if you didn't go check them out

123
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,120
I've posted a few shorts on YouTube

124
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,280
basically they are short clips taken

125
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,399
from long episodes I watched some of the

126
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:28,198
shows I found a few uh key moments that

127
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,959
I thought would be notable I cut them

128
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,199
out then I post them I edit them up a

129
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,038
little bit and then I post them to

130
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,560
YouTube as shorts it's great it does a

131
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,159
lot of advertising for the show I've

132
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,199
noticed I do get more subscribers and

133
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,400
more viewers because I post those shorts

134
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:43,759
I honestly don't have the time to make

135
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,879
those shorts so here's where I'm going

136
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,240
to ask for help ladies and gentlemen

137
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:50,199
boys and girls cannabis Community my

138
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
video editing friends out there if

139
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,360
you're watching these podcasts and you

140
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
see key moments that you think could be

141
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
turned into useful shorts or useful

142
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,559
clips for social media I would

143
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,359
appreciate it if you clip those moments

144
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,199
edit them down to they need to be

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,080
between 30 and 55 seconds long if I want

146
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,680
to use them as shorts so if you're

147
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,639
watching the show you see a notable

148
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,759
moment uh clip that out it could be a

149
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:14,600
longer segment that you chop down into

150
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,240
30 to 55 seconds so that I can post it

151
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,919
but find that clip that you think is

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,519
good that may stand out chop it out uh

153
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:23,279
turn it into a 30 to 55 second clip if

154
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,519
you want to put a cool intro a cool

155
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,959
outro on it or don't I can add that if

156
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:29,719
necessary on my own or I can use it as

157
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:32,599
it is if you want to put a filter or a

158
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,840
texture on it uh that is up to to you do

159
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,800
your artistic creative thing on it but

160
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,119
if you can send me one or two shorts as

161
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,520
an audition I would truly appreciate

162
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,038
those then if I like your style maybe we

163
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,279
can work something out what I would like

164
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,360
to do honestly is trade you a few packs

165
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,918
of seeds for a few shorts maybe you

166
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,360
could send me a few now a few in the

167
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:52,198
future and then I'll send you a few

168
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,840
seeds now a few seeds in the future

169
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,600
we'll keep it like a continuous trade

170
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,038
going that way you're always stacked up

171
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,319
with new seeds and then I've always got

172
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,800
new shorts to post I love the shorts

173
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,120
they do a great job but honestly I

174
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,240
simply don't have time to rewatch the

175
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,639
podcast pull the shorts out edit them

176
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,519
back down and then post them that takes

177
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,120
a lot of time so if anybody out there

178
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,799
would like to make those short clips for

179
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,199
me I would love to trade you seeds or we

180
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,240
could work out some sort of other

181
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,800
compensation for your time once again

182
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,840
what I need is a short clip somewhere

183
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:24,560
between 30 and 55 seconds long you can

184
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,399
do your artistic creativity to it uh you

185
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,319
could take a long clip that's a 3 minute

186
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,719
ramble and you can cut it out uh and

187
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,479
make it 30 to 55 5 Seconds what we need

188
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,160
is things that will uh draw people into

189
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,598
the podcast to get people watching get

190
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,280
people's attention in that quick short

191
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:40,360
time all right I wanted that ramble to

192
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,198
be much shorter I went way too long on

193
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,800
it so I'm going to wrap that up and say

194
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,879

215

my Instagram live I was intrigued by

216
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,918

217
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:34,038

into a private chat and talk about it

267
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,759
there but uh thank you for noticing the

268
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:13,039
transparency and it does make a big

269
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,000
difference I notice it makes a big

270
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,120
difference in the community when I go to

271
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,360
events I notice uh the few breeders

272
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
there are other breeders that put their

273
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,759
faces out there and shout out to them

274
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,159
the folks the guys the gals that put

275
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,000
their faces out there and they're on the

276
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:26,919
internet they're the ones at the events

277
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,440
that have large booths that have more

278
00:09:26,919 --> 00:09:30,360
people at their table that have more

279
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,800
traffic uh the people that keep their

280
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,519
head down and they don't put their faces

281
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:34,719
out there and they don't answer messages

282
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,799
you can see at the events because

283
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,519
there's no traffic at their Booth so

284
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,838
thanks for noticing that now it does go

285
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,200
on it says based on only customer

286
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,959
feedback in the last year which of your

287
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:48,440
strains collected the most positive

288
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,679
sentiment now that was a really good

289
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,360
question I did also talk about this on

290
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:55,759

Mondays are busy but uh this came up on

308
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,639
the Instagram I don't recall the answer

309
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,639
that I gave on Instagram I may have said

310
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,679
blueberry butcher but after the

311
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,120
Instagram live show I took a moment and

312
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,439
I went and looked and kind of read some

313
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,240
messages and scrolled through some

314
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,279
things and looked at some uh customer

315
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,759
service emails and some reviews and I

316
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:46,399
don't remember the answer I for sure

317
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,838
gave on Instagram but after thinking

318
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,879
about it and looking into it a little

319
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,160
bit uh The Strain that got the most uh

320
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:56,078
positive sentiment the most accolades

321
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:57,639
the most not Mo most notable strain from

322
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,519
my lineup this year that's harder to say

323
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,240
than it looks uh I'm going to say it was

324
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,679
a tie uh between the orange gasm and the

325
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,639
blueberry butcher Orange gasm has been

326
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:09,199
my most popular strain for two or three

327
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,959
years uh it sells very well it grows

328
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,560
very well it's got great results I get a

329
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,479
lot of great customer feedback from the

330
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,399
orange GM but recently I've noticed the

331
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,959
blueberry butcher may be passing that

332
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,120
one up in popularity it's also newer so

333
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,638
it's got more hype behind it um people

334
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,919
are really having great success with

335
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,320
that blueberry butcher it makes gigantic

336
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,759
buds it's got tremendous potency it

337
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:33,360
tastes really good it makes all kinds of

338
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,039
amazing extracts if you're doing it with

339
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,879
BHO if you're doing it with water if

340
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,480
you're pressing it the concentrates come

341
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,439
out really well from that blueberry

342
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,320
butcher so it's going to be a tie uh

343
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,480
between that orange gasm and the

344
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,560
blueberry butcher then in third place I

345
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,879
know you only asked for one but uh it's

346
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,599
my podcast I can ramble if I want to the

347
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:53,759
third place winner in that competition

348
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,800
would be the lemon Jeffrey so my number

349
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,399
three most notable strains it's going to

350
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:59,639
be a tie between orange gasm and

351
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,639
blueberry butcher currently uh number

352
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,799
three or maybe that's number two is the

353
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:05,959
Lemon Jeffrey uh maybe number three so

354
00:12:03,799 --> 00:12:07,399
top three orange gasm blueberry Butcher

355
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:10,039
and lemon Jeffrey are the three that are

356
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,879
getting the most notoriety now now that

357
00:12:10,039 --> 00:12:14,240
will shift because I've put out a lot of

358
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:16,278
new stuff recently uh people just simply

359
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,799
have not had time to grow all of it and

360
00:12:16,278 --> 00:12:19,600
send back a bunch of great feedback

361
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:20,958
there's new stuff coming out there's new

362
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,920
stuff in testing there's new stuff

363
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,719
that's recently been released so people

364
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:27,599
are growing that and there will be new

365
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,759
feedback on that within the next uh 3 6

366
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,480
9 12 months especially over the next 18

367
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:34,240
months all those reports will start

368
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,800
coming in we will see a big shift now

369
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,680
I'm going to add on to this subject you

370
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,719
mentioned uh the strains that got the

371
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:41,958
most positive sentiment I mentioned

372
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,519
those three now I want to talk about the

373
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:47,039
strain of the year for 2003 that I feel

374
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,959
like got overlooked the most I make a

375
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,559
lot of great strains uh I grow them I

376
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,000
send them out to friends to grow them

377
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,759
and then we put them online for other

378
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,078
people to grow them I see what you guys

379
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:57,919
are growing because you post your

380
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,078
pictures on social media you send me

381
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,559
pictures you share the photos on Discord

382
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,359
please join the Discord server and post

383
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:06,399
your pictures of my lines over there but

384
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,278
uh from all the results that I've seen I

385
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,039
think people are really sleeping on the

386
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:13,360
red line red line is an amazing plant it

387
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,120
produces gigantic flowers uh they're

388
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
super potent they've got amazing Aromas

389
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,480
and flavors if you're a concentrate

390
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,078
maker Redline is made from Red Lebanese

391
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,240
hash plant so it is a hash plant

392
00:13:21,078 --> 00:13:24,519
derivative uh the red line is very

393
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,159
overlooked I feel like it would have

394
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:28,198
sold more I feel like it would have been

395
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,719
more sought-after and more hyped up but

396
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:31,958
people kind of seem to be sleeping on

397
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,959
the red line so those are my top three

398
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:36,278
best sellers and the red line is the one

399
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,159
that got overlooked this year I think

400
00:13:36,278 --> 00:13:40,559
previously in the previous years uh

401
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,759
Scarlett Bonas was the one that got

402
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,198
snubbed and overlooked uh both of those

403
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:47,078
strains the red line and the Scarlett

404
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:49,399
Bonas or hot fire and they just didn't

405
00:13:47,078 --> 00:13:51,919
get a notice uh sometimes I wonder if it

406
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:53,600
was my marketing if it was timing if it

407
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,439
was the strain name a lot of times it's

408
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
the strain name that does that people

409
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,959
weren't into the strain Scarlet Bonas

410
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,600
for some reason but I wonder what what

411
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,119
does it sometimes I know what's going to

412
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,278
make a strain stand out it's because

413
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,360
it's hot fire uh the name is great the

414
00:14:04,278 --> 00:14:08,399
flavor is great the photos are great but

415
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,600
then I put up Red Line right next to it

416
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,120
I think it's a cool name uh Redline

417
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,120
because when you smoke it your eyes get

418
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,720
stupid red and also that's as high as

419
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,240
you're going to get you're red lining

420
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,040
and then also I used to ride bikes when

421
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,278
I was a kid and it's a tribute to the

422
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,599
red line bicycles I rode GTS but red

423
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:27,399
lines were around um but the red line uh

424
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,199
one of the most overlooked plants in my

425
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,879
opinion what really was funny that

426
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:32,758
happened though is Scarlett Bonas I do

427
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,039
still have some Scarlet Bonia seeds very

428
00:14:32,759 --> 00:14:36,120
few I need to package them up get them

429
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:37,879
on the website but those are almost gone

430
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,120
what I thought was funny is when I was

431
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,559
almost out of scarlet Bonia seeds The

432
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:42,919
Strain got real popular and people

433
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:45,039
wanted it now that it's gone I don't

434
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,919
make it anymore I'm not interested in it

435
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,519
now it's hyped up that's probably what

436
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,479
will happen to the red line all right my

437
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,000

Discord I'm super rambly today I don't

460
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:39,919
remember what I smoked I wish I did so

461
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,480
that I could tell you anyway this

462
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:44,759
question is a general grow question it

463
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,079
says I'm just wondering about Federal

464
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:49,480
rescheduling or descheduling yes there's

465
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:51,679
a lot of talk lately about the DEA uh

466
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:54,000
rescheduling or uh rescheduling or

467
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,078
descheduling cannabis uh lots of talk

468
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,879
there's no true info out yet at the time

469
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,958
of this recording it does go on though

470
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:02,039
it says do you think breeders will be

471
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:05,198
able or even want to send out flower

472
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,599
tester packs before folks decide which

473
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,318
seeds to buy that is a pretty cool idea

474
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,319
he clears it up he says what I mean by

475
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:13,439
that is maybe a couple of nugs or

476
00:16:11,318 --> 00:16:15,159
pre-rolls of each flowered product so

477
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,399
you know which seeds to buy based off

478
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,719
the effects you get when you try a test

479
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,839
sampler think of it like a sampler at a

480
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,240
micro Brewery I like that idea yeah I

481
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,759
was just seeing myself walking around

482
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,198
Costco getting little samples as you

483
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:29,879
said that uh it says this would be just

484
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,559
an additional product people purchase if

485
00:16:29,879 --> 00:16:34,278
they fixed the laws yeah that is a

486
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:38,000
really cool idea I do like that um I see

487
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:40,679
some pros and cons to that um it may set

488
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,839
a really weird expectation if I grew a

489
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:44,399
bunch of uh let's just say pick a strain

490
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,440
what's coming out real soon we're going

491
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,278
to say light Ripper uh light Ripper is

492
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,319
coming soon you guys p91 to Jack the

493
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:52,000
Ripper light Ripper is coming it will be

494
00:16:50,318 --> 00:16:53,879
released very soon stay tuned check out

495
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,120
iir sign up for the newsletter all that

496
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:58,720
good stuff um but light Ripper is coming

497
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,839
let's just say I wanted to advertise

498
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,120
light Ripper so I grew whatever a whole

499
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,798
bunch of light Ripper and I rolled up um

500
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,439
or just divided up a bunch of grams

501
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,838
let's say I took a pound and I gave you

502
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,720
a whole bunch of grams you got it all in

503
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,038
grams and then people that were tempted

504
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,000
to buy the seeds could order a sample

505
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,599
for whatever a gram would cost and then

506
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,400
we could hypothetically send it in the

507
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:22,000
mail um maybe I would have light Ripper

508
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,199
maybe I would also have uh what else is

509
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
something that's going to come out soon

510
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,000
I don't want to give you guys too many

511
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,078
uh tinf foil hat maybe I got some

512
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,599
tinfoil hat packs maybe I got some parad

513
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:32,480
packs uh but maybe I got the weed also

514
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:35,159
and then I could send you a parad Graham

515
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,440
A tinfoil hat gram a light Ripper Graham

516
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,400
and you can get all those and you can

517
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,320
smoke those and then you can decide

518
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,400
which strain you want to buy those seeds

519
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:44,558
from that is a really cool idea but

520
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,360
here's the catch I've been growing weed

521
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,160
for a really long time I've grown weed

522
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,759
I've grown cannabis in basements I've

523
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,519
grown cannabis in attics I've grown

524
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:54,839
cannabis in uh rooms that have been

525
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:56,839
built under stairs I've also uh grown

526
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,439
cannabis in Giant commercial production

527
00:17:56,839 --> 00:18:01,399
facilities I've grown in all different

528
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,279
types of ways I also bred this product

529
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,038
that we were sampling I should be able

530
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,399
to grow this like a pro I should be able

531
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:09,839
to grow the [ __ ] out of this this should

532
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,840
be award-winning so I may be setting uh

533
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:15,119
an unrealistic expectation if I grow it

534
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:17,678
and I send it to you and you choose from

535
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,519
those three um maybe I chose a different

536
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,120
phenotype than you maybe I had better

537
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,519
lighting than you maybe I had better

538
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,599
nutrients than you maybe I've just

539
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:26,400
simply got more experience and you're

540
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:30,558
going to make your selection based off

541
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,759
of my grow which that's cool but y grow

542
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,119
won't be the same so maybe it won't come

543
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,359
out the same for you but I see what

544
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,239
you're saying it's a really cool idea

545
00:18:36,359 --> 00:18:40,119
I'm just saying as the breeder I like

546
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,720
the idea but I'm also sketched out by

547
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:44,158
the idea for a few reasons most of the

548
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,038
time I think the descriptions and the

549
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,640
genetics give people a pretty good idea

550
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:51,200
of why they want a strain and why they

551
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,120
want to grow it so um uh it's a really

552
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,600
cool hypothetical idea it's a really

553
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,759
cool fantasy it's a really cool what if

554
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,639
um but there's a lot of things to think

555
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,558
about that come with it now what I wrote

556
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,400
down is bro that's what the events are

557
00:19:01,558 --> 00:19:05,918
for things like the dude grow cup The

558
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,759
Groovy gravy event uh the emerald cup

559
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,000
any of the other big consumption events

560
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,720
or the big uh uh community events where

561
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,880
you go and you're allowed to consume

562
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:16,319
that's what that is for um the Breeders

563
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,000
The Growers we try to bring samples

564
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:19,639
sometimes the venues tell us we can't we

565
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,519
try to sneak them in anyway sometimes we

566
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:23,360
do what we can sometimes we simply don't

567
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,400
have samples ready we between crops or

568
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,158
whatever but uh what we like to do is

569
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,000
bring a sample so if we're going to the

570
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,720
dude grows cup I want to sell you a

571
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,599
bunch of orange gasm or lemon Jeffree

572
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,839
seeds why wouldn't I grow a whole bunch

573
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:36,359
of orange gasm or lemon Jeffrey jar it

574
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,158
up and bring it with me to the event

575
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:39,399
have it sitting on the table that way

576
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,360
when you're like hey I'm thinking about

577
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,240
buying orange gas I'm be like there it

578
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,479
is smell it and you go holy [ __ ] I have

579
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,759
to buy two packs of that so uh the

580
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:49,279
events is where that is all about also

581
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:52,519
what's beautiful about the events you

582
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,960
can find uh five six 10 or 20 people

583
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,519
that are growing itic strains and you

584
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,240
can sample from different people who

585
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,759
have grown it uh in different

586
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,319
environments different conditions with

587
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,640
different lights uh different nutrients

588
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:06,279
uh different completely different

589
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,960
methods all together soilless mix cocoa

590
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:10,200
Hydro um however you can grow cannabis I

591
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,919
was trying to come up with some smartass

592
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,840
way but we'll stay focused but people

593
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,440
are growing it from California to Maine

594
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,038
uh people we got people in Maine where

595
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,919
it's snowing right now we got people in

596
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,599
Arizona where it's hot right now

597
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,159
everybody's growing it in different eni

598
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,079
environments and conditions and we all

599
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:27,400
meet up at the dude grows cup and you

600
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:30,399
can say hey this guy grew Raphael in

601
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,840
Arizona this grew Raphael in Missouri

602
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
and you can see both of their samples

603
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,558
and this guy grew Orange gasm in

604
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,000
Colorado and this guy grew Orange gasm

605
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:38,759
in Maine and you can look at both of our

606
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,400
samples and you can see kind of a

607
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:43,679
variety of what IE genetics has to offer

608
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,400
by coming to the events with the

609
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,480
community so not only do you get to come

610
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,960
see the product smoke the product you

611
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,880
get to meet a bunch of people you get to

612
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,558
meet uh the iy Army all the people

613
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,080
you've been talking to on the Discord

614
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,440
and then you'll also get an opportunity

615
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,918
to meet Mike and myself we're not shy uh

616
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,919
we are stuck behind the booth most of

617
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:01,360
the time because we've got work to do

618
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,038
but come up to the booth you don't have

619
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,079
to buy seeds you don't have to buy

620
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,640
anything to come to my booth and say hi

621
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,319
if I'm not busy if there's not a long

622
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,799
line there there's points in the day

623
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,038
where the booth gets really dead and

624
00:21:09,798 --> 00:21:13,319
really slow it comes in waves when

625
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,319
there's not a wave if you just want to

626
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:17,000
come [ __ ] come [ __ ] dude that's

627
00:21:15,319 --> 00:21:18,399
what we are there for come shake my hand

628
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:21,278
give me a fist bump give me a hug if

629
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,798
that's what you're into say hi uh meet

630
00:21:21,278 --> 00:21:25,558
us come say hi um smoke some of the weed

631
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:27,679
meet the community and say hi to us is

632
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,359
what it's all about so I'm rambling once

633
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,919
again I'm remember what I smoked bro but

634
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:33,399
it was [ __ ] good it's working but um

635
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,200
this would be a cool idea it' be cool if

636
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,278
I could send you out some samples like

637
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,679
every few months just be like hey here's

638
00:21:37,278 --> 00:21:40,159
five different samples let me know what

639
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:42,000
seed pack you're into and we can get you

640
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,640
that that would be cool but that is

641
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,400
really what the community events are for

642
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,400
so get out there join the community move

643
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,278
around and go to as many of the events

644
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,159
as you can there are a bunch of events

645
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:54,000
coming up I'm not sponsored by any of
