00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,360
we start the show with a freaking frog

83
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,400
in my throat it's awesome uh so Jesse is

84
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,760
here you guys we don't have to do a

85
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,719
whole bunch of technical formal

86
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:05,199
introductions let's get right down to it

87
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,400
uh we all wanted Jesse to come on the

88
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,919
show and do another grow lesson for us

89
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:13,480
because it's outdoor season uh we know

90
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:15,359
that growing outdoor is almost free uh

91
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:17,798
some people asked me kind of about doing

92
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,760
a budget episode like if they don't have

93
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:22,599
a lot of money so I figure we'll work on

94
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,679
getting the basics of an outdoor grow

95
00:03:22,598 --> 00:03:26,359
going and then maybe if we have some

96
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,360
extra time we will talk about maybe how

97
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,599
to do a budget grow so that way people

98
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,879
don't have to break the bank to build

99
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,199
their grow and grow a whole bunch of

100
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,798
ganja oh yeah you totally do that too oh

101
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,598
yeah oh yeah we have some ideas Jesse

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,159
and I have been at this for a minute I

103
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,318
bet we could build a hoop house together

104
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,919
in probably two hours oh easily yeah

105
00:03:41,318 --> 00:03:46,238
yeah Jesse's got the tools and I'll keep

106
00:03:42,919 --> 00:03:49,000
the dab nail hot all right

107
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,360
so uh we're GNA a lot of what we're

108
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,158
going to talk about may be kind of

109
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,280
regional to Colorado you may have to

110
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:56,840
adjust a lot of what we say for your

111
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,318
area um if you're in California you may

112
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,000
be a little bit earlier than us if

113
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,798
you're on the East Coast it's going to

114
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,079
be a whole different story yeah a whole

115
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,719
different yeah I don't even know how to

116
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:05,920
teach you to grow in the South or in the

117
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,000
East where you've got a lot more

118
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,238
humidity the scheduling is a lot more

119
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,719
wonky the weather comes Midwest is uh

120
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,239
pretty similar to us just a lot easier

121
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:17,720
for him so all right so we'll get it

122
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,679
we'll get most of this stuff based on

123
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:22,320
Colorado grows but we'll try to get it

124
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,759
to where everybody can work with this so

125
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:26,399
I guess the first question we should

126
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,199
start with is where uh where should we

127
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,758
start growing where should we look at

128
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,960
growing our outdoor crop where would be

129
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,400
your ideal

130
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:39,638
space um you want a a south facing uh

131
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:42,758
you know or good southern view um for

132
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:44,600
for the sun um starting this one off all

133
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,280
stoned no it's all right Stone it'll

134
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,600
come out of you eventually and I can

135
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:53,359
edit some stuff for sure n no need for

136
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:55,479
that um you want you know probably six

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:59,120
hours a day direct sunlight I mean

138
00:04:55,478 --> 00:05:02,839
they'll grow on less but you know for

139
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,478
proper you know you want six plus um for

140
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:08,719
big fat Lush PLS yeah yeah I I'd prefer

141
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:11,800
like 10 hours a day personally but I

142
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,440
mean can make it work Outdoors is really

143
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,520
forgiving so okay um they'll grow

144
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:20,279
anywhere yeah they will they'll grow on

145
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:23,318
accident sometimes so you want a south

146
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:25,000
facing uh slope if you can uh what if

147
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,439
we're stuck like in the city what if

148
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,519
we're in the backyard do we want to

149
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,038
avoid some

150
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,758
sheds avoid Street if you can street

151
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,560
lights most definitely sheds you know

152
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,199
you don't want to get too blocked in um

153
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,120
and that is mainly for airf flow I mean

154
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,720
if your area is you know like in the

155
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,800
middle of four sheds or something like

156
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,199
that all stacked together but it's 20x

157
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,720
20 you know you got plenty of air flow

158
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,639
there for a couple plants leav some

159
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,680
space for the plants to breathe you know

160
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:56,199
if it's like a 6x6 spot you know that's

161
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,639
enough for one plant maybe right so yeah

162
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:59,680
you guys your outdoor plants are going

163
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,840
to get big if you do this right and

164
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,800
we'll talk about that in a few minutes

165
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:06,038
when we talk about container size so you

166
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,160
you would like a southern facing slope

167
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:09,038
uh if you're going to grow in your

168
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,720
backyard or something don't grow between

169
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,959
the garage and the house and the shed

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
unless you can get plenty of air air

171
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,079
flowing through there that's going to be

172
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,199
a great show Jesse's too high and my

173
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,560
throat's all jacked this be wonderful uh

174
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,800
make sure you get plenty of air flow you

175
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,519
don't want your plants touching each

176
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
other so when you do plant them make

177
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:26,719
sure you give like expect the plants to

178
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,160
be 6 to 8 feet around each by the time

179
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,280
you're done maybe a little bit bigger if

180
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,199
you're a good grower and you know what

181
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,198
you're doing

182
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,560
yeah so expect a big plant um give

183
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
yourself plenty of room is kind of what

184
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,160
I was headed toward so we might be

185
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,360
behind on this question but uh here in

186
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,479
Colorado when should we put our plants

187
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,639
outside um pretty much anywhere in

188
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,478
America I think he could have been out

189
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,400
uh a couple of weeks ago probably oh

190
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:56,079
easily um uh you know the the summer

191
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:58,279
we've had here locally um you could have

192
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:59,639
been out first of May easily now I'm

193
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:02,000
going to ask a really random question

194
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:05,160
question uh locally we've been getting

195
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,959
beat to [ __ ] with hail yeah every for

196
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,160
two weeks we had hail every night how

197
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,918
does one deal with torrential hail

198
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,520
storms like that in a ganja store in a

199
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:16,359
ganja Farm um you get real good at

200
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:19,680
seeing hail storms coming okay and you

201
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:23,759
put the tarps up you watch yeah tarps

202
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,720
buckets um that's with our inground

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,560
plants uh the hell storm that actually

204
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,280
hit our place um we were able to put 55

205
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,598
gallon trash buckets

206
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,279
over each of the plants so okay just

207
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:35,399
flip it upside down and give it a little

208
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:38,359
Hut

209
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,159
yeah um you know if they were bigger

210
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,000
further in the season we'll talk about a

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,360
hoop house in a minute sorry I didn't

212
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,240
mean to interrupt you there really loud

213
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,840
you're good um did the who hoop house

214
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,120
get [ __ ] up from that hail um it had a

215
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:53,399
shade cloth on it okay so you cool um

216
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,560
we'll talk we'll talk about a hoop house

217
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:56,038
toward the end I'll write that down

218
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,478
because that's we talked about it on a

219
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:59,800
previous episode but we should uh kind

220
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:01,399
of re rewind on that one when we can

221
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,598
last year it totally got [ __ ] up by

222
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:05,959
hell though so it is very possible so

223
00:08:04,598 --> 00:08:08,000
you guys you're gonna [ __ ] some [ __ ] up

224
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:09,560
Don't Be Afraid like shit's going to go

225
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,639
wrong but you always get next year oh

226
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,680
yeah and you'll you'll you'll Salvage

227
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:16,960
something out of your Harvest

228
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,519
yes yeah you almost always get something

229
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,878
unless thieves or cops that's the only

230
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,439
thing that's going to take it all that's

231
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,240
funny because I've got the word thieves

232
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:25,719
and cops written on a note later on in

233
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,400
this I'm glad we're on the same page

234
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,199
here this is awesome uh so so we've got

235
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:33,079
a few plants in

236
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,479
oh ideally ideally it would be on a

237
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:38,399
field in Humbolt county or somewhere

238
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:42,399
towarda or out in Ry on a south facing

239
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,480
slope with a big 18 foot tall chain link

240
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,000
fence where nobody can get in uh but

241
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,639
that that's not always going to happen

242
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,559
for you uh we're going to want these

243
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,679
plants plenty of space between them

244
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,599
you're going to want them outside you're

245
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,559
going to have to think about this

246
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,879
weather I'm kind of skipping ahead but

247
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,239
Jesse said you could put him out now and

248
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:59,240
then I thought about all the weather

249
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,600
we've been getting uh let's let's just

250
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,000
go right to the hoop house let's talk

251
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,079
about that it seems to be the ideal

252
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,440
outdoor if people want to go Outdoors

253
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:09,239
cheap uh to protect everything I think a

254
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,120
hoop house might be

255
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,879
uh yeah that's also the best way to get

256
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:19,600
the the best resin um okay production in

257
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:22,039
my opinion okay um out just straight up

258
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,200
outdoor tends to get dirty yeah and if

259
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:25,240
you're making concentrates you're going

260
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,720
to make dust concentrate beaten by the

261
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:32,879
sun um uh rained on you know all that

262
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:34,560
good stuff a simple hoop house covering

263
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,799
um can save you a lot of headaches it

264
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:40,359
can create a couple too but um as long

265
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:42,199
as it's tall enough you know realize the

266
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,440
strain you're you're growing do a little

267
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,079
research figure out how much you're

268
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,320
going to stretch or if you done this

269
00:09:46,078 --> 00:09:51,958
before you know you'll you know what's

270
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,760
up yeah um so plan for that they're

271
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:57,439
going to get big outside yeah yeah plan

272
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,360
plan for the size um and make sure you

273
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,880
have plenty of air flow at the top as a

274
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,800
greenhouse and at the bottom so air

275
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,039
fresh air in and old stale air out you

276
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,120
guys it's just as important as in the

277
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:10,199
grow and the humid air too that's

278
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:13,120
because the plants are transpiring and

279
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,000
the plastic traps the water in there

280
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,120
yeah so that's you got to get that out

281
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,159
of there all right yeah so let's uh real

282
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,839
quickly if you could describe to me how

283
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,240
to build a you know just a hoop house

284
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:26,880
that would fit in my backyard you know

285
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,720
maybe just like a 10 x 20 at the biggest

286
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,838
would be the most the just just you know

287
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,519
two or three minutes it's worth of how

288
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,240
to build a hoop house for sure real

289
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,879
simple

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,159
um I'm trying to think how simple um I

291
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:42,759
mean start with the frame the the bottom

292
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,519
all right so take like uh what size did

293
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:49,439
you say uh like a 10 x 20 10 x 20 uh get

294
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,320
you 20 uh so you'll need 40 foot of

295
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,360
lumber there or 30 foot of lumber there

296
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,920
um no don't yeah 60 yeah there you go

297
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:05,839
but I get you um I I forgot to the

298
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:09,319
two um it uh uh so bu build your frame

299
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,160
um just like a big box um secure It To

300
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,639
The Ground you don't even have to secure

301
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:15,159
it to the ground but it'll help the way

302
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:19,000
shit's been around here lately I would

303
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:22,039
secure it um and uh inside that frame

304
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,879
just bend your your PVC tubes you know

305
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,679
use like probably 20 foot tube or

306
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:28,399
something like or 20 foot stick on that

307
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:30,278
um and you know that's going to end you

308
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,839
up with

309
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:33,639
I think somewhere around a s foot

310
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,880
ceiling I want to say I'm not sure on

311
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:41,120
that though um but uh and then just

312
00:11:37,879 --> 00:11:44,278
continue down um you know this over 20

313
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,360
foot span you'd probably want i' I'd

314
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:49,480
recommend at least seven um probably go

315
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,039
for more like eight or nine so what

316
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,278
we're doing he's we so you've got a

317
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,759
rectangle you got a rectangle it's a 10

318
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,600
by 20 and then what we're going to do

319
00:11:54,759 --> 00:11:58,720
why we call it a hoop house we're taking

320
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,959
uh PVC tubing and it almost looks like

321
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,440
you're just using hula hoops and

322
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:04,719
building a long tube you make an arch

323
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,000
from and we're doing it the 10 foot to

324
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,440
10 foot side not the 20 in or the 20

325
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,679
foot so you go from 11 10 acoss you just

326
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
make an arch and that way it makes it

327
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:14,919
about s feet tall and then it's 10 feet

328
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,119
wide and then you do those about every

329
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:21,559
two or three three or four feet yeah

330
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,639
depending on how much wind um I I here

331
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:26,319
you know here um in the prairie in uh

332
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,759
Southern Colorado I'd probably recommend

333
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,360
it 3 foot all right so so about every

334
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:35,559
3et put a put another PVC uh tube and

335
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,759
attach that to uh the Box somehow to

336
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:40,119
your base uh what what do you use to

337
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,519
attach it um like a conduit clamp

338
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,519
perfect that's what I yeah and then I

339
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,278
also run a lag bolt through there I only

340
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,799
want run one bolt through there and I

341
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:51,958
drill it out um I've had them what would

342
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:55,039
you call it wallow them wallow their way

343
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,879
out and it rips the PVC okay and then

344
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:59,838
that's always fun when you get a a

345
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:03,078
springboarded PVC pipe just clipping up

346
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,399
in the middle of the night yeah so

347
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:06,919
catapult some [ __ ] across the the grow

348
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,159
all right so then you got the supports

349
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,278
going over and then do you put one

350
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:14,159
across the middle yeah um I'd actually

351
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:16,720
recommend three um so if you're thinking

352
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:21,519
of it like a clock there'd be one at

353
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,800
12:00 uh one at 9:00 and one at what

354
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,159
would that be two or three yeah okay

355
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,319
yeah nine and three all right that makes

356
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:29,559
sense okay so now you've got this like

357
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:31,800
Arch looking building with a beam that

358
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:35,359
goes down the middle on the top and then

359
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:37,439
down the 3:00 angle down the 9:00 angle

360
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,278
uh that feels pretty secure how do you

361
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:44,399
attach that top hole and the side uh the

362
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:47,240
beams that come across um fence posts is

363
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,360
the easiest way uh just dig a a fence

364
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:52,680
post at the end of um each end of the

365
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,959
greenhouse on a 20 foot one you might

366
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,679
want one in the middle too um and just

367
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,319
arrange the size so that it meets up

368
00:13:58,679 --> 00:14:05,159
with that skeleton beam and fasten it to

369
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,560
it with more uh conduit clamps okay

370
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:10,360
sounds like you've done this a several

371
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,119
dozen times yes all right all right so

372
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,039
now pretty much looks like we've got the

373
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,879
skeleton figured out basically right

374
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:18,399
yeah all right now how do we what do we

375
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:20,039
use for cover for a a top for this thing

376
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,679
to keep the hail and Rain off of our

377
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:27,039
beautiful plants it depends on your

378
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:30,239
budget um if you know uh if you're you

379
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:33,639
know low in budget

380
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,440
um a visqueen or just polyplastic from

381
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:39,959
Lowe's works great uh get the heavier

382
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:43,199
thicker Mill um and you know if you got

383
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:45,479
a better budget uh we sell Greenhouse

384
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,838
Fabrics lots of places sell Greenhouse

385
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:51,759
fabric so um and it ranges you know

386
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,800
that's I want to say it's

387
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:55,399
somewhere hell I don't even know I know

388
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,958
it goes up to like 10 bucks a square

389
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:00,759
foot so I mean it starts off way cheaper

390
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,399
than that okay but is high yeah yeah

391
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:03,440
yeah so guys you can afford this if you

392
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,919
guys work a little bit through the

393
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,199
winter you can build this next summer

394
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,479
and you can definitely have you an

395
00:15:06,198 --> 00:15:12,639
outdoor all right so now we covered up

396
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:17,320
how do you secure the uh the cover there

397
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:21,519
um um whatever they call them

398
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:23,600
uh it looks like a a battery uh uh

399
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,440
jumper cable clamp Oh okay little

400
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,839
alligator clamp yeah yeah yeah but

401
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,600
better but stronger yeah we we call them

402
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:30,639
spring clamps but I don't think that's

403
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,440
what the the nipple clamps yeah yeah

404
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,440
yeah yeah framing clamps all right all

405
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
right so that makes a lot of sense yeah

406
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,839
I'm going get them for like 250 at

407
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,318
Harbor Freight all right so go buy a

408
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,880
whole bucket of those yeah literally

409
00:15:40,318 --> 00:15:45,240
I've gone in there and bought like four

410
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,879
buckets of them yeah what are you doing

411
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,759
don't ask lady don't ask yeah all right

412
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,759
so you got this little hoop house uh you

413
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,039
should put a fan in the top guys like in

414
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,919
one of the Peaks at the end cut out a

415
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:57,399
the shape of the fan and hang a fan in

416
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,599
there because you're going to need to

417
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,519
get some air in and out if you can do a

418
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,600
blower like a grow room blower that's

419
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,120
even cooler those work great on the

420
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,079
ground um you can do one coming in uh

421
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,839
yeah one thing that sucks about those is

422
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:13,439
though uh they suck up rocks and a lot

423
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:15,720
of them have plastic blades in them so

424
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,480
take you a piece of ducting that's I

425
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,120
don't know like three foot long and

426
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,079
secure it to the side of the greenhouse

427
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,480
lift it up a little bit higher attach it

428
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:27,519
to the fan so that it can't soak any

429
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,399
rocks off ground oh man I can just I I

430
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,720
don't want to know what that sounds like

431
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,000
it yeah it's fun sounds like Keys like

432
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:35,680
keys in the blender I could imagine all

433
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,759
right so we've got air in we've got air

434
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:40,239
out we've got a nice little

435
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,639
Greenhouse um I don't want I'm going to

436
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,079
save that question right there what kind

437
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:45,639
of soil should we

438
00:16:43,078 --> 00:16:47,799
use um that depends on your budget and

439
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,000
just your grow style really I mean

440
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:53,639
should we put them straight into the

441
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,639
dirt do you think or should we use pots

442
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:59,519
um it you know it also depends on your

443
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:01,439
location I would tend to recommend pot

444
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,519
even though I would rather be able to

445
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,919
recommend planting in the ground but um

446
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:11,240
there's a little more to that um if you

447
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:14,759
go get like a 30-gallon smart pot um

448
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:17,519
outdoors I recommend the fabric pots

449
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:20,199
um and they they sell the tan ones now

450
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:22,078
too which are great because um they

451
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,439
reflect heat a little better than the

452
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,759
black ones that tend to absorb heat um

453
00:17:26,439 --> 00:17:29,759
but you know I mean if you just went

454
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,160
with your favorite potting soil

455
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:33,599
um just you know I recommend probably

456
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,200
going three times bigger than your

457
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,759
typical indoor container okay large

458
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,319
containers for you guys large containers

459
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,038
stick with your regular nutrient

460
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:45,000
schedule you know stick with what you're

461
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:47,400
comfortable with um you know if you want

462
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,519
to do Organics I could spend a whole

463
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,679
episode talking about there are some

464
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,319
episodes with sha you guys that are all

465
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,200
about amending soil and there are great

466
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:58,439
outdoor mixes in there and I mean that's

467
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,480
personally the way I grow um half of my

468
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,519
PL I I mean we do six plants in the

469
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,360
ground we do six plants in the light dep

470
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,319
Greenhouse um the ones in the ground

471
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,918
have been in that I've been grown in

472
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:13,759
that soil for eight years now um the

473
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,600
ones in the greenhouse get my homemade

474
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,640
mixture which is real similar to I don't

475
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:21,879
know Roots so Roots organic is good

476
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:23,799
stuff yeah all right and they get that

477
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,000
you know personally iow organic so they

478
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:28,240
get teas and I've been playing around

479
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,919
with ferments and stuff like that but

480
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,359
don't they love nice tea oh man you can

481
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:33,799
see the growth if you feed them a nice

482
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:36,839
tea those plants take off yeah

483
00:18:33,798 --> 00:18:38,480
especially with the Ki juice yeah so all

484
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,240
right so now we've got these plants in a

485
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,079
nice Ki juice oh I yeah I could go off

486
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,679
on a whole rant about that that one it

487
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:47,879
almost flew over my head but as Ki juice

488
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:51,080
I still don't know what what is that uh

489
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,880
lab lactic acid bacteria yeah and it's

490
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:54,879
that purple stuff and the fungus stuff

491
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,880
looking stuff is basically great white

492
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,120
you're making great white shark yeah I

493
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,080
have all kinds of names for it that oh

494
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,839
dud it smells like vomit it smells like

495
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:07,119
beer bar trash can puke yeah all right

496
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:08,798
so we've got this uh nice little light

497
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,558
dep Greenhouse we've got some plants in

498
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,400
really large pots or not light dep it's

499
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:13,798
just a little hoop house I mean we

500
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,000
didn't do light dep on this episode we

501
00:19:13,798 --> 00:19:17,240
may discuss that a little more in the

502
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,640
future we've done it once we may cover

503
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,038
if you're interested in the light dep

504
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,960
it's uh you put the plastic on you take

505
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:26,558
it off um you get another tarp to cover

506
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,120
up the Sun so that you can schedule the

507
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,960
[ __ ] to go to sleep every night at a

508
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:33,519
speciic you could teach anyone to do it

509
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,159
so and we talk about it in a in a past

510
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:38,158
episode yeah uh we we'll we'll go more

511
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:39,600
over that one in the future also uh so

512
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:42,200
you got them in this little hoop house

513
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,558
you've got large pots with decent soil

514
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,919
you're feeding uh nutrients that you're

515
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,918
familiar with or a bottled nutrient line

516
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,880
because that's uh probably

517
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,679
cost-effective if not our friend sea

518
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,960
will teach you a great soil recipe I'll

519
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,840
find the episode number and insert that

520
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,400
in the notes um outdoor plants tend to

521
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:03,839
use a little more food food um okay when

522
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,798
I've grown bottled nutrients Outdoors uh

523
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:09,319
we normally feed to the top end of the

524
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:12,400
recommendation if maybe even just a

525
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,960
little over um know this was with

526
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
General organic specifically yeah

527
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,720
because the plants can metabolize more

528
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,120
because of the sun and the more

529
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,159
available CO2 and the bigger root mass

530
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,879
so you think your gavitas are badass

531
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,559
they ain't got nothing on that one the

532
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,360
sun will kick your's ass uh somebody

533
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,879
asked me what kind of Lights to use and

534
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:32,839
I was like gas and they're like I've got

535
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,720
low ceilings I like yeah so stick with

536
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,639
your like lumex or

537
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,960
whatever yeah those Magnums or whatever

538
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,600
all right so now when should we expect

539
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,759
to see signs of

540
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,158
flower um Late July early August in

541
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:47,839
Southern Colorado depends on what

542
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:52,159
strains we're working with I'd imagine

543
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:54,119
that too um Inda seem to tend or I would

544
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,039
say in my experience indusco a little

545
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:57,839
quicker around here so very true the

546
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:59,519
flow will take off blueberry will be

547
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,678
almost done by the time Golden Goat

548
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,879
spits out pistols uh my my government

549
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:07,159
meal just kills It Outdoors like it's

550
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:10,640
it's

551
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:12,159
great all right um so speaking of mules

552
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,080
I'm just joking that is kind of good

553
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,400
though what kind of problems do you

554
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:20,558
think uh we should tell the people to be

555
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:24,400
prepared for um we get those damn little

556
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:27,960
moths yeah they lay eggs turn into

557
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,278
caterpillars yeah and they bore into

558
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,960
your bud

559
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:32,880
um if you're doing light dip and it's

560
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,720
early

561
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:40,440
season um you got watch out for molds um

562
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,798
Bud rot stuff like that um is that

563
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:47,120
something that can be stopped once it's

564
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:50,839
happened um mold um I mean we could

565
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:54,239
spend well I don't know PMS of a bastard

566
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:57,240
um yes I agree um I mean I personally

567
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,038
don't think you know a little on a fan

568
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,839
Leaf here or there right before Harvest

569
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,599
is one thing if it's on the bud it's

570
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:07,000
done in my opinion agree Bud rot um I

571
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:11,158
have just seen that for the first time

572
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,400
this year ever um and it was in it it

573
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:17,039
was in another light dep um that didn't

574
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:19,798
have good air circulation um once again

575
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:23,919
guys get that circulation up we've had a

576
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:25,960
very rainy spring um and lots of hell

577
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,919
and everything it just the humidity has

578
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,480
been so much higher than a lot of

579
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,278
outdoor growth ERS are used to dealing

580
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,960
with um around here so and we're using

581
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:37,599
swamp coolers to try to cool the house

582
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,759
on top of that his his loss or his

583
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:43,639
Harvest was by no means a total loss um

584
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,038
you know he probably lost a plant you

585
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,278
know combined out of I think he did 12

586
00:22:46,038 --> 00:22:49,640
plants in there or something like that

587
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:51,558
so okay that's not bad yeah I mean

588
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,640
that's the the rule of averages with

589
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:56,960
growing weed it's not like it was PM

590
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,919
where like you can smell it on buds that

591
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,640
weren't even affected and stuff like

592
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,960
like or at least what I've seen so

593
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,120
far uh how do we deal with animals what

594
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,880
kind of animals do you think we're going

595
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:13,359
to get um you know depends on where you

596
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:16,520
live uh deer love it cows love it every

597
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:19,319
everything that eats stuff loves it um

598
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:23,480
especially when it's well cared for

599
00:23:19,319 --> 00:23:25,879
so um if you know you know just prepare

600
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,798
for the animals in your area um even

601
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,240
cats and dogs going to say cats rabbits

602
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:31,558
squirrels all the domestic [ __ ] pest

603
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,558
animals are going to come at it too so

604
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:35,158
be prepared somehow like you got to

605
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:37,278
section it off somehow so these animals

606
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:39,760
don't get to it should we treat for bugs

607
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:40,919
Outdoors my theory on outdoor growing

608
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,839
you can correct me if I'm wrong you're

609
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,278
the outdoor guy I feel like if we don't

610
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:46,038
[ __ ] with nature nature will kind of

611
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:48,159
take care of itself for us like I feel

612
00:23:46,038 --> 00:23:50,480
like if I spray I'm going to upset the

613
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,600
whole system and a bug that wouldn't

614
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,640
normally dominate will dominate because

615
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,558
whatever should have been there to eat

616
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,840
it will be gone is that kind of right

617
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:01,158
and like where I grow I totally agree

618
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:05,720
with that um we use very minimal

619
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:06,640
pesticides um very strategic timing um

620
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,440
in a

621
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,120
greenhouse um you know it depends on how

622
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,360
sealed up your Greenhouse is um a lot of

623
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,479
times it's just like a growroom

624
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:21,199
environment um

625
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:24,440
so uh just don't overdo it you know it's

626
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,840
um it is a lot harder for in insects and

627
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:30,278
parasites to survive outside um I mean

628
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:32,278
it's the best room in the world it's

629
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:35,079
it's got perfect air flow and everything

630
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:37,798
so and and the sun yeah as long as the

631
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:40,519
plants are happy aren't stressed out you

632
00:24:37,798 --> 00:24:42,278
know I think ASM Max's probably the

633
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:44,839
strongest thing I've ever used Outdoors

634
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,440
so how do you feel about uh spin aad uh

635
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:48,119
that's great stuff um that's something

636
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,000
you can do to go after the moths and

637
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:53,199
stuff like that uh that's a something I

638
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,798
mean we have bees on our property too so

639
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,880
that's a you know always a consideration

640
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:01,759
um but spinosad is something that you

641
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,640
know we don't really worry about at all

642
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:06,278
um it's it's totally natural it's like

643
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:08,159
spraying a tea on the plants which we do

644
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:10,398
it's actually a it derives from a

645
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,278
bacteria found in the bottle of a rum

646
00:25:10,398 --> 00:25:15,798
jar or in the bottom of a rum jar yeah

647
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,119
yeah yeah yeah or a Brum barrel barrel I

648
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:18,879
think is what it I think the wood has

649
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,439
something to do with it yeah for sure

650
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,600
for sure I read that a long time ago

651
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:26,278
somewhere all right uh Captain Jacks

652
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:27,918
yeah Captain Jacks to the rescue

653
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:29,359
sometimes so we talked about all the

654
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,240
weather you you guys be prepared for a

655
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,479
lot of weather you're going to get heat

656
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,120
you're going to get hail you're going to

657
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,079
get rain you're going to get wind it's

658
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,959
going to be treacherous out there uh

659
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:40,359
imagine being stuck outside all the time

660
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,000
and not being able to come inside you're

661
00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:43,079
going to have to prepare for your plants

662
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,679
you're going to need to build them in a

663
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,879
dogghouse or something you're going to

664
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:48,640
need love all right also something I

665
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559
thought we should mention is be prepared

666
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,640
for a lot of watering I don't know if

667
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,398
you guys are prepared or realize how

668
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,840
much water your outdoor plants are going

669
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:59,278
to take uh how often do you water your

670
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:03,119
outdoor plants Jesse

671
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:06,000
um well up until you know normally it's

672
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:08,398
once a day um this year has been a

673
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,319
little different I haven't had to water

674
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,119
as much we've got a lot of rain it's

675
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,278
actually been a pain in the [ __ ] ass

676
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:17,759
uh my some of my plants are severely

677
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,679
stunted because of it so um don't catch

678
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,640
up though so yeah it'll dry out here

679
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,559
pretty soon yeah yeah we'll be missing

680
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,919
that evening rain yeah so uh what else

681
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:28,519
was I going to ask you in the middle of

682
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,038
flowering when they start budding out in

683
00:26:28,519 --> 00:26:33,639
the summer are you going to be watering

684
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:37,200
them twice uh probably so um inground

685
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:41,360
plants don't need to be watered as much

686
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:45,558
if you water them right you know okay um

687
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:49,000
15 20 gallons at a time um it's it's a a

688
00:26:45,558 --> 00:26:51,798
workout when we do um outdoor in

689
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:55,079
groundwater oh [ __ ] I bet um in the

690
00:26:51,798 --> 00:26:56,839
greenhouse I use the automated system so

691
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:00,278
I put little Sprinklers and everything

692
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:01,398
and sweet yeah that shit's yeah screw

693
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:03,640
that

694
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:07,079
[ __ ] but that just tells you how much

695
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:10,880
water um you know even smart pots in E

696
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:13,480
Outdoors um the the sun just bakes those

697
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,919
pots uh gutal Lowe's or something like

698
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,720
that just fill the side of one of their

699
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,640
you know of a rose pot or something like

700
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,759
that sitting outside um and I mean this

701
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,679
the sun just bakes it it gets so [ __ ]

702
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,319
hot and that gets your roots hot um

703
00:27:26,679 --> 00:27:30,080
which they can survive they just need

704
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,798
plenty of water to be able to handle it

705
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:34,759
so okay U also you said to put Mulch on

706
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:37,639
top of your pots also to kind of shade

707
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:40,079
them a little keep moisture in yeah yeah

708
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,880
uh in ground or in the pots um another

709
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:46,000
thing if you do have black pots outside

710
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,559
I recommend uh wrapping them in Panda

711
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,759
plastic with the wh side out okay make

712
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:54,000
them a little reflective yeah yeah in

713
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,679
all that I did that three started doing

714
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
that three years ago and it it seemed to

715
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,559
make a difference so cool that's yeah um

716
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,798
what I'd like to figure out for these

717
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:06,398
people is uh some no till um talk with

718
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:08,038
Sean some future stuff about it so yeah

719
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,319
no till his NE I've been looking into

720
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:12,398
that this year it was kind of a last

721
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,720
minute opportunity for them so once they

722
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,239
got the Required licensing and

723
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,759
everything they just went with what they

724
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,319
had

725
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,519
so um which wasn't

726
00:28:21,319 --> 00:28:25,119
much all right before my computer starts

727
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,720
tripping out too much here uh do you

728
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:27,719
have any tips for the people that are

729
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,519
starting to grow outdoors for their

730
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:35,519
first time this year um water a lot um

731
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:38,000
if you're in ground um just make sure

732
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:41,440
the water's soaking down into the soil

733
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,640
uh once it starts pulling up um give it

734
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,519
a minute you know see how long it takes

735
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,600
it for it to drain down into the soil

736
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:50,759
that that gives you a real good

737
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:52,519
indication of um how damp the soil is

738
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:55,240
cuz that you know a container is easy

739
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:58,278
you just got to pick it up um you know

740
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,720
and you should be able to through trial

741
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,599
ER figure out how uh how much water to

742
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,919
put in it how much it should weigh how

743
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,719
long it takes to dry out um the the

744
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:10,519
Earth can be a little more challenging

745
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:14,000
um uh to Aid in that water and put a

746
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:17,278
frame around the plant like a 3ft x 3

747
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,240
foot 2x4 frame and just put it on the

748
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:23,720
ground you can also attach uh the big

749
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,798
crazy uh tomato cages or you know plant

750
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,360
cages made out of fencing to them later

751
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:29,960
on so prune them out pull them out a

752
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:32,038
