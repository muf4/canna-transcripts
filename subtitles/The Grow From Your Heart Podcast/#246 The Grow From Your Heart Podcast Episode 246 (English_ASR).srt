00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:02,550
couple of weeks and then I saw this news

116
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,189
article so there's gonna be a little bit

117
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:08,280
of news on this episode and then I am

118
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:10,350
going to talk about how I got into the

119
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,029
cannabis industry um I was hanging out

120
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,080
with a few friends that have known me

121
00:05:12,029 --> 00:05:14,639
for quite a while and they're like dude

122
00:05:13,079 --> 00:05:16,709
how did you even get into this I was

123
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,089
like well that's a podcast topic so let

124
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:19,589

you guys can listen to the show so I'll

126
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:23,129
talk about that in a couple of minutes

127
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:24,720
before I get to the news article before

128
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:27,060
I get to talking about how I got into

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,669
the industry I want to give a little bit

130
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,098
of advice a friend asked me about foliar

131
00:05:29,668 --> 00:05:34,199
spray he's actually applying silver

132
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:35,728
thiosulfate to his plants so that he can

133
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:38,818
reverse his females into

134
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:41,550
males and make feminized seeds and he

135
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:43,289
asked me one question about foliar spray

136
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,360
that I thought I should help you guys

137
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:46,740
out with a little bit when you were

138
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,718
spraying your plants whether it be

139
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,150
foliar spray whether it be pesticides

140
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:54,088
whether it be silver thiosulfate to try

141
00:05:51,149 --> 00:05:55,888
to make male plants out of them however

142
00:05:54,088 --> 00:05:58,139
you are spraying them I highly suggest

143
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,908
that you either spray right when the

144
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,400
lights go off or that you turn the

145
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,870
lights off while you spray there are a

146
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,058
couple of reasons for this but my main

147
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:08,069
reason for this is that you don't want

148
00:06:06,059 --> 00:06:10,050
to spray your plants when you've got big

149
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,639
heavy high-intensity discharge lights

150
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,110
right above them because you're gonna

151
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,430
spray little bubbles all over your

152
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,139
plants you're gonna put this layer of

153
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:17,550
bubbles it's basically a bunch of

154
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,528
bubbles all over your plants if you want

155
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,848
a nice fine mist when you spray you're

156
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,408
gonna have bubbles all over your plants

157
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:23,968
plants are gonna be soaked and these

158
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:25,740
high-intensity discharge lights are

159
00:06:23,968 --> 00:06:27,329
gonna shine down onto those bubbles and

160
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,918
it's going to work kind of like a

161
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:30,449
magnifying glass remember when you're a

162
00:06:28,918 --> 00:06:32,998
little kid used to roast ants with a

163
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:34,259
magnifying glass I know not everybody

164
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:36,088
did that but a lot of the boys are not

165
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,229
their head going yeah we did that well

166
00:06:36,088 --> 00:06:39,930
you're gonna do the same thing to your

167
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:41,579
plant the lights are gonna act like the

168
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:43,168
Sun the bubble is gonna act like the

169
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:44,998
magnifying glass and your leaf is gonna

170
00:06:43,168 --> 00:06:46,468
get little white burn dots on it you're

171
00:06:44,999 --> 00:06:47,789
gonna be really confused as what it's

172
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:49,680
from you're gonna think a bug ate it you

173
00:06:47,788 --> 00:06:51,028
think you have a deficiency you're gonna

174
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,009
think something's messed up but honestly

175
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:54,269
what happened was you foliar spray and

176
00:06:53,009 --> 00:06:55,770
the light made a little bubble on there

177
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:57,778
and it burned the [ __ ] out of your

178
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:59,218
plants so I highly recommend either

179
00:06:57,778 --> 00:07:01,259
removing the plants from the light

180
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:02,610
turning off the light or waiting until

181
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,990
the light clicks off right when that

182
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:05,729
light clicks off if you've got a small

183
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:07,199
crop you should be able to get in there

184
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:08,758
and you should be able to spray that

185
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,169
entire crop in just a couple of minutes

186
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:11,459
and your plants won't even notice that

187
00:07:10,168 --> 00:07:12,568
you kept them up for a couple of extra

188
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:14,459
minutes and that way you're not gonna

189
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:16,139
get any burns on your plants from the

190
00:07:14,459 --> 00:07:17,728
light then you're not interrupting your

191
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,199
photo period and your plants are gonna

192
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,788
get all of the light that they should

193
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,499
have gotten throughout the day cycle so

194
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:24,180
I recommend spraying right as the lights

195
00:07:22,499 --> 00:07:26,879
go off or if you need to turn the lights

196
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,168
off or if you must just remove the

197
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,360
plants if you're only gonna spray one or

198
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:33,180
two plants like my friend fred is trying

199
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,399
to reverse a female plant into a male by

200
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,598
spraying it with silver thiosulfate and

201
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,879
I would just take that plant into

202
00:07:36,598 --> 00:07:40,319
another room I would almost take that

203
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,520
plant to another part of the house if

204
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,218
it's a home grow I would go out to the

205
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:46,258
garage and spray it out there because

206
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:48,000
that way you will not get any of that

207
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,919
silver thiosulfate on the plants that

208
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,800
you want to remain

209
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,990
so that's my guidance on that also Fred

210
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,669
let that plant that you've sprayed dry

211
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,408
before you return it to the grow room

212
00:07:56,668 --> 00:08:00,688
with the females because you don't want

213
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:02,550
to spread that liquid dripping silver

214
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,180
thiosulfate on to any of the other

215
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,650
plants

216
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,870
all right so that's my guidance on

217
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:09,209
foliar spray or pesticide application

218
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,379
mainly don't do it with the lights on

219
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,448
cuz you don't want to burn the [ __ ] out

220
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:13,770
of the plants alright now I've got a

221

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,190
something's going on in Pueblo County

238
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,570
you might not notice as you drive

239
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,040
through the town which shook a big hit

240
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,839
during the steel recession of the 80s

241
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,370
and has slowly been coming back but your

242
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,930
nostrils should get a clue once you

243
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,360
reach the outskirts where the aroma of

244
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:56,338
cannabis hits you although this isn't an

245
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,139
unusual odor in Colorado these days the

246
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:00,329
pot industry is in full bloom in the

247
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:01,649
county surrounding Pueblo I wish I could

248
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:03,419
write my high school guidance counselor

249
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:05,190
a letter about this says Michael Cadwell

250
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,169
Director of Sales for the Los Suenos

251
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,570
cannabis farm as he sniffs above the

252
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:12,299
size of a football this is the way we do

253
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:14,850
it he says excuse my coughing you guys I

254
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:17,189
was taking some dabs earlier los sueños

255
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:19,440
is a 36 acre farm just outside the city

256
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,510
in Pueblo County it's one of the largest

257
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,310
outdoor grows in the country unlike

258
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,958
Denver County this one does not require

259
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:27,059
that commercial cannabis cultivation be

260
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,129
confined inside and a stroll through the

261
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,719
four fields planted with 55 strains

262
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:33,269
shows what a difference the bright

263
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,370
southern Colorado Sun makes plants here

264
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:37,078
grow much taller and heavier and they

265
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,360
need to be tied to stakes just to stay

266
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:41,719
upright a high elevation increase and

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,129
increase in ultraviolet rays tricks

268
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,320
tricks the plant into higher resident

269
00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:49,019
resin production explains Erin Hovey

270
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,550
head grower at Los Suenos and the

271
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,459
natural sunlight is virtually year-round

272
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:55,289
he says still the area can get cold so

273
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:57,239
when the winter for winter frost hits

274
00:09:55,289 --> 00:09:59,669
loose los sueños an outdoor growing

275
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,860
becomes unfeasible Hovey and his team

276
00:09:59,669 --> 00:10:03,549
operate in four greenhouses a more

277
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,769
eco-friendly alternative to the light

278
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:07,719
warehouse setups in Denver you can have

279
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:09,278
a thousand lights in some huge warehouse

280
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,959
for massive production but that's not

281
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:14,169
what we're trying to do down here Hobie

282
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,549
says this is farming cannabis hope you

283
00:10:14,169 --> 00:10:17,169
grew up in North Carolina where he

284
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:17,919
started growing marijuana outdoors as a

285
00:10:17,169 --> 00:10:19,539
teenager

286
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,069
despite the objections of his parents

287
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:23,828
and local law enforcement he honed his

288
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,079
craft there before finding a legal

289
00:10:23,828 --> 00:10:28,929
heaven Haven in Pueblo County where he

290
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,789
now matures nurtures I'm sorry nurtures

291
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:32,919
the lives of more than 10,000 marijuana

292
00:10:30,789 --> 00:10:34,208
plants there's no playbook to growing

293
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:35,860
pot like this and there are no

294
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,509
guarantees with growing in the natural

295
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,940
elements but that's what makes it fun

296
00:10:37,509 --> 00:10:41,740
Hobie says you can't be successful at

297
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,870
this without good help when the hail and

298
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,959
mold hits you need people who know what

299
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:49,000
they are doing Kogi is just one of many

300
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,069
Coloradans who moved to Pueblo to work

301
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,269
with the legal marijuana the locals are

302
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:54,850
getting in on the action too

303
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:57,190
more than 1300 jobs were created in

304
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,690
Pueblo County in 2014 by the marijuana

305
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,670
industry according to a study by the

306
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:02,800
southern Colorado Colorado Growers

307
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:04,958
Association a staffing firm that helps

308
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,509
people land marijuana jobs opened in

309
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,189
Pueblo last February at the same time

310
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:11,350
Industrial vacancies decreased by more

311
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:13,600
than 15% and marijuana related

312
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,159
businesses accounted for 36% of new

313
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,649
commercial building projects in Pueblo

314
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,328
County in 2014 according to the Pueblo

315
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:21,278
County Regional Building Department

316
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:23,409
folks are quickly realizing that the

317
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,088
cost of cultivation is a lot less in

318
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:27,338
greenhouses and outdoor says Pueblo

319
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:28,959
County Commissioner Sal pace who is

320
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:31,329
championed the marijuana industry as a

321
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:34,809
form of economic growth in the area we

322
00:11:31,328 --> 00:11:36,909
have a very sizable rural rural agrarian

323
00:11:34,809 --> 00:11:38,649
portion here sorry I've never read that

324
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:40,958
word before and I probably should have

325
00:11:38,649 --> 00:11:42,370
when Coloradans voted to legalize the

326
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,750
growing and selling of recreational

327
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:45,310
marijuana they also agreed to allow

328
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,198
towns and counties to choose whether or

329
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:49,328
not to allow retail pot businesses

330
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:51,789
within their boundaries Denver already

331
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:53,799
the state epicenter of medical marijuana

332
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:55,778
quickly became the first retail

333
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:57,189
marijuana capital of the world while

334
00:11:55,778 --> 00:11:58,659
much of the rest of the state struggled

335
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,180
over the decision of whether to accept

336
00:11:58,659 --> 00:12:02,740
pot businesses and if so how to regulate

337
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,359
them but pace and his fellow

338
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,940
commissioners were keen on the idea of

339
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,680
an agricultural marijuana economy early

340
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:11,589
on and began issuing cultivation

341
00:12:08,679 --> 00:12:13,838
licenses in 2014 in hopes of spurring

342
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,029
local industry there are now cultivation

343
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,440
licenses for 33 medical operations and

344
00:12:16,028 --> 00:12:18,539
50

345
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,140
seven recreational operations in Pueblo

346
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:23,969
and Pueblo West County um let me clarify

347
00:12:22,139 --> 00:12:25,139
for people that are not from Colorado

348
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,940
there were a couple things in that

349
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:28,379
sentence I want to clarify us is there

350
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,150
are now cultivation licenses for

351
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:33,500
thirty-three medical operations and

352
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:36,090
fifty-seven recreational operations

353
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:39,419
recreational and medical are grown in

354
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:42,060
completely different areas there so if a

355
00:12:39,419 --> 00:12:43,559
grow applies to be a legalized girl with

356
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:45,149
the meed the marijuana Enforcement

357
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:49,338
Division they either apply to be a

358
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:50,899
medical grow or a recreational grow and

359
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:53,180
it's just the difference in licensing

360
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:55,759
it's how your planet count adds up it's

361
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:57,948
how your cannabis is handled so if your

362
00:12:55,759 --> 00:13:00,919
medicine if the cannabis is grown in a

363
00:12:57,948 --> 00:13:03,799
medical facility it can only be sold to

364
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:05,149
medical retail facilities if the

365
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:07,938
cannabis has grown in a recreational

366
00:13:05,149 --> 00:13:11,179
facility it can only be sold in a

367
00:13:07,938 --> 00:13:12,349
recreational retail establishment so

368
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:14,599
that's why they make the indication

369
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,430
there if it's recreational or a medical

370
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,800
marijuana facility and also they talk

371
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:21,438
about Pueblo and Pueblo West County

372
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:23,149
those are on the border of each other

373
00:13:21,438 --> 00:13:26,328
and there are a bunch I think there are

374
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:28,789
14 or 15 dispensaries in Pueblo West

375
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:30,859
which is just a small short quick drive

376
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:33,019
from the city of Pueblo actually worked

377
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,669
in Pueblo West and I live in the south

378
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:35,959
side of Pueblo and it used to take me

379
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:38,240
just 15 or 20 minutes to get there so

380
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:39,859
it's not like it's a distance and the

381
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,379
city of Puebla does not allow any

382
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,149
cannabis sales within city limits so

383
00:13:42,379 --> 00:13:46,249
everything that is sold is just in

384
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:47,720
Pueblo County and Pueblo West

385
00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:49,519
all right I've gotten off on a tangent

386
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:51,290
let's get back to the article that says

387
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,639
all of the although the city of Pueblo

388
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:54,338
allows cultivation it's been more

389
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,360
guarded in its approach to sales

390
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:58,430
recreational pot shops are still under a

391
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,680
moratorium in the city until a public

392
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:02,659
vote on the matter in November of 2016

393
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:04,729
so residents need to purchase their pot

394
00:14:02,659 --> 00:14:06,649
of at one of the thirteen recreational

395
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,289
shops in Pueblo County where retail

396
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:10,429
sales aren't illegal Pueblo City Council

397
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:12,409
is starting to come around on the

398
00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:14,508
medical side however and the first MMJ

399
00:14:12,409 --> 00:14:16,730
dispensary was in Pueblo city limits

400
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:18,379
opened in October bubbeleh natives

401
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,120
Stephen and Monique Duran who've been

402
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:21,470
together for 13 years started looking

403
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,568
into medical marijuana businesses

404
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:25,819
several years ago he started studying

405
00:14:23,568 --> 00:14:27,528
medical marijuana after his shift at the

406
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:31,009
Comanche power plant while Moni became a

407
00:14:27,528 --> 00:14:32,899
regulatory regulatory rules Wiz finally

408
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,370
after finding one of the rare buildings

409
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:36,889
in Pueblo that met all of the city's

410
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,360
Street stringent zoning requirements

411
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:40,549
through the marijuana operation which

412
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,259
include the location and a small council

413
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:44,299
approved industrial zone the Duran's

414
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:47,058
poured their savings into a lease for

415
00:14:44,299 --> 00:14:48,498
the building which is now the 7-1 9mm J

416
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:50,538
dispensary

417
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:51,918
there wasn't map the city had for us in

418
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:53,838
order to meet the requirements and it

419
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:55,278
was very very limited we found this

420
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,379
place which meant all of them Monique

421
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,568
says right now it's us and one employee

422
00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:00,739
running the store or just a couple but

423
00:14:59,568 --> 00:15:02,688
we want to be the model for how to

424
00:15:00,739 --> 00:15:04,309
properly medicate patients in Pueblo

425
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:06,408
there won't be many competitors

426
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:08,598
following that model though since zoning

427
00:15:06,408 --> 00:15:09,739
maps the zoning map is so restrictive

428
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:11,239
that only a few more Medical

429
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:13,519
dispensaries might manage to find a

430
00:15:11,239 --> 00:15:14,959
suitable spot within the city the

431
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,399
couples inspiration for seven one nine

432
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,228
came from watching Stephens sister

433
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,298
struggle through the difficulties of

434
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:21,709
multiple sclerosis and seeing how

435
00:15:20,298 --> 00:15:24,108
pharmaceutical marijuana may keep

436
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:25,758
medication affected her this was just a

437
00:15:24,109 --> 00:15:27,469
different person on the she was just a

438
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,688
different person on those meds says

439
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:31,849
Steven seeing what real patients have to

440
00:15:29,688 --> 00:15:33,738
fight through was some strong motivation

441
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:35,569
now these homegrown owners are happy

442
00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:37,369
with what they've created is coming in

443
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:39,139
the shop and looking around has two kids

444
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:41,149
from Pueblo who never really had much

445
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:43,548
sometimes it's like a dream Monique says

446
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:46,129
it's such a cool story and we hope to

447
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:48,468
make it a better one it's a big shot at

448
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:49,699
the Pueblo Colorado several years ago

449
00:15:48,469 --> 00:15:50,929
like the article said this town was

450
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:53,058
falling apart when I used to tell people

451
00:15:50,928 --> 00:15:54,619
that I'm from Pueblo Colorado they would

452
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:55,219
laugh at me they would not take me

453
00:15:54,619 --> 00:15:57,709
seriously

454
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,509
now when I'm in Denver or Colorado

455
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:01,038
Springs and I say that I am from Pueblo

456
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:02,479

was made with propane let me open up

483
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:18,849
some shatter that was made with butane

484
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,680
so that I can compare them side-by-side

485
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,789
and kind of give you a little a better

486
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,620
description of what I'm working with

487
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:26,109
here so the shatter most you guys are

488
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:29,789
familiar with shatter shatter is an

489
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:33,099
amber II colored sort of a honey colored

490
00:17:29,789 --> 00:17:37,539
slab of shatter it's a little thin sheet

491
00:17:33,099 --> 00:17:38,859
of real if I bend it it cracks like

492
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:40,990
it'll just pop off and some of it will

493
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:42,789
chip off and go flying away when you're

494
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,339
watching Jurassic Park all those big

495
00:17:42,789 --> 00:17:47,200
slabs of like the amber resin that the

496
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:49,059
bugs are kept in that the bugs are stuck

497
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,440
in that is what shatter looks like in my

498
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:53,139
opinion I think that stuff looks like

499
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:55,090
shatter so compared to the shatter I'm

500
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:58,690
gonna open up this pho and take a look

501
00:17:55,089 --> 00:18:01,750
this is propane honey oil it looks like

502
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:04,330
aa and it looks like a piece of soap

503
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,089
it's really lightly colored it almost

504
00:18:04,329 --> 00:18:08,799
resembles since it's holiday time this

505
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:11,139
looks like a small piece of Amanda's

506
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,029
peanut butter fudge yeah if somebody cut

507
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,470
Amanda's peanut butter fudge perfectly

508
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:15,799
smooth I think it would look just like

509
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,569
this stuff

510
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:19,009
I just noticed that there was a kind of

511
00:18:17,569 --> 00:18:20,480
a shitty technical difficulty with my

512
00:18:19,009 --> 00:18:22,759
microphone so I apologize if part of the

513
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,589
show was subpar quality that is not my

514
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:25,789
style I'll do my best to fix it but I

515
00:18:24,589 --> 00:18:26,720
just noticed if there wasn't something

516
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:28,819
working properly

517
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,380
so shout out to the failed cable pretty

518
00:18:28,819 --> 00:18:32,210
sure it's just an XLR cable it needs to

519
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,620
be replaced not a big deal anyway I was

520
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,910
talking about this hash I'm picking some

521
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:37,579
of some of it up right now

522
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,529
this is much easier to handle and deal

523
00:18:37,579 --> 00:18:41,449
with and work with and shatter shatter

524
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:43,430
is real sticky it'll stick to your

525
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:45,140
fingers when you break it it'll break

526
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:47,450
off when your fingers heat it up it gets

527
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,370
kind of goopy I'm holding on to this pho

528
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,380
and I would be able I am able to break

529
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:53,329
off little dabs for myself I'm able to

530
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:55,340
break off big ass dabs for myself and

531
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:57,230
little dabs for my friends it's much

532
00:18:55,339 --> 00:19:00,039
easier to handle I just took a few dabs

533
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:03,620
of it one thing that I can really say

534
00:19:00,039 --> 00:19:06,920
this stuff is flavorful it's got a

535
00:19:03,619 --> 00:19:08,539
really sweet really dank flavor to it I

536
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:10,820
can't even properly describe the flavor

537
00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:13,250
of it it's got a cushy flavor to it it

538
00:19:10,819 --> 00:19:16,730
tastes the essence of cannabis is really

539
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:18,230
in the pho I was skeptical at first but

540
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:19,789
a friend of mine that works at just at a

541
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:21,259
dispensary she convinced me that I

542
00:19:19,789 --> 00:19:22,940
wanted to try some of it so I grabbed

543
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:25,430
myself a gram and you know what I

544
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,900

00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:28,610
the company here I don't usually do this

546
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,040

547
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:33,199
facility but I am gonna give a huge

548
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:36,769

was gonna come back and talk a little

560
00:19:56,930 --> 00:20:01,820
bit about how I got myself into the

561
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,160
cannabis industry let me get into that

562
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:05,659
um I'm grabbing I wrote a couple little

563
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,950
notes here nothing major I just took a

564
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:08,960
couple little bullet points while I was

565
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,779
dabbing so I wanted to say that I was in

566
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,370
the cannabis industry illegally before

567
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:16,339
the cannabis industry ever existed you

568
00:20:13,369 --> 00:20:17,839
guys I don't know how much of this I

569
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:19,669
should talk about or admit but we're

570
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,099
were beyond that right the statute of

571
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:24,920
limitations is probably gone if I admit

572
00:20:22,099 --> 00:20:26,299
to any criminal activity anyway when I

573
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:28,400
moved here from California I was going

574
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:29,899
to high school here and our little crew

575
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,040
I was on a camping trip

576
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,920
somebody pulled out a pipe and we

577
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,960
started smoking and I was like nice some

578
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,590
weed Z&amp;C weed since I've left California

579
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,759
so we got stoned and then I was like all

580
00:20:39,589 --> 00:20:41,750
right all my friends smoked weed that

581
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:43,369
means we're gonna have to find spore to

582
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,529
buy weed none of our crew really had a

583
00:20:43,369 --> 00:20:47,029
weed guy yet and I knew that a couple of

584
00:20:45,529 --> 00:20:49,279
the guys at school were hustling weed

585
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:51,230
but they didn't really there were some

586
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:54,109
racial tensions there in my school back

587
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:55,579
in that time the Mexican guys hung out

588
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:56,839
with the Mexican guys and the white guys

589
00:20:55,579 --> 00:20:58,220
hung out with the white guys and we

590
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,889
didn't fight or anything it's just kind

591
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:03,410
of what those groups did we didn't there

592
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,910
was there's no reason for us to mix we

593
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:06,560
were over here listening to Green Day

594
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,180
and Nirvana and fish and they were over

595
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,980
there listening to I don't even know do

596
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,880
Cypress Hill is one of the things I

597
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:14,210
remember they listened to a whole bunch

598
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,830
of but anyway ah I was brave enough to

599
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,390
hit up one of the Mexican guys that I

600
00:21:15,829 --> 00:21:19,339
knew sold weed I was like hey he could

601
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:20,780
sell me some weed he was kind of leery

602
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:22,639
about it at first but he's like yep she

603
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,559
have to buy ounces and at that time

604
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,630
we're just high school kids so announces

605
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,960
a little bit of a stretch so I made it

606
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:27,950
happen

607
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,299
I bought her an ounce and I started

608
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,750
hustling a little bit of that herb to my

609
00:21:29,299 --> 00:21:34,700
friends and then uh those guys were

610
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,839
heavily connected and they were like

611
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,069
you're movin ounces you're gonna start

612
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:38,779
movin pounds now and they started

613
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:40,490
throwing me pounds for dirty dirty cheap

614
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:42,019
around here in this town I was had the

615
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,750
cheapest hookup on pounds around here

616
00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:47,869
for a while until one day I was selling

617
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:50,269
a pound on the east side of town and a

618
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:51,889
couple of guys with face tattoos and

619
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:53,599
assault rifles walked up to my car and

620
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:55,280
they did not take my [ __ ] from me I was

621
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,869
so amazed but they told me that I was

622
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,940
not allowed to be selling my product on

623
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:00,649
that side of town that I was able to

624
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:02,059
sell my product on the north and south

625
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,920
ends of town but don't [ __ ] with the

626
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,089
east and west side and if they see me

627
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:07,640
again they're gonna take all my [ __ ]

628
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:10,099
from me and they sent me home nicely so

629
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,720
I kind of just became the street dude I

630
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:13,909
hustled the brick weed the Mexican brick

631
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,620
weed from a couple of friends that were

632
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:16,790
just flooding it to me so since since

633
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:18,799
none other white guys in my neighborhood

634
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:20,359
wanted to talk to these Mexican guys I

635
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,829
was just getting pounds from the Mexican

636
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:23,779
guys and just selling at all my gringo

637
00:22:21,829 --> 00:22:25,369
friends and it was working out for me so

638
00:22:23,779 --> 00:22:26,569
that's gonna where I made my break into

639
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:30,349
the weed scene that's how I learned how

640
00:22:26,569 --> 00:22:32,089
to hustle all of that is a fictional

641
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:33,500
tale if you were involved in any sort of

642
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:35,149
law enforcement I just made that up

643
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,529
I'm writing a book and that is all going

644
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:38,300
to be in the fictional book I'm writing

645
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:41,690
all right so how's that feel all right

646
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:42,980
so then let's see I'm smoking and

647
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,509
hustling and doing my thing several

648
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:46,009
years go by

649
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:48,609
I learned how to grow actually I learned

650
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,609
how to grow

651
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:52,500
I had a guide that lived in the same

652
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:54,869
apartment building as me when I was like

653
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,250
7 years old and that guy was growing

654
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:59,609
wheat in his backyard and I would listen

655
00:22:56,250 --> 00:23:01,980
to his conversations between my friend

656
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:03,149
Wayne and my uncle Eric and this dude

657
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,220
and they would talk about how to grill

658
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:06,960
weed I was like somewhere between 7 to

659
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,669
10 years old when I lived there and I

660
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,500
absorbed so much information from that

661
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:11,940
conversation that I felt like I was

662
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,609
destined to grow weed at some point in

663
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:16,169
time so we jump way forward into the

664
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:18,359
early 2000s I couldn't even tell you

665
00:23:16,169 --> 00:23:21,780
exactly which year a friend of mine was

666
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:23,759
growing some weed I in Colorado and he

667
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:24,899
needed a hand and so I went helped him

668
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,089
out he didn't let me do a whole bunch

669
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,240
but he let me he exposed me to some

670
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:31,678
things so I learned how to do that and I

671
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,109
got good at that then I moved to

672
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,850
Lawrence Kansas that just for unrelated

673
00:23:34,109 --> 00:23:38,009
reasons for musical reasons I changed

674
00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:39,599
tube and chase the dream of being in a

675
00:23:38,009 --> 00:23:40,859
band and went and played Lawrence Kansas

676
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,529
for several years travelled around the

677
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:45,178
Midwest but anyway a friend of mine

678
00:23:43,529 --> 00:23:47,279
there had a place where we would play

679
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:49,980
music and one day I was playing the

680
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,700
drums and I looked up I don't know why I

681
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,650
looked up when you're playing the drums

682
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:53,759
your eyes just wander your eyes just go

683
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,259
places you get bored a staring at the

684
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:57,359
guitar players back all day guitar

685
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:59,908
players asses are all to you so I looked

686
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,129
up and I see this light coming from the

687
00:23:59,909 --> 00:24:03,570
Attic and I'm like oh [ __ ] that's a

688
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:05,190
high-intensity discharge like they've

689
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:06,899
got an HPS light up there they're

690
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,009
growing some [ __ ] weed up there and

691
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,500
it's just like the crawlspace in the

692
00:24:08,009 --> 00:24:12,119
garage a little storage area so I waited

693
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,890
for everybody leave except for the dude

694
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,019
that owns the place it was his space and

695
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:17,490
I go hey bro not to be an [ __ ] but I

696
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,019
got hit in the face with the grow light

697
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,788
a couple of times up there what you got

698
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,069
up there and he kind of looked at me

699
00:24:20,788 --> 00:24:24,869
like huh weed smoke together we drank

700
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:26,908
together we're pros so he goes what do

701
00:24:24,869 --> 00:24:28,589
you know about aggro and I was like I'm

702
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:29,909
I'm okay in a girl I've never been like

703
00:24:28,589 --> 00:24:31,769
in charge of a girl but I've been a

704
00:24:29,909 --> 00:24:33,179
helper plenty of times you know and he's

705
00:24:31,769 --> 00:24:35,099
like well then come up here help me out

706
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:36,419
he's like I got a problem I need help

707
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,980
doing this and I'm gonna be out of town

708
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:40,500
for a few days can you take over I was

709
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,029
like sure so he goes out of town and he

710
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,159
ended up getting in trouble and he was

711
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:45,480
gone for several days way more days than

712
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,390
expected so I kind of took care of that

713
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,319
crop a harvest time came

714
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,700
and I was there through the whole

715
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,169
harvest I helped the dude pull down the

716
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,819
plants I helped him tram I got paid

717
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:55,740
pretty decently for helping him trim

718
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:57,119
some weed and this is in Kansas you guys

719
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:58,679
so I got paid a little extra because

720
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,449
we're really running a risk being in

721
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,600
Kansas the laws it was still completely

722
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:05,670
illegal and we were growing in basically

723
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,279
a jam space where we had a band practice

724
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,440
set up so we were begging for attention

725
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:11,879
every day with plants just right above

726
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,769
my head I could reach up and touch the

727
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,150
ceiling where these plants were sitting

728
00:25:13,769 --> 00:25:18,029
on actually which would be the floor on

729
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:19,740
the opposite side so I got to finish

730
00:25:18,029 --> 00:25:22,319
that crop with my buddy in Kansas I

731
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:23,940
actually brought some of that that we

732
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,798
grew what I got paid with I brought that

733
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,120
back to Colorado and shared that with a

734
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:28,349
lot of my friends here at my friend's

735
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:29,969
are like dude you guys kind of killed it

736
00:25:28,349 --> 00:25:31,769
and they were kind of impressed with my

737
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:34,110
herb so I had to move back to Colorado

738
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,150
for some family reasons my grandparents

739
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:38,519
were passing I came to spend the kind of

740
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:40,019
final days with them you know it was one

741
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,400
of my good excuses to get away Lawrence

742
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:43,079
Kansas was [ __ ] me up you guys I

743
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,669
became an alcoholic I became a drug

744
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:46,019
addict I needed to get away from there

745
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:49,169
change my life and honestly I have not

746
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:51,240
drank since Lawrence Kansas not blaming

747
00:25:49,169 --> 00:25:52,740
it on Kansas but once I left there is I

748
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,690
was able to get away from that lifestyle

749
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:57,359
and I feel like I'm way more productive

750
00:25:53,690 --> 00:26:00,000
anyway I moved back to Colorado and I

751
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:03,119
get a you know medical marijuana card

752
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,410
and there's not a lot of weed on the

753
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,109
streets anymore and the weed that I can

754
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,400
find isn't up to the expectations that

755
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:10,849
I'm looking for and it's not as

756
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,048
available as I would like it to be so

757
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:14,519
again a medical marijuana card and I

758
00:26:13,048 --> 00:26:16,710
told myself that when I got this medical

759
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,150
marijuana card I would quit drinking now

760
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:19,769
that there's as much cannabis available

761
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,690
as I want why do I need to drink right

762
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:23,730
so I go to a couple of dispensaries and

763
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:25,350
some of them were okay this was when it

764
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,450
was the wild wild west you guys this was

765
00:26:25,349 --> 00:26:28,678
way different so I go to a couple of

766
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:30,120
dispensaries and I don't really see

767
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,400
anything that impresses me but I made

768
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,289
friends all over the industry and then

769
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,910
one day somebody told me hey there's a

770
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:38,099
new dispensary in your neighborhood but

771
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:39,570
it's kind of a private deal and they

772
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:41,579
told me that you had to call this number

773
00:26:39,569 --> 00:26:42,960
first and then they would tell you where

774
00:26:41,579 --> 00:26:44,308
to go and then you had to knock on the

775
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,490
door at the back of this building and

776
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:49,289
they would let you win so ah I get my

777
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,429
card ready I get my ID and I called the

778
00:26:49,289 --> 00:26:51,899
number and the guy's like sure I'll be

779
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:54,179
home in about a half hour it's my house

780
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,340
just come knock on my door so I knock on

781
00:26:54,179 --> 00:26:57,360
his door and he lets me and he's up so

782
00:26:56,339 --> 00:26:58,859
there was an old health food store

783
00:26:57,359 --> 00:26:59,949
downtown and it was a three-story

784
00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:01,959
building

785
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,370
you have to walk up the back stairs to

786
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,778
the third storey and knock on the door

787
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:06,969
and this dude had an apartment up there

788
00:27:04,778 --> 00:27:08,859
and he would ask for your ID in your

789
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,389
medical marijuana card then he would

790
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:11,678
have you sit on the couch and then he

791
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:13,000
would light up a joint and smoke with

792
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,639
you and then after you smoked about half

793
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,470
the joint he would bring out a couple of

794
00:27:15,638 --> 00:27:18,579
different bags of weed I remember one of

795
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,950
the first ones he showed me was

796
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:23,408
chocolate chunk and then he had ak-47

797
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:25,149
Northern Lights there was another one I

798
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:26,320
can't remember I wish I remembered but I

799
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:28,509
remember the chocolate chunk got my

800
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:30,369
attention so he comes and shows me he

801
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:32,200
shows you these strains and then he only

802
00:27:30,369 --> 00:27:33,428
let me buy a quarter the first time he's

803
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,110
like no I don't know you I don't know he

804
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:36,610
checked my medical marijuana papers - he

805
00:27:35,109 --> 00:27:39,638
made a copy of my ID and my medical

806
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:41,589
marijuana card and sold me a quarter I

807
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:43,028
told me that I could come back every day

808
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:46,329
if I wanted we'd make friends and all

809
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:47,919
that stuff so I was kind of grabbed an

810
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:49,569
herb for other people I would go get

811
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,460
weed for the girl I was dating at the

812
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:53,079
time I would grab weed for my neighbor

813
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,730
there was a DJ friend of mine who needed

814
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,230
weed all the time and I was the only one

815
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,690
that really knew about this dispensary

816
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,190
in my group so I would go there every

817
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:02,169

doorbell and then he'd let me in and

821
00:28:05,648 --> 00:28:08,469
we'd sit on the couch smoke a joint he'd

822
00:28:07,089 --> 00:28:09,668
saw me a couple of quarters and every

823
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:11,380

835
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,950

911
00:30:35,299 --> 00:30:39,710
of his bedroom and I was running the

912
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:41,209
crow on the second storey and then he

913
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,100
would have to go run errands he would do

914
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:44,180
deliveries also at this time it was kind

915
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,319
it might have been illegal back in the

916
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:48,350
day but whatever that's already passed

917
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:49,639
ah he was going to do deliveries and

918
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:51,439
he'd be like hey bro people are coming

919
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,660
up to the store will you be able to help

920
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,160
them out I was like I got this and so

921
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:56,810
one night I'm helping we actually had

922
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:58,700
medical marijuana patients that would

923
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:01,159
show up these people were really sick

924
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:03,110
and we were a real dispensary so one

925
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:05,090
night there was an elderly couple came

926
00:31:03,109 --> 00:31:07,609
and I'll never forget him this lady was

927
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:10,309
actually sick and we sat on the couch

928
00:31:07,609 --> 00:31:11,569
and as I was having the conversation the

929
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:14,299
guy that was running this dispensary

930
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,799
showed up and he got to hear me explain

931
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:20,399
the differences between indicas and

932
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:22,500
sativas and he let me he got to hear me

933
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,090
tear gift for this woman I built a

934
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,559
relationship with her over a few minutes

935
00:31:24,089 --> 00:31:27,389
and figured out what's wrong with her

936
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:29,279
whoa why is she sick how she likes to

937
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:31,470
consume cannabis what she's consuming

938
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,029
for how it makes her feel if in because

939
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:34,440
her sativas worked better for her what

940
00:31:33,029 --> 00:31:36,779
the difference is between indicas and

941
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:38,820
sativas I spent 30 minutes talking with

942
00:31:36,779 --> 00:31:40,379
this lady to make sure that I sold her

943
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:41,819
the right cannabis and to make her feel

944
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,860
comfortable it was her first time buying

945
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:45,480
cannabis from a store so this dude that

946
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:48,240
actually ran the place walked in and saw

947
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:50,069
me doing this and he's like bro you were

948
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,630
amazing at that I have no business doing

949
00:31:50,069 --> 00:31:53,369
it after seeing what you just did with

950
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,690
that lady so he's like you were kind of

951
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,789
now the budtender guy oh there wasn't

952
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:58,680
the word budtender I don't think existed

953
00:31:56,789 --> 00:32:00,059
at that point so he's like you were now

954
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,340
the sales guy you're gonna be dealing

955
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:04,559
with the customers and I've got this so

956
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:06,509
I would grow weed most of the day and

957
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,769
deal with the customers and then I

958
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,480
realized I was like we've got a

959
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:10,710
dispensary on the third storey I was

960
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,360
like why don't we have this down on the

961
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:13,950
first floor where everybody can access

962
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:16,229
it and they said that the city asked

963
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:19,410
them not to do that and I was like we've

964
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:20,789
got all the proper licensing um Monday

965
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:22,860
when I come in I'm going to move this

966
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:24,240
door down to the first floor and you

967
00:32:22,859 --> 00:32:25,859
know we went to the second storey first

968
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,029
we moved we cleaned out an area and went

969
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:28,469
to the second storey so that you could

970
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:30,539
come into the first door on the bottom

971
00:32:28,470 --> 00:32:31,769
story and it would be a little office

972
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:33,149
area and we'd greet you and then we'd

973
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:34,559
take you up to the second floor and sell

974
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:36,780
you buds we did that for a little while

975
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:38,220
and then I just kept getting braver and

976
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,779
ballsier I was like you know we got to

977
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,309
move this down to the first floor where

978
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:43,200
the handicapped people could come it's a

979
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:45,809
medical marijuana dispensary so we moved

980
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,100
it to the first floor and the owner was

981
00:32:45,809 --> 00:32:48,539
really excited about what I was doing

982
00:32:47,099 --> 00:32:49,500
he's like I love that you got balls he's

983
00:32:48,539 --> 00:32:50,789
like I love that you can help the

984
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,170
customers he's like I love the way you

985
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:54,269
deal with things you know about cannabis

986
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,830
you can grow so he gave me a full-time

987
00:32:54,269 --> 00:32:59,039
position ah

988
00:32:55,829 --> 00:33:01,379
and eventually the guy that hired me

989
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,149
ended up moving on to open his own

990
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:05,910
business he wanted to open his own

991
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,080
dispensary because he was ah he learned

992
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:08,310
how to run it pretty much he saw

993
00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:09,720
everything he needed to do he had a

994
00:33:08,309 --> 00:33:11,609
dream of opening his own shop he didn't

995
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,769
want to work for my friend Tom shot at

996
00:33:11,609 --> 00:33:16,139
the tom sexton and Karen Garnett they're

997
00:33:13,769 --> 00:33:17,700
the ones who gave me a shot other than

998
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,560
Richard under Richard Richard is the one

999
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,759
that kind of told them to hire me but

1000
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:22,460
then they trusted me with their shop and

1001
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:24,779
gave me a shot so one day Richard left

1002
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,789
there's a whole nother story on that if

1003
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:27,899
you guys know me you know that story

1004
00:33:26,789 --> 00:33:29,079
there and I'm not ever gonna tell that

1005
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,690
on a podcast

1006
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:33,099
so Richard left one day Tom and Karen

1007
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:34,840
came over to try to run the store I

1008
00:33:33,099 --> 00:33:37,029
pretty much had the store under control

1009
00:33:34,839 --> 00:33:39,220
I knew what I was doing I knew all of

1010
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:41,170

1025
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:05,829
would check people in when they got

1026
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:07,630

your patient bill is heading back so

1031
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:18,340
they'd come back and see me the owner

1032
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,500
that originally owned the place would

1033
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,240
show up every day and I'm kind of a

1034
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,320
systems guy I make like systems and

1035
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,579
procedures when you're running a

1036
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,890
dispensary you've got to have like

1037
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:28,539
procedures in the way that [ __ ] flows or

1038
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,369
[ __ ] doesn't flow properly just like any

1039
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:32,739
real business needs so I would set up

1040
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:34,119
procedures and systems and nothing

1041
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,009
against my friend Tom who owned the

1042
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:38,109
place but he's an old southern boy from

1043
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,870
North Carolina and he doesn't believe in

1044
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:43,269
any sort of systems or order or putting

1045
00:34:40,869 --> 00:34:45,400
things here or doing things this way he

1046
00:34:43,269 --> 00:34:46,509
just wants to smoke a joint and things

1047
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,230
happen the way they do which is

1048
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,270
beautiful

1049
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:50,920
but it doesn't work for business so one

1050
00:34:49,269 --> 00:34:53,469
day I had to get the balls and I had to

1051
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,820
say hey Tom the best thing for your

1052
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:56,109
business right now would be for you to

1053
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,580
go on the mountain and grow the weed

1054
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,200
that you grow and bring that weed back

1055
00:34:57,579 --> 00:35:01,119
to the dispensary and let me sell it and

1056
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:02,230
you get the hell out of here he's like

1057
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,219
you really think so and I was like I

1058
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,539
love you but you don't know how to run a

1059
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:05,739
business dude you're kind of a train

1060
00:35:04,539 --> 00:35:07,090
wreck when it comes to a retail

1061
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:09,039
establishment and he took it very well

1062
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:10,539
so he handed me the keys and he said

1063
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,250
young man you got yourself a dispensary

1064
00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:15,279
don't do me wrong and he left and he let

1065
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:17,619
me run that dispensary we ran that for

1066
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,850
quite a while that's how I met our

1067
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,699
friend white Mike that comes on the

1068
00:35:18,849 --> 00:35:23,980
podcast here I met Mike there I hired

1069
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:25,899
Mike Mike was the first person I ever

1070
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,760
hired the first time I ever hired

1071
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,650
anybody is an employee it was Mike I

1072
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,440
hired Mike to work as a backup bud

1073
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:35,450
tender at metamour ministries dispensary

1074
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:37,460
in Pueblo Colorado that's how we met

1075
00:35:35,449 --> 00:35:40,548
so I hired a few people the shop got

1076
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:42,139
huge we were the only shop in town we

1077
00:35:40,548 --> 00:35:43,579
were the most popular shop in this part

1078
00:35:42,139 --> 00:35:45,558
of Colorado for a little while

1079
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:47,500
we hired a couple more employees we

1080
00:35:45,559 --> 00:35:50,240
heard several more employees we had

1081
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:52,760
Jordan and Andrea is backup bud tenders

1082
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,108
and computer people and managers but

1083
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,490
anyway I'm kind of getting sidetracked

1084
00:35:54,108 --> 00:35:56,960
here talking about madam R I'm

1085
00:35:55,489 --> 00:35:59,539
reminiscing in my own head

1086
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:01,369
one day a city manager and a police

1087
00:35:59,539 --> 00:36:02,900
officer came in and handed us a cease

1088
00:36:01,369 --> 00:36:05,030
and desist letter that said we can no

1089
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,389
longer serve cannabis out of that

1090
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,920
location so we pretty much all of the

1091
00:36:08,389 --> 00:36:11,659
patients that were in the store we gave

1092
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,010
them most of the product that was on the

1093
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:14,179
shelf because we were now closed there

1094
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:16,309
was nothing we could do with it I

1095
00:36:14,179 --> 00:36:18,108
remember I picked the jar of Sour Diesel

1096
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:19,730
might pick the jar of Chocolate Chunk

1097
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:21,348
Jordan picked a jar of what he liked an

1098
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,030
Andrea picked a jar of what he liked we

1099
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:24,318
took those jars the boss was like go get

1100
00:36:23,030 --> 00:36:25,700
a jar do whatever you want I don't care

1101
00:36:24,318 --> 00:36:28,969
what happens to the product we're closed

1102
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:30,230
you can have the [ __ ] so the owner gave

1103
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,879
us the product we gave most of the

1104
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,949
edibles and all that like perishable

1105
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,539
stuff to all the people did so when the

1106
00:36:33,949 --> 00:36:37,250
cop came in a bunch of people just left

1107
00:36:35,539 --> 00:36:37,608
they're like [ __ ] this and they got out

1108
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,960
of there

1109
00:36:37,608 --> 00:36:40,308
but the people that snuck around they

1110
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,440
got a lot of free products we just gave

1111
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:44,750
all that [ __ ] away and then met amar was

1112
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,780

1113
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:49,099

00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:37,719
was completely legal and compliant with

1137
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:40,029
the state of Colorado because I was a

1138
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:41,859
private registered caregiver for five

1139
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,300
other medical marijuana patients and

1140
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,269
myself which meant that I was allowed to

1141
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,920
grow plants for myself and them so I was

1142
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:49,329
growing product for myself and my

1143
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,349
patients but a lot of these people were

1144
00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:52,659
trying to get it from me

1145
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:54,279
so there were a select few that honestly

1146
00:37:52,659 --> 00:37:55,869
I sold to shoot out of some weed to

1147
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,340
those guys but I don't do that anymore

1148
00:37:55,869 --> 00:37:59,109
so I could talk about it but what I

1149
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,329
really ended up doing was I was

1150
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,620
caregiving and I was consulting and

1151
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:05,590
teaching people how to be a better

1152
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:07,299
caregiver so I would go if you didn't

1153
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,130
know how to grow weed yet I'd go to your

1154
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,360
house and I'd help you set up your Dro

1155
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,039
I'd figure out how much herb you need to

1156
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,809
grow how much space you've got we'd set

1157
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,880
you up and then I would either get a fee

1158
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:17,920
upfront or I would get a portion of your

1159
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,329
harvest so that's kind of how I stayed

1160
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,010
afloat there and kept myself real

1161
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:23,130
popular into this cannabis industry

1162
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:25,840
around here that and caregiving

1163
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:28,750
as soon as I saw madam our start I'd

1164
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,400
been breeding seeds and crossing plants

1165
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:34,289
a little bit a little bit before now

1166
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,789
before this time but when met amar went

1167
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:38,160
down and realized that I needed

1168
00:38:35,789 --> 00:38:40,140
something solid because the consulting

1169
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,210
thing was great but it's unreliable

1170
00:38:40,139 --> 00:38:43,858
people around here they say they're

1171
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,670
gonna pay and a lot of times they kind

1172
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:48,239
of don't want to pay

1173
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:49,559
so I started breeding seeds for retail

1174
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,239
distribution and that's how I read

1175
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:53,069
genetics came up I was posting pictures

1176
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:55,289
online people were loving my cannabis

1177
00:38:53,068 --> 00:38:58,079
pictures I decided to make an eye region

1178
00:38:55,289 --> 00:39:00,930
annex Facebook page and then I read

1179
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,930
genetics really exploded I began finding

1180
00:39:00,929 --> 00:39:05,460
my seeds to a vent or distributing my

1181
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:07,348
seeds to a vendor known as nature's

1182
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:09,900
green remedies calm they are now known

1183
00:39:07,349 --> 00:39:11,219
as the dank team calm they might have a

1184
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,719
little bit of my products available

1185
00:39:11,219 --> 00:39:14,940
right now as if you check them out the

1186
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,259
dank team calm you may be able to get

1187
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:18,509
some eye region attic seeds from there

1188
00:39:16,259 --> 00:39:19,969
so I started putting my seeds out I went

1189
00:39:18,509 --> 00:39:22,380
to a few cannabis cups and hustled

1190
00:39:19,969 --> 00:39:24,210
millions of seeds I've got millions of

1191
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,160
seeds out in the planet now there are my

1192
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:29,519
fault that I've given away and/or sold

1193
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,960
so Wow I was noticing that I was getting

1194
00:39:29,518 --> 00:39:33,028
a little stagnant honestly I had the

1195
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,068
podcast after after the seed company got

1196
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:36,929
going I started doing a podcast with my

1197
00:39:35,068 --> 00:39:38,429
friend Wade we had a podcast called

1198
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:41,190
seven one nine the blocks it is now

1199
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:42,929
defunct ah but he was doing a podcast

1200
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,210
one night I went to a comedy show and he

1201
00:39:42,929 --> 00:39:46,379
wanted to do a podcast after the comedy

1202
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,599
show and he didn't have anywhere to do

1203
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,798
it and I've got this sweet table and I

1204
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,019
was like let's go to my house and record

1205
00:39:49,798 --> 00:39:54,028
it'll be fun so I did a podcast with

1206
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:58,139
Wade and I honestly fell in love with

1207
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:59,670
podcasting because of that but I did not

1208
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:01,440
like the equipment that Wade had and I

1209
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:03,329
didn't approve of the quality production

1210
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,088
that Wade was doing and so I kind of

1211
00:40:03,329 --> 00:40:08,068
volunteered to help Wade get his show up

1212
00:40:06,088 --> 00:40:09,239
to par and I bought some recording I

1213
00:40:08,068 --> 00:40:10,349
already had some equipment cuz I'm a

1214
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:11,969
drummer and a musician but I bought a

1215
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:14,249
couple other add-ons for my equipment

1216
00:40:11,969 --> 00:40:17,159
bought a interface to make it work with

1217
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:18,838
my macbook started podcasting fell in

1218
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:20,429
love with podcasting with Wade we did a

1219
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:21,960
couple episodes that featured cannabis

1220
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:23,879
and then he got tired of hearing about

1221
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,329
weed on his show so I made my own

1222
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:29,130
cannabis spin-off and we're here now at

1223
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:30,420
a hundred and twelve episodes holy crap

1224
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:32,430
thank you guys for listening to me rant

1225
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:36,690
this long and fit listening to 112

1226
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:37,798
episodes so I started podcasting um then

1227
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,659
there were a bunch of dispensaries

1228
00:40:37,798 --> 00:40:41,548
opening up in my area and I was watching

1229
00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:43,989
a lot of my friends in my age group get

1230
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:45,489
really cool jobs at dispensaries and

1231
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:47,379
just kind of looks like fun I missed the

1232
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:49,359
meta Mar days I missed having coworkers

1233
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:51,460
I was working from home and private

1234
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,930
facilities and I wasn't having the

1235
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,490
interactions with the social

1236
00:40:52,929 --> 00:40:57,460
interactions that I missed that I

1237
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:58,599
desired so uh my buddy Kevin our old

1238
00:40:57,460 --> 00:41:00,610
friend Kevin that used to be on the show

1239
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:02,199
he worked at the spot dispensary and he

1240
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,519
kept putting in good words for me and

1241
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:04,689
saying that they should hit me up and

1242
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,130
have me be their grower because they

1243
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:09,010
were having issues with their master

1244
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:12,730
grower so I kept putting that off and

1245
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:14,410
putting that off and then I decided I

1246
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,090
started dating a girl named Angela and

1247
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:18,009
Angela got a job at the spa and talked

1248
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:20,650
about how much fun it was and so they

1249
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:22,660
would have functions what's his name

1250
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:24,760
afro man came out to the spa and we got

1251
00:41:22,659 --> 00:41:27,039
to meet afro man they did a few other

1252
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:28,780
things that I went to as a guest with

1253
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,309
Angela and I hung out and the spa crew

1254
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,100
was a bunch of fun people I had a good

1255
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:34,539
time with them we're all dirty minded

1256
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:36,819
dudes and I had a really good time with

1257
00:41:34,539 --> 00:41:37,869
Rob and with Dave and with Vegas and

1258
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:38,850
with the whole true I really got along

1259
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:42,400
with everybody

1260
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:44,529
so one day Angela said hey they want you

1261
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,030
to come in and talk about a job so I

1262
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:47,350
walked into the spot dispensary and

1263
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,730
they're like who are you what do you do

1264
00:41:47,349 --> 00:41:50,108
I was like I'm Rasta Jeff I'm the owner

1265
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:51,340
of Ira genetics I've been growing for

1266
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:54,819
this long I've been breeding for this

1267
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:57,070
long I helped found the only dispensary

1268
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:58,930
in the city of Pueblo Colorado we got a

1269
00:41:57,070 --> 00:42:00,550
podcast with this many listeners I had

1270
00:41:58,929 --> 00:42:02,440
at the time an Instagram following of

1271
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:05,230
like 15,000 followers which has been

1272
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,820
deleted so I just threw down who I was

1273
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:08,139
and what I did and they looked me

1274
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,910
straight in the face and they said can

1275
00:42:08,139 --> 00:42:12,039
you grow hydro then I told him you know

1276
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:13,210
I have very very little hydro experience

1277
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:14,529
but I'm pretty sure I can learn it

1278
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,210
because it's a cannabis plant I can

1279
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,440
learn anything and they looked at each

1280
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:18,579
other like they were impressed and they

1281
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,019
shook my hand and they said how much

1282
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:23,049
money do you want to make I told them

1283
00:42:20,019 --> 00:42:24,400
and they said okay and I kicked myself

1284
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,869
in the ass because I should have shot a

1285
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,220
lot higher since they didn't budge at

1286
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:30,190
all they're like okay we'll pay you that

1287
00:42:27,219 --> 00:42:32,559
so that's how I got into a spot I

1288
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,539
basically they knew who I was from my

1289
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,039
buddy Kevin hyping them up and then

1290
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:37,119
Angela told me that they were talking to

1291
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:38,980
her and that I should go in there and

1292
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,900
hit them up for a job so I went in there

1293
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,670
and they gave me a job on the spot so

1294
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,990
shout out to Kevin shout it to Angela

1295
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,369
and shout it through the whole spot crew

1296
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:47,019
even though I'm not there anymore I have

1297
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:49,450
no ill will toward the spot it's just

1298
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:51,489
not my spot for me they didn't have any

1299
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:53,949
plants and I need to grow plants so that

1300
00:42:51,489 --> 00:42:55,509
puts me into the next phase of how I got

1301
00:42:53,949 --> 00:42:56,669
into the industry or where I am now in

1302
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:58,500
the industry I guess

1303
00:42:56,670 --> 00:43:01,139
I worked at a spot for quite a while

1304
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,030
they were having issues getting their

1305
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:05,909
grow rooms up and running and up to par

1306
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:07,859
and I was struggling to find something

1307
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:09,539
to keep myself busy with for 40 hours

1308
00:43:07,858 --> 00:43:11,578
and I was on salary so I was expected to

1309
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:13,318
be doing something I caught myself

1310
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,548
cleaning [ __ ] in the parking lot one

1311
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:16,980
time and I thought about it and I was

1312
00:43:14,548 --> 00:43:18,449
like not to be conceited but I was like

1313
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:20,639
I'm a master grower and I'm pretty sure

1314
00:43:18,449 --> 00:43:22,348
I make one of the top salaries in the

1315
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:25,548
building why am I here picking up

1316
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:28,048
[ __ ] and not growing cannabis and

1317
00:43:25,548 --> 00:43:29,608
that really started to like eat at me I

1318
00:43:28,048 --> 00:43:33,000
was like I'm doing things like sweeping

1319
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:34,348
up dead bugs and fixing hanging shelves

1320
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,989
in the bud room was like I'm not here to

1321
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:38,400
be [ __ ] Felix fix it or fix it Felix

1322
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,979
from wreck-it Ralph brother that's not

1323
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,410
my duty I'm kind of a cannabis grower so

1324
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:45,269
one day I was at work and our good

1325
00:43:43,409 --> 00:43:47,098
friend hunt from Green and healthy

1326
00:43:45,269 --> 00:43:48,809
wellness sent me a text message and it

1327
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:51,059
said give me a call as soon as you can

1328
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:52,380
and hunt doesn't really send out the SOS

1329
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:53,700
like that usually it's like what's up

1330
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:56,548
brother let's take dabs and you're free

1331
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:58,139
but he said as soon as you can so since

1332
00:43:56,548 --> 00:44:00,329
I wasn't doing a damn thing at the spot

1333
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:01,409
anyway I pulled out my phone I gave him

1334
00:44:00,329 --> 00:44:03,690
a call he's like what's up brother and

1335
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:05,940
he's like hey there's an issue with my

1336
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:08,369
grower here and he no longer is employed

1337
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,068
and I need a master grower and I was

1338
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:13,798
like he actually was calling to ask if I

1339
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:15,539
had a partner or a minion that worked in

1340
00:44:13,798 --> 00:44:17,068
my groves that I would donate to him so

1341
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:18,989
that he could have somebody to work his

1342
00:44:17,068 --> 00:44:21,808
grows and I said you know what huh I

1343
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:25,169
want that job and we agreed on a wage

1344
00:44:21,809 --> 00:44:27,510
and a starting date and about six weeks

1345
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:29,338
ago it feels like I took over as the

1346
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,170
lead cultivator at Green and healthy

1347

00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:08,250
grown by myself rhasta Jeff put this

1364
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,289
into flour I've been taking good care of

1365
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,550
it so

1366
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,900
it'll be ready pretty soon but that's

1367
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:13,250
where I am now in the industry you guys

1368
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:14,930
that's pretty much how I got in the

1369
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:15,679
industry and that's where I am today in

1370
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:17,839
the industry

1371
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,239
I still breed seeds my next breeding

1372
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,210
project will probably be making an f2

1373
00:45:20,239 --> 00:45:25,909
version of the strain arise I will also

1374
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,099
add about four or five other females

1375
00:45:25,909 --> 00:45:30,049
into that selection there will so there

1376
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:32,389
will be some arise f2 s and then a

1377
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:34,670
couple of arise crosses that come out of

1378
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:36,349
IRA genetics in the near future I do

1379
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:38,510
intend to keep this podcast going as

1380
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:40,460
long as people will listen I know lately

1381
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:41,690
it's been a little bit unprepared but

1382
00:45:40,460 --> 00:45:43,010
that's because I'm working a lot of

1383
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:44,869
hours at Green and healthy wellness

1384
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:46,760
getting things put together there and

1385
00:45:44,869 --> 00:45:48,409

1386
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:50,150

1395
00:46:02,389 --> 00:46:06,139
about what I do in the grow room I'm

1396
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,730

do the things that I check we'll talk

1400
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:14,660

scale grow it green and healthy wellness

1403
00:46:16,309 --> 00:46:20,239
I'll try to talk about both of those I

1404
00:46:18,019 --> 00:46:23,809
also want to do a checklist of things

1405
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:26,239
that you guys should be doing on a daily

1406
00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:29,150
weekly and monthly basis so those will

1407
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,649
probably be the next two episodes anyway

1408
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:30,980
I feel like I'm rambling on and on and

1409

1411
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,769
was saying I'm gonna keep breeding seeds

1412
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:38,480
I read genetics will continue to come

1413
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:40,880
out with new seeds I will keep breeding

1414

my new stuff to my old stuff plus the

1415
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,230

1416
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,670
like will be bred into my lines I'm

1417

00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,289
telling you that I was going to make a

1711
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,389
checklist of things that you should be

1712
00:58:52,289 --> 00:58:56,190
taking care of in your garden so I did

1713
00:58:54,389 --> 00:58:58,699
that for you I've got a list of things

1714
00:58:56,190 --> 00:59:00,900
you should do daily weekly monthly

1715
00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:02,848
things you should do after each harvest

1716
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:04,170
and also things that you should do

1717
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:07,230
yearly there are a couple things on that

1718
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:08,460
list so I think I'm gonna take a dad and

1719
00:59:07,230 --> 00:59:10,019
a drink while you guys listen to a

1720
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:11,730
couple of seconds of reggae music and I

1722
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:19,789

1723
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:19,790
[Music]

1724
00:59:22,480 --> 01:00:20,289
[Music]

1725
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:29,809
cactus cooler from turf backs if you've

1726
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:31,610
ever cracked open a can cactus cooler

1727
01:00:29,809 --> 01:00:33,590
taking a drink it's exactly what this

1728
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:35,300
hash tastes like it's kind of got my

1729
01:00:33,590 --> 01:00:37,820
mouth watering we're taking a dad that

1730
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:39,320
made your mouth water usually your mouth

1731
01:00:37,820 --> 01:00:40,309
goes dry excuse me for coughing into the

1732
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,890
microphone I was listening to a podcast

1733
01:00:40,309 --> 01:00:44,690
today and the co-host was just coughing

1734
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,460
into the microphone err I really wanted

1735
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:47,470
to turn off the damn show so I apologize

1736
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,599
for coughing into the mic

1737
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:52,279
anyway this checklist here we go this is

1738
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:54,409
stuff that I feel you should be doing

1739
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:56,570
every day some of this stuff will vary

1740
01:00:54,409 --> 01:00:57,649
if you've got a hydro garden some of

1741
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:59,120
this stuff will be different if you've

1742
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:01,550
got a soil garden some of this stuff

1743
01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:02,989
will be different based on the size of

1744
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:04,850
your garden some of this stuff will have

1745
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:07,819
to be done over a course of a couple of

1746
01:01:04,849 --> 01:01:09,739
days some of this stuff will have to be

1747
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:11,180
if you've got a little garden this stuff

1748
01:01:09,739 --> 01:01:14,209
is just things that'll take you two

1749
01:01:11,179 --> 01:01:17,329
seconds so here is what I've got for

1750
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:19,639
your daily checklist daily visually

1751
01:01:17,329 --> 01:01:21,920
check each plant for bugs molds or signs

1752
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:25,789
of deficiencies or over fertilization

1753
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:27,590
and correct if necessary oh you got to

1754
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:29,389
get in there I walk in and I just pick a

1755
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:31,070
random plant and I just pull a random

1756
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:33,199
leaf off of a random plant and I flip it

1757
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:34,070
upside down and I look at it I make sure

1758
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:36,049
there's no bugs

1759
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:38,510
I feel the leaf I can tell by feeling

1760
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:40,190
the leaf how healthy the plant is I can

1761
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:41,630
kind of rub on the leaf and tell I like

1762
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:43,700
to pull the leaf off look for bugs look

1763
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:45,410
for molds I look around the room see if

1764
01:01:43,699 --> 01:01:47,159
any of the leaves are yellow or crispy

1765
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:49,018
or crunchy or if anything's happening

1766
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:52,048
if you've got anything weird going in

1767
01:01:49,018 --> 01:01:53,848
there work on correcting it something I

1768
01:01:52,048 --> 01:01:56,159
should add anything that can be done

1769
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:58,109
today do it today don't wait until

1770
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,058
tomorrow you've got plenty of [ __ ] to do

1771
01:01:58,108 --> 01:02:01,710
tomorrow whatever you can do today do it

1772
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:03,180
or you just keep adding [ __ ] up for

1773
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,798
tomorrow and then tomorrow never comes

1774
01:02:03,179 --> 01:02:06,239
and then one of these days you're gonna

1775
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:07,798
have a big-ass list of [ __ ] that you

1776
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:09,778
never did you're gonna find problems and

1777
01:02:07,798 --> 01:02:10,978
you're gonna in your grow and you're

1778
01:02:09,778 --> 01:02:12,298
gonna know why it's because you didn't

1779
01:02:10,978 --> 01:02:13,889
do that list of [ __ ] that you should

1780
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:15,059
have been keeping up on so try to stay

1781
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:17,009
on top of your chores you guys that's

1782
01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,390
what I'm saying so check your plants

1783
01:02:17,009 --> 01:02:19,559
every day you should be touching every

1784
01:02:18,389 --> 01:02:21,058
single plant you should be putting your

1785
01:02:19,559 --> 01:02:23,039
eyes on every single plant get in there

1786
01:02:21,059 --> 01:02:24,479
and love them so the second thing on my

1787
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,239
list here check to see if the plants

1788
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:28,919
need water you can check visually I can

1789
01:02:27,239 --> 01:02:30,088
see if the plants look droopy at all if

1790
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:31,619
they're starting to lean over if the

1791
01:02:30,088 --> 01:02:34,318
leaves are kind of hanging down they

1792
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:36,778
need water or lift up the pot and check

1793
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:39,088
the weight the standard way to do this

1794
01:02:36,778 --> 01:02:41,219
is think about it this way water your

1795
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,778
plant water until it's full freshly

1796
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:44,848
watered pick it up and see how much it

1797
01:02:42,778 --> 01:02:46,978
weighs that's its full weight when it

1798
01:02:44,849 --> 01:02:48,509
weighs half of that it's ready to be

1799
01:02:46,978 --> 01:02:50,848
watered again you need to pour in water

1800
01:02:48,509 --> 01:02:52,880
and get it wet again so second thing

1801
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:55,079
check to see if the plants need water

1802
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,869
the third thing I would do every single

1803
01:02:55,079 --> 01:03:00,028
day pull any dead leaves and put them in

1804
01:02:57,869 --> 01:03:02,519
a trash bag or a trash can that gets

1805
01:03:00,028 --> 01:03:03,989
removed from the garden area I don't

1806
01:03:02,518 --> 01:03:06,088
like to leave my trash bag or my

1807
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:07,440
trashcan in the garden that doesn't make

1808
01:03:06,088 --> 01:03:10,489
sense to me I want to get that out of

1809
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:12,119
there um one of the reasons being I

1810
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:13,409
apologize for all the coffee and

1811
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:16,710
cleaning with a throat that'll end here

1812
01:03:13,409 --> 01:03:17,818
pretty soon took a couple of ah the

1813
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:20,818
reason I like to get yellowing leaves

1814
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:23,130
out of the room as bugs are attracted to

1815
01:03:20,818 --> 01:03:25,498
yellow leaves bugs see yellow leaves as

1816
01:03:23,130 --> 01:03:27,150
a perfect opportunity the outer layer of

1817
01:03:25,498 --> 01:03:29,129
the leaf has been softened and they can

1818
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:31,139
bite in and get to the juicy insides of

1819
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:32,640
the leaves a little more easily and bugs

1820
01:03:31,139 --> 01:03:34,379
know that so they're attracted to yellow

1821
01:03:32,639 --> 01:03:36,838
leaves that's why your sticky traps are

1822
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:39,180
yellow so get all the yellow leaves out

1823
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:40,619
of there put them in a trash can put

1824
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:42,210
them in a trash bag and get them out of

1825
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:45,210
the room because those are gonna attract

1826
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:47,489
bugs so get that [ __ ] away from there

1827
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:49,349
the next thing I would recommend check

1828
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:50,818
the clones in the domes for moisture

1829
01:03:49,349 --> 01:03:53,219
I checked the humidity levels in your

1830
01:03:50,818 --> 01:03:54,838
clones and check for roots and if you've

1831
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:56,519
got roots to transplant them put them

1832
01:03:54,838 --> 01:03:57,808
into the next uh if they're going into

1833
01:03:56,518 --> 01:03:59,008
the next size Rock we'll put them into

1834
01:03:57,809 --> 01:03:59,960
there if they're going into cups with

1835
01:03:59,009 --> 01:04:01,670
soil throw them into there

1836
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,400
have you got roots do whatever you need

1837
01:04:01,670 --> 01:04:05,510
to do if they need moisture or humidity

1838
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:06,829
adjust that [ __ ] get in there and fix it

1839
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:09,350
you can fix the clone domes really

1840
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:11,119
easily so the next thing to do check the

1841
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:13,940
temps and the humidity of the room and

1842
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:16,969
adjust that if necessary you guys try to

1843
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:19,099
aim for 40 to 60% humidity during your

1844
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:20,989
bloom phase and then during the veg

1845
01:04:19,099 --> 01:04:22,489
phase you can be around 60 to 70%

1846
01:04:20,989 --> 01:04:25,039
humidity I wouldn't go any higher than

1847
01:04:22,489 --> 01:04:27,139
70% humidity and trying to have some air

1848
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,960
flow along with that or you will get

1849
01:04:27,139 --> 01:04:32,449
some issues try to keep the daytime

1850
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,159
temperature around 72 77 degrees I

1851
01:04:32,449 --> 01:04:36,679
really like 74 degrees plants really

1852
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:39,379
like 74 some of the sativa is like to

1853
01:04:36,679 --> 01:04:41,960
get up to 77 during the day cycle during

1854
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:44,150
the night cycle try to stay within 10

1855
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,130
degrees of what your day cycle is so if

1856
01:04:44,150 --> 01:04:48,320
during the day you're getting 77 at

1857
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:49,760
night you want to be at 67 or a little

1858
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,070
higher don't go more than 10 degrees

1859
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:56,150
swing from day to night so during the

1860
01:04:52,070 --> 01:04:57,950
day 72 77 during the night 60 to 65

1861
01:04:56,150 --> 01:05:00,470
degrees during your night cycle is what

1862
01:04:57,949 --> 01:05:01,819
I try to aim for another thing that you

1863
01:05:00,469 --> 01:05:03,259
need to do that a lot of people forget

1864
01:05:01,820 --> 01:05:05,780
to do and I can tell by your Instagram

1865
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:07,460
photos sweep the damn floor all you

1866
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:09,890
gotta do is get a broom and a dustpan

1867
01:05:07,460 --> 01:05:11,360
and a bucket and sweep the floor scoop

1868
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:13,670
up that [ __ ] that you just swept up into

1869
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:15,220
a dustpan dump it into the bucket get it

1870
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:17,840
out of there and put it into a trash can

1871
01:05:15,219 --> 01:05:19,339
and get it out of the house all that

1872
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,510
[ __ ] on the floor first of all it looks

1873
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,559
terrible why do you want that [ __ ] on

1874
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:23,360
your floor in your own room it looks

1875
01:05:21,559 --> 01:05:26,960
like [ __ ] get the leaves off there get

1876
01:05:23,360 --> 01:05:28,280
the dirt off there get that the I can't

1877
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:30,079
think of what that shit's called right

1878
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,610
now that white stuff that sucks to step

1879
01:05:30,079 --> 01:05:33,920
on the perlite get the perlite up off

1880
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:36,050
the floor just sweep up you guys it's

1881
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:37,670
not that hard every leaf on the floor

1882
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:39,590
every little piece of debris that's a

1883
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:41,659
good spot for a bug to hide if you've

1884
01:05:39,590 --> 01:05:44,930
got a problem with white flies fungus

1885
01:05:41,659 --> 01:05:46,940
gnats spider mites a fidex

1886
01:05:44,929 --> 01:05:48,739
that's another spot for a bug to hide

1887
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:51,230
one little tiny bug can hide under a

1888
01:05:48,739 --> 01:05:53,809
leaf and lay so many eggs don't give

1889
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:55,070
them the opportunity you guys fight the

1890
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:56,809
battle at your advantage

1891
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:59,090
don't give these bugs a place to go so

1892
01:05:56,809 --> 01:06:01,340
sweep the floor the next thing I would

1893
01:05:59,090 --> 01:06:03,230
do check any equipment check your hydro

1894
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:04,820
pumps check the EZ cloner pumps check

1895
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:06,500
your dehumidifiers if you're running

1896
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,059
hydro check your mix pump in your

1897
01:06:06,500 --> 01:06:09,650
reservoir I know a lot of guys have a

1898
01:06:08,059 --> 01:06:11,090
big res filled with nutrients you just

1899
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:12,800
put a pump in there to shoot the

1900
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:15,079
nutrients around to check that pump make

1901
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:16,400
sure it hasn't gotten clogged up those

1902
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:18,769
pumps have little filters on them they

1903
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:20,660
like to get gunky if you're using any

1904
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:21,980
kind of feed system check that thing

1905
01:06:20,659 --> 01:06:24,409
make sure your sprinklers haven't gotten

1906
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:26,900
clogged up if you've got an EZ cloner

1907
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:30,649
check the water level in that as well

1908
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:32,539
and refill it and adjust the pH so the

1909
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:35,289
next thing you should do check the pH in

1910
01:06:32,539 --> 01:06:37,909
ppm levels if you're running any hydro

1911
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:39,590
if you've got a flood and drain kit if

1912
01:06:37,909 --> 01:06:42,829
you're doing buckets or whatever check

1913
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:44,480
your pH also check your ppm you need to

1914
01:06:42,829 --> 01:06:47,269
adjust your pH you need to adjust your

1915
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,010
PPM's almost every day I've seen large

1916
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:51,320
hydro Gardens need to be topped off

1917
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:53,270
every day if not twice a day because of

1918
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,340
water evaporation and plant productivity

1919
01:06:53,269 --> 01:06:57,079
and every time that water evaporates and

1920
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:59,269
you add more water you've got to adjust

1921
01:06:57,079 --> 01:07:01,610
the pH so check that [ __ ] out all the

1922
01:06:59,269 --> 01:07:03,050
time every day if you can twice a day if

1923
01:07:01,610 --> 01:07:04,789
you can on that if you're running hydro

1924
01:07:03,050 --> 01:07:06,350
hydro guys may have a little bit more

1925
01:07:04,789 --> 01:07:07,909
work to do than a soil guys but we've

1926
01:07:06,349 --> 01:07:09,679
got a lot of soil and dirt to deal with

1927
01:07:07,909 --> 01:07:12,079
so the work will kind of math out I

1928
01:07:09,679 --> 01:07:14,149
guess I'm not sure I'm a real hydro

1929
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,199
garden myself so I can't speak correctly

1930
01:07:14,150 --> 01:07:16,670
on that but it seems like you have a lot

1931
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:19,489
of cleaning and a lot of maintenance to

1932
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:21,050
do in a hydro drill so what's next I

1933
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:22,789
prune and train the plants and shape

1934
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:24,050
them the way you want them for your grow

1935
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:26,269
space that's something you can be

1936
01:07:24,050 --> 01:07:27,860
working on every single day keep in mind

1937
01:07:26,269 --> 01:07:29,570
how you want those plants to be shaped

1938
01:07:27,860 --> 01:07:31,910
if the architecture correct since you

1939
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:33,910
have sturdy plants try to use up as much

1940
01:07:31,909 --> 01:07:36,170
canopy space as you can with each plant

1941
01:07:33,909 --> 01:07:38,299
so prune and train your plants take off

1942
01:07:36,170 --> 01:07:39,860
all the shitty leaves take off any

1943
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,210
little sucker leaves that are happen and

1944
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:44,780
just get rid of that crap make the plant

1945
01:07:41,210 --> 01:07:47,360
cells all right excuse me so the next

1946
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:48,620
step lollipop any small crap while

1947
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:49,940
you're in flower all those little tiny

1948
01:07:48,619 --> 01:07:52,519
buds that are happening on the bottom

1949
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:53,780
just crap cut that crap off you can

1950
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:56,000
lollipop all the way up through week

1951
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:57,019
four I've done it up into week five once

1952
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:59,000
you get the hang of it you can really

1953
01:07:57,019 --> 01:08:02,570
get carried away you'll know what to cut

1954
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,769
off you'll know what to leave so only do

1955
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:05,360
it for the first couple of weeks I guess

1956
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:06,409
until you get the hang of it then once

1957
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:07,789
you've gotten a few crops under your

1958
01:08:06,409 --> 01:08:09,019
belt that you've ollie popped you'll be

1959
01:08:07,789 --> 01:08:10,519
able to do it up in a week four or five

1960
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:12,139
without pissing the plants off I've done

1961
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:13,759
it too late and caused from after nights

1962
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:15,829
that's why I warned you to go light and

1963
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,390
then learn how to do it so a lollipop

1964
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:19,640
stuff take off all that small crap in

1965
01:08:17,390 --> 01:08:21,710
flower pull off any funky leaves while

1966
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:23,720
you're there so the next thing that you

1967
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:26,210
can do every single day you guys take

1968
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:28,069
notes on everything you

1969
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:30,199
Oh everything you do just write down

1970
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:33,830
what you do I run a large grove for

1971
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:35,329
green and healthy wellness basically the

1972
01:08:33,829 --> 01:08:37,130
owner of green and healthy wellness has

1973
01:08:35,329 --> 01:08:39,318
put me in charge of the grow what I say

1974
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:41,960
goes he doesn't ask me any questions as

1975
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:44,330
long as at the end of the harvest

1976
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:46,159
there's our goal weight of quality flour

1977
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:49,789
nobody's gonna [ __ ] with me and I'm

1978
01:08:46,159 --> 01:08:51,079
gonna reach that goal but the OCD person

1979
01:08:49,789 --> 01:08:53,238
in me the person that likes to be

1980
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:55,068
accountable I make notes of everything I

1981
01:08:53,238 --> 01:08:57,349
do all day every day if I open up my

1982
01:08:55,069 --> 01:08:58,910
phone we could read exactly what I did

1983
01:08:57,350 --> 01:09:00,950
not exactly probably but I'm pretty

1984
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:02,298
close to every step I did today from

1985
01:09:00,949 --> 01:09:03,649
walking in and checking the Clones

1986
01:09:02,298 --> 01:09:06,019
walking the roads and checking each

1987
01:09:03,649 --> 01:09:07,789
plant fixing the sprinklers like I write

1988
01:09:06,020 --> 01:09:09,109
down what I do every day just to keep

1989
01:09:07,789 --> 01:09:11,088
accountability and to keep myself

1990
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:12,890
reminded of what's been done so that if

1991
01:09:11,088 --> 01:09:14,988
something goes wrong I can look back on

1992
01:09:12,890 --> 01:09:17,450
that look right here when I make this

1993
01:09:14,988 --> 01:09:20,289
stupid [ __ ] together I messed up also

1994
01:09:17,449 --> 01:09:23,028
you guys a good reason to take notes

1995
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:24,829
this industry is expanding rapidly and

1996
01:09:23,029 --> 01:09:26,319
we're gonna have marijuana available in

1997
01:09:24,829 --> 01:09:29,119
every state before too long

1998
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,770
when state start legalizing cannabis and

1999
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:32,689
it's time to hire professional growers

2000
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:34,730
you guys that took good notes of all

2001
01:09:32,689 --> 01:09:38,088
your grows you guys are gonna have a

2002
01:09:34,729 --> 01:09:40,129
portfolio basically an application or a

2003
01:09:38,088 --> 01:09:41,899
resume right there on paper you can say

2004
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:43,460
look I took notes that shows that you're

2005
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:44,659
organized it shows that you're

2006
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:45,980
accountable it shows that you're

2007
01:09:44,659 --> 01:09:48,380
planning it shows that you're thinking

2008
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:49,699
it shows that you're serious all the

2009
01:09:48,380 --> 01:09:51,409
other guys are gonna be able to say well

2010
01:09:49,699 --> 01:09:52,818
I grew this much weed in my mom's

2011
01:09:51,409 --> 01:09:54,889
basement and they're not gonna have any

2012
01:09:52,819 --> 01:09:56,420
pictures or any notes or anything like

2013
01:09:54,890 --> 01:09:58,700
that so you guys are taking notes you're

2014
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:00,680
gonna have the advantage there so take

2015
01:09:58,699 --> 01:10:01,729
notes on everything you do I talk about

2016
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:03,140
that a lot but it's something that I

2017
01:10:01,729 --> 01:10:05,839
think is really serious in a cannabis

2018
01:10:03,140 --> 01:10:06,680
grow what if you do something different

2019
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,420
this time and it comes out perfect

2020
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:10,039
you're gonna want to know what you did

2021
01:10:08,420 --> 01:10:11,630
the only way your dumb high ass is gonna

2022
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:13,100
remember is if you wrote it down cuz

2023
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:15,529
you're smoking too much good weed you're

2024
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:18,770
growing too much good so write [ __ ] down

2025
01:10:15,529 --> 01:10:20,599
and that is my weekly or my daily to-do

2026
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:22,130
checklist I'm now gonna move on to

2027
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,960
weekly so this is nothing you should be

2028
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:26,270
handling once a week I like to pick

2029
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,520
Mondays and just kick Monday's ass I get

2030
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:29,480
all the chores done on Monday and then

2031
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:30,950
through the rest of the week you can

2032
01:10:29,479 --> 01:10:32,238
just focus on the plants and keeping

2033
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:34,159
everything clean and doing all that

2034
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:36,019
stuff so every Monday this is what I

2035
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:38,420
would do I would start each week with a

2036
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,349
well-planned feed in each room if you've

2037
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:42,260
got a cloner

2038
01:10:39,349 --> 01:10:44,210
if they've got water in trays or in a

2039
01:10:42,260 --> 01:10:46,250
cloner dump that water out put fresh

2040
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:48,198
water in there fresh nutrients whatever

2041
01:10:46,250 --> 01:10:50,300
you're using if you're using a and B in

2042
01:10:48,198 --> 01:10:51,799
the cloner or if you're using rapid

2043
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:53,480
start or if you're using clone acts

2044
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:56,150
whatever put fresh solution in your

2045
01:10:53,479 --> 01:10:57,379
cloner get it going fresh on Monday or

2046
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:58,939
whatever day you choose to start but

2047
01:10:57,380 --> 01:11:01,190
once a week clean that sucker out and

2048
01:10:58,939 --> 01:11:03,319
get it going fresh also water all of

2049
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:05,448
your veg plants feed your veg plants

2050
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:07,340
with a strong nutrient solution on

2051
01:11:05,448 --> 01:11:09,138
Monday if they're little babies maybe

2052
01:11:07,340 --> 01:11:10,130
just some a and B they're getting a

2053
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:11,539
little bigger maybe throw a little

2054
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,920
liquid karma in there if they're getting

2055
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:14,359
even bigger maybe they want some

2056
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,368
potassium silicates and maybe some

2057
01:11:14,359 --> 01:11:18,348
cal-mag in there you should definitely

2058
01:11:16,368 --> 01:11:20,839
be feeding your veg plants a little bit

2059
01:11:18,349 --> 01:11:23,710
of ruin oculi also get those roots going

2060
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:27,050
so also feed your flowering plants a

2061
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:29,118
well-planned feed each week if it's time

2062
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:30,560
to flush you need to start flushing and

2063
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:33,259
that's another good reason to take notes

2064
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,480
then you know when to flush if you guys

2065
01:11:33,260 --> 01:11:37,190
need help planning your feeding I did an

2066
01:11:35,479 --> 01:11:39,618
episode all about feeding your flowering

2067
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:42,109
plants so episode number 69 will give

2068
01:11:39,618 --> 01:11:44,328
you a weekly planning a weekly schedule

2069
01:11:42,109 --> 01:11:45,469
of what to feed your plants while

2070
01:11:44,328 --> 01:11:47,719
they're in flowers if you want to check

2071
01:11:45,469 --> 01:11:50,210
that out that may be useful for you so

2072
01:11:47,719 --> 01:11:52,760
every week feed your plants a well feed

2073
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:54,560
a well-planned feed the next thing I

2074
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:56,810
would do every week is dust all of the

2075
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:59,090
fans you guys those fans get dirty

2076
01:11:56,810 --> 01:12:00,349
I just dust the backs of them off if you

2077
01:11:59,090 --> 01:12:01,699
want to take off the screen and clean

2078
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:03,770
the blades every week that would be

2079
01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:05,448
super cool of you your room would

2080
01:12:03,770 --> 01:12:07,400
appreciate it all of that dust is going

2081
01:12:05,448 --> 01:12:09,589
to end up in your dabs if you don't

2082
01:12:07,399 --> 01:12:10,429
clean the fan think of it that way the

2083
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:12,429
next thing I would do

2084
01:12:10,429 --> 01:12:15,260
check the timers for proper time and

2085
01:12:12,429 --> 01:12:16,940
function be there when the lights come

2086
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:18,349
on a couple of times a week I know you

2087
01:12:16,939 --> 01:12:20,598
can't be there all the time when the

2088
01:12:18,349 --> 01:12:21,739
lights come on but if you can try to be

2089
01:12:20,599 --> 01:12:23,239
there if the lights come on at nine

2090
01:12:21,738 --> 01:12:26,779
o'clock just be standing outside of the

2091
01:12:23,238 --> 01:12:28,250
room like 857 so that when the lights

2092
01:12:26,779 --> 01:12:29,899
click on you can hear it go click and

2093
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:31,368
then you can open the door they can make

2094
01:12:29,899 --> 01:12:33,348
sure the timer is working and then be

2095
01:12:31,368 --> 01:12:35,359
there again when the lights go off so

2096
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:38,270
just check the timers for proper time

2097
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:40,639
and proper function every week I would

2098
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:41,869
calibrate your meters if you've got a pH

2099
01:12:40,639 --> 01:12:44,779
meter you should have one of those

2100
01:12:41,868 --> 01:12:46,759
calibrate it get the 4 the 7 and the 10

2101
01:12:44,779 --> 01:12:48,170
solution and just calibrate that thing

2102
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,900
once a week if you're a small time

2103
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:53,270
grower and you have a hydro short hydro

2104
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:54,920
store near you that you frequent

2105
01:12:53,270 --> 01:12:56,510
they will probably calibrate your pH

2106
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:58,489
meter for you they'll be nice and do

2107
01:12:56,510 --> 01:13:01,489
that as a courtesy so calibrate your pH

2108
01:12:58,489 --> 01:13:04,069
meter you should also have a ppm meter

2109
01:13:01,489 --> 01:13:05,869
calibrate that as frequently as you can

2110
01:13:04,069 --> 01:13:07,369
at least once a week that can make a

2111
01:13:05,869 --> 01:13:08,539
huge difference in the quality of your

2112
01:13:07,369 --> 01:13:10,699
flowers if you're measuring something

2113
01:13:08,539 --> 01:13:13,640
and your meter is telling you that it's

2114
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:14,989
at seven but it's actually at five and

2115
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,280
you're adjusting to get to six five

2116
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:18,260
you're actually gonna be adjusting down

2117
01:13:16,279 --> 01:13:20,239
into the fours and you're really gonna

2118
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:22,280
cause problems so calibrate your meters

2119
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:24,079
you guys the next thing I would do at

2120
01:13:22,279 --> 01:13:25,670
least once a week is check all your

2121
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:27,380
blowers and fans and make sure that

2122
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:30,020
they're not clogged or restricted in any

2123
01:13:27,380 --> 01:13:31,520
way most of the time this you can be

2124
01:13:30,020 --> 01:13:33,260
done visually you can look around the

2125
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:35,150
room and see that everything is working

2126
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:37,100
maybe put your hand if you've got a big

2127
01:13:35,149 --> 01:13:38,719
vortex blower just put your hand on the

2128
01:13:37,100 --> 01:13:40,789
outside of the vortex blower and feel it

2129
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:42,380
vibrate listen to it you'll know if some

2130
01:13:40,789 --> 01:13:44,420
shits wrong but just pay attention to

2131
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:46,430
that stuff if it's clogged up that could

2132
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:48,020
be a fire hazard if it's clogged up that

2133
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:49,520
is going to cost you electricity because

2134
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:51,320
that fan is spinning and you're not

2135
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,730
getting blowing out of it but you're

2136
01:13:51,319 --> 01:13:54,590
using electricity because it's spinning

2137
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:55,969
and trying to break free from that hair

2138
01:13:54,590 --> 01:13:57,380
clog or whatever you've got in there

2139
01:13:55,970 --> 01:14:00,050
those leaves that are clogged in there

2140
01:13:57,380 --> 01:14:01,760
so just check those out guys before you

2141
01:14:00,050 --> 01:14:03,770
go sticking your fingers and any blowers

2142
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,780
unplug them and give them a long time to

2143
01:14:03,770 --> 01:14:08,420
quit spinning they spin for a long time

2144
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:10,009
and just the natural force of those fans

2145
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:11,539
spinning on their own weight that's

2146
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:13,220
enough to put a nice cut on your finger

2147
01:14:11,539 --> 01:14:14,720
so watch your [ __ ] fingers those

2148
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:16,430
blowers I've cut myself on a blower

2149
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:19,010
before it sucks more than you would ever

2150
01:14:16,430 --> 01:14:20,240
know take it from me there's blood sweat

2151
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:22,369
and tears in my garden and that's where

2152
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:23,779
the blood came from so the next thing

2153
01:14:22,369 --> 01:14:25,250
you guys visually check the ductwork

2154
01:14:23,779 --> 01:14:27,050
and make sure that everything is sealed

2155
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:28,970
up we're blowing a lot of pressure

2156
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:30,890
through these ducts or the ducting

2157
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:32,510
connects to the lights where the ducting

2158
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:34,190
connects to the blower where the ducting

2159
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:35,930
runs out of whatever room you're using

2160
01:14:34,189 --> 01:14:38,750
just make sure that all that stuff is

2161
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:40,220
sealed also clean your air stones if

2162
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:41,539
you're making any kind of tees or

2163
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:43,310
running any hydro or if you've got

2164
01:14:41,539 --> 01:14:44,600
cloners with air stones or if you've

2165
01:14:43,310 --> 01:14:46,940
just got water sitting there to get

2166
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:48,350
bubbled to get the chlorine out clean

2167
01:14:46,939 --> 01:14:49,879
the air stones you guys those things get

2168
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,289
murky sometimes you might just want to

2169
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:53,029
throw them away and replace them they

2170
01:14:51,289 --> 01:14:54,680
are not that expensive if you've got a

2171
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:57,259
few bucks just go buy new ones

2172
01:14:54,680 --> 01:15:00,440
the next thing clean your dehumidifier

2173
01:14:57,260 --> 01:15:02,270
or a humidifier filter in Colorado we

2174
01:15:00,439 --> 01:15:04,939
probably don't even have a dehumidifier

2175
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:06,210
in most rooms we use a humidifier in

2176
01:15:04,939 --> 01:15:07,738
some places but clean the

2177
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:09,899
filters they get funky that she gets

2178
01:15:07,738 --> 01:15:11,039
dirty anything that has water running

2179
01:15:09,899 --> 01:15:12,809
through it frequently needs to be

2180
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:15,210
cleaned it'll get gross just clean your

2181
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:17,340
[ __ ] if you're running hydro clean out

2182
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:19,289
your reservoir every week to ten days

2183
01:15:17,340 --> 01:15:21,750
and start with fresh water and fresh

2184
01:15:19,289 --> 01:15:23,729
nutrients well like I keep saying water

2185
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:25,260
that sits around that gets old gets

2186
01:15:23,729 --> 01:15:27,809
gross shit's able to grow in there

2187
01:15:25,260 --> 01:15:30,000
things can call an eyes in there you

2188
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:31,440
don't want that you want fresh stuff if

2189
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:33,479
you're running easy cloners do the same

2190
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:35,159
flush out those easy cloners I talked

2191
01:15:33,479 --> 01:15:36,988
about that a minute ago just dump it out

2192
01:15:35,159 --> 01:15:39,269
fill it with fresh water fresh nutrients

2193
01:15:36,988 --> 01:15:40,769
pH it and get it going all over again

2194
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:42,480
your plants will love you for it you

2195
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:44,250
don't want to drink old funky water do

2196
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:45,629
you like you don't even leave your dog's

2197
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:47,159
bowl sit there for too long without

2198
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:48,480
putting fresh water in it don't do that

2199
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:51,659
to your plants all of your plants

2200
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:53,159
they're family too so something you're

2201
01:15:51,659 --> 01:15:55,920
gonna need to think about weekly you

2202
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:57,750
need you need to dispose of your grow

2203
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:00,600
room trash carefully when the trash man

2204
01:15:57,750 --> 01:16:02,640
comes you're gonna I would wait until

2205
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:03,870
the morning and take the trash out till

2206
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:05,190
you when you know he's coming don't

2207
01:16:03,869 --> 01:16:07,529
leave that trash sitting out there on

2208
01:16:05,189 --> 01:16:09,839
the curb overnight if it's out there on

2209
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:12,359
the curb your trash is accessible to the

2210
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:15,000
public and it is legal for police

2211
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:17,189
officers neighborhood kids hungry

2212
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,829
homeless people curious neighbors

2213
01:16:17,189 --> 01:16:21,750
whoever private investigators anybody

2214
01:16:19,829 --> 01:16:23,460
can walk up to your trash and look

2215
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:25,020
through your [ __ ] and they can take it

2216
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:30,689
if they want those guys stole my trash

2217
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:32,130
yeah they can do that but your trash is

2218
01:16:30,689 --> 01:16:34,109
fair game if it's out there on the curb

2219
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:35,340
and if you've got a whole bunch of

2220
01:16:34,109 --> 01:16:37,349
leaves in there and you live in a state

2221
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:39,060
that is not legal to produce cannabis

2222
01:16:37,350 --> 01:16:40,469
you could have a crime that could be

2223
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:42,330
evidence to the crime right there so be

2224
01:16:40,469 --> 01:16:45,029
careful dispose of your grow room trash

2225
01:16:42,329 --> 01:16:46,890
very carefully if you're doing a large

2226
01:16:45,029 --> 01:16:48,539
grow take it to the dump yourself the

2227
01:16:46,890 --> 01:16:49,950
guys at the dump don't give a [ __ ] just

2228
01:16:48,539 --> 01:16:51,420
take it to the dump have it in big trash

2229
01:16:49,949 --> 01:16:52,409
bags just go drop it off they don't care

2230
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:54,210
that you're dropping off weed leaves

2231
01:16:52,409 --> 01:16:56,760
those guys have their own business going

2232
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:57,989
on so uh dispose of your grow room trash

2233
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:00,090
carefully another thing I would

2234
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:02,129
recommend doing weekly look around the

2235
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:04,289
grow room look on the walls and the

2236
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:06,210
ceiling and the floors and look for any

2237
01:17:04,289 --> 01:17:08,488
mold or moisture if you've got

2238
01:17:06,210 --> 01:17:10,500
condensation happening somewhere figure

2239
01:17:08,488 --> 01:17:13,109
out why that's happening correct it if

2240
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:14,640
you've got any mold I've seen blue mold

2241
01:17:13,109 --> 01:17:16,339
form on the walls and grow rooms I've

2242
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,770
seen little green mold form on the walls

2243
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:21,140
grow rooms clean that [ __ ] up get rid of

2244
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:23,660
it use h2o to use bleach use peroxide

2245
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:25,640
use something strong if you want to go

2246
01:17:23,659 --> 01:17:27,590
organic do that do your thing but clean

2247
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:29,869
that [ __ ] up that is unhealthy for you

2248
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:31,760
it's unhealthy for the plants figure out

2249
01:17:29,869 --> 01:17:33,319
why it's happening and resolve the issue

2250
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,400
to make it not happen once you've

2251
01:17:33,319 --> 01:17:36,469
cleaned it you've got to figure out what

2252
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,269
caused it and stop it from happening or

2253
01:17:36,470 --> 01:17:40,610
it'll just come back mold is a [ __ ] you

2254
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:42,770
can clean mold I saw somebody clean mold

2255
01:17:40,609 --> 01:17:44,210
off of a wall they had a spot this is

2256
01:17:42,770 --> 01:17:46,340
about the size of a quarter maybe a

2257
01:17:44,210 --> 01:17:48,350
50-cent piece and she scrubbed the mold

2258
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:49,430
with bleach and hot water and she called

2259
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:50,690
me the next day and she's like come over

2260
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:53,119
here I want you to see this and I walked

2261
01:17:50,689 --> 01:17:55,759
into that mold and formed into like a

2262
01:17:53,119 --> 01:17:57,739
four by four square it just grew that

2263
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,750
much in like 24 hours it was so

2264
01:17:57,739 --> 01:18:01,130
ridiculous so if you've got mold figure

2265
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,909
out what's causing it clean the [ __ ] out

2266
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:04,369
of it you may need to call a

2267
01:18:01,909 --> 01:18:07,760
professional eventually don't ruin a

2268
01:18:04,369 --> 01:18:08,779
rental home growing weed I apologize for

2269
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,949
clearing the throat so much in this

2270
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:12,109
episode but I've got a whole bunch of

2271
01:18:09,949 --> 01:18:13,579
good dabs from the Terp station so shout

2272
01:18:12,109 --> 01:18:16,069
out to chirp ex you can blame all the

2273
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:17,960
throat clearing on Jordan that sounded

2274
01:18:16,069 --> 01:18:20,059
grosser than it was meant to but there

2275
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:21,680
we go so that's everything that you

2276
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:23,360
should do in my opinion stuff that you

2277
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,220
should do weekly I'm gonna move on to

2278
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:27,259
things that you should do monthly if

2279
01:18:25,220 --> 01:18:29,449
you're running hydro or if you have a

2280
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:32,690
feed system I recommend that you clean

2281
01:18:29,449 --> 01:18:35,210
the lines out some way who recommended

2282
01:18:32,689 --> 01:18:37,250
it to me I remember who said it Shane it

2283
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:39,920
was our friend Shane Shane recommended

2284
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:41,840
that you use an air compressor to clean

2285
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:43,609
out the lines of your hydro system to

2286
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:45,829
blow out any clogs so if you've got a

2287
01:18:43,609 --> 01:18:47,569
feed system he's got a hydro system

2288
01:18:45,829 --> 01:18:49,369
clean that [ __ ] out if you've got little

2289
01:18:47,569 --> 01:18:52,250
sprinklers clean those out if you've got

2290
01:18:49,369 --> 01:18:53,750
drippers clean those out just you might

2291
01:18:52,250 --> 01:18:55,640
have to hand poke them you might have to

2292
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:57,680
get something pokey and just hand poke

2293
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:59,390
each little hole out by hand but you

2294
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:02,570
need them clean so clean the [ __ ] out of

2295
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:04,190
those monthly clean your air conditioner

2296
01:19:02,569 --> 01:19:07,489
filters that's something that needs to

2297
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:09,139
be done monthly also test your smoke

2298
01:19:07,489 --> 01:19:11,210
detectors you should have smoke

2299
01:19:09,140 --> 01:19:12,800
detectors in your grow rooms yes you

2300
01:19:11,210 --> 01:19:14,770
don't want that [ __ ] burning down if it

2301
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:17,239
catches on fire you want a heads up so

2302
01:19:14,770 --> 01:19:18,680
test your smoke detectors replace the

2303
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:22,069
battery if necessary that should be

2304
01:19:18,680 --> 01:19:24,170
obvious there's nothing like a beep beep

2305
01:19:22,069 --> 01:19:25,969
all the time when you're growing and

2306
01:19:24,170 --> 01:19:27,199
batteries trying to die it's the worst

2307
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,880
sound ever I don't know how anyone can

2308
01:19:27,199 --> 01:19:30,050
live with that another thing you should

2309
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,909
do every month

2310
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:34,579
the glass in your reflectors you guys

2311
01:19:31,908 --> 01:19:36,649
this may need to be done more or less

2312
01:19:34,578 --> 01:19:38,149
often depending on your style if you're

2313
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:40,279
spraying in there if you're using a

2314
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:42,319
foliar spray that shoots gonna probably

2315
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:44,118
end up a little bit on the reflectors

2316
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,590
unless you're careful if you're spraying

2317
01:19:44,118 --> 01:19:47,929
bug sprays it's gonna end up on the

2318
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:50,480
light reflectors clean that glass just

2319
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:52,130
clean it out if you can slide the glass

2320
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:53,359
out clean the inside sometimes your

2321
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:55,489
carbon filter blows a little bit of

2322
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:58,250
carbon in there just clean that stuff up

2323
01:19:55,488 --> 01:20:00,019
you're paying for the light to shine

2324
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,908
it's taking electricity the light is

2325
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:03,770
shining don't put a dirty lens between

2326
01:20:01,908 --> 01:20:05,658
the light and the plants that you're

2327
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:07,670
trying to put the light on it just makes

2328
01:20:05,658 --> 01:20:09,289
more sense to clean it you're paying

2329
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:10,309
full price no matter what you do so

2330
01:20:09,289 --> 01:20:11,779
clean that [ __ ]

2331
01:20:10,309 --> 01:20:13,039
and speaking of paying full price the

2332
01:20:11,779 --> 01:20:16,219
next step these may sound like no

2333
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:18,800
brainers but pay your electricity and

2334
01:20:16,219 --> 01:20:20,149
water bills every month you guys you

2335
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,469
should be okay running a whole bunch of

2336
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,908
electricity and use it a whole bunch of

2337
01:20:21,469 --> 01:20:24,260
water but the first time you miss a bill

2338
01:20:22,908 --> 01:20:25,279
they're gonna come [ __ ] with you they're

2339
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,719
gonna knock on your door they're gonna

2340
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:28,488
want their money and that's when [ __ ]

2341
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,078
can go wrong so pay your bills don't

2342
01:20:28,488 --> 01:20:32,419
ever try to ditch out on a grow bill

2343
01:20:30,078 --> 01:20:34,549
don't ever steal electricity you don't

2344
01:20:32,420 --> 01:20:35,868
ever steal water just pay your bills it

2345
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:37,099
should be a no-brainer most of the

2346
01:20:35,868 --> 01:20:38,719
people who listen to this show should

2347
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:40,460
already be doing that but don't ever

2348
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,439
steal if you do get caught stealing

2349
01:20:40,460 --> 01:20:44,630
electricity or water if the government I

2350
01:20:42,439 --> 01:20:47,928
think here I was told that they're able

2351
01:20:44,630 --> 01:20:49,279
to charge you threefold for what you use

2352
01:20:47,929 --> 01:20:50,389
so if you use a hundred dollars in

2353
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:53,059
electricity and you get caught stealing

2354
01:20:50,389 --> 01:20:54,260
it they can charge you 300 dollars just

2355
01:20:53,059 --> 01:20:56,809
because you stole it so pay up front

2356
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:57,980
don't be a dick it's well worth it all

2357
01:20:56,809 --> 01:20:59,510
right that's my stuff you should do

2358
01:20:57,979 --> 01:21:02,448
monthly I'm gonna move in two things

2359
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:04,280
that you should do every harvest every

2360
01:21:02,448 --> 01:21:07,189
harvest you're going to need to dispose

2361
01:21:04,279 --> 01:21:08,300
of your sticks and leaves that you have

2362
01:21:07,189 --> 01:21:09,799
left over there's gonna be a bunch of

2363
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:11,929
sticks and a bunch of leaves and a bunch

2364
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,130
of trim not the small trim you want to

2365
01:21:11,929 --> 01:21:15,170
make a shout of that but like a bunch of

2366
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:17,000
trim crap that you don't want laying

2367
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:18,590
around you need to get rid of that like

2368
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,969
I said don't go throw-in that in the

2369
01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:21,139
trash and just leaving it out there you

2370
01:21:19,969 --> 01:21:23,389
might want to wait for the trash guy to

2371
01:21:21,139 --> 01:21:24,770
come you might want to find a friend who

2372
01:21:23,389 --> 01:21:26,239
has a construction site and get

2373
01:21:24,770 --> 01:21:27,650
permission to throw your trash in there

2374
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:29,029
don't go using someone's dumpster

2375
01:21:27,649 --> 01:21:30,738
because if you get caught doing that

2376
01:21:29,029 --> 01:21:32,448
bill that's a fine for throwing your

2377
01:21:30,738 --> 01:21:33,558
trash into somebody else's [ __ ] and then

2378
01:21:32,448 --> 01:21:35,539
they'll want to see what you threw in

2379
01:21:33,559 --> 01:21:37,369
there and then this cops looking at you

2380
01:21:35,539 --> 01:21:38,929
and your big-ass bag of weed leaves and

2381
01:21:37,368 --> 01:21:42,529
then you're trying to figure out a story

2382
01:21:38,929 --> 01:21:43,940
so figure out a clever way a safe way a

2383
01:21:42,529 --> 01:21:46,939
smart way to get rid of all your

2384
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:49,189
sticks and leaves also dispose of or

2385
01:21:46,939 --> 01:21:51,500
compost or recycle all of your soil

2386
01:21:49,189 --> 01:21:53,269
carefully you don't want to be in the

2387
01:21:51,500 --> 01:21:55,219
backyard dumping out your old pots and

2388
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:56,900
then your backyard ends up full of

2389
01:21:55,219 --> 01:21:58,219
perlite and it's all white and speckly

2390
01:21:56,899 --> 01:21:59,869
and the dirt doesn't look right you

2391
01:21:58,219 --> 01:22:01,609
can't be that guy so you have to figure

2392
01:21:59,869 --> 01:22:04,329
out a way to either dispose of or

2393
01:22:01,609 --> 01:22:06,679
recycle all of that soil that you use

2394
01:22:04,329 --> 01:22:07,819
recycling soil isn't as hard as you

2395
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,650
would imagine it just needs to be

2396
01:22:07,819 --> 01:22:11,299
remanded and kind of stirred around and

2397
01:22:09,649 --> 01:22:13,429
then you can definitely use that soil

2398
01:22:11,300 --> 01:22:14,869
again so I figured out a way to do that

2399
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:17,150
I've done a little bit of talking about

2400
01:22:14,869 --> 01:22:19,189
that on the show I'm still experimenting

2401
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:21,439
with it myself so once I get good at it

2402
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:23,960
I'll do a full episode on recycling soil

2403
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:25,339
I made a little note about that so we're

2404
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:27,859
gonna have to learn how to get rid of a

2405
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,630
bunch of dirt you're gonna have sticks

2406
01:22:27,859 --> 01:22:30,769
and stuff get rid of that you're also if

2407
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:33,319
you're running hydro you're gonna have

2408
01:22:30,770 --> 01:22:36,350
rock wool cubes or you're gonna have

2409
01:22:33,319 --> 01:22:36,889
those hydroton clay pellets I hate those

2410
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:38,060
things

2411
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:40,070
you're gonna have to get rid of that

2412
01:22:38,060 --> 01:22:42,500
[ __ ] too somehow I'm pretty sure you can

2413
01:22:40,069 --> 01:22:44,630
recycle the rock wool cubes the hydrogen

2414
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:46,640
pellets you can rinse them off and use a

2415
01:22:44,630 --> 01:22:47,779
beginning and clean them but eventually

2416
01:22:46,640 --> 01:22:49,940
you got to throw those away because they

2417
01:22:47,779 --> 01:22:52,550
get funky so don't just go throw don't

2418
01:22:49,939 --> 01:22:54,198
go throwing those into your trash make

2419
01:22:52,550 --> 01:22:56,810
sure you get rid of those safely and

2420
01:22:54,198 --> 01:22:59,210
smartly smartly a word I think so

2421
01:22:56,810 --> 01:23:00,920
it is now also clean your pots you guys

2422
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:03,319
every harvest you should clean your pots

2423
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:05,180
you should also clean your hydro trays

2424
01:23:03,319 --> 01:23:06,469
if you've got a four by four botanic

2425
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:08,239
care tray or one of those four by eight

2426
01:23:06,469 --> 01:23:09,469
trays you should clean those things

2427
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:11,299
you're gonna think I'm crazy but here's

2428
01:23:09,469 --> 01:23:12,260
how I recommend you do it I throw it in

2429
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,390
the truck and just take them right to

2430
01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:15,980
the car wash and just line the pots up

2431
01:23:14,390 --> 01:23:18,829
against the wall and just spray the [ __ ]

2432
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:20,299
out of them it's Colorado here everybody

2433
01:23:18,829 --> 01:23:21,800
knows what you're doing just go spray

2434
01:23:20,300 --> 01:23:23,420
your [ __ ] down nobody cares the hydro

2435
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:25,070
trays lean it up against the side of the

2436
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:26,779
truck spray the [ __ ] out of it throw up

2437
01:23:25,069 --> 01:23:28,069
the back of the truck take it home if

2438
01:23:26,779 --> 01:23:30,109
you're in another state that may be kind

2439
01:23:28,069 --> 01:23:31,309
of weird but if cannabis is legal just

2440
01:23:30,109 --> 01:23:32,809
take them to the car wash and hose them

2441
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:34,850
down don't use any soap don't use the

2442
01:23:32,810 --> 01:23:36,140
car washing soap don't wax them just use

2443
01:23:34,850 --> 01:23:37,670
hot water on them with the high-pressure

2444
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:40,520
thing just spray the [ __ ] out of them it

2445
01:23:37,670 --> 01:23:42,829
works really well so once you got your

2446
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:44,900
pots cleaned I recommend you clean the

2447
01:23:42,829 --> 01:23:47,329
room thoroughly from top to bottom I

2448
01:23:44,899 --> 01:23:49,670
said earlier use h2o to use bleach use

2449
01:23:47,329 --> 01:23:50,960
hydrogen peroxide there are a thousand

2450
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:52,489
other products I could say to use but

2451
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:54,230
use something to get in there and

2452
01:23:52,488 --> 01:23:55,789
sanitize the room don't just clean it up

2453
01:23:54,229 --> 01:23:57,679
sanitize it

2454
01:23:55,789 --> 01:23:59,659
our good friend Mike helps me out when

2455
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:01,369
it's time to clean the room Mike and I

2456
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:03,590
dress up in our little let's get clean

2457
01:24:01,369 --> 01:24:05,899
suits it's basically just our shittiest

2458
01:24:03,590 --> 01:24:08,600
clothes we have put bandanas on our

2459
01:24:05,899 --> 01:24:10,609
faces put our hair and crazy hats go

2460
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:12,170
down in there and just clean everything

2461
01:24:10,609 --> 01:24:13,729
and by the time we're done you can eat

2462
01:24:12,170 --> 01:24:15,170
off the floor of my grow rooms when

2463
01:24:13,729 --> 01:24:17,119
they're freshly started it is so

2464
01:24:15,170 --> 01:24:19,250
gorgeous in there since I'm talking

2465
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:21,649
about Mike gonna give him a shout out we

2466
01:24:19,250 --> 01:24:23,539
recorded a podcast last night and the

2467
01:24:21,649 --> 01:24:25,159
recording sounded like [ __ ] something

2468
01:24:23,539 --> 01:24:27,319
went wrong in the recording software and

2469
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:29,809
everything sounded like robots sound

2470
01:24:27,319 --> 01:24:32,479
like r2d2 and Darth Vader and b8 having

2471
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:34,430
conversations so I just deleted that I

2472
01:24:32,479 --> 01:24:36,469
apologize to Mike for that podcast never

2473
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:38,000
making it to the air but you know he'll

2474
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:42,530
be back Mike you'll be back bro I'm

2475
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:44,119
sorry that did not work but anyway so

2476
01:24:42,529 --> 01:24:46,340
thanks for coming and let's get back

2477
01:24:44,119 --> 01:24:48,019
into the show sanitize your room every

2478
01:24:46,340 --> 01:24:49,610
harvest that's what I was saying I also

2479
01:24:48,020 --> 01:24:52,040
clean the floors and the walls in the

2480
01:24:49,609 --> 01:24:55,309
ceiling you guys wipe them down scrub

2481
01:24:52,039 --> 01:24:57,229
them down the ceiling gets funky you're

2482
01:24:55,310 --> 01:24:58,910
in there it's humid you're in there

2483
01:24:57,229 --> 01:25:01,429
spraying pesticides are in there Spring

2484
01:24:58,909 --> 01:25:03,050
foliar sprays so that puts moisture

2485
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:05,720
everywhere then it gets humid water

2486
01:25:03,050 --> 01:25:07,460
rises the ceiling is gonna get funkier

2487
01:25:05,720 --> 01:25:09,079
then you're gonna assume so just scrub

2488
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:10,909
it you'll think it's clean you'll hit it

2489
01:25:09,079 --> 01:25:12,140
with the rag and you realize it is not

2490
01:25:10,909 --> 01:25:14,000
clean the walls

2491
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:15,500
obviously same thing with the foliar

2492
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:17,449
spray same thing with the humidity and

2493
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:19,670
the floors everything lands on the floor

2494
01:25:17,449 --> 01:25:22,149
you spilled nutrients there even walk in

2495
01:25:19,670 --> 01:25:24,770
there it's just filthy clean that [ __ ]

2496
01:25:22,149 --> 01:25:27,019
also inspect any seals you've made if

2497
01:25:24,770 --> 01:25:28,340
you've sealed up any windows or doors or

2498
01:25:27,020 --> 01:25:30,110
anything like that if you've put

2499
01:25:28,340 --> 01:25:31,270
caulking somewhere recaulk it if you've

2500
01:25:30,109 --> 01:25:33,739
taped it retaping

2501
01:25:31,270 --> 01:25:36,740
also if you've put up I put up hepa

2502
01:25:33,739 --> 01:25:38,630
filters so if I've got a wall between

2503
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:40,399
two rooms and I'm pulling air from one

2504
01:25:38,630 --> 01:25:42,140
room to the other I just go to Lowe's

2505
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:43,429
and buy those little square HEPA filters

2506
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:45,050
and I just cut them kind of close to the

2507
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:48,260
shape I want just staple them to the

2508
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:49,850
wall I replace those every time every

2509
01:25:48,260 --> 01:25:52,460
harvest also I try to because they get

2510
01:25:49,850 --> 01:25:54,050
dusty they get dirty but they keep all

2511
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:55,909
the funk out of the room so just go

2512
01:25:54,050 --> 01:25:58,279
ahead and replace those that's always a

2513
01:25:55,909 --> 01:26:00,109
good idea just those little square HEPA

2514
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:02,569
filters you can find them at Lowe's if

2515
01:26:00,109 --> 01:26:03,979
you can't find those just use lucky any

2516
01:26:02,569 --> 01:26:05,210
kind of filter will work for is just

2517
01:26:03,979 --> 01:26:06,919
better than having the hole where the

2518
01:26:05,210 --> 01:26:08,020
air is moving open you just want to put

2519
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,940
a filter over there to catch

2520
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:11,590
Derr ernie bugs or anything they may be

2521
01:26:09,939 --> 01:26:13,210
trying to move around try to migrate

2522
01:26:11,590 --> 01:26:15,550
from place to place alright

2523
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:17,680
so yearly here are a couple of things

2524
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:20,260
that i think you should do every single

2525
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:23,079
year as a grower oh I forgot to mention

2526
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:24,789
every harvest um that little sleeve that

2527
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:27,369
goes around your carbon filter take that

2528
01:26:24,789 --> 01:26:28,750
off and clean it and put it back on and

2529
01:26:27,369 --> 01:26:30,099
good luck not getting carbon everywhere

2530
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,920
the next time you turn on your carbon

2531
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:33,670
filter there are tons of tricks on that

2532
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:35,289
here's what I'm talking about when you

2533
01:26:33,670 --> 01:26:37,449
use a carbon filter every time you move

2534
01:26:35,289 --> 01:26:38,949
it you jar the carbon inside and then

2535
01:26:37,449 --> 01:26:40,569
you put a blower on there if you plug in

2536
01:26:38,949 --> 01:26:42,489
the blower to start blowing the air

2537
01:26:40,569 --> 01:26:44,049
through the filter just to use it and

2538
01:26:42,489 --> 01:26:45,639
then all that carbon you've just stirred

2539
01:26:44,050 --> 01:26:49,090
goes flying through all of your lights

2540
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:50,710
and into your grow room you've got to

2541
01:26:49,090 --> 01:26:52,989
get you got to figure out a smart way to

2542
01:26:50,710 --> 01:26:56,319
catch that carbon what I do is I blow it

2543
01:26:52,989 --> 01:26:57,460
into a I've got a it's a what is it I

2544
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:59,109
know what it is I can't think of the

2545
01:26:57,460 --> 01:27:00,730
brand it's a Crown Royal bag because the

2546
01:26:59,109 --> 01:27:02,170
Crown Royal bag will let the air out but

2547
01:27:00,729 --> 01:27:04,299
it'll catch all of the particulate

2548
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:05,800
that's coming through so I just put the

2549
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:07,810
ducting into a Crown Royal bag and hold

2550
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,730
it and plug it into there for a couple

2551
01:27:07,810 --> 01:27:10,660
seconds then I just pull that off and

2552
01:27:09,729 --> 01:27:12,729
seal it up and I've caught all the

2553
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:15,189
carbon in there so that's a trick a

2554
01:27:12,729 --> 01:27:18,759
really weird random trick to keep all

2555
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:19,960
the carbon from blowing out that little

2556
01:27:18,760 --> 01:27:22,239
cover off you guys it comes with the

2557
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:23,739
sleeve take that off clean it it looks

2558
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:25,269
like [ __ ] when it's all dusty anyway you

2559
01:27:23,739 --> 01:27:27,309

2560
01:27:25,270 --> 01:27:28,210

2561
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:30,220
sucker white again

2562
01:27:28,210 --> 01:27:32,770
so yearly here's where we are yearly

2563
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:34,480
replace your carbon filter the guide the

2564
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:36,190
hydro shop swears to me that my carbon

2565
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:40,629
filters are gonna last two years they do

2566
01:27:36,189 --> 01:27:42,549
not there was a guy replacing I what's

2567
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:44,980
it called a transformer in my backyard a

2568
01:27:42,550 --> 01:27:46,539
couple of weeks ago and he told me sir

2569
01:27:44,979 --> 01:27:49,059
smells like you got a skunk back here

2570
01:27:46,539 --> 01:27:50,590
there were no smokes back there that was

2571
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:52,420
a little bit of grateful dog crossed a

2572
01:27:50,590 --> 01:27:53,619
space Queen and it was stinking up the

2573
01:27:52,420 --> 01:27:55,300
whole neighborhood because my carbon

2574
01:27:53,619 --> 01:27:57,430
filter needed to be replaced I've got a

2575
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:59,110
new one sitting there now as soon as I

2576
01:27:57,430 --> 01:28:00,670
rebuild the room I'll have a fresh

2577
01:27:59,109 --> 01:28:03,099
filter the neighbours will quit smelling

2578
01:28:00,670 --> 01:28:04,449
the candy scented skunks so replace your

2579
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:06,640
carbon filter they only last about a

2580
01:28:04,449 --> 01:28:08,979
year another thing that you should do

2581
01:28:06,640 --> 01:28:11,920
every year you guys have your fire

2582
01:28:08,979 --> 01:28:14,439
extinguisher checked and replaced or

2583
01:28:11,920 --> 01:28:16,480
charged they've got a little red yellow

2584
01:28:14,439 --> 01:28:18,369
and green gauge on them you want it all

2585
01:28:16,479 --> 01:28:20,169
the way in the green if it starts to get

2586
01:28:18,369 --> 01:28:21,819
too yellow it's not reliable anymore you

2587
01:28:20,170 --> 01:28:23,590
need a new fire extinguisher in either

2588
01:28:21,819 --> 01:28:24,849
either need to go get it charged or just

2589
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:26,199
buy a new one they sell them at Lowe's

2590
01:28:24,849 --> 01:28:28,659
they sell them at Home Depot they're not

2591
01:28:26,198 --> 01:28:30,219
expensive there hopefully you never need

2592
01:28:28,658 --> 01:28:32,408
it I really hope you never need it but

2593
01:28:30,219 --> 01:28:34,090
if you do you want it fully charged I

2594
01:28:32,408 --> 01:28:36,309
always have a fire extinguisher near

2595
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:39,099
your Dro I've got one I've got a veg

2596
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:40,630
room I've got a flowering room there's a

2597
01:28:39,099 --> 01:28:42,578
fire extinguisher hanging on the outside

2598
01:28:40,630 --> 01:28:44,139
of my flowering room have it on the

2599
01:28:42,578 --> 01:28:45,549
outside if something goes if you hear

2600
01:28:44,139 --> 01:28:47,590
that smoke alarm and they're going off

2601
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:49,869
grab the fire extinguisher check the

2602
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:51,010
door for heat if it's stupid hot you

2603
01:28:49,868 --> 01:28:53,710
have a decision to make do you want to

2604
01:28:51,010 --> 01:28:54,639
open that door or not open that door hit

2605
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:56,260
that [ __ ] with the fire extinguisher

2606
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,310
that you've already got in your hand you

2607
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,780
don't wanna open the door to run in

2608
01:28:57,310 --> 01:29:01,030
there and find the fire extinguisher in

2609
01:28:58,779 --> 01:29:03,039
the smoky hot fiery room so have it on

2610
01:29:01,029 --> 01:29:04,269
the outside but I really I prayed a job

2611
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:05,679
that you never have to use your fire

2612
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:09,579
extinguisher but I'd rather you have it

2613
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:11,590
and it work and I'd rather you be safe

2614
01:29:09,578 --> 01:29:13,238
then this thing fail on you so I've got

2615
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:15,069
another fire fire extinguisher right

2616
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:16,868
just outside the bedroom also just

2617
01:29:15,069 --> 01:29:17,948
that's where [ __ ] can go wrong there are

2618
01:29:16,868 --> 01:29:20,229
a lot of why it's a lot of electricity

2619
01:29:17,948 --> 01:29:21,759
just want to be a responsible grower try

2620
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:24,519
to be responsible so get your fire

2621
01:29:21,760 --> 01:29:27,369
extinguisher inspected and replaced once

2622
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:30,130
a year and I think that's all I've got

2623
01:29:27,368 --> 01:29:31,539
for the checklist you guys I really want

2624
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:33,819
to thank all my friends on Facebook I

2625
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:35,469
posted to Facebook asking for some

2626
01:29:33,819 --> 01:29:36,939
updates and a lot of people contributed

2627
01:29:35,469 --> 01:29:38,529
so many of you that I'm not even gonna

2628
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:40,328
try to list everybody so shout out to my

2629
01:29:38,529 --> 01:29:42,189
facebook community that helped out I

2630
01:29:40,328 --> 01:29:43,899
truly appreciate that there's some

2631
01:29:42,189 --> 01:29:46,359
things I did leave out I understand that

2632
01:29:43,899 --> 01:29:48,158
things got left out here you'll need to

2633
01:29:46,359 --> 01:29:49,269
work on a pest management system you'll

2634
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:51,519
need to integrate that into this

2635
01:29:49,270 --> 01:29:53,530
checklist somehow if you don't see any

2636
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:55,989
issues you can simply spray once a week

2637
01:29:53,529 --> 01:29:59,050
with an organic application whatever you

2638
01:29:55,988 --> 01:30:00,729
want to use I use as a max if there's no

2639
01:29:59,050 --> 01:30:02,230
problems I just use like since I travel

2640
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:03,549
from so many gardens I hit my plants

2641
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:04,988
once a week with that as a max when

2642
01:30:03,550 --> 01:30:06,460
they're in veg just to make sure that I

2643
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:08,529
don't bring anything home from all the

2644
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:10,029
other gardens I play in if you see any

2645
01:30:08,529 --> 01:30:12,639
issues in your garden you may need to

2646
01:30:10,029 --> 01:30:15,069
increase the frequency and the potency

2647
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,690
of whatever you're spraying maybe change

2648
01:30:15,069 --> 01:30:18,759
the active ingredient to of something a

2649
01:30:16,689 --> 01:30:20,049
little bit stronger hopefully you don't

2650
01:30:18,760 --> 01:30:21,579
get any pests if you're doing something

2651
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:23,469
preventative but that's something you'll

2652
01:30:21,578 --> 01:30:25,899
have to work into this regimen here as

2653
01:30:23,469 --> 01:30:27,880
well there's also gonna be a point in

2654
01:30:25,899 --> 01:30:30,098
time or you're going to need to change

2655
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:32,109
your lightbulbs we did another episode

2656
01:30:30,099 --> 01:30:35,319
on that every bulb is different every

2657
01:30:32,109 --> 01:30:38,889
garden is different we talked about swap

2658
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:40,479
your thousand watt HPS bulbs about every

2659
01:30:38,889 --> 01:30:42,400
one to three harvests I've heard people

2660
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:44,529
using them for a full year I've heard

2661
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:45,939
people using them for a while it's like

2662
01:30:44,529 --> 01:30:48,368
I said earlier when your bulbs start

2663
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:50,379
diminishing your eyes won't notice it

2664
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:52,299
but your plants will and you're still

2665
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:54,190
paying for all of the electricity if

2666
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:55,929
you've got a thousand watt bulb and it's

2667
01:30:54,189 --> 01:30:57,729
like six months old it's probably only

2668
01:30:55,929 --> 01:30:59,739
putting out 60 to 70 percent of its

2669
01:30:57,729 --> 01:31:01,868
output but you're paying for one hundred

2670
01:30:59,738 --> 01:31:04,089
percent of that thousand wants to be

2671
01:31:01,868 --> 01:31:06,130
running so go upgrade your bulbs it

2672
01:31:04,090 --> 01:31:07,840
doesn't cost that much money if you

2673
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:09,609
think about how how much herb you're

2674
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,949
gonna grow from a fresh bulb the

2675
01:31:09,609 --> 01:31:13,868
difference the cost of that bulb should

2676
01:31:11,948 --> 01:31:15,460
definitely be worth it so that's what

2677
01:31:13,868 --> 01:31:16,899
I've got for you on a checklist of

2678
01:31:15,460 --> 01:31:19,539
things that you should be doing in your

2679
01:31:16,899 --> 01:31:21,069
garden don't be shy to send me things

2706
01:32:08,439 --> 01:32:11,828
do this justice if I destroy if I tried

2707
01:32:10,510 --> 01:32:15,159
to describe it with words on a

2708
01:32:11,828 --> 01:32:18,158
microphone it's five disc perks stacked

2709
01:32:15,158 --> 01:32:20,259
on top of each other and they are welded

2710
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:23,259
together with what's called a Jesus seal

2711
01:32:20,260 --> 01:32:26,079
there are three Jesus seals holding each

2712
01:32:23,260 --> 01:32:28,150
perk together the discs are actually

2713
01:32:26,078 --> 01:32:30,309
donuts and there is a tube that goes

2714
01:32:28,149 --> 01:32:32,500
down the middle and it's got a hammer

2715
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:34,090
head so there's a down stem that goes

2716
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:36,908

01:34:02,569 --> 01:34:06,769
appreciate it if you're curious where

2766
01:34:04,789 --> 01:34:08,359
your contribution goes it goes to paying

2767
01:34:06,770 --> 01:34:09,500
for the hosting of my website it goes

2768
01:34:08,359 --> 01:34:11,149
through things like new microphone

2769
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:12,529
covers I try to have microphone covers

2770
01:34:11,149 --> 01:34:15,769
for the guests because they do this kind

2771
01:34:12,529 --> 01:34:17,300
of stuff the microphones when they're

2772
01:34:15,770 --> 01:34:18,650
talking because they're new so I try to

2773
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,300
have a cover for each guest if they

2774
01:34:18,649 --> 01:34:22,339
don't have to go rub in their face on

2775
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:24,770
another person's mic cover I just think

2776
01:34:22,340 --> 01:34:26,869
so that's gross water bottles for all of

2777
01:34:24,770 --> 01:34:29,960
the guests but mostly it goes to

2778
01:34:26,869 --> 01:34:31,640
covering the Bluehost website which is

2779
01:34:29,960 --> 01:34:32,989
where I host or the Bluehost hosting fee

2780
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:34,940
which is where I have my website which

2781
01:34:32,988 --> 01:34:36,529
is where I host this show there's a

2782
01:34:34,939 --> 01:34:37,909
hundred and thirteen episodes up there

2783
01:34:36,529 --> 01:34:39,259
so it does take a little bit of

2784
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:40,698
bandwidth anyway I'm just letting you

2785
01:34:39,260 --> 01:34:41,810
know where that goes I'm not begging if

2786
01:34:40,698 --> 01:34:43,729
you'd like to contribute I would

2787

01:42:40,929 --> 01:42:44,618
know you mostly as Fox I'll probably

2920
01:42:42,250 --> 01:42:47,139
clean Fox's most of the show that's you

2921
01:42:44,618 --> 01:42:48,908
are who I refer to as my CBD expert if

2922
01:42:47,139 --> 01:42:51,219
I've got a CBD question I usually call

2923
01:42:48,908 --> 01:42:53,170
you up so Wow I guess what I should

2924
01:42:51,219 --> 01:42:55,810
start with is can you tell my listeners

2925
01:42:53,170 --> 01:43:00,328
a little bit about what CBD is okay

2926
01:42:55,810 --> 01:43:04,139
CBD just like THC is a compound

2927
01:43:00,328 --> 01:43:08,009
in cannabis that is non psychoactive so

2928
01:43:04,139 --> 01:43:10,130
let's say tea is a psychoactive compound

2929
01:43:08,010 --> 01:43:14,460
which obviously gives us a great feeling

2930
01:43:10,130 --> 01:43:18,779
CBD is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid

2931
01:43:14,460 --> 01:43:22,559
that has different qualities that THC

2932
01:43:18,779 --> 01:43:25,828
doesn't have okay and I mean it's it's

2933
01:43:22,559 --> 01:43:28,980
one of 138 found in cannabis and it's

2934
01:43:25,828 --> 01:43:45,029
like you know we're 138 cannabinoids 130

2935
01:43:28,979 --> 01:43:46,229
Wow I only know of maybe 12 or 13 so THC

2936
01:43:45,029 --> 01:43:48,779
is the one that we all love it gets us

2937
01:43:46,229 --> 01:43:51,658
high it displays you said there is no

2938
01:43:48,779 --> 01:43:54,090
psychoactive effects to CBD no there's

2939
01:43:51,658 --> 01:43:55,920
more for effect right you know in high

2940
01:43:54,090 --> 01:43:58,800
doses you can get kind of like an

2941
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:01,429
elevated euphoria but it's nothing like

2942
01:43:58,800 --> 01:44:06,179
a psychoactive effect where you feel

2943
01:44:01,429 --> 01:44:08,849
high CBD being in Colorado we're blessed

2944
01:44:06,179 --> 01:44:10,380
to have absolutely available I'm not I

2945
01:44:08,849 --> 01:44:12,000
don't smoke a lot of CBD myself it

2946
01:44:10,380 --> 01:44:13,349
doesn't do anything for me I am a

2947
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,939
medical marijuana patient but I don't

2948
01:44:13,349 --> 01:44:16,828
need the CBD so I try to save it for the

2949
01:44:14,939 --> 01:44:19,618
patient's trip we did talk about it on

2950
01:44:16,828 --> 01:44:21,058
in one episode we'll talk a little bit

2951
01:44:19,618 --> 01:44:25,139
later about the effect that had on

2952
01:44:21,059 --> 01:44:26,940
myself but I want to hear more about so

2953
01:44:25,139 --> 01:44:28,920
why are we going for the CBD it what

2954
01:44:26,939 --> 01:44:30,719
does it really do for you why are you so

2955
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:39,029
enthusiastic about CBD if it's not

2956
01:44:30,719 --> 01:44:41,698
psychoactive okay we've got plenty of

2957
01:44:39,029 --> 01:44:46,939
time okay so in the long terms of it

2958
01:44:41,698 --> 01:44:46,939
when I was young you know I lost a child

2959
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:53,760
that's that's why I'm here and that's

2960
01:44:52,469 --> 01:44:56,279
why raise awareness

2961
01:44:53,760 --> 01:44:58,090
I lost my second child epilepsy I was

2962
01:44:56,279 --> 01:45:02,819
very young what happened

2963
01:44:58,090 --> 01:45:07,360
I had no idea about epilepsy at the time

2964
01:45:02,819 --> 01:45:09,219
literally it took me by storm there was

2965
01:45:07,359 --> 01:45:13,149
a good seven-year period where I had one

2966
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:15,880
two very confused place it puts strain

2967
01:45:13,149 --> 01:45:18,309
on every relationship around me all that

2968
01:45:15,880 --> 01:45:20,590
I continued to focus on at the time was

2969
01:45:18,310 --> 01:45:23,920
cannabis and I had no idea that it would

2970
01:45:20,590 --> 01:45:26,260
bring me round circle to something that

2971
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:28,389
I dealt with and not really knew about

2972
01:45:26,260 --> 01:45:30,250
what had gone on until I met a parent

2973
01:45:28,389 --> 01:45:32,349
going through something similar with

2974
01:45:30,250 --> 01:45:34,479
their nonverbal autistic child who was a

2975
01:45:32,349 --> 01:45:36,099
cannabis patient in their state they

2976
01:45:34,479 --> 01:45:39,819
started telling me all about the wonders

2977
01:45:36,099 --> 01:45:41,650
of how CBD is working for them but they

2978
01:45:39,819 --> 01:45:43,179
have problems getting at problems

2979
01:45:41,649 --> 01:45:44,799
obtaining at the CBD that they were

2980
01:45:43,179 --> 01:45:49,270
getting was tainted and making their

2981
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:53,320
child sick had random [ __ ] in it

2982
01:45:49,270 --> 01:45:55,090
absolutely we didn't know much let's say

2983
01:45:53,319 --> 01:45:57,250
this is two years ago that I you know

2984
01:45:55,090 --> 01:45:59,739

2985
01:45:57,250 --> 01:46:01,599

2986
01:45:59,738 --> 01:46:03,789

3044
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:26,720

you know wonderful unit that he had I

3046
01:48:26,720 --> 01:48:32,850
think so and then okay Caleb over there

01:48:31,079 --> 01:48:35,180
got the oil and cranked it out into the

3048
01:48:32,850 --> 01:48:37,289
award-winning chocolate bar that it was

3049
01:48:35,180 --> 01:48:39,180
funny that you had all those people in

3050
01:48:37,289 --> 01:48:48,170

01:48:50,939 --> 01:48:53,710

3056
01:48:54,760 --> 01:48:59,770
definitely try the peanut butter is very

3057
01:48:56,649 --> 01:49:01,229
yummy my favorite was the banana what

3058
01:48:59,770 --> 01:49:04,540
was that a banana something you gave me

3059
01:49:01,229 --> 01:49:09,239
yes yeah that was the the entry okay

3060
01:49:04,539 --> 01:49:11,979
the banana cream that was so delicious

3061
01:49:09,239 --> 01:49:14,109
walked around just whoa for the rest of

3062
01:49:11,979 --> 01:49:16,089
the day it put a little slowness on my

3063
01:49:14,109 --> 01:49:20,019
day you know the oil that we used for it

3064
01:49:16,090 --> 01:49:24,220
it came back testing out at 71.3% CBD

3065
01:49:20,020 --> 01:49:26,740
okay ten point nine five percent THC so

3066
01:49:24,220 --> 01:49:28,329
really strong seven to one so when we

3067
01:49:26,739 --> 01:49:30,639
cranked out and did the math that he

3068
01:49:28,329 --> 01:49:34,539
dosed it out it came out to like 160

3069
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:37,110
milligrams to that bar and I mean it was

3070
01:49:34,539 --> 01:49:39,939
almost the perfect ratio for just

3071
01:49:37,109 --> 01:49:42,880
literally having the calmest day we come

3072
01:49:39,939 --> 01:49:44,739
we gave some in donating stem to some

3073
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:47,770
autistic patients that were having some

3074
01:49:44,739 --> 01:49:49,179
rage issues pediatric nonverbal so

3075
01:49:47,770 --> 01:49:51,190
obviously you know it's hard to gate

3076
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:52,420
stuff like that and the results that we

3077
01:49:51,189 --> 01:49:53,979
were getting back from the parents were

3078
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:55,690
almost immediate saying just from a few

3079
01:49:53,979 --> 01:49:57,579
chips of this chocolate bar they were

3080
01:49:55,689 --> 01:49:59,559
getting calming soothing effects so that

3081
01:49:57,579 --> 01:50:02,140
was really helping with those oh I can

3082
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:05,160
see there's no way that I could be

3083
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:07,510
rageful or angry after eating that thing

3084
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:11,460
walking around day 2 of the cannabis cup

3085
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:13,780
just in mellow bubble around beautiful

3086
01:50:11,460 --> 01:50:15,250
alright so you said really help the

3087
01:50:13,779 --> 01:50:20,500
autistic children with their rage what

3088
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:24,670
other things to CBD help with CBD is a

3089
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:26,470
new your protectant anti cancer so let

3090
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:29,199
me pause for a second when I say anti

3091
01:50:26,470 --> 01:50:32,890
cancer we all know that THC kills cancer

3092
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:34,779
cells CBD freezes the cancer cell in its

3093
01:50:32,890 --> 01:50:37,720
tracks so it can't progress or grow any

3094
01:50:34,779 --> 01:50:41,649
further but it will not kill it no anti

3095
01:50:37,720 --> 01:50:44,170
cancer is freezing it at bay its best it

3096
01:50:41,649 --> 01:50:46,779
basically causes cell death in the

3097
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:51,489
mutated cells and so that the tumors

3098
01:50:46,779 --> 01:50:53,649
can't grow anymore but they're okay if

3099
01:50:51,489 --> 01:50:57,099
you use a conjunction of a high CBD high

3100
01:50:53,649 --> 01:50:59,739
THC regimen with cancer you're bound to

3101
01:50:57,100 --> 01:51:01,440
basically stop kick freeze and kill

3102
01:50:59,739 --> 01:51:03,059
those mutated cells and

3103
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:07,409
you know get back to a healthier you

3104
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:09,360
know way of living yes so CBDs in your

3105
01:51:07,409 --> 01:51:10,710
protection so obviously it's very

3106
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:12,960
popular with epilepsy and other

3107
01:51:10,710 --> 01:51:14,609
neurological diseases Asperger's autism

3108
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:20,279
children on the spectrum

3109
01:51:14,609 --> 01:51:22,019
Crohn's PTSD anxiety it kind of goes on

3110
01:51:20,279 --> 01:51:26,399
there's almost anything that an adult

3111
01:51:22,020 --> 01:51:29,340
would be suffering from pretty much I

3112
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:32,219
don't even take any form of aspirin or

3113
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:35,369
any I mean I have completely separated

3114
01:51:32,219 --> 01:51:37,350
all that with different regimens of CBD

3115
01:51:35,369 --> 01:51:39,719
and THC in just a healthy cannabis

3116
01:51:37,350 --> 01:51:42,030
regimen you know okay endocannabinoid

3117
01:51:39,719 --> 01:51:43,680
system is very important and we all as

3118
01:51:42,029 --> 01:51:46,170
medical patients have our own

3119
01:51:43,680 --> 01:51:49,380
deficiencies in those systems CBD is one

3120
01:51:46,170 --> 01:51:51,239
of those all around protectants it's the

3121
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:53,609
vault it's the multivitamin of the

3122
01:51:51,238 --> 01:51:56,429
cannabis you know world I like that you

3123
01:51:53,609 --> 01:52:01,198
make a sticker out of that yeah Centrum

3124
01:51:56,430 --> 01:52:03,630
sticker it does so much and in different

3125
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:07,250
variations and ratios that can help so

3126
01:52:03,630 --> 01:52:12,690
many different things I mean Parkinson's

3127
01:52:07,250 --> 01:52:15,930
cerebral palsy nerve damage it goes it

3128
01:52:12,689 --> 01:52:18,329
goes on and on I mean it literally the

3129
01:52:15,930 --> 01:52:24,030
in CBD itself there's other spectrum of

3130
01:52:18,329 --> 01:52:27,930
cannabinoids CBN CVG CBC you know that

3131
01:52:24,029 --> 01:52:31,198
all have different medical attributes

3132
01:52:27,930 --> 01:52:34,289
that aren't psychoactive kitchen high

3133
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:37,609
kind of things these are one of these is

3134
01:52:34,289 --> 01:52:40,109
an anti-inflammatory one of these is a

3135
01:52:37,609 --> 01:52:42,359
antibacterial one of these is a bone

3136
01:52:40,109 --> 01:52:44,670
regeneration you know I make a CBG cream

3137
01:52:42,359 --> 01:52:46,409
for a couple of patients that have this

3138
01:52:44,670 --> 01:52:48,190
rare disease called Keene box disease

3139
01:52:46,409 --> 01:52:51,880
which is where

3140
01:52:48,189 --> 01:52:55,059
is basically dying and I came up with

3141
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:56,770
the salve that literally supplies

3142
01:52:55,060 --> 01:52:59,110
immediate relief for people that have

3143
01:52:56,770 --> 01:53:00,460
had the surgery we have that pain I'm

3144
01:52:59,109 --> 01:53:02,698
trying to make that more readily

3145
01:53:00,460 --> 01:53:05,260
available that's amazing that's amazing

3146
01:53:02,698 --> 01:53:06,759
that should definitely sway some of the

3147
01:53:05,260 --> 01:53:08,199
people I encourage people that don't

3148
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:10,239
know a lot about cannabis to listen to

3149
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:11,829
my show so that should sway them to

3150
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:14,198
believe a little bit more in medical

3151
01:53:11,829 --> 01:53:15,399
marijuana and the uses as practical uses

3152
01:53:14,198 --> 01:53:18,369
and then we're not just in this just to

3153
01:53:15,399 --> 01:53:28,569
get as high as we possibly a lot of us

3154
01:53:18,369 --> 01:53:31,630
are and get rekt but part of my regimen

3155
01:53:28,569 --> 01:53:33,729
all the time I don't just advocate in

3156
01:53:31,630 --> 01:53:35,469
you know see what we do with the

3157
01:53:33,729 --> 01:53:39,189
genetics and you know the breeding and

3158
01:53:35,469 --> 01:53:43,230
just everything in general I needed you

3159
01:53:39,189 --> 01:53:47,589
know I literally I know I'm happier with

3160
01:53:43,229 --> 01:53:48,939
productive person I don't have going

3161
01:53:47,590 --> 01:53:50,380
through some of the things that you know

3162
01:53:48,939 --> 01:53:52,238
I've gone through at a young age you

3163
01:53:50,380 --> 01:53:54,310
know that kind of you know it weighs on

3164
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:57,099
you a little bit you know and so it it

3165
01:53:54,310 --> 01:54:00,340
gets hard sometimes literally as soon as

3166
01:53:57,100 --> 01:54:04,380
I started enriching my cannabis diet

3167
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:07,480
with CBD I've noticed a wide spectrum of

3168
01:54:04,380 --> 01:54:10,270
problems that I was having day to day

3169
01:54:07,479 --> 01:54:13,389
really kind of just have more control

3170
01:54:10,270 --> 01:54:14,500
over I don't really I don't let it get

3171
01:54:13,390 --> 01:54:16,600
to me anymore and I just find myself

3172
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:19,420
being incredibly more productive when

3173
01:54:16,600 --> 01:54:24,190
you have it in my system the same way

3174
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:29,800
about THC and I'm glad that we can sit

3175
01:54:24,189 --> 01:54:33,719
here and Wonder for THC one of my

3176
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:33,719
friends team Landon

3177
01:54:34,289 --> 01:54:37,819
[Music]

3178
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:43,838
[Music]

3179
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:52,369
but yeah he cured his leukemia with THC

3180
01:54:50,329 --> 01:54:53,779
strong cannabis though he started with

3181
01:54:52,369 --> 01:54:56,960
the realm of caring which is obviously

3182
01:54:53,779 --> 01:54:59,509
known for Charlotte's Web and the yeah

3183
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:02,090
but the CBD oil which he actually wasn't

3184
01:54:59,510 --> 01:55:03,470
even using for the most part I mean they

3185
01:55:02,090 --> 01:55:05,360
used it as a supplement because they

3186
01:55:03,470 --> 01:55:08,119
noticed it was stopping what the chemo

3187
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:10,279
is doing but they made it very they were

3188
01:55:08,119 --> 01:55:13,789
very adamant that TV is what killed and

3189
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:15,619
stopped his leukemia and you know it's

3190
01:55:13,789 --> 01:55:18,050
been I think over six months since he's

3191
01:55:15,619 --> 01:55:20,599
had a clean you know bill very nice yeah

3192
01:55:18,050 --> 01:55:22,420
absolutely no or stay chemo anymore

3193
01:55:20,600 --> 01:55:24,560
state for scheme oh I'm sorry no more

3194
01:55:22,420 --> 01:55:27,739
all the tests have come back completely

3195
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:30,110
negative you know there's no signs he

3196
01:55:27,739 --> 01:55:31,729
still maintains a healthy regimen Ciera

3197
01:55:30,109 --> 01:55:35,389
maintains as his caregiver and we

3198
01:55:31,729 --> 01:55:36,979
oversee you know all that and I've seen

3199
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:38,450
what both sides of it does so at the end

3200
01:55:36,979 --> 01:55:39,919
of the day though we advocate for are

3201
01:55:38,449 --> 01:55:41,779
different compounds are different

3202
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:46,369
cannabinoids whole plant cannabis is

3203
01:55:41,779 --> 01:55:52,819
what I think the full spectrum the

3204
01:55:46,369 --> 01:55:55,159
synergistic effect play this episode for

3205
01:55:52,819 --> 01:56:04,579
me guys put them put them up by the the

3206
01:55:55,159 --> 01:56:06,649
iPhone I let him hear this Judy yeah did

3207
01:56:04,579 --> 01:56:08,569
Colorado Springs is Sony we were talking

3208
01:56:06,649 --> 01:56:10,519
a minute ago about how the medical

3209
01:56:08,569 --> 01:56:12,079
community here has united because we

3210
01:56:10,520 --> 01:56:14,810
don't have recreational so we don't have

3211
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:21,829
that there's not as greedy of a vibe in

3212
01:56:14,810 --> 01:56:23,270
cannabis it's beautiful it's all

3213
01:56:21,829 --> 01:56:24,619
peaceful no one's got a problem we got

3214
01:56:23,270 --> 01:56:26,750
people up there whipping up dabs for

3215
01:56:24,619 --> 01:56:28,460
them they're pressing a frozen just

3216
01:56:26,750 --> 01:56:29,840
hanging out it's so peaceful it's great

3217
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:31,159
I love it hey guys come on down to the

3218
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:36,560
candy cane and get a dad with us one of

3219
01:56:31,159 --> 01:56:37,760
these nights you told me we talked a

3220
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:39,680
little bit before we hit record you guys

3221
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,150
got comfortable took a bunch of dabs

3222
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:45,460
together but you're telling me that you

3223
01:56:41,149 --> 01:56:48,500
made extracts before you even grew yes

3224
01:56:45,460 --> 01:56:52,159
just being a process process I hate

3225
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:52,869
saying I mean I values what you're doing

3226
01:56:52,159 --> 01:56:54,909
but

3227
01:56:52,869 --> 01:56:57,789
understand the term where we were

3228
01:56:54,909 --> 01:57:01,720
whatever the case was it started one way

3229
01:56:57,789 --> 01:57:03,909
and it started becoming clear that we

3230
01:57:01,720 --> 01:57:06,579
couldn't control you can only control so

3231
01:57:03,909 --> 01:57:08,649
much of what you make things it's all in

3232
01:57:06,579 --> 01:57:11,710
your starting material absolutely and I

3233
01:57:08,649 --> 01:57:13,539
wanted to start controlling the type of

3234
01:57:11,710 --> 01:57:17,050
medicine that I was making instead of

3235
01:57:13,539 --> 01:57:18,640
just processing other people's material

3236
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:20,500
I mean because it's hit or miss you have

3237
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:22,329
some people that put their love and

3238
01:57:20,500 --> 01:57:24,220
their everything into their material and

3239
01:57:22,329 --> 01:57:28,600
it shows when you end up pulling it out

3240
01:57:24,220 --> 01:57:31,990
and sometimes out the case flora my and

3241
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:38,800
everything else exactly what you mean

3242
01:57:31,989 --> 01:57:41,550
that's the most wonderfully nice yeah so

3243
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:44,470
you know certain processing the oil

3244
01:57:41,550 --> 01:57:46,420
found out that I kind of really love

3245
01:57:44,470 --> 01:57:48,610
doing it got back to you know my roots

3246
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:50,350
and chemistry and just little things

3247
01:57:48,609 --> 01:57:51,909
like that and then and seeing what

3248
01:57:50,350 --> 01:57:53,710
people are doing with distillation even

3249
01:57:51,909 --> 01:57:55,300
a few years ago and then things like

3250
01:57:53,710 --> 01:57:58,980
that yeah and seeing how we're coming

3251
01:57:55,300 --> 01:58:02,110
along I mean we're still a budding baby

3252
01:57:58,979 --> 01:58:05,079
industry in the can of chemistry world

3253
01:58:02,109 --> 01:58:07,179
oh yeah I agree with that yeah it's

3254
01:58:05,079 --> 01:58:10,119
amazing to see what we're doing now with

3255
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:12,220
technology that's been around for a long

3256
01:58:10,119 --> 01:58:13,869
time and now we have these wonderful new

3257
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:15,610
ways and freedoms to apply these new

3258
01:58:13,869 --> 01:58:17,590
applications so it's great to see what

3259
01:58:15,609 --> 01:58:19,239
these guys are doing and people are

3260
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:20,710
coming out with new extraction

3261
01:58:19,239 --> 01:58:22,239
techniques whether it's in the solvent

3262
01:58:20,710 --> 01:58:25,689
list world or whether we're using you

3263
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:29,979
know solvents or whatever the case is

3264
01:58:25,689 --> 01:58:31,119
and it's exciting to see what are some

3265
01:58:29,979 --> 01:58:32,799
of the things you make I've seen you

3266
01:58:31,119 --> 01:58:35,229
make a bunch of different types of Seco

3267
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:38,890
products through the list of what you

3268
01:58:35,229 --> 01:58:42,250
can do so we made suppositories for some

3269
01:58:38,890 --> 01:58:44,140
patients we've made dogs CBD biscuits

3270
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:47,859
we've also one-to-one treats for the

3271
01:58:44,140 --> 01:58:50,020
cancer you know some older you know some

3272
01:58:47,859 --> 01:58:52,750
rural canine friends have you know fatty

3273
01:58:50,020 --> 01:58:54,760
tumors or whatnot at all absolutely you

3274
01:58:52,750 --> 01:58:56,560
know so we do what we can and start

3275
01:58:54,760 --> 01:58:59,940
coming up with solutions solutions to

3276
01:58:56,560 --> 01:58:59,940
try to help those patients

3277
01:59:02,529 --> 01:59:07,439
you know I have a few myself so from

3278
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:11,319
there

3279
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:14,889
bombs different ratios of capsules for a

3280
01:59:11,319 --> 01:59:16,000
wide variety of ailments from you know

3281
01:59:14,890 --> 01:59:19,570
everyday

3282
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:24,430
cannabis regimens you know for a normal

3283
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:26,949
medical patient to an extended hospice

3284
01:59:24,430 --> 01:59:28,329
patient where what we do at that point

3285
01:59:26,949 --> 01:59:31,389
is make them as comfortable as we can

3286
01:59:28,329 --> 01:59:32,800
and we're you know these patients are in

3287
01:59:31,390 --> 01:59:34,450
the excess of taking anywhere from a

3288
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:37,480
thousand to three thousand milligrams of

3289
01:59:34,449 --> 01:59:39,970
cannabis a day to comfortable you know

3290
01:59:37,479 --> 01:59:42,309
because that's what you can do so and

3291
01:59:39,970 --> 01:59:47,820
you're able to produce then reliably

3292
01:59:42,310 --> 01:59:51,250
perhaps we do we make per patient it's

3293
01:59:47,819 --> 01:59:53,199
specifically per so there's nothing -

3294
01:59:51,250 --> 01:59:55,270
the sad that I've talked about the CBG

3295
01:59:53,199 --> 01:59:57,039
salve and then any collaborations that

3296
01:59:55,270 --> 01:59:59,530
we've done with friends like Caleb or

3297
01:59:57,039 --> 02:00:00,880
anything like that are things that are

3298
01:59:59,529 --> 02:00:02,859
even close to being mass-produced

3299
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:06,039
everything is small batch everything is

3300
02:00:02,859 --> 02:00:08,649
individually made per patient we've done

3301
02:00:06,039 --> 02:00:10,989
saline and cannabis saline infusions as

3302
02:00:08,649 --> 02:00:13,779
well as for those children that have to

3303
02:00:10,989 --> 02:00:16,840
feed through tea tubes oh wow

3304
02:00:13,779 --> 02:00:19,389
we've done thinking of everything yeah

3305
02:00:16,840 --> 02:00:21,909
we've done some medicated lubricants as

3306
02:00:19,390 --> 02:00:23,579
well we've done those work yeah

3307
02:00:21,909 --> 02:00:27,340
absolutely

3308
02:00:23,579 --> 02:00:32,949
shoot obviously different concentrates

3309
02:00:27,340 --> 02:00:39,400
water extracted butane extracted what's

3310
02:00:32,949 --> 02:00:40,960
the white CBD stuff I've seen my friends

3311
02:00:39,399 --> 02:00:43,509
seemly I didn't have a company called

3312
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:45,460
land in South Hutt and they work with

3313
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:50,230
the lab here in the states that produces

3314
02:00:45,460 --> 02:00:53,319
this hemp derived 99.5 seven percent I

3315
02:00:50,229 --> 02:00:54,459
CBD isolate Wow and at first she started

3316
02:00:53,319 --> 02:00:55,899
telling me about it and I was very

3317
02:00:54,460 --> 02:00:57,970
skeptical and I wanted more information

3318
02:00:55,899 --> 02:01:00,009
and then we got in touch with the lab

3319
02:00:57,970 --> 02:01:01,990
and I found out that they were using you

3320
02:01:00,010 --> 02:01:03,130
know American sourced hampt and they you

3321
02:01:01,989 --> 02:01:05,469
know they kind of walked us through the

3322
02:01:03,130 --> 02:01:07,670
process of you know did this lading and

3323
02:01:05,470 --> 02:01:10,920
then you know crystallizing

3324
02:01:07,670 --> 02:01:12,270
you basically you know it's I know just

3325
02:01:10,920 --> 02:01:14,010
made it sound like it's a simplified

3326
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:15,180
process but it kind of is you know it's

3327
02:01:14,010 --> 02:01:17,550
just a matter of getting the right

3328
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:25,320
material you're gonna you've got a chem

3329
02:01:17,550 --> 02:01:27,659
background so the pond with the rocks of

3330
02:01:25,319 --> 02:01:31,439
time but what catches really catches and

3331
02:01:27,659 --> 02:01:32,279
throw a lot of trial and error you this

3332
02:01:31,439 --> 02:01:34,139
industry is all about

3333
02:01:32,279 --> 02:01:36,239
absolutely trial and errors your friend

3334
02:01:34,140 --> 02:01:38,579
and I mean that's how I do everything

3335
02:01:36,239 --> 02:01:40,229
and I really you know we try to focus

3336
02:01:38,579 --> 02:01:43,920
and don't get anything out until it's

3337
02:01:40,229 --> 02:01:45,509
right and we in the series of things I

3338
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:47,279
can really only think of one little

3339
02:01:45,510 --> 02:01:49,350
thing that we've ever gone through and

3340
02:01:47,279 --> 02:01:51,359
you know you're making edibles for

3341
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:53,070
someone I learned my mistakes and

3342
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:54,449
putting flaxseed in there because some

3343
02:01:53,069 --> 02:01:57,389
people are very susceptible to that

3344
02:01:54,449 --> 02:01:59,609
allergy but other than that like I can't

3345
02:01:57,390 --> 02:02:01,500
think of you know what we make has

3346
02:01:59,609 --> 02:02:04,949
really helped a lot of people across the

3347
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:06,420
board for all the different ailments we

3348
02:02:04,949 --> 02:02:11,279
stay away from alcohol extractions as

3349
02:02:06,420 --> 02:02:12,659
far as our so any alcohol infused

3350
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:14,869
textures or anything like that just

3351
02:02:12,659 --> 02:02:17,699
because we mostly started with pediatric

3352
02:02:14,869 --> 02:02:19,800
epileptic patients then trace amounts of

3353
02:02:17,699 --> 02:02:21,720
alcohol could the medications that they

3354
02:02:19,800 --> 02:02:24,029
have to take for the most part even

3355
02:02:21,720 --> 02:02:27,539
trace amounts of that kid effect and

3356
02:02:24,029 --> 02:02:29,639
totally just give them a huge variety of

3357
02:02:27,539 --> 02:02:32,750
complications with their medication and

3358
02:02:29,640 --> 02:02:36,240
I've seen you know it's also it's very

3359
02:02:32,750 --> 02:02:37,409
hard on their digestive systems and so

3360
02:02:36,239 --> 02:02:39,510
yeah children that are going through

3361
02:02:37,409 --> 02:02:41,250
chemo children that have autism children

3362
02:02:39,510 --> 02:02:43,610
that have epilepsy all have compromised

3363
02:02:41,250 --> 02:02:47,340
immune systems and compromised digestive

3364
02:02:43,609 --> 02:02:48,839
systems in their own way so one of the

3365
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:51,329
problems that I've seen with pediatric

3366
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:53,900
patients using ours so is that they have

3367
02:02:51,329 --> 02:02:56,789
problems holding down that medicine so

3368
02:02:53,899 --> 02:03:00,269
start going around and promoting you

3369
02:02:56,789 --> 02:03:03,239
know different carrier oils different

3370
02:03:00,270 --> 02:03:05,750
you know ways of taking this you know

3371
02:03:03,239 --> 02:03:08,039
non solvent or solvent extract and

3372
02:03:05,750 --> 02:03:09,810
decarboxylate and you know putting it

3373
02:03:08,039 --> 02:03:12,000
into a healthier carrier oil for these

3374
02:03:09,810 --> 02:03:14,880
children what's an example maybe copper

3375
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:17,239
coil coconut oil and if someone is

3376
02:03:14,880 --> 02:03:19,279
diabetic and they want to try

3377
02:03:17,239 --> 02:03:22,010
there's always ham seed oil which is the

3378
02:03:19,279 --> 02:03:23,960
healthiest I mean it's protein juice

3379
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:26,480
it's it's absolutely wonderful for you

3380
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:29,600
so I always say hemp seed oil first if

3381
02:03:26,479 --> 02:03:31,429
not avvocato Isle grape seed oil is

3382
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:33,620
another wonderful example of something

3383
02:03:31,430 --> 02:03:35,030
you can use those in coconut oil but you

3384
02:03:33,619 --> 02:03:37,309
know a lot of people are very happy with

3385
02:03:35,029 --> 02:03:38,659
coconut oil if it works and you know it

3386
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:40,100
works yeah a lot of people are on the

3387
02:03:38,659 --> 02:03:42,380
coconut oil cake it seems to be real

3388
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:43,880
popular lately my first question is with

3389
02:03:42,380 --> 02:03:45,619
that is if they're Crohn's patient or

3390
02:03:43,880 --> 02:03:48,350
diabetic I asked them right away

3391
02:03:45,619 --> 02:03:50,059
and you know we just I transparency is

3392
02:03:48,350 --> 02:03:51,470
everything you know true knowledge you

3393
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:53,270
know this knowledge is all open source

3394
02:03:51,470 --> 02:03:55,430
so the more you can be open with the

3395
02:03:53,270 --> 02:03:56,750
patient and explain it to them the more

3396
02:03:55,430 --> 02:03:58,400
they leave knowing at the end of the day

3397
02:03:56,750 --> 02:04:00,380
the better it is in the long run you

3398
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:02,389
know have you thought about going to

3399
02:04:00,380 --> 02:04:03,980
dispensaries and maybe to medical shops

3400
02:04:02,390 --> 02:04:05,840
and teaching the bud tenders this sort

3401
02:04:03,979 --> 02:04:07,789
of stuff or do you think they I

3402
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:11,150
absolutely think there's a really

3403
02:04:07,789 --> 02:04:13,840
important part and people bartenders

3404
02:04:11,149 --> 02:04:17,719
specifically getting some form of

3405
02:04:13,840 --> 02:04:19,400
education because a lot of them I'll be

3406
02:04:17,720 --> 02:04:21,500
very blunt I say this a lot of them look

3407
02:04:19,399 --> 02:04:23,929
at it's just a job you know a lot of

3408
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:25,520
them come in looking at the retail job

3409
02:04:23,930 --> 02:04:26,960
there's a lot of retail aspects to what

3410
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:29,120
it is because it is a peel a

3411
02:04:26,960 --> 02:04:30,109
point-of-sale system but at the end of

3412
02:04:29,119 --> 02:04:32,000
the day you're dealing with medical

3413
02:04:30,109 --> 02:04:36,949
patients and what you're providing what

3414
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:38,720
you're helping sell is we want to be

3415
02:04:36,949 --> 02:04:40,760
taken seriously like a medical industry

3416
02:04:38,720 --> 02:04:43,250
like we're trying to take the time with

3417
02:04:40,760 --> 02:04:44,840
the medical patient is required I don't

3418
02:04:43,250 --> 02:04:46,909
think anyone ever got too mad at a bun

3419
02:04:44,840 --> 02:04:48,230
tender for knowing too much like proper

3420
02:04:46,909 --> 02:04:50,180
information about their meds

3421
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:52,219
I've been a budtender and I've annoyed a

3422
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:57,409
few people with my weed nerd skills so

3423
02:04:52,220 --> 02:04:59,000
people just don't care for what they

3424
02:04:57,409 --> 02:05:00,500
want are therefore just what they want

3425
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,039
but there's curious patients that come

3426
02:05:00,500 --> 02:05:05,779
in and they have genuine like like real

3427
02:05:04,039 --> 02:05:08,090
questions about things that they don't

3428
02:05:05,779 --> 02:05:09,500
know so it's wonderful to have somebody

3429
02:05:08,090 --> 02:05:11,750
there that knows what they're talking

3430
02:05:09,500 --> 02:05:13,520
yeah they can just make them feel more

3431
02:05:11,750 --> 02:05:15,590
welcome and more often or not you build

3432
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:17,420
wonderful business relationships with

3433
02:05:15,590 --> 02:05:19,970
your patients and they feel comfortable

3434
02:05:17,420 --> 02:05:22,060
coming back and getting you know their

3435
02:05:19,970 --> 02:05:24,909
medicine from people that actually

3436
02:05:22,060 --> 02:05:26,320
and care about what there at the

3437
02:05:24,909 --> 02:05:28,029
restaurant where the guy remembers me

3438
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:29,889
and remembers oh you like this last time

3439
02:05:28,029 --> 02:05:31,239
you just want to go back where you build

3440
02:05:29,890 --> 02:05:35,590
a relationship and our treat is like

3441
02:05:31,239 --> 02:05:38,079
customer number seven for today you

3442
02:05:35,590 --> 02:05:44,890
don't make a Rick Simpson oil type of

3443
02:05:38,079 --> 02:05:47,829
Prada I do I literally will infuse I

3444
02:05:44,890 --> 02:05:50,650
mean the oils that we make in comparison

3445
02:05:47,829 --> 02:05:56,019
are either infused with hemp seed oil

3446
02:05:50,649 --> 02:06:01,269
the Tincher percent okay or we crank the

3447
02:05:56,020 --> 02:06:04,030
ratios out with raw beginning hemp seed

3448
02:06:01,270 --> 02:06:05,620
or grape seed oil or coconut oil and

3449
02:06:04,029 --> 02:06:09,239
we'll use that as the carrier and we've

3450
02:06:05,619 --> 02:06:11,439
seen I can get the dosage almost down to

3451
02:06:09,239 --> 02:06:15,340
similar to what it would be and your

3452
02:06:11,439 --> 02:06:19,169
body's gonna love that what are that

3453
02:06:15,340 --> 02:06:22,329
black sludge is super hard for about

3454
02:06:19,170 --> 02:06:24,159
nauseous and change colors that stuff

3455
02:06:22,329 --> 02:06:26,350
raw and I don't understand how they can

3456
02:06:24,159 --> 02:06:28,659
do it it's you know so we're just trying

3457
02:06:26,350 --> 02:06:30,039
to find better ways of easier ways for

3458
02:06:28,659 --> 02:06:33,369
this to get into our system and

3459
02:06:30,039 --> 02:06:34,960
healthier ways Rick Simpson was an

3460
02:06:33,369 --> 02:06:37,510
innovator for what he did but right now

3461
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:40,359
knowing what we know about NAFTA and the

3462
02:06:37,510 --> 02:06:43,119
process and I mean you were we're at a

3463
02:06:40,359 --> 02:06:45,789
different place now medically so we know

3464
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:47,800
better and we should provide that to our

3465
02:06:45,789 --> 02:06:52,359
page right and I like your integrity on

3466
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:54,369
that we kind of got sidetracked we're

3467
02:06:52,359 --> 02:06:57,189
talking about you uh you started making

3468
02:06:54,369 --> 02:06:58,599
hash before you started growing so how

3469
02:06:57,189 --> 02:06:59,979
did you end up because you weren't

3470
02:06:58,600 --> 02:07:11,470
satisfied with the material that was

3471
02:06:59,979 --> 02:07:13,059
around right that cookies trip a lot of

3472
02:07:11,470 --> 02:07:16,449
the CBD fire that was coming out was

3473
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:18,190
looking like grass clippings or it was

3474
02:07:16,449 --> 02:07:19,929
really bad I'm not sure plants are hard

3475
02:07:18,189 --> 02:07:22,119
to grow no the CBD heavy plants are not

3476
02:07:19,930 --> 02:07:25,140
as easy to grow as some of the more THC

3477
02:07:22,119 --> 02:07:26,880
or sativa or indica

3478
02:07:25,140 --> 02:07:29,039
as a breeder in the grower I recognize

3479
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:31,050
that heavily I don't like ced dominant

3480
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:33,510
plants so here's the thing as a girl

3481
02:07:31,050 --> 02:07:36,449
that started out just girl you CBD

3482
02:07:33,510 --> 02:07:38,010
dominant plans the first time I pop some

3483
02:07:36,449 --> 02:07:43,170
seeds that would cheesy dumb and I was

3484
02:07:38,010 --> 02:07:47,430
like this is really easy you'd had the

3485
02:07:43,170 --> 02:07:50,340
curve now and the curves that I had to

3486
02:07:47,430 --> 02:07:52,079
deal with for CBD for growing the CBD or

3487
02:07:50,340 --> 02:07:56,340
not what I was dealing with it growing

3488
02:07:52,079 --> 02:07:57,750
you know some very wonderful TC genetics

3489
02:07:56,340 --> 02:08:09,360
that I had been gifted and I was just

3490
02:07:57,750 --> 02:08:12,930
like your ratios will be affected

3491
02:08:09,359 --> 02:08:15,059
severely if there's any sort of stress

3492
02:08:12,930 --> 02:08:19,289
during the vegetative state whatsoever

3493
02:08:15,060 --> 02:08:21,330
because that CBD is already there in the

3494
02:08:19,289 --> 02:08:23,010
vegetative state before before it's been

3495
02:08:21,329 --> 02:08:24,869
flipped or anything you know glad you

3496
02:08:23,010 --> 02:08:26,640
said that people often completely

3497
02:08:24,869 --> 02:08:28,369
overlooked their veg state people will

3498
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:30,960
build a grub I've watched people build

3499
02:08:28,369 --> 02:08:32,309
$10,000 flour rooms and spend six or

3500
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:33,810
eight hundred bucks just fixing up a

3501
02:08:32,310 --> 02:08:36,240
shitty old bedroom to make a bed space

3502
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:37,740
like come on let's do that cuz that's

3503
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:39,779
like you said that's where the plants

3504
02:08:37,739 --> 02:08:41,699
start stage of life you're going from

3505
02:08:39,779 --> 02:08:44,639
seed you obviously want to wax your

3506
02:08:41,699 --> 02:08:50,809
tapper you want to make it strong

3507
02:08:44,640 --> 02:08:53,490
adolescence before you put them hands

3508
02:08:50,810 --> 02:08:55,260
and every time something happened I just

3509
02:08:53,489 --> 02:08:56,909
call one of my friends debug looks what

3510
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:59,940
I'm going through please you know and I

3511
02:08:56,909 --> 02:09:01,409
want to think I just wanna say this now

3512
02:08:59,939 --> 02:09:03,809
and if it's okay if I shot them out

3513
02:09:01,409 --> 02:09:05,430
always offer chronic gene my friend

3524
02:09:27,658 --> 02:09:31,978
dude she had every breeder every person

3525
02:09:30,868 --> 02:09:34,259
that I've talked about what I'm trying

3526
02:09:31,979 --> 02:09:35,909
to do is CV has been completely open

3527
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:37,918
source with me and helpful and any

3528
02:09:35,908 --> 02:09:39,598
little thing that I it's literally

3529
02:09:37,918 --> 02:09:42,359
fast-tracked me so much that it's a

3530
02:09:39,599 --> 02:09:43,559
blessing you know it's I am completely

3531
02:09:42,359 --> 02:09:46,319
grateful for the knowledge that's been

3532
02:09:43,559 --> 02:09:48,418
dropped on me because it took me from

3533
02:09:46,319 --> 02:09:52,109
trying to provide for my patients and

3534
02:09:48,418 --> 02:09:54,179
struggling to knowing things that I just

3535
02:09:52,109 --> 02:09:56,549
would have never grasped before you know

3536
02:09:54,179 --> 02:10:00,809
like I said it's I'm truly grateful for

3537
02:09:56,550 --> 02:10:02,159
it but yeah I started as an extractor it

3538
02:10:00,809 --> 02:10:04,349
just took one of my friends getting

3539
02:10:02,158 --> 02:10:06,299
screwed over basically for me to say you

3540
02:10:04,349 --> 02:10:09,029
know what dude I'll girl for you yeah

3541
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:10,650
there you go yeah became very public

3542
02:10:09,029 --> 02:10:12,328
about it and when I first started

3543
02:10:10,649 --> 02:10:14,009
growing my problem was people hoard

3544
02:10:12,328 --> 02:10:16,349
these or they were hoarding these

3545
02:10:14,010 --> 02:10:18,329
strange right so it was like well let's

3546
02:10:16,349 --> 02:10:20,668
share them let's you know let's pull cut

3547
02:10:18,328 --> 02:10:22,590
and you know give them out and I you can

3548
02:10:20,668 --> 02:10:24,238
only help as many people as you can get

3549
02:10:22,590 --> 02:10:27,208
this cut out to you which is something

3550
02:10:24,238 --> 02:10:31,198
I'll touch into later but my main source

3551
02:10:27,208 --> 02:10:33,748
was you know okay well let's make this

3552
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:35,638
happen so my time in Cali people were on

3553
02:10:33,748 --> 02:10:38,550
this crazy cookies craze I was going

3554
02:10:35,639 --> 02:10:40,618
from noir cow to SoCal and brilliant

3555
02:10:38,550 --> 02:10:42,659
Southern California you know hits at all

3556
02:10:40,618 --> 02:10:44,698
no progress whatsoever in Northern

3557
02:10:42,658 --> 02:10:46,918
California so I fell in love with a

3558
02:10:44,698 --> 02:10:49,708
wonderful plant called star tsunami and

3559
02:10:46,918 --> 02:10:53,038
I met an amazing group of breeders in

3560
02:10:49,708 --> 02:10:53,779
the Emerald triangle that changed my

3561
02:10:53,038 --> 02:10:56,550
life

3562
02:10:53,779 --> 02:10:58,139
some they were already caregivers for

3563
02:10:56,550 --> 02:11:02,189
some of the children in the state going

3564
02:10:58,139 --> 02:11:04,739
through cancer these men showed me what

3565
02:11:02,189 --> 02:11:07,050
real compassion was at the very starting

3566
02:11:04,738 --> 02:11:09,538
point when I was in this industry and

3567
02:11:07,050 --> 02:11:11,189
blessed me with some genetics and

3568
02:11:09,538 --> 02:11:12,868
knowledge and play me in the right

3569
02:11:11,189 --> 02:11:16,050
directions of things for what I wanted

3570
02:11:12,868 --> 02:11:24,299
to do or something

3571
02:11:16,050 --> 02:11:26,489
Ringo there's a lot of them you know

3572
02:11:24,300 --> 02:11:27,100
they know if they hear this they know

3573
02:11:26,488 --> 02:11:29,229
they are

3574
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:32,410
they're the kind hearted people who

3575
02:11:29,229 --> 02:11:34,059
don't do this for the name they just do

3576
02:11:32,409 --> 02:11:36,670
this for the sake of continuing to push

3577
02:11:34,060 --> 02:11:39,310
cannabis forward you know for Jacob but

3578
02:11:36,670 --> 02:11:41,800
they've got my respect absolutely all

3579
02:11:39,310 --> 02:11:43,480
right so these people in NorCal you find

3580
02:11:41,800 --> 02:11:45,940
this crew in NorCal and you follow up

3581
02:11:43,479 --> 02:11:48,729
with them you find sauer tsunami yep you

3582
02:11:45,939 --> 02:11:51,729
start growing nowan yeah started asking

3583
02:11:48,729 --> 02:11:54,699
questions started doing runs with the

3584
02:11:51,729 --> 02:11:56,859
plants specifically then people started

3585
02:11:54,699 --> 02:11:59,050
talking about this plant this you know

3586
02:11:56,859 --> 02:12:01,089
because at the time even california

3587
02:11:59,050 --> 02:12:02,739
there was such a hype about Colorado and

3588
02:12:01,090 --> 02:12:04,900
Charlotte's Web and what it really was

3589
02:12:02,739 --> 02:12:06,789
and all these guys in California had no

3590
02:12:04,899 --> 02:12:08,589
clue so when you had these strange

3591
02:12:06,789 --> 02:12:10,829
popping up like sour tsunami and they're

3592
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:15,190
like oh well it's just like sour tsunami

3593
02:12:10,829 --> 02:12:17,680
no and then you had Harlequin popping up

3594
02:12:15,189 --> 02:12:19,569
in the upper side down by Oakland and

3595
02:12:17,680 --> 02:12:20,710
that was one of the stronger three two

3596
02:12:19,569 --> 02:12:22,509
one two two ones they're like no it's

3597
02:12:20,710 --> 02:12:25,119
nothing like Charlotte's Web and then

3598
02:12:22,510 --> 02:12:27,220
this ac/dc plant started come around you

3599
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:28,960
know and people just started comparing

3600
02:12:27,220 --> 02:12:30,670
them because no one knew there's all

3601
02:12:28,960 --> 02:12:32,680
these new strains are coming out from

3602
02:12:30,670 --> 02:12:36,579
Colorado is that a Colorado strain the

3603
02:12:32,680 --> 02:12:40,780
ac/dc no okay all right it started in

3604
02:12:36,579 --> 02:12:42,640
Spain from what I believe from where I

3605
02:12:40,779 --> 02:12:44,469
understand it started in Spain and

3606
02:12:42,640 --> 02:12:46,570
somehow made its way to California and

3607
02:12:44,470 --> 02:12:49,390
then from that's just from what I

3608
02:12:46,569 --> 02:12:51,069
understand from what I've been told you

3609
02:12:49,390 --> 02:12:56,690
know as far as their colorado CBD

3610
02:12:51,069 --> 02:13:00,380
strains you know r4 r5 the rule 5

3611
02:12:56,689 --> 02:13:03,019
as well before you you know the work

3612
02:13:00,380 --> 02:13:06,789
that natural mr. caregivers down here

3613
02:13:03,020 --> 02:13:09,739
[Music]

3614
02:13:06,789 --> 02:13:11,329
absolutely wonderful natural mystic

3615
02:13:09,738 --> 02:13:13,988
Ferreira one of the only shops that

3616
02:13:11,329 --> 02:13:16,579
really focuses heavily on CBD absolute

3617
02:13:13,988 --> 02:13:18,979
three or four different kinds of

3618
02:13:16,579 --> 02:13:20,869
top-shelf flower that are CBD dominant

3619
02:13:18,979 --> 02:13:22,250
it's actually one of my favorite places

3620
02:13:20,869 --> 02:13:23,930
in the springs to go to foresee buddy

3621
02:13:22,250 --> 02:13:26,359
fire because you know I support any

3622
02:13:23,930 --> 02:13:28,250
place that will put good CVD products on

3623
02:13:26,359 --> 02:13:34,189
leisure and I know the growers there I

3624
02:13:28,250 --> 02:13:35,869
know Joey pretty well well so many

3625
02:13:34,189 --> 02:13:37,609
questions you were talking about a labs

3626
02:13:35,869 --> 02:13:40,309
that getting your stuff tested you have

3627
02:13:37,609 --> 02:13:43,009
a lab that you prefer there's a friend

3628
02:13:40,310 --> 02:13:44,690
of ours that has an independent lab and

3629
02:13:43,010 --> 02:13:47,630
he really does help a lot of people with

3630
02:13:44,689 --> 02:13:50,119
low-cost testing and does his part to

3631
02:13:47,630 --> 02:13:51,829
help you know Colorado law has made a

3632
02:13:50,119 --> 02:13:56,269
little hard for caregivers patients

3633
02:13:51,829 --> 02:13:59,420
parents to have their meds tested

3634
02:13:56,270 --> 02:14:01,330
because obviously most labs are forced

3635
02:13:59,420 --> 02:14:04,069
to deal with people that have MIPS

3636
02:14:01,329 --> 02:14:05,420
licenses whatever the case is so there

3637
02:14:04,069 --> 02:14:06,920
are those few independent people who

3638
02:14:05,420 --> 02:14:09,890
have taken upon themselves with their

3639
02:14:06,920 --> 02:14:11,569
own dollar to provide a place where

3640
02:14:09,890 --> 02:14:13,340
patients can have their meds tested and

3641
02:14:11,569 --> 02:14:15,380
there's actually a place like that down

3642
02:14:13,340 --> 02:14:17,630
here in the springs I don't have all the

3643
02:14:15,380 --> 02:14:20,090
information so I don't want to worry

3644
02:14:17,630 --> 02:14:21,289
that's all right yeah Nate knows who he

3645
02:14:20,090 --> 02:14:24,590
is and he's definitely killing it down

3646
02:14:21,289 --> 02:14:26,090
here so once I get more information I'll

3647
02:14:24,590 --> 02:14:27,949
gladly pass along your way and we can

3648
02:14:26,090 --> 02:14:29,270
share it sounds great yeah we'll get it

3649
02:14:27,948 --> 02:14:30,710
out yeah he's the one who did the

3650
02:14:29,270 --> 02:14:33,199
testing for the cannabis cup actually

3651
02:14:30,710 --> 02:14:34,670
that Caleb and I did he's done some

3652
02:14:33,198 --> 02:14:36,919
other testing for the oil that I've done

3653
02:14:34,670 --> 02:14:38,659
before and and the numbers of OHS come

3654
02:14:36,920 --> 02:14:40,100
spot-on to the point where if I go

3655
02:14:38,659 --> 02:14:41,599
somewhere else and I feel like my

3656
02:14:40,100 --> 02:14:45,350
numbers aren't right I go to Nate

3657
02:14:41,600 --> 02:14:46,179
because you know that's I can count on

3658
02:14:45,350 --> 02:14:48,249
that

3659
02:14:46,179 --> 02:14:50,498
so so the cannabis cup is coming up it's

3660
02:14:48,248 --> 02:14:53,948
January you guys really calling out 2016

3661
02:14:50,498 --> 02:14:56,529
and it sounds so weird to say that do

3662
02:14:53,948 --> 02:14:58,328
anything for the cup this year there are

3663
02:14:56,529 --> 02:15:01,389
some few plans for the cup I'm keeping

3664
02:14:58,328 --> 02:15:03,099
myself open right now the way that they

3665
02:15:01,389 --> 02:15:05,050
split up so cow for the two weekends is

3666
02:15:03,099 --> 02:15:07,538
a little confusing so honestly that is

3667
02:15:05,050 --> 02:15:09,219
widely kind of backed out of doing

3668
02:15:07,538 --> 02:15:11,679
anything so quickly but I had some

3669
02:15:09,219 --> 02:15:12,998
things going obviously you know with

3670
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:15,578
whatever happens in Denver we'll have a

3671
02:15:12,998 --> 02:15:18,519
showing out and there is something in

3672
02:15:15,578 --> 02:15:20,679
California that is calling my attention

3673
02:15:18,519 --> 02:15:22,329
that you know a few people reach out you

3674

02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:13,719
it out it'll be great you know that the

3690
02:16:11,738 --> 02:16:15,908
emmy has their feelings about how

3691
02:16:13,719 --> 02:16:20,590
cannabis events should be and what they

3692
02:16:15,908 --> 02:16:22,509
are Colorado they have a huge opposition

3693
02:16:20,590 --> 02:16:24,788
to a lot of the way that these events

3694
02:16:22,510 --> 02:16:28,539
are run what's your two cents if I can

3695
02:16:24,788 --> 02:16:30,340
ask personally on how that goes here for

3696
02:16:28,538 --> 02:16:32,629
people like us you know that obviously

3697
02:16:30,340 --> 02:16:34,519
have companies and promote within as

3698
02:16:32,629 --> 02:16:37,699
well as the people who enjoy these

3699
02:16:34,519 --> 02:16:41,090
events wait does what it does for me as

3700
02:16:37,700 --> 02:16:43,280
I work for a immediated dispensary so I

3701
02:16:41,090 --> 02:16:44,870
can't take my seed company and set up a

3702
02:16:43,280 --> 02:16:47,149
booth because I'm affiliated with that

3703
02:16:44,870 --> 02:16:49,670
dispensary so closely that I'll be find

3704
02:16:47,148 --> 02:16:52,010
my dispensary will be find if I'm there

3705
02:16:49,670 --> 02:16:55,129
selling products or giving products out

3706
02:16:52,010 --> 02:16:56,780
yeah yeah oh my god what do you get your

3707
02:16:55,129 --> 02:16:59,869
meed badge that's part of what you sign

3708
02:16:56,780 --> 02:17:02,179
but I feel the dispensaries this is

3709
02:16:59,870 --> 02:17:05,269
Colorado we're allowed to smoke everyone

3710
02:17:02,179 --> 02:17:10,790
there's 21 and over it's in an enclosed

3711
02:17:05,269 --> 02:17:12,710
area we should be able to go and set up

3712
02:17:10,790 --> 02:17:14,750
a booth and show our wares just like any

3713
02:17:12,709 --> 02:17:16,909
other industry we have beer festivals

3714
02:17:14,750 --> 02:17:18,950
where I'm not gonna name any beer brands

3715
02:17:16,909 --> 02:17:20,388
but whatever brand a B and C bring their

3716
02:17:18,950 --> 02:17:22,340
beer truck they said a beer they serve

3717
02:17:20,388 --> 02:17:24,799
it to people all day they show blocks

3718
02:17:22,340 --> 02:17:26,540
whole blocks of downtown Denver we're

3719
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:29,808
doing this at a private event area at

3720
02:17:26,540 --> 02:17:31,910
the name of the place the Denver Mart

3721
02:17:29,808 --> 02:17:34,069
yes there were renting a place we're not

3722
02:17:31,909 --> 02:17:35,718
even doing it in the city blocks I think

3723
02:17:34,069 --> 02:17:38,090
that dispensary should be able to come

3724
02:17:35,718 --> 02:17:40,159
set up a booth and bring smoke and smoke

3725
02:17:38,090 --> 02:17:41,689
you and I out and everybody out they

3726
02:17:40,159 --> 02:17:45,250
should say this is our flagships train

3727
02:17:41,689 --> 02:17:45,250
this is what we grow come check us out

3728
02:17:47,888 --> 02:17:52,898
you know being an independent caregiver

3729
02:17:51,228 --> 02:17:55,609
on the other side of it I don't

3730
02:17:52,898 --> 02:17:57,379
necessarily have to answer to them but

3731
02:17:55,610 --> 02:17:59,809
at some point you know we cross paths

3732
02:17:57,379 --> 02:18:02,268
and things are mentioned so it's

3733
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:04,429
interesting for people that are running

3734
02:18:02,269 --> 02:18:06,800
within that model in Colorado and how

3735
02:18:04,429 --> 02:18:08,450
that affects us for trying to actively

3736
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:12,679
promote an events like this you know

3737
02:18:08,450 --> 02:18:14,780
without being threatening whatever the

3738
02:18:12,679 --> 02:18:17,659
case may be finds in your business

3739
02:18:14,780 --> 02:18:19,760
clothes a big enough fine green and

3740
02:18:17,659 --> 02:18:21,530
healthy is a small small business just a

3741
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:23,719
few of us and a large enough fund would

3742
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:31,579
end us that would be the end so we have

3743
02:18:23,718 --> 02:18:34,339
to be pretty careful on that we're

3744
02:18:31,579 --> 02:18:36,138
officially open yeah this will come out

3745
02:18:34,340 --> 02:18:39,679
we're open today but this will come out

3746
02:18:36,138 --> 02:18:41,388
like two weeks so we'll be full-on

3747
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:42,709
yeah he will he'll be back to give you

3748
02:18:41,388 --> 02:18:46,788
guys a review on what he thinks are the

3749
02:18:42,709 --> 02:18:48,499
perfect rigs there and some stuff you'd

3750
02:18:46,789 --> 02:18:50,899
want to see awesome I took some notes

3751
02:18:48,498 --> 02:18:52,549
but I think I've gone through them and I

3752
02:18:50,898 --> 02:18:54,318
loved how cool Colorado Springs is we

3753
02:18:52,549 --> 02:18:57,349
don't have one of these in Pueblo so

3754
02:18:54,318 --> 02:18:59,118
this is kind of there there may be one

3755
02:18:57,349 --> 02:19:02,148
but it's real low-key and I haven't gone

3756
02:18:59,119 --> 02:19:04,039
there yet it's open yet so I'll go check

3757
02:19:02,148 --> 02:19:05,208
it out this is chill I like it it was

3758
02:19:04,039 --> 02:19:07,069
just hanging out have a good

3759
02:19:05,209 --> 02:19:10,668
conversation taking dabs it's cloudy as

3760
02:19:07,068 --> 02:19:11,898
[ __ ] in here just let us come hang out

3761
02:19:10,668 --> 02:19:14,808
and do a podcast maybe I can get

3762
02:19:11,898 --> 02:19:17,208
Camille's attention to come say hi it's

3763
02:19:14,808 --> 02:19:23,328
gonna bugger she's being social she's a

3764
02:19:17,209 --> 02:19:24,050
great poster I love it yeah I'll be here

3765
02:19:23,328 --> 02:19:25,699
a lot more often

3766
02:19:24,049 --> 02:19:26,629
I brought we've been going for like 40

3767
02:19:25,699 --> 02:19:28,069
minutes you got anything else that you

3768
02:19:26,629 --> 02:19:30,288
want to throw out to the world about CBD

3769
02:19:28,068 --> 02:19:36,228
while you're on a microphone you will be

3770
02:19:30,289 --> 02:19:37,519
back on the show you know I started this

3771
02:19:36,228 --> 02:19:41,058
company because obviously something

3772
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:44,119
happened to me you know somebody that I

3773
02:19:41,058 --> 02:19:45,018
couldn't help my goal is to help as many

3774
02:19:44,119 --> 02:19:48,409
people as I can

3775
02:19:45,019 --> 02:19:51,139
because if you know that feeling of not

3776
02:19:48,408 --> 02:19:53,809
being able to help someone but then are

3777
02:19:51,139 --> 02:19:56,599
put in a position where you can why not

3778
02:19:53,809 --> 02:19:58,668
right you know and so every day I

3779
02:19:56,600 --> 02:20:00,890
encourage people to learn something new

3780
02:19:58,668 --> 02:20:02,840
about cannabis I encourage people to

3781
02:20:00,889 --> 02:20:04,398
take up a cause that's close to them it

3782
02:20:02,840 --> 02:20:06,738
doesn't matter what it is no matter what

3783
02:20:04,398 --> 02:20:08,898
it is for me it's epilepsy awareness and

3784
02:20:06,738 --> 02:20:10,170
I will talk about it and so my face

3785
02:20:08,898 --> 02:20:12,359
turns blue and

3786
02:20:10,170 --> 02:20:13,590
no more about epilepsy than you did

3787
02:20:12,360 --> 02:20:15,450
before we start talking

3788
02:20:13,590 --> 02:20:18,299
I wondered a lot today I'm really glad

3789
02:20:15,450 --> 02:20:29,400
so that being said like that's my main

3790
02:20:18,299 --> 02:20:30,239
focus with everything that I do I feel

3791
02:20:29,399 --> 02:20:31,709
like there are a lot of people out there

3792
02:20:30,239 --> 02:20:34,010
doing it but if you do need my help you

3793
02:20:31,709 --> 02:20:34,009
let me know

3794
02:20:35,329 --> 02:20:39,420

3795

3994
02:32:50,629 --> 02:33:00,020
probably the right part of the country

3995
02:32:52,579 --> 02:33:02,209
is everybody's bubble that was just a

3996
02:33:00,021 --> 02:33:04,700
piece of ice so another social media

3997
02:33:02,209 --> 02:33:06,709
thing that has been really catching a

3998
02:33:04,700 --> 02:33:08,930
lot of attention lately there was a

3999
02:33:06,709 --> 02:33:11,750
glass convention in Las Vegas just

4000
02:33:08,930 --> 02:33:14,180
recently was it in Vegas anyway there's

4001
02:33:11,750 --> 02:33:17,460
a glass convention a an industry

4002
02:33:14,180 --> 02:33:20,791
convention or a mothership rig

4003

bacon and Scott Debbie collab sold you

4004

4010
02:33:36,299 --> 02:33:41,009
[Music]

4011
02:33:53,940 --> 02:33:57,019
[Music]

4012
02:34:06,430 --> 02:34:09,469
[Music]

4013
02:34:11,810 --> 02:34:15,661
you said that okay let's open up that

4014
02:34:14,251 --> 02:34:17,400
floodgate I'm gonna say this on my

4015
02:34:15,661 --> 02:34:18,630
podcast about five thousand people are

4016
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:19,950
gonna listen to this and I'm sure at

4017
02:34:18,630 --> 02:34:26,760
least 100 of em are gonna send me dirty

4018
02:34:19,950 --> 02:34:31,340
emails that rig is really ugly you know

4019
02:34:26,761 --> 02:34:41,371
I'm sure many other things comes weed

4020
02:34:31,341 --> 02:34:42,931
but it's got a gaudy ass bass the bass

4021
02:34:41,370 --> 02:34:45,270
is this so one thing I should mention

4022
02:34:42,931 --> 02:34:46,951
this rig is covered in moons and if you

4023
02:34:45,271 --> 02:34:48,811
turn the rig around slowly it goes

4024
02:34:46,950 --> 02:34:50,310
through the phases of the Moon is

4025
02:34:48,810 --> 02:34:52,171
something that Debbie pointed out Scott

4026
02:34:50,310 --> 02:34:54,181
Deb you shout out to Scott Debbie and to

4027
02:34:52,171 --> 02:34:55,501
Sagan glass it's great work you guys I

4028
02:34:54,181 --> 02:34:56,971
just think it's ugly it's my personal

4029
02:34:55,501 --> 02:34:58,140
preference obviously enough people love

4030
02:34:56,970 --> 02:34:59,820
it so don't be mad at me for thinking

4031
02:34:58,140 --> 02:35:01,020
it's ugly a lot of people somebody paid

4032
02:34:59,820 --> 02:35:03,740
one hundred and one thousand dollars so

4033
02:35:01,021 --> 02:35:07,261
it's obviously not one person loved them

4034
02:35:03,740 --> 02:35:08,611
way more than I hated it he loves it one

4035
02:35:07,261 --> 02:35:10,381
hundred and one thousand times more than

4036
02:35:08,611 --> 02:35:11,281
I dislike it I just think it's ugly but

4037
02:35:10,380 --> 02:35:13,800
it's poorly planned

4038
02:35:11,281 --> 02:35:16,141
the base is god-awful ugly it's got

4039
02:35:13,800 --> 02:35:17,970
moons glued to it on the base that's in

4040
02:35:16,140 --> 02:35:20,130
this odd shape it looks like the base

4041
02:35:17,970 --> 02:35:21,210
was just they made the top and they're

4042
02:35:20,130 --> 02:35:22,680
like well we need something big enough

4043
02:35:21,210 --> 02:35:25,710
to hold this up now so they made that

4044
02:35:22,681 --> 02:35:27,570
gaudy base and then they put a I think

4045
02:35:25,710 --> 02:35:29,880
the color would be called Stardust black

4046
02:35:27,570 --> 02:35:30,809
Stardust Faberge egg and if you guys

4047
02:35:29,880 --> 02:35:32,729
know anything about glass

4048
02:35:30,809 --> 02:35:34,739
the Fab Age is the artwork it's the way

4049
02:35:32,729 --> 02:35:36,029
to go but they made it out of a color of

4050
02:35:34,739 --> 02:35:37,440
glass you can't see through so you could

4051
02:35:36,030 --> 02:35:39,510
barely tell that it's a fat bake it

4052
02:35:37,440 --> 02:35:44,130
looks like a grenade it's exactly what

4053
02:35:39,510 --> 02:35:45,659
it looks like actually okay I've got a

4054
02:35:44,129 --> 02:35:47,279
picture here on my phone somewhere I

4055
02:35:45,659 --> 02:35:48,899
posted it up to social media so it

4056
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:50,340
shouldn't be too hard to find we will

4057
02:35:48,899 --> 02:35:52,619
pull this up for you to take a look at

4058
02:35:50,340 --> 02:35:54,120
but it looks like poorly planned and

4059
02:35:52,620 --> 02:35:56,250
then it looks like they just glued moons

4060
02:35:54,120 --> 02:35:58,079
around it to give it the moon vibe that

4061
02:35:56,250 --> 02:36:00,270
they were looking for and I said that I

4062
02:35:58,079 --> 02:36:03,350
wanted to buy it and just glue a rocket

4063
02:36:00,270 --> 02:36:06,149
to it just to complete the whole space

4064
02:36:03,350 --> 02:36:07,229
look there was the image right away so

4065
02:36:06,149 --> 02:36:08,969
you give me a minute to find the image

4066
02:36:07,229 --> 02:36:09,930
because Facebook likes to do that thing

4067
02:36:08,969 --> 02:36:13,590
where it jumps around

4068
02:36:09,930 --> 02:36:15,300
I promise here we go this is a rig that

4069
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:17,460
somebody paid a hundred and one thousand

4070
02:36:15,299 --> 02:36:18,899
dollars for it's insane it's beautiful

4071
02:36:17,459 --> 02:36:20,609
it's got some great colors to it but it

4072
02:36:18,899 --> 02:36:22,199
looks like something that les claypool

4073
02:36:20,610 --> 02:36:27,239
or Tim Burton would have put together in

4074
02:36:22,200 --> 02:36:30,420
my opinion for a really clean sleek

4075
02:36:27,239 --> 02:36:32,399
smooth tight baller status look the rigs

4076
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:34,260
are gorgeous and clean and perfect and

4077
02:36:32,399 --> 02:36:37,260
flawless and this thing's doesn't come

4078
02:36:34,260 --> 02:36:39,120
close yeah I like that

4079
02:36:37,260 --> 02:36:40,649
Allen's not really into the glass scene

4080
02:36:39,120 --> 02:36:41,970
he doesn't he hasn't mentioned anything

4081
02:36:40,649 --> 02:36:45,029
about glass and the time that I've known

4082
02:36:41,969 --> 02:36:46,439
him he's looks cool he just does he

4083
02:36:45,030 --> 02:36:49,110
already knows that that doesn't fit the

4084
02:36:46,440 --> 02:36:50,220
mother ship motto mother ship I'll give

4085
02:36:49,110 --> 02:36:52,770
you guys a shout out though those new

4086
02:36:50,219 --> 02:36:53,729
racecar seamed rigs are the bee's knees

4087
02:36:52,770 --> 02:36:55,020
bro

4088
02:36:53,729 --> 02:36:57,209
there are a couple of those that I

4089
02:36:55,020 --> 02:36:58,829
really really love I feel like I'm doing

4090
02:36:57,209 --> 02:36:59,879
too much pulling up stuff on the phone

4091
02:36:58,829 --> 02:37:01,500
here but I'll show you guys these

4092
02:36:59,879 --> 02:37:03,299
racecar rigs because they are beautiful

4093
02:37:01,500 --> 02:37:05,209
and I can do editing if any of this gets

4094
02:37:03,299 --> 02:37:10,520
carried away

4095
02:37:05,209 --> 02:37:11,930
hitman our mothership these rigs I'm

4096
02:37:10,521 --> 02:37:15,110
gonna try to describe it now since I'm

4097
02:37:11,931 --> 02:37:17,301
pulling it up so they took a normal

4098
02:37:15,110 --> 02:37:20,810
tourist rig which would be clear and

4099
02:37:17,300 --> 02:37:23,000
they have used yellow glass on one

4100
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:24,920
portion and blue glass on another and it

4101
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:26,390
looks really sleek and it's super smooth

4102
02:37:24,920 --> 02:37:28,579
and they call it the race car series

4103
02:37:26,390 --> 02:37:30,380
this is a Cline and where the Cline

4104
02:37:28,579 --> 02:37:32,149
function happens they used clear glass

4105
02:37:30,380 --> 02:37:34,010
to make a window so that you can see the

4106
02:37:32,149 --> 02:37:35,690
water bubble image that is actually

4107
02:37:34,011 --> 02:37:39,649
pretty cool yeah I really love the race

4108
02:37:35,690 --> 02:37:41,569
car series glass they do not like that

4109
02:37:39,649 --> 02:37:49,159
expensive piece but I really love the

4110
02:37:41,569 --> 02:37:58,220
the race car series so I apologize is

4111
02:37:49,159 --> 02:38:00,200
that I don't know how you made that

4112
02:37:58,220 --> 02:38:01,520
happen I should probably stop talking

4113
02:38:00,200 --> 02:38:06,471
about mothership since I'm sponsored by

4114
02:38:01,521 --> 02:38:07,820
hitmen glass by yourself all right so we

4115
02:38:06,470 --> 02:38:13,789
all agree that that rig was way

4116
02:38:07,819 --> 02:38:15,229
overpriced right does financially well

4117
02:38:13,790 --> 02:38:18,261
we're all kind of in the the legal

4118
02:38:15,229 --> 02:38:20,000
cannabis industry yeah what's uh what's

4119
02:38:18,261 --> 02:38:22,460
the most money that you would find

4120
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:49,459
acceptable to pay at this point in your

4121
02:38:22,459 --> 02:38:53,060
life that's reasonable hey guys I want

4122
02:38:49,459 --> 02:38:55,100
you to send me a tweet to @g fyh podcast

4123
02:38:53,060 --> 02:38:56,810
and tell me right now if you're gonna

4124
02:38:55,101 --> 02:38:58,341
buy a rig what you would find a reed to

4125
02:38:56,810 --> 02:39:00,261
be a reasonable budget are you in the

4126
02:38:58,341 --> 02:39:01,819
hundred and one thousand dollar range or

4127
02:39:00,261 --> 02:39:04,399
are you over here like Carlos with one

4128
02:39:01,819 --> 02:39:06,709
hundred and fifty dollar great Bob I'm

4129
02:39:04,399 --> 02:39:08,720
using a hitman III sidecar in front of

4130
02:39:06,709 --> 02:39:11,000
me this one so I bought this at

4131
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:12,289
illusions glass in Denver and this was a

4132
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:13,350
five hundred and fifty dollar rig at

4133
02:39:12,290 --> 02:39:15,810
that point in time

4134
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:17,970
ah it's natl think it's worth that at

4135
02:39:15,809 --> 02:39:19,559
this point but it was at that time in

4136
02:39:17,969 --> 02:39:24,898
front of me here is the shot at the

4137
02:39:19,559 --> 02:39:28,289
Hitmen glass once again this one on

4138
02:39:24,898 --> 02:39:40,019
their website is 800 for the short stack

4139
02:39:28,290 --> 02:39:41,010
yeah if you won that lottery I'm glad

4140
02:39:40,020 --> 02:39:42,449

4141
02:39:41,010 --> 02:39:43,829
before we checked out your Powerball

4142
02:39:42,449 --> 02:39:51,300
numbers because if you won that I would

4143

not have seen you tonight yeah all right

4144
02:39:51,299 --> 02:39:55,618

4145
02:39:52,978 --> 02:39:58,829
about since everybody at the table is

4146
02:39:55,619 --> 02:40:00,510
into the legal cannabis industry you

4147
02:39:58,829 --> 02:40:01,590
were kind of making I should we should

4148
02:40:00,510 --> 02:40:03,478
back up and talk about kind of how we

4149
02:40:01,590 --> 02:40:05,809
ran into each other I have known you

4150
02:40:03,478 --> 02:40:11,368
since I was the budtender at met amar

4151
02:40:05,809 --> 02:40:13,049
such a long time but we closed yeah you

4152
02:40:11,369 --> 02:40:15,600
were one of our first patients that

4153
02:40:13,049 --> 02:40:17,849
would come in sometime buy medicine from

4154
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:19,488
us yeah when you came did you come in

4155
02:40:17,850 --> 02:40:21,960
when it was in the apartment upstairs I

4156
02:40:19,488 --> 02:40:24,180
did okay so you got to see it evolve

4157
02:40:21,959 --> 02:40:25,948
from that guys couch we don't talk about

4158
02:40:24,180 --> 02:40:28,199
that guy's name on the show we leave

4159
02:40:25,949 --> 02:40:29,640
names out to protect the innocent we

4160
02:40:28,199 --> 02:40:30,779
went from that guy's couch and then it

4161
02:40:29,639 --> 02:40:33,170
went to the middle floor and then we

4162
02:40:30,779 --> 02:40:37,640
moved it down to the main floor and

4163
02:40:33,170 --> 02:40:37,639
busted out and went hardcore for a while

4164
02:40:38,719 --> 02:40:47,459
2008 is when that shop was really

4165
02:40:41,158 --> 02:40:49,889
booming used to shop at the dispensary

4166
02:40:47,459 --> 02:40:51,269
they which Tom sex and pretty much

4167
02:40:49,889 --> 02:40:54,539
handed the keys to me and it was like

4168
02:40:51,270 --> 02:40:56,550
here you go run the shop so yeah since

4169
02:40:54,540 --> 02:41:01,680
then we've both gotten into that shop

4170
02:40:56,549 --> 02:41:03,509
was legal quasi illegal was such a gray

4171
02:41:01,680 --> 02:41:05,939
area we called it the wild wild west I

4172
02:41:03,510 --> 02:41:07,170
was growing urban the house and Tom was

4173
02:41:05,939 --> 02:41:09,199
growing herb at the house and we would

4174
02:41:07,170 --> 02:41:11,699
take it put it on the shelves and then

4175
02:41:09,199 --> 02:41:14,340
customers would show up with a backpack

4176
02:41:11,699 --> 02:41:16,170
and you know I just need to talk to Jeff

4177
02:41:14,340 --> 02:41:17,309
they'd send him back and they'd come

4178
02:41:16,170 --> 02:41:18,840
talk to him and they'd be like look at

4179
02:41:17,309 --> 02:41:20,100
all this weed I grew do you guys want to

4180
02:41:18,840 --> 02:41:21,329
buy it and so we just buy it if it was

4181
02:41:20,100 --> 02:41:23,130
good enough and they wanted a reasonable

4182
02:41:21,329 --> 02:41:24,450
price we could buy the weed from them

4183
02:41:23,129 --> 02:41:28,049
and put it on the shelves at that point

4184
02:41:24,450 --> 02:41:31,340
it days the good old days yes I think

4185
02:41:28,049 --> 02:41:31,340
the herb was a little bit better back

4186
02:41:33,590 --> 02:41:38,100
yeah and I work in a large scale grow

4187
02:41:35,909 --> 02:41:39,750
it's a different type of thing it's a

4188
02:41:38,100 --> 02:41:41,610
totally different monster the airflow is

4189
02:41:39,750 --> 02:41:42,898
different the temperature one of the

4190
02:41:41,610 --> 02:41:44,760
things I've noticed about everything is

4191
02:41:42,898 --> 02:41:47,099
that commercial growers are just oh my

4192
02:41:44,760 --> 02:41:49,590
god there just seems like I can't

4193
02:41:47,100 --> 02:41:52,200
believe how weed back in the day was so

4194
02:41:49,590 --> 02:41:54,540
much better and it was just people

4195
02:41:52,200 --> 02:41:58,470
working with almost no budget compared

4196
02:41:54,540 --> 02:42:01,500
to people have a lot of that is because

4197
02:41:58,469 --> 02:42:03,539
the passion the industry evolved the

4198
02:42:01,500 --> 02:42:05,610
rules evolve to where only people with a

4199
02:42:03,540 --> 02:42:06,630
million dollars can play in the cannabis

4200
02:42:05,610 --> 02:42:08,250
game right now you have to have a

4201
02:42:06,629 --> 02:42:10,049
million dollars to get involved in the

4202
02:42:08,250 --> 02:42:12,148
cannabis game to have a legal shop and

4203
02:42:10,049 --> 02:42:14,250
to grow a grow that supports that shop

4204
02:42:12,148 --> 02:42:16,680
to be able to open and have a clean

4205
02:42:14,250 --> 02:42:18,360
environment to build your grow and a

4206
02:42:16,680 --> 02:42:20,610
retail environment and to hire a staff

4207
02:42:18,360 --> 02:42:22,649
and to get product and to get insurance

4208
02:42:20,610 --> 02:42:24,950
and to get security security is so

4209
02:42:22,648 --> 02:42:27,329
expensive to open any type of anything

4210
02:42:24,950 --> 02:42:30,240
marijuana Enforcement Division regulated

4211
02:42:27,329 --> 02:42:32,520
every square foot where people can go

4212
02:42:30,239 --> 02:42:34,439
needs to be covered by a camera if

4213
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:36,060
there's a doorway they want a camera on

4214
02:42:34,439 --> 02:42:37,739
both sides of the door so that if they

4215
02:42:36,059 --> 02:42:39,000
look at two camera views on the monitor

4216
02:42:37,739 --> 02:42:41,069
they can see you leave one room and

4217
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:42,930
enter the other room flawlessly there

4218
02:42:41,069 --> 02:42:44,819
can be no gaps in your travel on the

4219
02:42:42,930 --> 02:42:46,229
cameras so it cost you a million bucks

4220
02:42:44,819 --> 02:42:48,898
to get into the industry nowadays and

4221
02:42:46,228 --> 02:42:51,329
what sucks about that is people like you

4222
02:42:48,898 --> 02:42:52,289
and I we have heart we got mad heart you

4223
02:42:51,329 --> 02:42:54,360
know what I mean we've been doing this

4224
02:42:52,290 --> 02:42:58,920
before we should even admit we were

4225
02:42:54,360 --> 02:43:00,060
growing in our on and so we've got heart

4226
02:42:58,920 --> 02:43:01,590
we don't have a million dollars because

4227
02:43:00,059 --> 02:43:02,939
we had to hide we had we were drawing

4228
02:43:01,590 --> 02:43:04,170
weed we weren't going to college we

4229
02:43:02,939 --> 02:43:05,280
weren't running a car dealership we

4230
02:43:04,170 --> 02:43:06,689
weren't doing whatever these other guys

4231
02:43:05,280 --> 02:43:09,840
are doing so we need to make our own

4232
02:43:06,689 --> 02:43:13,530
money and now that we've got it your

4233
02:43:09,840 --> 02:43:28,829
headphones alright no good I'll tap them

4234
02:43:13,530 --> 02:43:32,430
and they'll start working no just one on

4235
02:43:28,829 --> 02:43:34,319
alright guys don't ever buy the hero4

4236
02:43:32,430 --> 02:43:35,460
headphone amplifier from livewire if

4237
02:43:34,319 --> 02:43:36,739
you're a guitar tuner and they offer you

4238
02:43:35,459 --> 02:43:38,149
that give them a dirty

4239
02:43:36,739 --> 02:43:39,560
can buy the one that's $20 more

4240
02:43:38,149 --> 02:43:41,449
expensive it'll be well worth your time

4241
02:43:39,560 --> 02:43:42,649
guys that's my recommendation all right

4242
02:43:41,450 --> 02:43:43,790
so we're talking about this industry if

4243
02:43:42,649 --> 02:43:45,140
you don't have a million dollars you

4244
02:43:43,790 --> 02:43:46,700
can't get into the cannabis industry but

4245
02:43:45,140 --> 02:43:48,350
Louis and I Carlos and I have mad

4246
02:43:46,700 --> 02:43:49,971
passion we wouldn't be able to buy a

4247
02:43:48,351 --> 02:43:51,710
shop right now and set that up because

4248
02:43:49,970 --> 02:43:52,970
we've been growing weed and living like

4249
02:43:51,709 --> 02:43:54,199
that you got to kind of hide when you're

4250
02:43:52,970 --> 02:43:55,670
a cannabis grower back in the day we

4251
02:43:54,200 --> 02:43:56,721
couldn't have all the money that we had

4252
02:43:55,670 --> 02:43:57,890
so we had to hide that we couldn't go

4253
02:43:56,720 --> 02:44:02,359
open the store so we couldn't talk about

4254
02:43:57,890 --> 02:44:03,920
how'd you make this money I grew weed so

4255
02:44:02,360 --> 02:44:05,690
the people that are able to open shops

4256
02:44:03,920 --> 02:44:07,220
now are guys that have had other

4257
02:44:05,690 --> 02:44:08,750
businesses that we're doing other things

4258
02:44:07,220 --> 02:44:10,159
and no offense to those guys but they

4259
02:44:08,750 --> 02:44:11,870
don't have the heart that somebody like

4260
02:44:10,159 --> 02:44:13,819
you and I have about the industry we

4261
02:44:11,870 --> 02:44:15,380
work in this it's a business to them if

4262
02:44:13,819 --> 02:44:16,729
they have an accountant and a lawyer and

4263
02:44:15,379 --> 02:44:18,170
then the master growers are the guys

4264
02:44:16,729 --> 02:44:27,709
that are supposed to go grow their

4265
02:44:18,170 --> 02:44:30,530
employees so what I was kind of getting

4266
02:44:27,709 --> 02:44:33,079
out a little bit is right now mastered

4267
02:44:30,530 --> 02:44:34,610
growers and head growers I'm called a

4268
02:44:33,079 --> 02:44:35,750
lead cultivator as my official title I

4269
02:44:34,610 --> 02:44:37,130
hated the word master grower so we

4270
02:44:35,750 --> 02:44:40,310
changed I'm a lead cultivator I'll lead

4271
02:44:37,129 --> 02:44:42,770
the cultivation team we're making hella

4272
02:44:40,310 --> 02:44:44,899
good money like we're being paid fat

4273
02:44:42,771 --> 02:44:46,431
chunky salaries as lead cultivators in

4274
02:44:44,899 --> 02:44:47,779
this industry right now people that have

4275
02:44:46,431 --> 02:44:49,280
been at it for I've been growing

4276
02:44:47,780 --> 02:44:51,021
cannabis for over 20 years I've been

4277
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:55,851
involved in the cannabis industry or the

4278
02:44:51,021 --> 02:44:57,829
cannabis scene for Wow 25 years I have

4279
02:44:55,851 --> 02:44:59,989
to think about that messin with weed for

4280
02:44:57,829 --> 02:45:01,909
25 years any guys there's a big

4281
02:44:59,989 --> 02:45:04,159
difference between being like a weed

4282
02:45:01,909 --> 02:45:05,390
grower and a cannabis giver caregiver

4283
02:45:04,159 --> 02:45:06,709
and being in the industry if you're not

4284
02:45:05,390 --> 02:45:08,539
paying taxes on it you don't have some

4285
02:45:06,709 --> 02:45:10,640
kind of cannabis meed regulated license

4286
02:45:08,540 --> 02:45:16,550
you can't say you're in the industry in

4287
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:17,931
Colorado see I do this in the industry

4288
02:45:16,549 --> 02:45:20,600
you're a grower you're underground

4289
02:45:17,931 --> 02:45:22,819
get on paper come join us it's fun pay

4290
02:45:20,601 --> 02:45:24,230
taxes do it correctly but so what I'm

4291
02:45:22,819 --> 02:45:25,789
saying is the people that own the

4292
02:45:24,229 --> 02:45:27,439
industry they have all kinds of money

4293
02:45:25,790 --> 02:45:29,061
now so I think that people like myself

4294
02:45:27,440 --> 02:45:31,340
that are making good money we better

4295
02:45:29,060 --> 02:45:33,049
stick to it we better make a fat resume

4296
02:45:31,340 --> 02:45:34,521
you guys that are trimming making I know

4297
02:45:33,049 --> 02:45:36,170
trimmers that make anywhere between 10

4298
02:45:34,521 --> 02:45:38,030
and 20 bucks an hour if you're making

4299
02:45:36,170 --> 02:45:39,890
good money trimming start documenting

4300
02:45:38,030 --> 02:45:41,300
how many hours you've been trimming if

4301
02:45:39,890 --> 02:45:42,859
you're using a trim machine if you're

4302
02:45:41,299 --> 02:45:43,549
using the satellite if you're using the

4303
02:45:42,860 --> 02:45:45,590
Ripper

4304
02:45:43,549 --> 02:45:47,239
document how many hours you use on that

4305
02:45:45,590 --> 02:45:49,579
put that as part of your resume if you

4306
02:45:47,239 --> 02:45:50,271
know how if your applicator certified

4307
02:45:49,579 --> 02:45:52,399
that goes on

4308
02:45:50,271 --> 02:45:54,739
resume because in the future this is

4309
02:45:52,399 --> 02:45:56,600
gonna turn into just a basic job

4310
02:45:54,739 --> 02:45:59,329
unfortunately people like Alan said over

4311
02:45:56,601 --> 02:46:01,489
here it's a business that owners aren't

4312
02:45:59,329 --> 02:46:03,649
gonna want to pay the next set of

4313
02:46:01,489 --> 02:46:06,351
growers my salary the people that come

4314
02:46:03,649 --> 02:46:08,300
after me they're not gonna get paid what

4315
02:46:06,351 --> 02:46:09,650
this group of growers are getting paid

4316
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:11,899
it's gonna start tapering off because

4317
02:46:09,649 --> 02:46:14,899
what I think creates a high dollar

4318
02:46:11,899 --> 02:46:17,001
product is an illegal product since it

4319
02:46:14,899 --> 02:46:19,100
was illegal it was highly in demand but

4320
02:46:17,001 --> 02:46:20,390
there wasn't any supply now it's legal

4321
02:46:19,101 --> 02:46:21,739
we could grow the [ __ ] out of it we

4322
02:46:20,390 --> 02:46:23,960
don't have to hide why are we charging

4323
02:46:21,739 --> 02:46:25,940
so much for it it's only for production

4324
02:46:23,960 --> 02:46:27,529
once we catch up with production which

4325
02:46:25,940 --> 02:46:29,989
won't take too long we're building their

4326
02:46:27,530 --> 02:46:31,341
greenhouses going up every single day so

4327
02:46:29,989 --> 02:46:33,591
once we catch up the production I see

4328
02:46:31,341 --> 02:46:35,450
prices going down and then the producers

4329
02:46:33,591 --> 02:46:36,950
are going to start being paid less and

4330
02:46:35,450 --> 02:46:39,530
less trimmers aren't gonna get hired on

4331
02:46:36,950 --> 02:46:41,211
for 15 an hour anymore the industry is

4332
02:46:39,530 --> 02:46:43,431
gonna taper off it'll be any other

4333
02:46:41,210 --> 02:46:47,119
agricultural Hills find more temporary

4334
02:46:43,431 --> 02:46:49,341
they have been going on it probably but

4335
02:46:47,120 --> 02:46:51,860
getting back to the leaf cultivator like

4336
02:46:49,341 --> 02:46:54,800
any industry I do will believe that if

4337
02:46:51,860 --> 02:46:57,141
you can show someone that you are worth

4338
02:46:54,800 --> 02:46:58,760
your money you can get a higher wage for

4339
02:46:57,140 --> 02:47:01,279
it if you can go in there and you can

4340
02:46:58,761 --> 02:47:03,171
increase production and show them that

4341
02:47:01,280 --> 02:47:05,061
you can do it you can bring it up 10 15

4342
02:47:03,171 --> 02:47:06,771
20 percent you'll still have a

4343
02:47:05,060 --> 02:47:08,360
competitive edge over someone else

4344
02:47:06,771 --> 02:47:10,551
absolutely able to present that

4345
02:47:08,360 --> 02:47:13,251
absolutely you make good recommendations

4346
02:47:10,550 --> 02:47:14,421
of absolutely documenting your history

4347
02:47:13,251 --> 02:47:16,220
and what you've been able to accomplish

4348
02:47:14,421 --> 02:47:18,800
and it's gonna make a lot of differences

4349
02:47:16,220 --> 02:47:20,539
as this industry does change that works

4350
02:47:18,800 --> 02:47:22,579
and in any industry document what you're

4351
02:47:20,540 --> 02:47:24,471
doing have proof it's just harder in the

4352
02:47:22,579 --> 02:47:26,450
cannabis industry but as we're revolving

4353
02:47:24,470 --> 02:47:28,279
a lot of guys like us we're ahead of the

4354
02:47:26,450 --> 02:47:29,870
game so stay ahead of the game and

4355
02:47:28,280 --> 02:47:31,641
document that stuff don't get stuck in

4356
02:47:29,870 --> 02:47:32,961
your bubble and write down everything

4357
02:47:31,640 --> 02:47:34,789
that you're learning and that goes on a

4358
02:47:32,960 --> 02:47:36,199
resume if you can eat like I said if you

4359
02:47:34,790 --> 02:47:38,150
can use the satellite that goes on your

4360
02:47:36,200 --> 02:47:39,409
resume if you can use the obidos that

4361
02:47:38,149 --> 02:47:41,149
goes on your resume if you can run a

4362
02:47:39,409 --> 02:47:43,130
sweet leaf extractor that goes on your

4363
02:47:41,149 --> 02:47:46,399
resume because eventually you guys

4364
02:47:43,130 --> 02:47:48,409
you're not gonna so Alan brought up a

4365
02:47:46,399 --> 02:47:50,300
good point you can impress them and you

4366
02:47:48,409 --> 02:47:52,970
can jump in and make a few a few more

4367
02:47:50,300 --> 02:47:54,739
dollars on your salary but a lot of

4368
02:47:52,970 --> 02:47:56,720
those guys a lot of those jobs are taken

4369
02:47:54,739 --> 02:47:58,489
by guys like us I've got a jump on it so

4370
02:47:56,720 --> 02:47:59,779
it's the next wave of people all the all

4371
02:47:58,489 --> 02:48:01,729
the rock stars are kind of doing that

4372
02:47:59,780 --> 02:48:03,141
now you're gonna have to be a badass to

4373
02:48:01,729 --> 02:48:03,779
get that kind of a salary in the future

4374
02:48:03,140 --> 02:48:06,270
I think

4375
02:48:03,779 --> 02:48:07,890
my opinion yeah I agree with you on on

4376
02:48:06,270 --> 02:48:10,399
that a lot it's still gonna come down to

4377
02:48:07,889 --> 02:48:13,588
networking to ivory and other industries

4378
02:48:10,398 --> 02:48:15,599
networking was important you have to

4379
02:48:13,588 --> 02:48:18,180
have those you know those crossover

4380
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:19,979
relationships but nothing like this

4381
02:48:18,180 --> 02:48:22,680
industry of I've ever experienced the

4382
02:48:19,978 --> 02:48:26,068
word so I use the word incestuous it

4383
02:48:22,680 --> 02:48:29,279
really is you have to know someone a lot

4384
02:48:26,068 --> 02:48:31,738
of instances to get I get in the door

4385
02:48:29,279 --> 02:48:33,479
now I was pretty fortunate I was got

4386
02:48:31,738 --> 02:48:36,148
hired on I've always been in the

4387
02:48:33,478 --> 02:48:38,548
industry about well eight months and I

4388
02:48:36,148 --> 02:48:41,398
think I've been badged and I've worked

4389
02:48:38,549 --> 02:48:45,209
at a couple other facilities starting at

4390
02:48:41,398 --> 02:48:47,908
the ground level literally and I did

4391
02:48:45,209 --> 02:48:50,789
walk into one place and with my

4392
02:48:47,908 --> 02:48:52,618
crossover skills and my resume I was

4393
02:48:50,789 --> 02:48:54,539
able to get in there but I've had to

4394
02:48:52,619 --> 02:48:56,939
work and hustle to learn this industry

4395
02:48:54,539 --> 02:48:58,770
oh yeah but it does matter a lot on if

4396
02:48:56,939 --> 02:49:00,959
you can name drop a little bit I think

4397
02:48:58,770 --> 02:49:04,049
it helps a tremendous amount more so in

4398
02:49:00,959 --> 02:49:06,270
this industry I can completely testify

4399
02:49:04,049 --> 02:49:08,760
to your statement I would not be in the

4400
02:49:06,270 --> 02:49:09,238
position I'm in if I weren't I earned it

4401
02:49:08,760 --> 02:49:11,100
honestly

4402
02:49:09,238 --> 02:49:13,260
I earned I earned the spot but if I did

4403
02:49:11,100 --> 02:49:15,568
not know grimy Gatsby if I wasn't tight

4404
02:49:13,260 --> 02:49:16,889
with hunt like I was I would not have

4405
02:49:15,568 --> 02:49:18,600
found my spot where I am

4406
02:49:16,889 --> 02:49:20,128
he was my homie from before he had a

4407
02:49:18,600 --> 02:49:21,930
spot and when things went wrong he

4408
02:49:20,129 --> 02:49:23,939
called me right away like you can grow

4409
02:49:21,930 --> 02:49:25,559
yeah so get out and join the industry I

4410
02:49:23,939 --> 02:49:26,789
mean that's kind of what that you were

4411
02:49:25,559 --> 02:49:29,430
bringing up you know if you're gonna

4412
02:49:26,789 --> 02:49:31,829

4414
02:49:31,828 --> 02:49:36,898

4416

4425
02:49:54,209 --> 02:49:57,299
you guys are new kind of fairly new to

4426
02:49:55,859 --> 02:49:58,918
the legal cannabis industry can we talk

4427
02:49:57,299 --> 02:49:59,789
about what you guys are doing or is that

4428
02:49:58,918 --> 02:50:02,398
would you like to keep some of that

4429
02:49:59,789 --> 02:50:04,289
quiet for now well I won't mention who

4430
02:50:02,398 --> 02:50:07,078
I'm with because you know I don't think

4431
02:50:04,289 --> 02:50:10,319
it's okay the thing but yeah I'm just in

4432
02:50:07,078 --> 02:50:13,228
quality control trimming if you will

4433
02:50:10,318 --> 02:50:16,039
okay but you know it did really those

4434
02:50:13,228 --> 02:50:20,539
you'd mentioned dropping the mass

4435
02:50:16,040 --> 02:50:23,090
grower and lead cultivator the trimmer

4436
02:50:20,540 --> 02:50:25,730
is the last well not the last person but

4437
02:50:23,090 --> 02:50:27,440
one of the last people to see what that

4438
02:50:25,729 --> 02:50:29,090
products going to be like when it gets

4439
02:50:27,440 --> 02:50:34,220
out there yeah you get your dis turn

4440
02:50:29,090 --> 02:50:36,200
into more of a quality control issue in

4441
02:50:34,219 --> 02:50:37,789
the industry I think - you hear that

4442
02:50:36,200 --> 02:50:38,960
forward-thinking you guys that's

4443
02:50:37,790 --> 02:50:40,760
something we need in the cannabis

4444
02:50:38,959 --> 02:50:42,469
industry you're not just a trimmer you

4445
02:50:40,760 --> 02:50:44,420
were a quality control you're inspecting

4446
02:50:42,469 --> 02:50:46,159
my life buds that I handed to you to

4447
02:50:44,420 --> 02:50:47,510
trim your the last eyes they're gonna

4448
02:50:46,159 --> 02:50:49,729
look at them before we put them in a jar

4449
02:50:47,510 --> 02:51:09,559
and customers touch them so you have to

4450
02:50:49,729 --> 02:51:10,939
be inspector quality control before

4451
02:51:09,559 --> 02:51:12,350
thinker if you're gonna come join the

4452
02:51:10,940 --> 02:51:14,149
cannabis industry just like just like

4453
02:51:12,350 --> 02:51:15,649
you saying you're not just trimming it

4454
02:51:14,149 --> 02:51:17,209
you're not staring into the buds all day

4455
02:51:15,649 --> 02:51:18,529
you are making sure they are beautiful

4456
02:51:17,209 --> 02:51:20,779
so that when I put them in the jar and

4457
02:51:18,530 --> 02:51:22,460
the patients come in they go oh who trim

4458

all especially on the hand trimming you

4460
02:51:24,530 --> 02:51:30,159
know really is a it's a fun it's a fun

4461
02:51:26,780 --> 02:51:32,810
skill to learn I mean it takes a lot of

4462
02:51:30,159 --> 02:51:34,579
technique and it can be boring but I

4463
02:51:32,809 --> 02:51:36,739
mean you have some great conversations

4464
02:51:34,579 --> 02:51:38,959
over the table you meet such a wide

4465
02:51:36,739 --> 02:51:40,940
variety of personalities in the industry

4469
02:51:45,409 --> 02:51:58,100
I actually find that I'm always the

4470
02:51:46,969 --> 02:51:59,869
minority of the table everybody's a

4471
02:51:58,100 --> 02:52:01,670
little crowded it's starting to get the

4472
02:51:59,870 --> 02:52:04,010
rents going up it's getting a little bit

4473
02:52:01,670 --> 02:52:07,190
full they have an abundance of labor for

4474
02:52:04,010 --> 02:52:10,550
the market so it is competitive you know

4475
02:52:07,190 --> 02:52:12,050
so work on your skills and work on work

4476
02:52:10,549 --> 02:52:13,520
on getting to know people in the

4477
02:52:12,049 --> 02:52:16,189
industries where someone will give you a

4478
02:52:13,521 --> 02:52:17,720
chance then like every other thing show

4479
02:52:16,190 --> 02:52:19,550
up and do your stuff you know it's not a

4480
02:52:17,719 --> 02:52:21,109
place where you just sit around party or

4481
02:52:19,549 --> 02:52:22,579
I think there's a lot of people who want

4482
02:52:21,110 --> 02:52:23,810
to get into the industry because they

4483
02:52:22,579 --> 02:52:25,578
think it was like high school

4484
02:52:23,809 --> 02:52:27,139
whereby this sits around the topes

4485
02:52:25,578 --> 02:52:28,850
around a table or something it sounds

4486
02:52:27,139 --> 02:52:30,828
like that but I'm the lead cultures

4487

02:52:43,459 --> 02:52:46,728

short-lived industry cash register has

4547

[Music]

4559
02:55:36,600 --> 02:55:41,079
he's come across as very well-spoken and

4560
02:55:39,370 --> 02:55:45,490
very intelligent so far let's let him

4561
02:55:41,079 --> 02:55:52,389
continue that reputation on the show we

4562
02:55:45,489 --> 02:55:54,879
turn into a bubble I'm heating up the

4563
02:55:52,389 --> 02:55:56,739
highly educated this one's the duality

4564
02:55:54,879 --> 02:56:00,099
male you know I do have to sell you

4565
02:55:56,739 --> 02:56:05,139
stuff when I participated when it wasn't

4566
02:56:00,100 --> 02:56:09,329
legal as a younger man I had one of the

4567
02:56:05,139 --> 02:56:09,329
old Hobbit bongs that I used to smoke my

4568
02:56:09,989 --> 02:56:15,750
wonderful ex-wife

4569
02:56:12,068 --> 02:56:15,750
now she's wonderful cuz she's an ex

4570
02:56:16,228 --> 02:56:21,728
awesome I love you the glass where they

4571
02:56:19,930 --> 02:56:24,790
have here I mean to sit here you don't

4572
02:56:21,728 --> 02:56:26,829
have to really smoke to appreciate the

4573
02:56:24,790 --> 02:56:29,091
art or the craftsmanship in it you don't

4574
02:56:26,829 --> 02:56:33,140
have to do that it is really

4575
02:56:29,091 --> 02:56:36,021
pardon me you can see why someone who

4576
02:56:33,140 --> 02:56:40,239
asked the budget may spend the money all

4577
02:56:36,021 --> 02:56:44,120
here on one you know art is subjective

4578
02:56:40,239 --> 02:56:46,101
and it it's not jumping back to what

4579
02:56:44,120 --> 02:56:47,511
we're talking about earlier and what I'm

4580
02:56:46,101 --> 02:56:50,150
sitting here looking at what you have on

4581
02:56:47,511 --> 02:56:52,940
the table I mean there's three beautiful

4582
02:56:50,149 --> 02:56:59,001
pieces well thank you to hit man's and

4583
02:56:52,940 --> 02:57:03,381
then a piece from elevate glasses

4584
02:56:59,001 --> 02:57:05,989
changed like what maybe the last ten

4585
02:57:03,380 --> 02:57:07,699
years I remember just going into the

4586
02:57:05,989 --> 02:57:10,460
glass shop it was kind of like so so you

4587
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:17,631
know and then now this seems like the

4588
02:57:10,460 --> 02:57:20,420
glass shops there's something about

4589
02:57:17,630 --> 02:57:22,520
being a grower I caught myself falling

4590
02:57:20,421 --> 02:57:24,380
into it when you harvest do you have too

4591
02:57:22,521 --> 02:57:26,601
much money for a minute and like any

4592
02:57:24,380 --> 02:57:28,489
young guy that has too much money and a

4593
02:57:26,601 --> 02:57:30,681
big ego and [ __ ] going on you gotta go

4594
02:57:28,489 --> 02:57:33,229
buy something and I don't do the gold

4595
02:57:30,681 --> 02:57:35,211
chains I don't do rims on my car and the

4596
02:57:33,229 --> 02:57:36,829
thing I like to do is smoke hash and

4597
02:57:35,210 --> 02:57:38,659
listen to good music so I've got a

4598
02:57:36,829 --> 02:57:41,239
slammin stereo system I got really good

4599
02:57:38,659 --> 02:57:43,190
headphones on and I've got really nice

4600
02:57:41,239 --> 02:57:44,989
hash so that's every harvest I would go

4601
02:57:43,190 --> 02:57:46,761
buy something ridiculous like this was

4602
02:57:44,989 --> 02:57:48,619
one of my first good harvest to hit and

4603
02:57:46,761 --> 02:57:50,659
we were talking about that was like a

4604
02:57:48,620 --> 02:57:52,190
harvest that I drew this one here I just

4605
02:57:50,659 --> 02:57:53,810
drew some extra herb I was like I'm

4606
02:57:52,190 --> 02:57:55,819
gonna set up this room and that extra

4607
02:57:53,810 --> 02:57:57,380
room bought me that rig was pretty much

4608
02:57:55,819 --> 02:57:59,779
what I pulled out of there extra you

4609
02:57:57,380 --> 02:58:01,340
know so stuff like that we're gonna go

4610
02:57:59,780 --> 02:58:07,521
buy a rig instead of buying rims and

4611
02:58:01,341 --> 02:58:08,810
gold chains and if you've gold chains

4612

4627
02:58:40,591 --> 02:58:44,251
there's probably a half gram of just

4628
02:58:42,239 --> 02:58:46,199
buzz stuck in there yeah that's just

4629
02:58:44,251 --> 02:58:47,610
that's a very intricate piece to be

4630
02:58:46,200 --> 02:58:50,601
trying to I'm gonna have to dissolve it

4631
02:58:47,610 --> 02:58:50,601
really well with rubbing alcohol

4632
02:58:51,021 --> 02:58:55,501
isopropyl alcohol just fill the rig up

4633
02:58:53,700 --> 02:58:57,601
as high as you can with alcohol let it

4634
02:58:55,501 --> 02:59:00,329
sit for a few then pour a little bit of

4635
02:58:57,601 --> 02:59:02,221
kosher salt in there kosher salts real

4636
02:59:00,329 --> 02:59:04,261
rough and then shake the [ __ ] out of the

4637
02:59:02,220 --> 02:59:05,761
rig cover the holes of your thumbs and

4638
02:59:04,261 --> 02:59:07,501
shake the [ __ ] out of it don't drop it

4639
02:59:05,761 --> 02:59:08,909
do it over the carpet dude over the

4640
02:59:07,501 --> 02:59:11,460
couch if you feel like you're clumsy and

4641
02:59:08,909 --> 02:59:12,780
just shake the [ __ ] [ __ ] up real good

4642
02:59:11,460 --> 02:59:17,909
and then rinse it with hot water a few

4643
02:59:12,780 --> 02:59:20,851
times let it cool off things I noticed

4644
02:59:17,909 --> 02:59:21,899
is if you give it a decent one about

4645
02:59:20,851 --> 02:59:39,001
that what that piece is a pretty

4646
02:59:21,899 --> 02:59:44,550
