today it's been a long podcasting day

46
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,040
it was 95 for part of the day it was a

47
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,280
really hot day

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
ah i feel like it has cooled off quite a

49
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,280
bit and it is time to do a good podcast

50
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,719
so

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,560

52
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:50,798
part of the show where we do shout outs

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,000

54
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,920

this episode

95
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,439
the first question on today's podcast

96
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,560
goes

97
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,400
just like this it says hey i'll be in

98
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,080
the live again i just thought i'd try my

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
luck i can't find this information

100
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
anywhere

101
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
so i think they're starting off by

102
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,639
saying they found me through my

103
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:17,919
instagram live feed

104
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,399

00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,639
time

106
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,239
i jump on instagram live and i hang out

107
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,079
with my friends i take a bunch of dabs

108
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,319
and i ramble for about a solid

109
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,239
hour my instagram gives you one full

110
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:29,359
hour i'm there until they cut me off

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,280
most of the time

112
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
i try to field all of the questions that

113
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,479
come up in the chat i have

114
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,400
no way of predicting what may come up in

115
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,878
the chat so if you ask a question in the

116

question answered but have no fear

136
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:10,158
because i'm going to read your question

137
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,039
here on the show it says

138
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,000
i'm growing in cocoa a 4x4 scrog i just

139
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:16,159
filled the net was going

140
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,319
to flip to flower tomorrow but i noticed

141
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,439
powdery mildew on the lower and some of

142
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,599
the other leaves

143
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:22,719
i stripped and the lower big fan leaves

144
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
at the bottom

145
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,840
and then it says i will use a product

146
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,319
they listed the product

147
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,758
and then it says do i wait or do i begin

148
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,079
flowering i'm so grateful

149
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,439
for any help and i fully understand that

150
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,918
you are busy stay

151
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,279
blessed um i really believe that if

152
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,120
you've got powdery mildew when you were

153
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:40,879
considering flipping the flower

154
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,399
i would wait i would wait until that

155
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:43,279
problem is under control get that

156
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:45,679
corrected

157
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,478
get the the issue at hand corrected get

158
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
the

159
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,680
reason causing the issue corrected

160
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,199
there's a reason why this is happening

161
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,319
something is incorrect in the room the

162
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,720
vpd is off

163
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,719
you're not evacuating humidity quickly

164
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,160
enough something's going on in there so

165
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
we need to get more airflow we need to

166
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,800
remove humidity from the room we need to

167
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,479
solve the problem

168
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,319
and also treat the plants at the same

169
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,758
time we can keep spraying the plants

170
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:07,120
with [ __ ] we can keep putting band-aids

171
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,960
on the plants but they will keep getting

172
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,519
powdery mildew if we don't correct the

173
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,079
room

174
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,639
so the overall solution is correct the

175
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,319
room

176
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,319
then correct the plants or tree both at

177
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,560
the same time solve the problem

178
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,680
then go into flowers so set yourself up

179
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,439
for success

180
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,879
uh if you put these plants into flower

181
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,959
and they've got powdery mildew

182
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,639
it's going to get worse the powdery

183
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,719
mildew will get worse and then your

184
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,800
options for treating that powdery mildew

185
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
will get minimized as time goes on once

186
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,560
you've got bud set

187
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:36,000
chunkier buds you cannot start doing

188
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,519
different things for those

189
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,959
powdery mildew problems i got way off

190
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:40,478
course there but i think you know what

191
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:41,758
i'm saying once we get buds we can't

192
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:44,159
spray with some [ __ ] so

193
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,120
we don't want to get buds now we want to

194
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,120
solve the problem

195
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,319
treat the plants rid of the rid the room

196
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,879
of the powdery mildew

197
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,800
then put the healthy clean plants into

198
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,319
flour

199
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,680
all right you did not include your name

200
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,199
so i don't know who to thank for this

201
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,319
great message but i hope i gave you some

202
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,000
good grow advice

203
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,840
big thanks and big shout out and i hope

204
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,759
you have solved your powdery

205
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,599
mildew problem there are a lot of things

206
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,400
you can do for the powdery mildew now

207
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,520
i think that double nickel and cease are

208
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,120
great products for that

209
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:12,399
there are a lot of great fungicides out

210
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,079
there that will solve that problem

211
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,159
depending on the intensity

212
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,199
but honestly the main thing right now is

213
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,199
to solve

214
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,560
the problem what is causing that powdery

215
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,439
mildew in the room we could spray the

216
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,879
plants all day

217
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,719
but if we don't take care of the issue

218
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,159
it will keep coming back

219
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,160
all right i've got another great message

220
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,919
here in front of me this one comes from

221
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,759

do you go through phases this is just a

230
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,360
side note a good rant a rosta jeff

231
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,719
moment here

232
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,960
you go through phases where you can

233
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,440
smoke all of the dabs and you don't get

234
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:52,719
high

235
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,478
and then you go through phases where you

236
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
can just open the jar and you get

237
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,279
obliterated

238
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,199
this week has been one of the weeks

239
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,918
where i take a dab and every dab has

240
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,478
made me go

241
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:04,079
oh [ __ ] it's a it's a great thing it's

242
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:04,399
been cost effective of course today i

243
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:06,399
smoked

244
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,159
nearly three grams of concentrates today

245
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,120
but it's been a long day today is not a

246
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
normal day

247
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,759
ah but this has been one of the phases

248
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:15,519
where i just take a fat dab in my body's

249
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,639
like oh you're high bro you should sit

250
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,478
down for a minute

251
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,000

i'm a cheap date lately which is

253
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,959
always nice because on those weeks when

254

i smoke and smoke and smoke and nothing

255
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,519
happens i feel like i just burned

256
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,960
through the concentrates

257
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,120
that gets quite expensive a little bit

258
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,799
spendy but slab dab

259
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,639

this batter uh that gets expensive

261
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,519
throwing down slab dabs but if you're

262
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,959

anything that mean

288
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,038

292
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,800
press into terpy rosin

293
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,280
are more important than profile of the

294
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,840
high to me honestly so you prefer greasy

295
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,879
buds

296
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,319
with turpee rosin over the profile of

297
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:37,200
the high alright then it says keep on

298
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,159

299
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,680

00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,559

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,039
somebody that wants to remember me

304
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,879
uh you said stoney indica most of what i

305
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,599
breed is more of a real

306
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,039
head racy sativa i think the orange gasm

307
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,120
may be a really good thing to remember

308
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,278
me by somebody made me a nice plaque

309
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,440
uh sent me a real nice letter it had an

310
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,958
orange gasm package in it lately orange

311
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,959
gasm has been the hit

312
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:06,399
uh orange gasm has been the best seller

313
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,679
out of all of them the photos have been

314
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,600
[ __ ] amazing

315
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,879
so that may be a good one to remember me

316
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,399
by of course there is

317
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,480
lemon jeffrey it's got my name on the

318
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,399
damn package so maybe lemon jeffrey

319
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,519
it's tall it smells funny and it will

320
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,799
kick your ass so

321
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,679
lemon jeffrey you know but stony indicas

322
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,159
i would say maybe morning do since you

323
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,479
want that

324
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:28,480
indica that indica funk and then you

325
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,320
said uh stony profile

326
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,320
uh more important than the high terpy

327
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,120
rosin more important than the profile of

328
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,839
the high so

329
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,959
yeah you're gonna get that skunky

330
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,760
funkiness uh

331
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:41,199
but also stony indica i think morning

332
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,278
dew may be the one for you so

333
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,440
if you want the oranges go for the the

334
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,120
orange gasm if you want more of a skunky

335
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,800
stoney thing that's what i would say go

336
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,240
for the morning do so those are the two

337
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,240
of the three because i put lemon jeffrey

338
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,759
in there as well so man it really sounds

339
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,120
like i'm dying and nobody told me about

340
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,480
it that's what's on my mind now

341
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,159
so those are the three strains i would

342
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,600
recommend for you tyler i hope i

343
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,559

344
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,920

345
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:05,439
hit lately it's been my number one

be a fan of it

375
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,199

like it so many people sent me messages

377
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,399

it myself so i can't endorse it

381

382
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,199

people

453
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,639

promise you it will happen

456
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:12,319
i had a couple obstacles in the way i

457
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,278
think we're clearing those up we're

458
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,200

let me keep going here uh it says i

460
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,480
aspire to be as

461
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,320
big in the podcast world as you and

462
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,519
maybe if i get a big following

463
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,200
i can have you on the show um

464
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,799
feels weird when you say get as big in

465
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,680
the podcast world as me i'm just a

466
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,159
little show bro

467
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,239
uh sometimes i pop up in the top 100 on

468
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,000
stitcher and the education category

469
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,000
just a little show just a normal dude

470
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,759
doing my thing a one-man production here

471
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,720
i do appreciate uh that you think it's a

472
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:40,399
giant thing

473
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,000
i try to stay humble and realize it's

474
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:43,039
just a guy in a microphone doing what i

475
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,519
meant to do

476
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,879
i appreciate that as for getting me on

477
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,320
your podcast i've got a better idea

478
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,919
and this means this i'm not trying to

479
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,360
sound egotistical here this is really

480
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:55,360
the way that i think it would work for

481
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,959
both of us marketing wise instead of me

482
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,879
going on your show

483
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,958
not many people know of your show it's

484
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,639
new that's how it goes new shows not a

485
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:03,919
big exposure not a big audience nobody

486
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,278
knows about you yet

487
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,198
people are listening to the show you say

488
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,360
you want to be as big as my show uh

489
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,399
come on my show tell us about your show

490
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,240
on my show

491
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,559
expose yourself don't expose yourself

492
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,159
keep your clothes on expose your show

493
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,239
to my audience and that way people can

494
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,078
hear you on my show and my audience will

495
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,680
hear you if i go on your show

496
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,278
uh chances are this is where it sounds

497
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,958
egotistical chances are your

498
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,720
small new audience knows of my bigger

499
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,159
show already so you're going to get more

500
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,920
benefit if you come here

501
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,278
and will spread you to a bigger audience

502
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,039
just a larger catapult

503
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,799
will get you going and then you can post

504
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,559
the episode where you're on my show

505
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,000
i'll give you permission to post that

506
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:39,679
episode on your feed

507
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,278
so you can get rosta jeff on your feed

508
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,958
have your interview up there you get

509
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,159
free content you get a whole new episode

510
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,000
for your feed that way

511
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,198
uh we call it a swap cast we both get a

512
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,120
show out of our time

513
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,639
works well we'll both get exposure but i

514
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,839
think that's the way to do it is get you

515
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,440
up here on my show

516
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
i'll make a little intro for it put the

517
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,519
music on and stuff make it look real

518
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,039
killer

519
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,480
uh but no offense to your show or

520
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,000
anything i just think that marketing

521
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,560
wise that is probably the better

522
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,600
strategery is to have you come be on the

523
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:06,319
show via zoom

524
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,120
uh something like that uh i think i hope

525
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,320
that works for you

526
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,679
uh by the way i'm gonna mention the name

527
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,720
of your show it says the show is called

528
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,319
talking buds

529
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,000
i'm gonna have to check that out for you

530
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,720
it says first episode wasn't great

531
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,639
quality

532
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,320
but it is all on the platforms if you

533
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,000
ever bored and want to check it out you

534
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,040
guys there's a new podcast out there

535
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,720
called talking buds with a z budz it's

536
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:25,759
on all of the platforms he says it's

537
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,040
poor quality

538
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,799
but you know what's cool about a poor

539
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:30,159
quality first podcast this means

540
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,479
you got [ __ ] plenty of room for

541
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:34,000
improvement if you put out that [ __ ]

542
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,278
number 10 on the first episode you

543
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,360
wouldn't have anything else to do you'd

544
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,278
have to keep putting out [ __ ] tens

545
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,680
and it's hard i put out like solid

546
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:43,198
eights nines i try for tens but

547
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,559
tens are i think tens are [ __ ] that's

548
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,319
that's doing something i put out eights

549
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,078
and nines every week twice a week

550
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
if it was a seven i re-record it i don't

551
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,399
you won't get a seven but don't be

552
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,278
upset with yourself about putting out a

553
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,039
sub par

554
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,559
first episode that's totally legit you

555
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,240
could do that ah

556
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,799
you got nowhere to go but up from there

557

632
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:10,798

633
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,798

634
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,720
cool long time fan of who

635
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,160
a long time fan who finally got the

636
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,200
opportunity to purchase some of your

637
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,960
genetics

638
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,600
i'm in week five a flower with the

639
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,600
golden goat s1 and i have noticed many

640
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,879
many of the leaves have a bud growing

641
00:18:23,599 --> 00:18:26,798
from the center

642
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,320
i know what you're talking about so he's

643
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,639
got golden goat s ones

644
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,918
that is a golden goat feminized seed he

645
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,600
said that he has got

646
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,840
uh is it leaves or buds let me make sure

647
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,599
which ones i've seen both of the leaves

648
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:39,359
have a bud growing from the center so

649
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:40,558
you've got a leaf so say your bud is

650
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,678
coming up here and you've got a leaf

651
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,200
coming out of the plant

652
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,038
and then there's where it spreads out it

653
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,798
makes the fingery leaf right about the

654
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,160
palm but facing up there's a little

655
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,558
nugget farming just one

656
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,759
calyx forming right there i've seen that

657
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:53,839
i think i know

658
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:55,599
a common denominator of when and why

659
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,279
that happens but let's keep reading

660
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:58,639
it says i was curious if this was a

661
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:01,038
mutation

662
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,720
that you had seen commonly i've never

663
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,079
seen this in the golden goat i've seen

664
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,759
this in jack the ripper

665
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,599
i've seen this in a few other strains

666
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,599
mostly uh sativa

667
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,359
tropical type varietals is where i've

668
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:14,079
seen it it says i've been growing her

669
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,879
organically using down to earth 444 for

670
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:17,599
veg and dr

671
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,520
earth 394 flower girl during flower

672
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,480
they're quite close to the whites

673
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,319
as i am very limited in a very limited

674
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,038
height area so i figured it could easily

675
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,038
be a stress

676
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:29,440
issue amazing podcast and incredible

677
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:31,440
work i can't wait to finally try

678
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,880
what i've heard so much about you know

679
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,400
i've never seen that happen

680
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,160
and it's weird if you've got multiple

681
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,519
phenotypes doing that

682
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,200
because that is something happening in

683
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,798
your room if it was just one plant

684
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,319
i would say that's a total anomaly in

685
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,679
the genetics you've got multiple plants

686
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,038
doing it in your room it's something

687
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,000
happening in there

688
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:50,000
honestly i think the reason for a plant

689
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,119
to spit out extra buds like that is

690
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,400
because it's

691
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:56,319
super happy with life it's like

692
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
bro i'm so happy those parts of the

693
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,359
plant that it's making are its

694
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,439
reproductive organs it's like

695
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,479
so happy i'm so horny and happy i'm

696
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,640
gonna make more

697
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,000
sex organs on different parts just so i

698
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,080
can get even hornier

699
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,759
and have more happy parts that's really

700
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:10,558
what i think is happening the plant is

701
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:12,640
so happy

702
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:14,399
it's like i've got so much light so much

703
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,720
nutrients everything is dialed in so

704
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,080
well

705
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
i'm just gonna make more buds for this

706
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:19,119
guy here you go it's trying to give you

707
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,720
more flowers

708
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:22,719
it's got so much energy it doesn't know

709
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,079
where to put those buds so it popped up

710
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
right there that's really what i think

711
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,399
is happening

712
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,919
there could be more of a scientific

713
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,200
answer that i'm unaware of but from when

714
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,919
i've seen this happen

715
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,360
it is always tropical sativa varietal

716
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,759
plants that were really

717
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,119
really happy so that's what i think is

718
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:38,798
happening i don't think it's a problem i

719
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,399
think you've got happy plants

720
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:42,158
so monkey i want to thank you for the

721
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,360
message i would like an update this was

722
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,120
sent a little bit back

723
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:47,678
i'd like to see how this crop is doing

724
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,199
how it went uh send me some pictures

725
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,120
uh send me an update on those golden

726
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,000
goat s ones i'd like to

727
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,599
likes to know how that went all right

728
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,038
i'm gonna get my voice together get my

729
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,839
thoughts together and we're gonna read

730
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,960
another email this one comes from i

731
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,480
don't know if they want their name said

732
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,038
it's got their full name here at the top

733
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,640
it says

734
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,480
hey my name is busy there we go they

735
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,880
gave us a good name feel free to use my

736
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,798
name and this entire email

737
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,400
thank you bro says i have a question

738
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,798
about types of pollen or

739
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,320
outcomes all right i love a good pollen

740
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:17,679
question breeding questions are some of

741
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,200
my favorites

742
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,798
i'll share a lot but i keep some to

743
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,440
myself this one is going to be good it

744
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:23,359
says

745
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,480
it's hard to explain but i will try my

746
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,319
best

747
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,919
i'm in it says i have a strawberry

748
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,079
banana female

749
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,640
so far i follow you i also have a

750
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,599
strawberry eclair female alright so you

751
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,759
like strawberry

752
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:37,519
flavored plants you like strawberry

753
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,519
banana strawberry eclair

754
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:42,240
sounds like [ __ ] i could get into it

755
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:44,319
says i plan on selfing each one to have

756
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,519
seeds to store for the future i follow

757
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,399
you so far

758
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,480
if i take pollen from the bubble gum cut

759
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,440
and add it to the a clear cut

760
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,480
with the phenol outcomes very much if i

761
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,880
would add pollen

762
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,839
in the opposite declared a bubble gum

763
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,159
seems like a silly

764
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,240
question but i would like to hear your

765
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,840
thoughts yes there will be variation

766
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:07,759
um depict and it just depends on the

767
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:08,319
dominance of the genetics that you're

768
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,759
using

769
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,000
so both of those plants have

770
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:13,038
grandparents or both those plants have

771
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,038
parents which are going to be

772
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,798
grandparents of your new offspring so

773
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,279
your strawberry eclair

774
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:19,839
and your strawberry banana have

775
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:21,119
different

776
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,399
there's a different at least one

777
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,519
different parent and they're possibly

778
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,038
two i don't know what the cross you got

779
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,440
the word strawberry in both of them

780
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,038
i'm going to assume there's one common

781
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,679
parent and then two different parents in

782
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:32,319
there

783
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,400
so different phenotypes of those plants

784
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,119
are going to show different expressions

785
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,440
then when you breed to them you may see

786
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,639
so

787
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,320
we took the grandparents the

788
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,120
grandparents we made the new parents we

789
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:43,038
crossed those

790
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,399
you may see these grandparents come up

791
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:46,319
in some phenotypes

792
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,159
depending on the way that you did it and

793
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,918
it all depends on which grandpa in which

794
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,840
grandma was more dominant and which

795
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,440
mommy and witch daddy was more dominant

796
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:54,000
so you've got the opportunity to see

797
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,080
this plant

798
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,240
this plant and these two plants on the

799
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,079
family tree so you can see mommy

800
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,759
and you can see mommy's grandparents and

801
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,558
you can see daddy and daddy's

802
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:04,720
grandparents

803
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,240
coming through some of those phenotypes

804
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,480
and it's all about

805
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,319
which plant had the genetics it's all

806
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,919
it's a gamble and a dice roll of which

807
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,038
way those genetics are going to land so

808
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,759
you will see

809
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,480
varying phenotypes depending on just how

810
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:18,879
those

811
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
genetics land it's kind of a gamble it's

812
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
like putting up a chart you get so many

813
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,880
attribute points on this chart and

814
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,480
they're going to fall

815
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,000
in so many ways you'll get a lot of

816
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,319
common things but then

817
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,480
you may see on one side you may see a

818
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,000
grandfather trait really heavily on the

819
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,000
other one you could see the grandmother

820
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,919
trait very heavily or you may not see

821
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,440
any of those traits there will be

822
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,679
variation yes

823
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,120
there will be variations so uh it says

824
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,480
seems like a silly question but i'd like

825
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:43,119
to hear your thoughts not a silly

826
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,720
question

827
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,239
at all i love it when people think about

828
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,519
breathing like that those are some of my

829
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,240
favorite questions

830
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,079
um you've just you've taken one

831
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,599
ingredient and another ingredient

832
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:54,960
and if you just if you mix things

833
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,158
different ways you're going to have

834
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,840
different outcomes yes

835
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,278
using the male one way you'll get

836
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,558
different resistance possibly a

837
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:01,359
different structure maybe different

838
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,678
aromas

839
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,798
just because that's what the male does

840
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,559
to the cross

841
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,240
or at least the pollen donor will do to

842
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:10,319
the cross and you'll unlock

843
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,839
recessive traits and traits from the

844
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,599
parents and grandparents like i keep

845
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,278
saying so you will see different things

846
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,359
uh let me get myself back on track it

847
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,278
says on a random note my buddy rasta

848
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,798

and everything is new and excited

859
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:38,079
exciting here since we went medical

860
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,599
that was a cool little family we did get

861
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:40,399
to meet up hung out in a parking lot for

862
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:42,079
a few minutes

863
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
got to share some love a bunch of dread

864
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,000
heads in a parking lot little tiny kids

865
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:47,678
with dreadlocks that was adorable uh

866
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,919
the whole family was dreads except mama

867
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,120
she said she used to have dreads but

868
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,640
she'll get them back i'm sure one day

869
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,000
she'll have dreadies again so shout out

870
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,559
to the dreadlock family that came and

871
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,119
hung out

872
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:58,558
also shout out to our friend busy uh

873
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,000
thanks for the great question

874
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,839
if you've got any more breeding

875
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,798
questions let me know something else i

876
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:04,558
want to talk about if you're going to

877
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:07,359
preserve these i would do them

878
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:09,200
uh do one plant for a reversal at a time

879
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,639
don't have two males in the same room in

880
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,080
the same house at the same time it'll

881
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,159
get sloppy there will be

882
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,918
pollen contamination you won't have the

883
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,799
breeding project you think you have

884
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,240
so reverse either that eclair or the

885
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:21,599
strawberry other one what was it

886
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,200
strawberry bubble gum

887
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,319
isn't that what you said where am i i

888
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
can't even read any more strawberry

889
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:27,439
banana

890
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,240
and strawberry eclair pick one reverse

891
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,159
it pollinate

892
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,440
both uh you can pollinate both at the

893
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,799
same time they'll both be in the room

894
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,320
put the male plant in the middle

895
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,400
just knock it back and forth pollinate

896
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,000
both plants then do the opposite next

897
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,679
time but do them at separate times

898
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,359
so you've got a clear idea of which is

899
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,000
who the baby daddy is we always want to

900
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,278
know who the baby

901
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,880
daddy we don't want to have to take

902
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,159
these plants to maury and figure out

903
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,159
what you did

904
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,440
all right so that is my advice uh thank

905
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,200
you for the great question

906
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,798
and i look forward to meeting you the

907
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,798
next time the dead crew

908
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,918
comes through from missouri i hope

909
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:57,839
things go well for you out there in

910
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:00,640
missouri as well good luck on the new

911
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:02,158
medical cannabis venture all right do we

912
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,600
have time for one more of course we've

913
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,760
got time for one more

914
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,359
let's jump into one more you know what

915
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,000
i've got a screenshot on my

916
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,759
phone that i wanted to read this is a

917
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,159
great question here we go

918
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:15,119
this one says who's this come from i

919
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,080
don't know if they want their name said

920
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:17,359
on the show so i'm going to keep that

921
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,038
private you know who you are thank you

922
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,000
for the great question it says

923
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,519
great show great genetics that's a way

924
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,519
to start a message to me

925
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:27,119
thank you great compliment it says i

926
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:28,000
love listening to your show rasta jeff

927
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,759
and i've got a quick

928
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,278
breeding question here we go again i

929
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,440
love the breeding questions

930
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,919
says after pollinating seeds are

931
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,759
starting do you change the nutrients or

932
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,880
the lighting i hear you should start up

933
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,400
veg newts again

934
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,400
i would like to know if there's any

935
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,759
truth to that

936
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,519
so that's a really good question this

937
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,400
one could keep me talking for quite a

938
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,119
few minutes

939
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,880
uh so he's got a crop that is seated now

940
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:52,239
at this point in time we are not growing

941
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,559
for flowers we don't want

942
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,079
buds with big beautiful flowers and

943
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,839
trichomes that's not what we're growing

944
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,399
for at this point this grower is growing

945
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,240
four

946
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,919
seeds we have now abandoned the idea of

947
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,919
seedless bud we're going

948
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,960
seeded but it's a whole new project so

949
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,559
at this point

950
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,240
yes i do recommend changing the

951
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,759
nutrients we need to focus a little bit

952
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,519
more on growth and not buds and

953
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:12,240
trichomes we're not making big fat buds

954
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,519
we're making

955
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,120
healthy seeds so i would replace the veg

956
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:19,038
the flowering nutrients and i would put

957
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,439
a vegetative nutrient in there

958
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:23,200
uh keep doing the calmag don't do the

959
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,038
bud boosters like you would normally do

960
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,120
instead of doing a bud booster add

961
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,640
amino acids amino acids are good

962
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,719
building blocks for life

963
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,000
so that's what i would do uh you may

964
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,600
need some calmag you're going to want to

965
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,159
keep that nitrogen going to keep the

966
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,918
plants

967
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,240
with a lot of energy a lot of vigor and

968
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,480
a lot of momentum and then uh

969
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,079
they may want to go a little bit longer

970
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,919
than you normally flower

971
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,278
so pay attention to the plants don't

972
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,559
start flushing as early

973
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:47,839
you don't need to worry as much about

974
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:49,440
flushing because we're not going to

975
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,720
consume these flowers anyway they're

976
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,080
going to be filled with seeds

977
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,919
by the time you get the seeds out of

978
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,720
there it's mostly just dust and trash

979
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,720
anyway

980
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,000
so i do change the feeding i continue

981
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,640
with the vegetative newts

982
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,359
i don't add bloom boosters i add amino

983
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,278
acids

984
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,639
i kind of increase the calmag based on

985
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,640
what i see the plants do

986
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,640
and then i pay a lot of attention to the

987
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,919
plants they're kind of they're pregnant

988
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,480
so you got to treat them like a pregnant

989
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,919
lady

990
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,839
their needs are going to change you have

991
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:17,679
to learn how to identify those needs

992
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:20,798
by watching the plants now for lighting

993
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,320
um there are a few things you can do if

994
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,879
you're an experienced grower

995
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,439
and you know what to watch for um you

996
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,399
can

997
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,000
change the lights i don't talk about

998
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:31,038
this a lot but here we go come down this

999
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,440
path with me

1000
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,798
uh the last two weeks of flower okay

1001
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,480
we'll do it for the last three weeks of

1002
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,200
a seeded crop you can turn your lights

1003
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,839
back on

1004
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,720
18 and 6 for the last a little bit of a

1005
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,119
seeded crop

1006
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,000
and it will help those seeds bulk up and

1007
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:45,439
speed up i do

1008
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
this earlier than i'm recommending

1009
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,159
because i'm very experienced with my

1010
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,360
plants i know what to look for i know

1011
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:50,480
how they're going to respond i know what

1012
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:52,398
they're going to do

1013
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,599
so like i said before we're not growing

1014
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,038
for pretty buds

1015
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,798
if you're not growing for buds if your

1016
00:28:55,038 --> 00:28:58,720
goal is seeds you can turn

1017
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,720
the time after pollination has happened

1018
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,079
after you see seeds forming the calyxes

1019
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,640
are swollen you know there's seeds in

1020
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:05,519
there

1021
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,200
turn the timer back to 18 6. the plants

1022
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:10,319
will begin to reveg

1023
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,159
in about 15 days 17 days you'll see

1024
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,000
re-vegetative growth happening on the

1025
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,520
plants don't be alarmed

1026
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,599
we don't care about the buds we care

1027
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,319
about the seeds tucked inside of those

1028
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:20,879
buds

1029
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,558
that extra light those extra photons

1030
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
that extra ppfd

1031
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,000
that extra energy is going to make the

1032
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,000
seeds grow

1033
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,519
with more vigor more quickly they'll get

1034
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,200
harder faster

1035
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,038
and they'll be done sooner and they'll

1036
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,519
be more healthy seeds i know this from

1037
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,000
experience this is how i speed up seeds

1038
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:39,839
so i think you can speed them up by

1039
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,240
putting the timer back to 18

1040
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:44,240
6. that is for seeded plants you can do

1041
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,679
it uh you can do it once you see the

1042
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,319
seeds are building up and getting kind

1043
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,759
of chunky

1044
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:49,599
that's when it is safe to do it put them

1045
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:51,038
on 18 6. let them go

1046
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,719
and then when you start seeing the seeds

1047
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:53,519
poking out of the calyxes on the tips of

1048
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,960
the buds

1049
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,639
pull a couple of them off and give them

1050
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,919
a squeeze how do they feel are they

1051
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,360
hollow do they crunch

1052
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,799
when you squeeze them does juice come

1053
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,398
out did that green thing come out did a

1054
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:03,679
little white embryo come out

1055
00:30:02,398 --> 00:30:05,678
see what's inside of that seed and

1056
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,120
you'll know when they are ripe sometimes

1057
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,880
you need to dig deeper into the bud

1058
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,759
sometimes the outer seeds aren't the

1059
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,760
best seeds

1060
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,119
sometimes those get roasted by the light

1061
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,919
sometimes you touch them or something

1062
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:15,519
you kill them

1063
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,360
get a seed from the inside of the bud

1064
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,879
see if it's nice and hard that is when

1065
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,119
it is time to harvest so

1066
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,520
you can change the light cycle back to

1067
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,519
18 6 at the end of the flowering period

1068
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,200
for your seeded crop to help them get

1069
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,440
chunkier and faster

1070
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,200
and harder at a quicker rate all right

1071
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,880
that is my breeding advice for you

1072
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,319
that was a golden tip i don't share that

1073
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,120
with a lot of people so don't tell

1074
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,038
anybody

1075
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:38,479
