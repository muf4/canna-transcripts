138
00:04:52,680 --> 00:05:02,939

142
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:11,189
episodes into this podcast I haven't

143
00:05:09,689 --> 00:05:13,740
missed a week in two and a half years

144
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:16,069
every month as a podcast to listen to in

145
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:23,310
some Thursday's it's been incredible

146
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:24,689
I've been running 20 episodes nice I was

147
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:26,430
honored to be on one of those episodes

148
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:28,290
you guys we did a I call it a swap cast

149
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,720
I learned the phrase swap cast from Doug

150
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:32,730
Stanhope but it's when two podcasters

151
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,170
come together and record one podcast and

152
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:35,730
then they both put it up on their feed

153
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:37,800
so that everybody gets exposed to both

154
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:39,360
shows at the same time I did one of

155
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,620
those with the Colorado a podcast make

156
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,420
sure you check it out it was good fun

157
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,310
it's a little bit of chaos but it is a

158
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,230
great show listen to it on their feed so

159
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:48,360
that they get to click so you guys yeah

160
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,009
the Colorado podcast page and listen to

161
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,620
that episode on their feed because they

162
00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:54,659
can use the traffic we post them up

163
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,040
we've got some internet problems so

164
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,630
there's some website problems at the

165
00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:00,210
moment so I'm not sure they'll be able

166
00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,620
to find that difficulties mate well this

167
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:03,779
episode won't come out for a few days so

168

work on that

171
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:10,889
before yeah all right I was I was gonna

172
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:13,800
say I'm excited because episode 150 it

173
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:15,750
has been confirmed episode 150 is going

174

176
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:20,399

cool way for a karma to land on us

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,400

what's in each of these little vials you

216
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:33,598
got here we got critical mass critical

217
00:07:29,728 --> 00:07:39,060
mass Terps just to the rod distillate

218
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:40,620
this is the ovm ovm orange orange

219
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:42,060
vanilla milano shout out to the garden

220
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,889
of Weeden for an amazing breeding

221
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:46,050
project that was his first run Chuck and

222
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:50,280
pollen and those [ __ ] that strain came

223
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,319
out amazing yeah yeah I had 12 females

224
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:53,579
of it so I don't know how much he's

225
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,399
growing it out but I could tell him a

226
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:58,889
little about it I could use a pack of

227
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:02,129
those Spence some of them what's this

228
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:04,650
last one here that is gorilla glue

229
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,658
gorilla glue raw Terps so you guys have

230
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:08,399
figured out how to take a plant a

231
00:08:06,658 --> 00:08:10,050
cannabis plant probably takes more than

232
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,810
one plan but take a large batch of

233
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:15,569
cannabis and extract the terpenoids from

234
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,579
that specific batch that one plant and

235
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:18,129
then you can get the essence the flavor

236
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:19,870
via

237
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:21,670
the taste you can get it all in your

238
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:23,829
face and all in your palate just with

239
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,819
one little droplet on a dab and it's

240
00:08:23,829 --> 00:08:27,180
amazing

241
00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:31,569
it can actually be overwhelming it is

242
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:35,019
that some require far far less than a

243
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:37,779
droplet Durbin poisoned dad's over very

244
00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:39,129
very little very little I overdone it on

245
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,288
some that I took the other night and it

246
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:43,509
was just too much that was way too much

247
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:46,629
Durbin poison on there this this glue

248
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:48,220
was like okay really overwhelming I

249
00:08:46,629 --> 00:08:50,439
really think the terpenes are really

250
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,200
contributing to my high also it makes me

251
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,760
skyrocket to that next level that became

252
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,520
crystal clear when I started playing

253
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:59,409
with the distillate in the Terps it's

254
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:02,129
you're taking the same THC but cereal

255
00:08:59,409 --> 00:09:05,049
and when you add it just something like

256
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:07,059
the critical mass you go one way hard

257
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:09,129
when you add it to something like the

258
00:09:07,059 --> 00:09:11,799
Durbin you know the other way we are oh

259
00:09:09,129 --> 00:09:14,470
yeah and you're not changing the THC

260
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,969
content right it's the other parts of

261
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,160
the plant that really shaped that on

262
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:20,529
that entourage effects this interesting

263
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,389
effect what Gupta talked about yes it's

264
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:24,579
exactly evident and when we're using the

265
00:09:22,389 --> 00:09:25,629
Terps like this yeah dude good job

266
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,100
you're kind of your company's

267
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:28,149
experimenting give your company a shout

268
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,190
out so that we can hype them up a little

269
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,019
bit it's the Uncle Bud company the Uncle

270
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,550
Bud company based in Pueblo Colorado you

271
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,740
guys we were pulling raw Terps out here

272
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:38,500
in Pueblo Colorado can I have no - you

273
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:42,490
know zero THC Enys terpenoids zero to

274
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,919
your lab proven zero THC yeah so these

275
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:46,110
it would not be hypothetically I'm not

276
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:48,250
gonna do this don't [ __ ] ask

277
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,019
hypothetically we could make these

278
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:52,919
available nationwide because there are

279
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:55,659
no cannabinoids in there yes awesome

280
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,349
diverting it out of metric is a whole

281
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,899
nother story

282
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,519
right right making them so it's it's

283
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:02,769
virtually impossible for that to leave

284
00:10:00,519 --> 00:10:04,750
the Colorado marijuana enforcement

285
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,819
tracking system that is stuck you're not

286
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:09,610
gonna get it you guys well as it can

287
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,640
store once you once if you purchase it

288
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:15,220
in a store if there's no THC they can it

289
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,899
travel yes I would believe so yes that

290
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:18,519
was also my assumption is there's

291
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:20,559
nothing that's terpenoids terpenoids are

292
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,970
not illegal it's a glass vial you're

293
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,979
gonna spend a lot of time explaining

294
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,870
that I just smells like weed officer

295
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:26,909
stop hating me good vitamin cottage get

296
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:29,940
yourself some [ __ ]

297
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:32,279
theoretically it's also legal to ship in

298
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:34,620
the mail I wasn't gonna go there just

299
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,689
but yeah theoretically since it's just

300
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,669
her Pinoys I mean you can buy chirping

301
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,110
noise bought vials of liquid in the mail

302
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:46,829
that's that's the thing they're big on

303
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:49,200
well I wouldn't folks but if there's

304
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,150
really no THC in it I think there's a

305
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,200
loop here to be played with if necessary

306
00:10:51,149 --> 00:10:53,399
there's actually a whoa

307
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,530
we might got too hot there's a website

308
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,610
called just chirps calm or something

309
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,649
similar to that where you can purchase

310
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:00,600
terpenoids you can buy limonene you can

311
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:02,209
buy all of the terpenoids separately is

312
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,190
that the big pretty we live scene

313
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:06,420
probably but those Terps are not derived

314
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,430
from cannabis those are pulled from

315
00:11:06,419 --> 00:11:11,129
things like bananas and roses and

316
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:13,409
oranges and other fruits this is just

317
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,570
the Terps and you would people that are

318
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:17,069
not able to smoke this quality cannabis

319
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:19,050
would be able they'd have to get some

320
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,090
dad's or some distillate or something to

321
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:22,679
carry it you can probably put this in it

322
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,509
like a vape pen cartridge you can mix

323
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,489
that up with some VG some vegetable

324
00:11:24,509 --> 00:11:30,000
glycol or something all day long all day

325
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:32,610
we've tried it yes it's actually pretty

326
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,779
amazing it makes a vaping a little less

327
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,159

so outdoor growing yeah there's probably

400
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:51,210
about three weeks into flower you should

401
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,679
start seeing the pistols the calyx

402
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:54,660
pistols are starting to form on your

403
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:56,338
plants those little you guys call them

404
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:57,809
hares the white hairs those are popping

405
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,060
up on your plants if you've got girls

406
00:14:57,809 --> 00:15:03,059
those are popping up something super

407
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:05,489
important and hypercritical your boy

408
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,079
plants need to be [ __ ] pulled by now

409
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:09,210
walk through your garden look for boys

410
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,910
look for hermaphrodites get rid of that

411
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:14,250
[ __ ] because how far can Paul and travel

412
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:16,769
at least four miles or so it's very far

413
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,960
yeah I don't I don't want everybody's

414
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:20,549
crop getting pollinated because your Wow

415
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,930
excuse me I just let it a full solid

416
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:23,459
burp on the podcast I was read I don't

417
00:15:21,929 --> 00:15:25,379
need everybody's crap getting pollinated

418
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,028
because you're too lazy to pull a male

419
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:28,320
plant out of your garden so go outside

420
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:29,939
pull the male plants if you haven't

421
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,230
already done it you might be [ __ ] up

422
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,510
already I talked about it on another

423
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,399
episode of how quickly male plants drop

424
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:37,860
pollen I've got a male plant another

425
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,689
room right over there he is like 15 days

426
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,210
in and he has just blast and pollen

427
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,830
right now so it only takes 15 or 16 days

428
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:47,370
for serious trouble to start happening

429
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:49,830
yep doesn't take long I've actually I've

430
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:54,330
known a amateur breeder that pollinated

431
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:58,560
his neighbor's grow that was less safe

432
00:15:54,330 --> 00:16:01,500
400 500 feet away oh man with with trees

433
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:03,569
fences houses all kinds of pollen is

434
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,399
amazing yeah that's its whole purpose of

435
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,900
life is to just land on the female plant

436
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:10,049
and climb up that pistol and get up in

437
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:12,088
there wants to get in the ovule there's

438
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:14,099
a couple of places that have passed

439
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:17,400
special rules keeping hemp and marijuana

440
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,120
grows like five or six miles away just

441
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:23,850
to make sure that there's never a legal

442
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,830
war between like the big hammer hit the

443
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,159
big marijuana yeah I totally know a

444
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:30,490
solution to that

445
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:33,549
I would I would grow my sensimilla of

446
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,990
grow right next to em field are you

447
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:37,179
willing to expose your secret on the

448
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:38,889
podcast I think I know you told me the

449
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:40,208
way you told me we tell us on the show

450
00:16:38,889 --> 00:16:42,009
or do you have to keep that a secret him

451
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,568
plants only pollinate once a year or

452
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:49,139
they only release pollen once a year

453
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:53,860
okay so plan your your your bloom cycles

454
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:55,930
accordingly if you can yeah but also

455
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,850
most Tim promoters like to grow from

456
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:59,620
clones well there's a significant other

457
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,420
ways you can protect your own grow from

458
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,470
the next the guy next door who doesn't

459
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:05,500
know the difference between a male and a

460
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,759
female you just got a it's part of the

461
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,798
planning in the research you should have

462
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,088
done by now or he should have done he

463
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:11,980
should not have a male out there outside

464
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:13,448
in the first place I actually know a

465
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,949
couple breeders in California to do

466
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:19,779
everything outdoors and I just shake my

467
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:20,949
heads at them so you'll be getting buds

468
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,178
right about now you'll start seeing the

469
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:26,169
bud sights it's time to get in there and

470
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:27,490
kind of take off that lower [ __ ] yeah

471
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:28,600
screwed him up shave the legs in there

472
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:30,009
you guys get in there and clean off all

473
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:31,449
the lower canopy where the air is not

474
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:32,980
getting in something where like a little

475
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,240
squirrel could get help climbing up the

476
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,929
little ladder at the bottom take that

477
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,460
off of there

478
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:38,409
all that stuff that's gonna hang down

479
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,720
and touch the dirt get get rid of that

480
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:42,490
all those little sucker branches just a

481
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,350
little thin pale yellow branches that

482
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:45,669
are just shooting up take all those off

483
00:17:44,349 --> 00:17:47,678
you don't need those go clean up the

484
00:17:45,669 --> 00:17:48,909
inside a little bit you want to focus on

485
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,500
the tops of the plants that's where all

486
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,070
the magic is gonna happen so clean them

487
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,440
up a little bit

488
00:17:51,069 --> 00:17:54,730
follow them out yeah hollow him out a

489
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,900
little bit pull them apart and spread

490
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,460
them if you can if you need to get a

491
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,990
giant stick and stick it in the dirt and

492
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,279
pull one branch this way in one branch

493
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:02,200
this way so that they're getting Sun

494
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:04,418
properly feel free to do it they could

495
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,940
take a beating go out into your grow

496
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:09,640
around noon one o'clock when the sun's

497
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:12,640
really high in the sky and everything

498
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:17,140
that's not getting direct sunlight right

499
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,059
then and there you know that's that kind

500
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,788
of use that as a guide of what to take

501
00:18:19,058 --> 00:18:23,048
off so it's you know I mean not

502
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:25,808
everything's gonna be getting full

503
00:18:23,048 --> 00:18:27,819
sunlight but you know things that are

504
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:30,069
just in the dark you know at the bottom

505
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:31,808
you know you can take that off things

506
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:34,029
that are you know a little further down

507
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:35,460
the side or bud sites that are further

508
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:37,288
down the side

509
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,669
they may not be getting full sunlight

510
00:18:37,288 --> 00:18:41,429
but they're still getting sunlight leave

511
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:43,740
those there so you know just judge

512
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:46,278
accordingly but all that all that dark

513
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,839
stuff you definitely take that off

514
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:49,980
that's gonna be lower fee yeah yeah you

515
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:51,178
don't want to turn that and unless

516
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,500
you're making a bunch of hash and then I

517
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,759
mean maybe you leave that if you want to

518
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:56,940
but it's gonna take away from the energy

519
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:58,558
up top yeah all right so stretch face

520
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,360
should be just about over right we've

521
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,678
about the first three weeks we really

522
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:03,658
start stretching that should be slowing

523
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,519
down now so we can see kind of how big

524
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,778
our plants are actually gonna be gonna

525
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,220
get a judgement of how tall they're

526
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:13,558
gonna be how much panicking you need to

527
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:15,089
do on readjusting defense yeah well

528
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:16,349
people are growing crazy outdoor plants

529
00:19:15,089 --> 00:19:17,609
here in Pueblo and it's completely

530
00:19:16,349 --> 00:19:18,959
illegal to grow outside in Pueblo

531
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:20,189
Colorado is bad but there are people

532
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,870
that are doing it they're just building

533
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,120
a higher fence every week I see him like

534
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,288
had to put more plywood up I spotted

535
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:28,109
another one today there was an old

536
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:33,450
school giant back TV set prop to gets to

537
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:34,949
gate on the outside it's that time of

538
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:36,960
year you guys there it's gonna be all

539
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:38,220
over Pueblo you guys if you're growing

540
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,750
outdoors this year and someone tries to

541
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,640
steal your [ __ ] don't [ __ ] shoot them

542
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,798
grow more weed next year do we have to

543
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,480
do this episode every year but just it's

544
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:46,558
just we just let it go yeah it's

545
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,028
happened here though somebody got shot

546
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:50,009
trying to steal somebody's cannabis

547
00:19:48,028 --> 00:19:51,808
outdoors and that medicine that was

548
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:53,369
supposed to be medicine became a target

549
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:55,079
of theft which became an attempted

550
00:19:53,369 --> 00:19:56,579
homicide which [ __ ] that we don't need

551
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:58,048
that vibe attached to this plant at all

552
00:19:56,579 --> 00:20:00,058
that's why we tried to make it legal

553
00:19:58,048 --> 00:20:01,980
that's why we wanted safely accessible

554
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:03,928
so nobody's getting shot over the [ __ ]

555
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,909
we took it away from the cartels but in

556
00:20:03,929 --> 00:20:08,610
the hands of the medical community let's

557
00:20:05,909 --> 00:20:12,860
deal right yes it is not justifiable it

558
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:16,048
instantly makes it into criminal

559
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:18,869
criminal enterprise yeah yes no you're

560
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,220
protecting your illegal crop yes yeah

561
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:21,178
don't shoot anybody please you guys if

562
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:22,769
you're listening to this you're probably

563
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:24,240
not gonna shoot everybody you know

564
00:20:22,769 --> 00:20:26,398
peaceful cool ass people is why you're

565
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,450
listening to my show so stretch face is

566
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:30,239
over you're gonna start seeing what size

567
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:31,679
plants are don't pop don't top anymore

568
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,909
I'm glad but that's one of the next

569
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,230
things I had written down is no more

570
00:20:32,909 --> 00:20:35,940
chopping the hormones and the plants

571
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:37,259
have all decided where the tops of those

572
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,058
plants are gonna be and where they need

573
00:20:37,259 --> 00:20:40,679
to bake the most energy where they need

574
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:42,808
to send the THC where they need to send

575
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,220
all the energy for budding quit topping

576
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,200
them no more topping you can kind of

577
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,259
bend them you can stretch them down but

578
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,640
don't cut anymore

579
00:20:47,259 --> 00:20:50,710
off the tops of the plant so you take

580
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,450
all that bottom [ __ ] freely but the tops

581
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,630
where the hormones have climbed up don't

582
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,940
take that off of there no more topping

583
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,900
is it time now to adjust the nutrients

584
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:02,110
that we're feeding them

585
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,640
yeah for sure probably you know

586
00:21:02,109 --> 00:21:06,779
especially by the time this comes out

587
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:10,990
but yeah last week most definitely now

588
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:13,059
but yeah go for it we can put this out

589
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,839
we could put this out Monday morning out

590
00:21:13,059 --> 00:21:19,119
outdoor plants they'll use a little more

591
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:22,059
nitrogen then indoor plants will through

592
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,069
the bloom cycle so keep that in mind you

593
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:28,210
know keep that bottle of bloom or I mean

594
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:30,220
bottle grow around the way I do it is

595
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,380
I'd probably just if I felt they needed

596
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,529
a little extra nitrogen shot I just mix

597
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:39,250
up some some grow and maybe a little cow

598
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:41,619
mag and feed that in addition to a

599
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,450
normal feed so okay so add it on top of

600
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:45,969
what's normally feeding you know I saw

601
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:48,370
sub cool take a bottle of nutrients and

602
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,049
pour it directly onto the soil on his

603
00:21:48,369 --> 00:21:52,059
outdoor grow and then just watered it in

604
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:53,559
I wouldn't recommend that but I saw that

605
00:21:52,059 --> 00:21:56,440
[ __ ] and it made me shake my head like

606
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:57,759
some cool really did that bro like one

607
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,259
of the most reputable growers who could

608
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,509
find on the Internet and that dude just

609
00:21:59,259 --> 00:22:03,940
poured a bottle of a nutrient I won't

610
00:22:01,509 --> 00:22:06,789
even use straight onto the dirt and then

611
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:08,350
watered it in just fine you know the sub

612
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,879
cool is kind of kind of from the south a

613
00:22:08,349 --> 00:22:11,469
little bit he's got that southern flavor

614
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:15,150
to him so he doesn't give two shits most

615
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,150
of the time I'll hold my tongue on this

616
00:22:16,049 --> 00:22:19,599
time to adjust the feet he might want to

617
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,769
keep Jessie made a really good point

618
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:21,909
that I didn't think about these outdoor

619
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,349
plants are gonna use a little more

620
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:25,269
nitrogen than what we're used to so

621
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:27,279
increase your nitrogen feed if you're

622
00:22:25,269 --> 00:22:29,019
not gonna be a bottle fed nutrient kind

623
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,879
of guy what kind of stuff can we add to

624
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:36,480
top dress to get a little more nitrogen

625
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,970
yeah now we're talking some neem ill

626
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,809
seabird guano is a great all-purpose

627
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:46,049
guano if if that's your thing I've quit

628
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:48,549
using it but I had a [ __ ] ton of it so

629
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:51,829
it's not going anywhere I gotta use it

630
00:22:48,549 --> 00:22:55,190
up I'm just not gonna buy any more but

631
00:22:51,829 --> 00:22:56,480
seabird guano gives you PKM nitrogen so

632
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,070
it's a real good one

633
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,620
there's something about whatever they're

634
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:02,359
eating the fish and the kelp that's in

635
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:04,579
that I think that really adds to the

636
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:06,289
flavor and the funky smell of good cushy

637
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:08,839
but I think help and seabird guano

638
00:23:06,289 --> 00:23:11,329
really contribute I love oh

639
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:14,000
ocean products may make the best tasting

640
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:17,119
but in my pantry I've done began acai

641
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,869
have done you know the bone mills and

642
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:24,979
blood mills I'm everything and that's I

643
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:29,179
love my little my ocean style you know

644
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:32,329
kelp and crab shell mill seabird guano

645
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:34,880
works good with it yeah it's I like the

646
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:38,929
product SEAPLEX from organic hair

647
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,540
definitely as it's a cold-pressed blue

648
00:23:38,930 --> 00:23:42,799
algae based product product and it makes

649
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:45,470
I think it makes the buds taste better

650
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,940
smell better they get more density and I

651
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:48,259
think there's something else in there

652
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,059
that just makes them grow better

653
00:23:48,259 --> 00:23:52,490
whatever is happening in that kelp that

654
00:23:50,059 --> 00:23:54,200
life that's in that kiln makes my plants

655
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:57,170
happier who definitely knows I'm a

656
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,330
little boost helps the fastest growing

657
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:02,000
plant on the face of the planet so yeah

658
00:23:59,329 --> 00:24:05,809
there's all kinds of natural PTR's going

659
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:10,339
on there okay it works is I yes I know

660
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:19,399
toxins and cytokinins yeah auxins and

661
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:20,839
cytokinins yeah yeah yeah yeah some of

662
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,410
this stuff is not for everybody so

663
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:27,519
here's a quick little kelp kelp is also

664
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,529
a great bloom booster so you can take

665
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,359
kelp take put it in a mason and say

666
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:34,730
quart mason jar put a cup of kelp in

667
00:24:32,359 --> 00:24:39,559
there go ahead and top it off with water

668
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:41,539
let it rehydrate for 24 hours strain any

669
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:44,690
extra water away if there is a little

670
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:47,389
bit run that kelp through your food

671
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:51,470
processor and that'll turn it into just

672
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:53,360
a mush at that point you can it

673
00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:55,850
dissolves into water and you can follow

674
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,619
your spray it as a bloom booster right

675
00:24:55,849 --> 00:25:00,199
there on your plant and then store it in

676
00:24:57,619 --> 00:25:02,178
your refrigerator

677
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,460
in the back keep it as cold as possible

678
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:06,710
so that'll definitely make your plants

679
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:09,319
happy yeah would you add any fulvic acid

680
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:11,149
to that spray that wouldn't hurt a bit

681
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:13,730
but make it a little more absorbable

682
00:25:11,148 --> 00:25:15,739
that's probably the recipe to a lot of

683
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:18,798
organic gluten booster sent them are why

684
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:20,000
they're alive Yeah right there any

685
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:21,918
foliar that you're spraying has got

686
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,480
kalpen is there so silica acid naturally

687
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,009
in cup like that it's over this high

688
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,500
silica acid comes in there's a little

689
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:29,569
bit but most of that or the big source

690
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,369
of that is ala beer that's really

691
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:35,168
popular right now yeah you could easily

692
00:25:31,369 --> 00:25:37,518
add some aloe vera into that and that's

693
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:42,169
am I actually going to do that let's

694
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:49,128
really history thank you we just made a

695
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:50,659
new products that's went up here did

696
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:54,168
micro were brain that's in my grower

697
00:25:50,659 --> 00:25:55,730
brain yeah yeah see back in the day we

698
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:57,049
were taught not to take too many notes

699
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,399
because if your door got kicked in and

700
00:25:57,048 --> 00:26:00,109
there were notes that said feed on week

701
00:25:58,398 --> 00:26:01,908
six feet on week seven you just left a

702
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:03,109
paper trail in your handwriting you had

703
00:26:01,909 --> 00:26:05,509
to have those plants in there with no

704
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:09,229
[ __ ] notes and a good memory yep yeah

705
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:11,269
it was harder that time at that time so

706
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,829
many things changed in legalization and

707
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:15,339
that's just one of the really nice ones

708
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:19,609
that she not everyone even gets to see

709
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:22,069
[ __ ] I was scared to look at it on the

710
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:23,869
internet even like even to Google or

711
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:27,069
back then it was like Yahoo or American

712
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:30,079
were you part of over overgrow calm I

713
00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:32,089
was way too scared to ever ask questions

714
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,038
or post on it but I totally read totally

715
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:35,509
trolled it look at it alright yeah I

716
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:37,250
used to go look and all that good stuff

717
00:26:35,509 --> 00:26:39,019
I used to make up fake accounts on other

718
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,288
sites and just go look like that before

719
00:26:39,019 --> 00:26:43,638
I was supposed to be doing it like

720
00:26:41,288 --> 00:26:45,378
cannabis culture magazine had a really

721
00:26:43,638 --> 00:26:47,178
good one too after they shut down and

722
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:51,428
over girl a lot of the people from there

723
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:54,379
went and that's I got into the forums

724
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:55,909
years later when I got my med card I was

725
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:58,369
like [ __ ] this but once I had my med

726
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:00,409
cards game the [ __ ] on yeah I think uh

727
00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:03,739
and a lot of people may argue with me I

728
00:27:00,409 --> 00:27:07,129
think that the OG Kush the og and OG

729
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:08,868
Kush could be og from overgrow calm cuz

730
00:27:07,128 --> 00:27:10,668
if you met somebody from overgrow they'd

731
00:27:08,868 --> 00:27:11,449
just say are you [ __ ] Jesse from og

732
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:12,380
and you

733
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:14,028
because you wouldn't want to say

734
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:15,260
overgrow because if it wasn't you then I

735
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:20,179
mean I just [ __ ] up they like from

736
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:22,429
what we just called it oh gee are you

737
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:24,980
guys all on Ogier what come on over girl

738
00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:27,409
calm and so I think that people were

739
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:29,000
shipping seeds around like one guy had a

740
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:30,440
seed and he shipped some of them to

741
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,089
Jesse and then Jesse grew him and found

742
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,679
the phenotype he liked and bred to that

743
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,939
and then shipped those seeds to somebody

744
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,230
and I think that somebody ended up with

745
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:41,269
a bag of seeds and they call it to

746
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:42,769
overgrow cush there's so many stories of

747
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:45,740
where the OG Kush came from that's one

748
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:47,990
of the ones that I mean that's kind of

749
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,769
an adaptive adapt Jase you know of

750
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:55,038
another one I've heard okay that's that

751
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:57,558
one and then the one that involves the

752
00:27:55,038 --> 00:28:00,259
bubba kush guy yeah Matt from Florida

753
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:01,849
that's kind of the same I mean it kind

754
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:04,638
of falls in there but that's the - I

755
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:06,558
tend to believe personally okay yeah

756
00:28:04,638 --> 00:28:08,000
there are plenty of other stories of how

757
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,490
that happened I don't even bring up the

758
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,880
podcast I've heard them on hasn't the oh

759
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:15,769
geez I have I yeah I love oh gee I love

760
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,059
some good OG my Jeff Shoji has got some

761
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:18,319
flavor to it there will be some Jeff

762
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:19,579
Shoji available on the shelf at the

763
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,528
store pretty soon here that John

764
00:28:19,579 --> 00:28:22,129
Randall's jr. trimmed up for us it looks

765
00:28:21,528 --> 00:28:24,500
delicious

766
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:27,200
so we're top dressing with nitrogen

767
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:30,138
heavy products how about some ah no I

768
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,909
mean the atom in there okay Adam yeah

769
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:33,379
alright but don't go too hard yeah you

770
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:36,049
want to hit hard with your your P's and

771
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,600
K's peas and K's now yeah I remember it

772
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:41,000
takes a week to two weeks on a typical

773
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:46,788
top dress for it to break down enough to

774
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,798
be up take a bull by the plant so Rick

775
00:28:46,788 --> 00:28:51,308
plan ahead and you know that's if you do

776
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:54,589
it right now we're in the morning

777
00:28:51,308 --> 00:28:56,269
whatever it is you know that's not gonna

778
00:28:54,589 --> 00:29:00,619
really take effect for at least a week

779
00:28:56,269 --> 00:29:02,750
so think about that plant is already

780
00:29:00,619 --> 00:29:04,668
yellowing you're chasing it by now yeah

781
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,308
yeah see you sure that you should have

782
00:29:04,669 --> 00:29:11,269
done more nitrogen already so next year

783
00:29:07,308 --> 00:29:12,829
do more yeah yeah and I would still add

784
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:14,870
nitrogen to keep it from getting worse

785
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:17,798
and that'll help your buds develop it'll

786
00:29:14,869 --> 00:29:19,719
keep everything moving alright other

787
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:23,019
top dresses though knee mill is a

788
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:26,470
favorite of mine crab mill is good for

789
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:28,028
blue ink and then kelp I mean most

790
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:30,579
organic bloom boosters are made out of

791
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:32,470
kelp so that's really where you want to

792
00:29:30,579 --> 00:29:34,749
go do you mess with the Quran Jamil oh

793
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:38,829
yeah yeah okay that's the neem a lime

794
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:41,110
mix I use it's okay great mix that'll

795
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:43,298
keep most bugs out of the soil most bugs

796
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:45,189
off the plants and you'll never notice

797
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:47,378
it when the finished product all right

798
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:48,700
so let's talk about defoliating because

799
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:50,738
at this point of the season it's time to

800
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:52,480
clean up a bunch of the leaves do you

801
00:29:50,739 --> 00:29:55,778
like to heavily defoliate or do you just

802
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,868
kind of clean them up I'm more of a

803
00:29:55,778 --> 00:30:00,128
cleanup guy on outdoors I get in there I

804
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:02,079
get in there and clean them the [ __ ] up

805
00:30:00,128 --> 00:30:03,579
on an inner core I'll take off a lot of

806
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:04,868
leaves to where people look at you like

807
00:30:03,579 --> 00:30:06,278
you're crazy but then they come back a

808
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:08,918
week ten days later and all the leaves

809
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:10,509
are back and they can't even tell I

810
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,059
actually have a plan I'm gonna try it on

811
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:15,700
this year I've got three of the same

812
00:30:13,058 --> 00:30:17,408
strains planted in a row so the one in

813
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,319
the middle they're all about the same

814
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:22,649
size the women get tortured yeah what

815
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:24,608
strain do you have Northern Lights the

816
00:30:22,648 --> 00:30:27,069
old-school Northern Lights number five

817
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:28,778
the cut that goes around in four shops

818
00:30:27,069 --> 00:30:30,819
quite a bit that the limits been spread

819
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:32,558
- yeah nice it's a good cut I had that

820
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:34,989
for a little bit that's the code I made

821
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,028
uh my grape OG with - oh that's a great

822
00:30:34,989 --> 00:30:39,429
cut make some donkey dicks for buds for

823
00:30:37,028 --> 00:30:39,849
sure yeah make some huge huge [ __ ]

824
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:42,009
buds

825
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:44,319
alright so defoliant up in there

826
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,970
basically any leaf that looks like it's

827
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,349
gonna be blocking a bud site from

828
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:48,608
getting sunlight just go ahead and pull

829
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:50,168
that [ __ ] off and it's gonna grow back

830
00:30:48,608 --> 00:30:51,730
because it's an outdoor plant and you're

831
00:30:50,169 --> 00:30:53,559
gonna be amazed at how quickly the

832
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:55,089
leaves grow back yeah you'll pull off a

833
00:30:53,558 --> 00:30:56,470
leaf the size of your hand and in ten

834
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:59,408
days you'll have one back bigger than

835
00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:01,960
your head for sure it is grow and grow

836
00:30:59,409 --> 00:31:03,159
they love the outdoors alright so we've

837
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,629
talked about feeding a little bit we

838
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:07,179
talked a little bit about top dressing

839
00:31:04,628 --> 00:31:09,128
we talked about defoliating you

840
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:11,800
mentioned specifically that we need to

841
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:16,869
talk about caterpillar prevention

842
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:18,609
so this is the time it happens every

843
00:31:16,869 --> 00:31:21,939
year you know what do we do to get rid

844
00:31:18,609 --> 00:31:24,699
of caterpillars and they've already got

845
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,440
full-blown or full-grown caterpillars

846
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,840
inside your fully developed bud your

847
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,029
[ __ ] there's nothing you can do aside

848
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:32,459
from just manually picking through and

849
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:35,589
pulling them out yourself

850
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:40,420
now now yeah it sucks

851
00:31:35,589 --> 00:31:42,039
yeah now is the time to apply those

852
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,259
preventative things that will keep them

853
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:50,319
away and you're gonna have to spray your

854
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:53,329
bud sites spraying your sorry

855
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:56,419
I just heard voices in my head jump

856
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:56,419
[Music]

857
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:03,580
trying to fix it but you fix yourself

858
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:06,069
you're good you need some buds ight for

859
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:08,409
that BT to be on to to ward off the

860
00:32:06,069 --> 00:32:11,740
parent from laying the egg in there in

861
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:15,990
the first place so BT is what I

862
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,990
recommend that's like Captain Jack's

863
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:23,409
Monterey Spray okay back back c-lister

864
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,390
cider but sillas thuringiensis yeah i

865
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,340
think i think i should google that you

866
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:31,509
keep talking i'll google that one that's

867
00:32:27,339 --> 00:32:34,750
what I recommend for for getting rid of

868
00:32:31,509 --> 00:32:38,609
any kind of bud warm and now is the time

869
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:40,960
to apply it so also the garlic oil

870
00:32:38,609 --> 00:32:45,009
ferment that you were talking about yeah

871
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,539
it's very good for that too even just a

872
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:49,629
central garlic oil from the health food

873
00:32:46,539 --> 00:32:52,389
store would probably have some of the

874
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:55,930
same properties in it right there yes

875
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:59,380
it's bacillus thuringiensis I was really

876
00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:01,029
close so yes that's that's available

877
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,330
from Captain Jack's it's available in

878
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:06,430
Monterey Spray it's a very very popular

879
00:33:03,329 --> 00:33:07,899
product used for keeping away insects

880
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:10,180
and it's also usable you can use it in

881
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:13,320
the soil it will not cause any problems

882
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:15,490
the mosquito dunks that you buy and

883
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,779
whatever Lowe's or Home Depot it's

884
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:18,339
that's the main ingredient in there you

885
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:19,839
can crush those up you can put that in

886
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:21,159
some water you can water that directly

887
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:22,689
into your soil that will get rid of your

888
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,808
fungus gnats that'll get rid of most

889
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:27,450
sound creatures

890
00:33:24,808 --> 00:33:29,668
Teno vein is uh is another brand name

891
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,009
that's a dry powdered product but it's

892
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:33,840
same active ingredient natural has the

893
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,399
same thing you guys if you're gonna use

894
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,959
any of these powdered products beyond

895
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:38,398
the dunks the dunks are just fine

896
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,169
probably to use without a mask if you're

897
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,908
gonna use natural or act innovate please

898
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:44,399
wear a mask to research everything

899
00:33:41,909 --> 00:33:45,778
before use yeah when you get a new

900
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:47,128
pesticide if you take that little

901
00:33:45,778 --> 00:33:48,538
booklet that's on there I know it's

902
00:33:47,128 --> 00:33:50,099
crazy nobody does this that little

903
00:33:48,538 --> 00:33:53,849
booklet if you open it up it tells you

904
00:33:50,099 --> 00:33:54,480
all the safety precautions it's the

905
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:56,668
truth

906
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,679
I love readin it tells you how much to

907
00:33:56,669 --> 00:34:00,659
apply on certain types of crops it tells

908
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:01,980
you how long between applications it

909
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:04,230
tells you what kind of safety equipment

910
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:05,700
you need to wear any kind of whether you

911
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,349
need to apply it in right because I

912
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,878
matter because if it's gonna rain and

913
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:10,409
you apply certain things it's just gonna

914
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,210
wash right off and you just wasted that

915
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:15,030
whole application time and the expense

916
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:17,398
on the product also in there it tells

917
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:18,839
you the re-entry interval how long from

918
00:34:17,398 --> 00:34:21,000
spring this product should you avoid

919
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:22,679
this room without wearing protective

920
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,969
gear because some of the chemicals and

921
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,710
products that are available to Hydra

922
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:27,088
store much more toxic and dangerous than

923
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,559
you realize they expect you to be a

924
00:34:27,088 --> 00:34:30,838
responsible adult that can read that

925
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,309
label [ __ ] that bare stuff the bear

926
00:34:30,838 --> 00:34:35,099
spray they sell for your outdoor house

927
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:36,809
it Lowe's that can kill you that can

928
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,889
completely kill a human if you [ __ ]

929
00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:39,509
around and do it wrong so pay attention

930
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,159
to the labels you guys read that [ __ ]

931
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:42,569
read the safety sheets and then it's

932
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,460
really important I know it sound like a

933
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:45,989
preaching to you but a lot of the things

934
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,550
that you can get from these products you

935
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:49,318
won't notice until ten or twelve years

936
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,760
down the line you'll start getting a

937
00:34:49,318 --> 00:34:52,168
facial tic or something and it'll be

938
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,639
from that time there's a brief Laura

939
00:34:52,168 --> 00:34:55,559
might into the fan and it came back into

940

its most they nervous system and

942

reproductive systems it's the exact same

943
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:03,240
thing they do to the insects exactly did

944
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:04,858
to kill yeah she was gonna take a little

945
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:06,838
while longer on you because you're

meaning they eat more [ __ ] okay they're

973
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:11,929
still growing yeah yeah okay and there's

974
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:14,210
a they'll hang around longer - all right

975
00:36:11,929 --> 00:36:16,279
Thank You ladybugs - stick around is

976
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:20,840
there a trick to that I've heard some

977
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:23,300
pretty awful things for me you know

978
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,420
outdoors is where I use the most and

979
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:30,289
just having a nice welcoming environment

980
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:32,150
you know that's there's not normally

981
00:36:30,289 --> 00:36:34,400
many pests on the plants but there can

982
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:37,099
be pests found in the mulches and the

983
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,050
garden beds around so I think that works

984
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:40,699
to keep them around stick around there -

985
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,039

986

990
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:54,410
plant they will hatch and come alive in

991
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:56,089
your garden you can watch it happen it's

992

993
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,030
but I've seen videos of it because I'm

994
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,139
kind of an internet nerd but yeah

995
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:01,940

997

998
00:37:03,469 --> 00:37:07,129
preventative to keep the bugs away if

999
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,690
you want something a little stronger to

1000
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,090

I use that catalog all the time just for

1006
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,150
plenty of research to compare those what

1007
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,980
does this versus this which is better

1008
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,630
you just hold the pages and see what you

1009
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,579
like better and read them yeah they've

1010
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:29,630
got everything in there but again if you

1011
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,230
get some floor might if you get

1012
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,970
something crazy

1013
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:34,610
get yourself a Tyvek suit and some

1014
00:37:31,969 --> 00:37:36,589
gloves a mask suit up

1015
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:38,588

1016
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:40,239
do it properly don't get soon

1017
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:41,949
and I also think you're bastards for

1018
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,108
spraying that [ __ ] outside yeah don't

1019
00:37:41,949 --> 00:37:47,939
don't ever spray it outside there don't

1020
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:50,048
kill bees that [ __ ] wipes eyes out it's

1021
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,999
just personal opinion without the bees

1022
00:37:50,048 --> 00:37:53,380
you don't have any food right especially

1023
00:37:51,998 --> 00:37:55,689
me I'm a vegetarian everything I eat

1024
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:58,809
grows we don't know everything I eat

1025
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:01,509
either grows or eats eats something that

1026
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:02,140
grows your food eats my food yep it's

1027
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:04,440
not fair

1028
00:38:02,139 --> 00:38:07,298
it'd be a pretty shitty place without

1029
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:11,798
pollinators yes absolutely

1030
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:13,179
so we want ladybugs we want beneficial

1031
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:15,909
predators predatory mites is what I'm

1032
00:38:13,179 --> 00:38:17,440
thinking we want some of the preying

1033
00:38:15,909 --> 00:38:19,420
mantises what other kind of bugs can we

1034
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,179
put out there to help us out

1035
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:24,639
worms in your soil okay oh yeah put

1036
00:38:22,179 --> 00:38:25,960

1041
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:40,689
they no not really

1042
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:44,440

1043

that we can help you out with exactly

1094
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:29,710
what you need kind of dial it in and aim

1095
00:40:28,179 --> 00:40:32,379
it a little more at you specifically and

1096
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,940
get what you need one other quick thing

1097
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:38,110
plants are gonna start using more water

1098
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:39,880
so don't just give them what they'll

1099
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,920
take and what they need to stay perked

1100
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:44,410
up if you want big fat buds you got to

1101
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,150
get them lots of water lots of water I

1102
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:49,179
guess that that mainly applies to

1103
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:52,450
inground plants but same same you know

1104
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:55,239
same for a potted container it I mean

1105
00:40:52,449 --> 00:40:56,409
it'll only take so much water but right

1106
00:40:55,239 --> 00:40:58,479
but as soon as it dries give it some

1107
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:59,829
more oh yeah don't be shy don't don't

1108
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,690
sleep in and think you can water those

1109
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:02,769
plants later nope you can't you got to

1110
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,360
get out there and water them right now

1111
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:06,460
if you're not want to stay on it don't

1112
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,849
start it that's the truth if you let

1113
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:12,309
them dry out its a noticeable chunk out

1114
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:14,559
of your harvest yeah it's I'm sure it's

1115
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:16,750
a noticeable percentage so it's like

1116
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,130
that an indoor or outdoor yeah how do

1117
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:20,739
you feel about using a drip system in an

1118
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:22,360
outdoor girl awesome awesome okay

1119
00:41:20,739 --> 00:41:23,439
it's I've promised the listeners that I

1120
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,440
would talk about building a drip system

1121
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,610
but it's not a lot of plant involvement

1122
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,099
and I don't want to spend too much of an

1123
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:31,900
episode talking about building PVC pipes

1124
00:41:30,099 --> 00:41:34,059
that actually kind of be a hard episode

1125
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:37,150
cuz it's not really hard right just

1126
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:39,130

1140
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:04,750
Legos basically I bought these two $30

1141

expert

1146
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:19,539
boys playing with LEGOs is essentially

1147

1180
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:40,299
not as reggae every year it's the

1181
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:43,600
lightest way to say that but the band

1182
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:45,460
has got slightly more two of my two of

1183
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,190
my favorite reggae bands ever are

1184
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,480
opening the show steel poles of course

1185

1189
00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:58,630

1190
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:00,220
