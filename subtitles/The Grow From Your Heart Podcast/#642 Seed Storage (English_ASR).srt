thing

83
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,319
a lot of the audio podcast services have

84
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,640

85
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,839
um long story short my website got

86
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,639
messed up you don't care about the

87
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,719
details

88
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,479

90
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,518
weird

91
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,959
my web guy is working diligently to

92
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,319
solve the problems

93
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,920
we don't know that there is a problem

94
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:43,759
until somebody tells us i didn't know

95
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,518
that the show wasn't on stitcher google

96
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,280
podcast spotify

97
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
uh it wasn't showing up in a lot of

98
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,120
places we were working to correct that

99
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,480
uh it should be corrected by the time

100
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,159
this episode comes out the thing is

101
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,840
every time we correct one thing we find

102
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:57,439
that something else is

103
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,519
messed up so we're playing the fix the

104
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,039
internet game i do apologize if you've

105
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,280

107
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,959

108
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,158
you want to listen to the shows i want

109

them to be available

110
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,959
trust me uh sponsors pay for it patreon

111
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,560
uh relies on the shows coming out

112
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,479
i do want the shows to come out on time

113
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,360
if the show is not on the service which

114
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,199
you are used to

115

117
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,318

finding the show

130

you're not even gonna get the message

131
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,280
it's like calling somebody who left

their phone at your house hey bro your

133

the phone is just ringing on my table

135
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,480
all right let's move forward into

136
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,239
something

137
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,399
useful in this podcast i recently

138
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,360
attended a great event

139
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,599
i attended the groovy gravy secret stash

140
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,200
seed exchange event in denver colorado

141
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,238
that was a beautiful event we had a

142
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,919
great time

143
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,120
i was a low-key event it was kind of

144
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,039
low-key i would guess there were

145
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,239
somewhere between three and 500 people

146
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,719
at the whole event

147
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,759
uh which was not bad that was great for

148
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:13,359
um

149
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,039
i was kind of calling it a practice run

150
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,160
like getting back into the environment

151
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:17,918
re-entry

152
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,199
i haven't been to an event to a concert

153
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,240
to a comedy show

154
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,639
uh any big sort of gathering since uh

155
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,319
march 12th or 13th i was at the last

156
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,560
comedy show that was at the comedy works

157
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,478
downtown in denver uh the last show was

158
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,839
bobby lee they haven't had a big show

159
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:33,599
in that building since then they have

160
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,198
now by the time you hear this uh some

161
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,800
socially distant shows but

162
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,960
uh there haven't been any big shows

163
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
events uh anything like that for me to

164
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,120
go to

165
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,639
so it was exciting to get out this was

166
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,079
just a small event

167
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,600
most of the time i take two or three

168
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:47,199
people to a big event to help me out

169
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,120

171
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759

172
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:53,599
perfect that's what i'm getting at i

173
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,280
needed a small event for re-entry to

174
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,879
learn how to deal with people again

175
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,359
how to be at an event environment it's

176
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:00,959
been so long that i kind of forgot

177
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,479
uh once we got there we totally fell

178
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,000
right into the rhythm though it was just

179
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:05,038
just like old times the drive up was

180
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,959
super smooth

181
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,478
uh it's about a three hour drive from

182
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,198
where mike and i were

183
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,560
uh to actually get to the event pretty

184
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,840
uneventful drive

185
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120

186
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,399
mike and i just have really good

187
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,439

189
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,719

buyer beware

316
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
um i think they were there they had a

317
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:53,039
booth i didn't realize who that was

318
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,480
until later on

319
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,919
uh when i realized they changed their

320
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,600
names but it was kind of cool it was a

321
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,000
cool setup event so people got to come

322
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,440
in

323
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,839
they got an hour to shop and then they

324
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,360
got moved out uh to the outside area

325
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,200
it wasn't rude they knew that they got

326
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,159
an hour so there was from noon to one

327
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,560
got to shop

328
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:10,559
and then from 1 to 130 it was basically

329
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,000
just vips in the building and the vips

330
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,000
have already been to my booth a couple

331
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,679
of times they've shopped they've chatted

332
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,440
they've gotten their fist bumps so when

333
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,679
that 30-minute break between

334
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,839
uh groups between waves that would give

335
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,838
us time to just regroup i could take a

336
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,600
drink of water reorganize my booth

337
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
check my phone use the restroom if i

338
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,360
needed to go get a bagel if i wanted one

339
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,360
because they had bagels there for us

340
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
go get a coffee if we wanted one just

341
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,159
whatever you need you can get like a

342
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,958
good 20 or 30 minute break and that's

343
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,679
kind of cool

344
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,679
because when i go to an event i am the

345
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,278
mickey mouse of my brand i know that i'm

346
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,799
my face is on the package

347
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,159
people don't come there no offense mike

348
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:45,039
nobody came there to talk to mike some

349
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,719
people do but

350
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,079
90 of the people that come to my booth

351
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,920
want to talk to me and that's

352
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,440
understandable

353
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:52,879
so i don't get to leave the booth very

354
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,080
often but when you got a minute break

355
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:55,360
there in the middle you know that i can

356
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,399
just go use the restroom and no one's

357
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,200
going to come up to the booth and be

358
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,720
disappointed

359
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,000
that they didn't get to meet roster jeff

360
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
because they really do try to meet

361
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,159
everybody

362
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,079
try to shake everybody's hands if you

363
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:05,679
want a selfie a high five a picture

364
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,759
if you want me to autograph some [ __ ]

365
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,000
i'll do it because i understand without

366
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:11,120
uh the people that support me i wouldn't

367
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,120
be supported

368
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,480
so i'm grateful and thankful and i like

369
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,480
to uh

370
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
oblige and be cordial to the people who

371
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,000
have supported me uh i'm

372
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,440
successful because of those people but

373
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,720
they're successful with their grows

374
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,839
because of what we're giving each other

375
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
so it works out

376
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,839
um i really like that flow it's a great

377
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,360
time it was really good i keep rambling

378
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,040
about this event because i was excited

379
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,200

380
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,319
uh standing at my booth is just a good

381
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,160

how good of a job we do with the seeds

388

podcast

390
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,000
somebody told me that they've been

391
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:51,519
growing for several years uh like maybe

392
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,480
eight or ten years i think they said and

393
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,720
then they discovered

394
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,560
the podcast two years ago and they said

395
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,160
that their crop has never been better

396
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,359
they're putting out a better product

397
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,000
better weights they're way more

398
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,079

great compliments on the podcast

514
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,679
a lot of times i bash rosin i'm really

515
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:24,958
not a huge fan of most

516
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,399
rosin and most of you guys are gonna say

517
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,319
well you're not smoking the right rosin

518
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,958
or they're not doing it right i know i

519
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,480
know

520
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,479
and most you guys say that you give me

521
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,680
rosin it tastes like [ __ ] also

522
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,000
i think a lot of the times it tastes

523
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,759
like a popsicle stick or burnt popcorn

524
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,679
let's recap and head back to my buddy

525
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:40,480
neil he gave me this lemon jeffrey live

526
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,000
rosin

527
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,399
apparently i liked it because look at

528
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,679
the jar it is empty it is

529
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,879
zero it is finito fin the end throw it

530
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:50,559
away

531
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,240
i kept it because it still smells

532
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:53,518
amazing and this was my reminder to talk

533
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,839
about it on the show

534
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,159
this lemon jeffrey live rosin was

535
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,160
tremendous it didn't have the negative

536
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,240
flavors the negative things i usually

537
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,519
experience when i'm smoking rosin

538
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,039
this was delicious i uh if i had paid

539
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,320
money i didn't this was a gift if i had

540
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,159

bro ah had a great time talking to you i

545

546
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,879

um send me a message bro because you're

548

your concentrate was amazing lemon

550
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,000
jeffrey is quite possibly one of my top

551
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:28,719
three favorite flavors it's named after

552
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,839

555
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,440

i probably i'd buy that i got lost in

557
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,600
sidetracked and what i was saying

558
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,320
talking about how good that concentrate

559
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,159

i mean it bro good [ __ ] good dude also

561

562
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,360
media though so that's weird

563
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,600

564
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,199

product

570
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
uh jeremy couldn't make it to the event

571
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,759
he was kind enough to send three jars of

572
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,039
concentrate with our friend to make sure

573
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,879
they made it to

574
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,919
the booth um same story here i generally

575
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,958
don't dab

576
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:18,719
rosin but this number six

577
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:22,078
the jar is empty dude it is empty

578
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,680
oh it smells ah it's got some tangy it's

579
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,559
got a little clementine to it

580
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,198
but then it's got like a strawberry like

581
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,518
a fake

582
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,958
strawberry candy strawberry incense sort

583
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,039
of thing going on to it

584
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,239
and this one did not last long you could

585
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,000
tell that jar is empty

586
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,519
it's got scrape marks in it i was trying

587
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,519
to get the final dabs

588
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,799
out of that one there was number six

589
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,320
there was number five and i think there

590
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,799
was also number three

591
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,480
number three is gone non-existent and

592
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,399
then i think there might be

593
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,000
just a little bit of the sap left in

594
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,320
number five so shout out to jeremy

595
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,679

598
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720

599
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,799
ah didn't make me cough didn't make me

600
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,519

rosin though i smoke uh bho i smoke

602

don't need as big of a dab i still take

605

as big of a dab

606
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,919
but it feels like there's weight on my

607
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,038
chest for a minute after i smoke it i

608
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,720
kind of enjoy it

609
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,759

00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,319
owner and founder of essential extracts

665
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,918
at least he was

666
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,918
at one point that's how i knew him he

667
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,280
was dj nicoti also that guy from

668
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,880
essential extracts

669
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,399
he used to be the other guy with dreads

670
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,280
he's cut his dreads off now i'm not

671
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,160
following the trend

672
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,440
don't do it uh but dj nicoti showed up

673
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,640
and dj nicotine

674
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
set the vibe for the day it was

675
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,038
beautiful

676
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,480
uh mike was like i hope we don't have to

677
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:14,640
listen to sublime all day

678
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,558
and i get it uh mike's not really a

679
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,280
reggae fan mike's not a sublime kind of

680
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:19,119
fan

681
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,319
and when the dj started playing reggae

682
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,159
mike kind of looked at me like oh it's

683
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,639
gonna be reggae all day but a few songs

684
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,400
in

685
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,840
he blended reggae with some other stuff

686
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,320
with some good reggae with some other

687
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,079
stuff

688
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,839
mike's not a reggae fan and he actually

689
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:31,759
enjoyed the musical vibes it felt like

690
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:34,798
they were playing a playlist for me

691
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:36,480
so big shout out to dj nicoti cush and

692
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,240
coconut water you guys it was really

693
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,919
exciting to be at events again

694
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,759
um i'm just rambling about an event

695
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,120
because i wanted to recap it and talk

696
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,640
about it because i haven't gone out and

697
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:45,199
done something like that in such a long

698
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,280
time

699
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,720
that it was amazing it also made me

700
00:19:47,279 --> 00:19:51,119
realize

701
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,038
i need to update my booth uh the booth

702
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:54,558
looked good uh but it could be better

703
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,038
some of the guys have more professional

704
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:56,558
booths

705
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,079
i saw a couple of things that inspired

706
00:19:56,558 --> 00:19:58,399
me some ideas that i'm definitely going

707
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,399
to

708
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,759
uh i'm going to steal your ideas that's

709
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,360
how we do it right you see business that

710
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,279
works and you copy things that work and

711
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,439
you ditch ideas that don't work

712
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,879
that's what we're doing here i saw great

713
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,759
a couple of ways just to improve the

714
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,080
booth flow

715
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,919
improve uh the efficiency of the booth

716
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,439
and lessen the environmental impact i

717
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,159
want to do less paper at the booth i

718
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,159
know that's

719
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,080
uh some hippy [ __ ] but uh there will be

720
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,200
less paper less takeaway stuff it'll all

721
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,960
be digital

722
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,319
the world's digital now we don't need

723
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,960
paper all right so

741
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,639
awards or something here

742
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:53,918

743
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,038
shout outs at the start of the show for

744
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,400
patreon

745
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,119

746
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,038
tier

747
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,639
where i promise to give them a shout out

748
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:03,839
on the show so if i didn't shout them

749
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,200

750
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:06,158
and i do it in the first minute of the

751
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,679
show if you don't want to hear the

752
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,440
commercial and the shout outs

753
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,798
hit that skip button when you don't hear

754
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,679
music anymore the shout outs are

755
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,279
probably over

756
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,038
it's usually the way it works the music

757
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:15,519
and the shout outs last about the same

758
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:17,119

topic of this podcast i've been talking

775
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,880
for quite a while this is gonna be a

776
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,640
long show

777
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,159
um this portion of the show is brought

778
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,000
to you by my friend kes burton shout out

779
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,960
to my buddy kes burton this topic is

780
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,919
going to be

781
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
seed storage uh we sold a bunch of seeds

782
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,559
at the seed event

783
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,240
i get a lot of messages about how to

784
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:01,759
store seeds i felt like this would be a

785
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,480
great appropriate episode

786
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,158
to segue the seed event into seed

787
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,200
storage perhaps you went to an event

788
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,320
this weekend perhaps you've been

789
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
shopping online

790
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,119
perhaps you're headed to the events that

791
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:11,759
are coming up and you've got a bunch of

792
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:13,599
seeds

793
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,200
what do i do with my seeds as a seed

794
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:16,879
breeder as a seed seller

795
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,880
my number one recommendation for what

796
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,039
you do with your seeds is to

797
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,559
guess what grow them i didn't make seeds

798
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:24,240
for you to put them in a [ __ ] vault i

799
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:24,798
don't want those seeds in a [ __ ] desk

800
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,880
drawer

801
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,400
i don't want those seeds in your safe i

802
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,320
would prefer not to see them

803
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,919
in your [ __ ] junk drawer or your

804
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,319
underwear drawer or wherever you keep

805
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,240
them

806
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,439
in your fridge i want you to put them in

807
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,880
the dirt

808
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,480
depending on your location and your

809
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
legalities iregenetics is not

810
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,000
responsible for

811
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,119
violation of uh growing laws or rules or

812
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,558
regulations but

813
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:46,000
if you're in a safe legal place i really

814
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:46,960
want you to get them wet and put them in

815
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,119
the [ __ ] dirt

816
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,798
i don't want you to store them however i

817
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,439
do appreciate love and respect and

818
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:53,279
admire

819
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,360
that people are buying my seed packages

820
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,879
and keeping them like baseball cards

821
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,038
they treat them like a pokemon card i

822
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
gotta get them all and as a seller of

823
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:00,879
seeds

824
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:02,158
i have no complaints if you're gonna put

825
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,760
those in a drawer i guess i'm gonna be

826
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,640
excited about that but let's talk about

827
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:06,960
a way

828
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,759
to safely and effectively long-term

829
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,600
store these seeds seeds are not cheap

830
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,200
seeds do not last forever i like to

831
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,359
pride myself in being one of the more

832
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,519
affordable seed breeders also

833
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,879
i saw some prices this weekend i've seen

834
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,639
some prices online

835
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,000
and you guys are welcome i'm staying

836
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:23,360
very affordable i don't

837
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,720
need to take all of your money i just

838
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,359
need to get paid for my work i don't

839
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,480
need

840
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,839
we're not trying to get rich we're just

841
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,798
trying to live over here make sure

842
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,720
everybody's fed

843
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,639
uh maybe some some sneakers we'll be all

844
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,400
right anyway i'm rambling

845
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,600
but uh you've got expensive seeds you

846
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
want to keep them alive you want to keep

847
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:38,319
them safe you want to keep them stored

848
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,278
what is the best way

849
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,960
to store these seeds for long term most

850
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,278
of the seeds that you buy are going to

851
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
be

852
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,558
in a package they should be in some sort

853
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,039
of a sealed package already

854
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,038
i'm looking across the table jj sells

855
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,720
his seeds in that like mylar package it

856
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:53,759
seems to be vacuum sealed or at least

857
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,640
heat sealed

858
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:58,158
i'm looking at uh loving in her eyes has

859
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,600
quite an extravagant package but on the

860
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,480
inside those are sealed

861
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,000
inside of a little vial my seeds come in

862
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,000
a disc with the foam padding

863
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,200
on the inside the disc to keep the seeds

864
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,720
from rattling around

865
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,640
those are inside of a baggie with the

866
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,360
folded card insert that baggie is heat

867
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,960
sealed

868
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,959
so most of the seeds are going to be

869
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,720
sealed in a good package already

870
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,480
the first thing i would suggest is maybe

871
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,919
putting your seeds if you've got a lot

872
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,759
of packs you're trying to seal get one

873
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:22,240
box and put them all in one box that

874
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,359
does

875
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,038
seal um i've got for my

876
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:28,719
small personal stash that i know i'm

877
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:31,119
gonna i think i'm gonna run

878
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,798
i've got a it's a grateful dead lunch

879
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:34,558
box it's one of those metal lunch boxes

880
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:35,599
it doesn't seal super tight but it seals

881
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,200
enough for me

882
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,959
and all those seeds are already sealed

883
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,360
so i'm comfortable with that for my

884
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,159
personal little storage stash my uh

885
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:45,439
my nostalgic seed vault if you will i

886
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,520
would recommend something

887
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,278
that is airtight they make those little

888
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,359
uh all the head shops used to have them

889
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:52,640
in the late 90s early 2000s we were in

890
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,278
high school it's what we kept all our

891
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,038
[ __ ] in

892
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,558
just a little airtight stash box it's

893
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:57,839
just got a rubber grommet around it it's

894
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,079
a metal box

895
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,759
it's probably got led zeppelin or insane

896
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:03,359
clown posse or something [ __ ] printed

897
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,400
on it maybe you got tupac on yours i

898
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,399
don't know

899
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,559
but uh what we need to do is make an

900
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,840
irie genetics seed stash box just like

901
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:11,359
that if you know how to do that if you

902
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,480
were the person that does that please

903
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,158
contact me

904
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,200
ah we will hook you the [ __ ] up because

905
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
everybody out there is going to want to

906
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,038
buy an irie genetic seed stash box

907
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,278
let's get back on track we need a stash

908
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,960
box something that could be airtight not

909
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,720
super airtight isn't critical i like the

910
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,960
airtight so we're going to put the seeds

911
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,558
in the airtight box as the first step

912
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,319
then where do we put that

913
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,918
i see a lot of people putting their

914
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,439
seeds in the refrigerator

915
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,799
let me talk a little bit about that

916
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
because i'm going to say put your seeds

917
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:38,158
in a cool dry dark place and people are

918
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,519
going to say that's the refrigerator or

919
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,159
the crisper drawer

920
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:43,599
that is cool also i don't like the

921
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,720
freezer that's going to fall into this

922
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,918
category

923
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,360
think about if you put uh anything in

924
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:49,840
the crisper drawer anything in the

925
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:51,678
fridge

926
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:53,199
it makes condensation it gets cold in

927
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,400
there right it creates moisture inside

928
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,120
that package

929
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,120
then you take that out now that moisture

930
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,119
has to go somewhere that condensation

931
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,719
is inside of that package you've got

932
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,719
moisture moving around

933
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,240
inside of your package possibly inside

934
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,880
of your seed package what

935
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,720
germinates your seeds is moisture so you

936
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,159
can create a condensation issue by

937
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,679
putting your seeds in the fridge and

938
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,278
taking them out or putting them in the

939
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,080
freezer and taking them out too

940
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:20,319
frequently if you do choose to store

941
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,199
your seeds in the refrigerator or in the

942
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:23,278
freezer

943
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,480
put them in there and leave them there

944
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,159
for a while

945
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,599
if you're the kind of person that likes

946
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,278
to pull out your seeds and marvel at

947
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:30,158
your collection or show off your seeds

948
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,079
to your friends

949
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,679
i don't recommend putting them in that

950
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,960
deep of a cold

951
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,320
in that case i recommend just a cool

952
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,079
dry dark environment perhaps you live in

953
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:42,960
colorado and you've got a basement maybe

954
00:26:42,079 --> 00:26:45,199
you've got a back

955
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,400
dark corner of that basement where you

956
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,720
can put a safe

957
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,679
put those seeds in that safe that will

958
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,240
stay cool

959
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,798
in the basement in colorado it stays

960
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,960
about

961
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,480
75 degrees ish it may get a little bit

962
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,679
colder in the winter it may get a little

963
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,120
bit hotter in the summer

964
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,559
but if you got the normal house

965
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,639
environment happening it's going to stay

966
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:03,918
about 75 down there in the basement

967
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,520
because you got the heater upstairs

968
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,038
running the house to keep it warm or you

969
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:08,558
got the cooler keeping it cool

970
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:10,079
it's gonna kind of adjust the downstairs

971
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:11,519
the house stays insulated

972
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,199
pretty good temperature down there find

973
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:13,918
that back secure corner nobody knows how

974
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,519
to find

975
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,200
put your safe with your seeds back there

976
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,000
that's nice and secure cool

977
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,200
dry dark safe environment also a safe

978
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,839
environment something that nobody could

979
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,038
get to

980
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,038
because you don't want people stealing

981
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,319
your expensive freaking seeds

982
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,679
um heat in my opinion is one of the best

983
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,839
ways to destroy

984
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,600
and degrade the lifespan of a seed so

985
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,240
keep those seeds cool the cooler the

986
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:35,839
better

987
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,759
to a point you don't want to get them so

988
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,240
cold that they rupture and explode

989
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,359
that's another thing to talk about super

990
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,679
dry seeds

991
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:45,199
i try to dry my seeds really really dry

992
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,480
before i send them to anybody something

993
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,000
we did discover

994
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,399
is that if you don't dry the seeds

995
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,000
enough um i was having

996
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:53,839
an issue that seeds going to one

997
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,278
direction i was getting complaints on it

998
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,038
seeds i sent to another direction i

999
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,398
didn't get any complaints about

1000
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,158
and i was like how come everybody on the

1001
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,599
east coast is having germination issues

1002
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,039
with this new batch of seeds

1003
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,319
everybody on the west coast their seeds

1004
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:05,359
are just fine i thought about it it's

1005
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,798
the middle of winter

1006
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:08,240
the seeds going that way are [ __ ]

1007
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:09,200
freezing the seeds going that way are

1008
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,038
just fine

1009
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,960
uh then i thought there's freezing and

1010
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:14,720
erupting they're probably erupting

1011
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,319
in cargo they're probably on a plane

1012
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880
they're getting too cold and they're

1013
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,759
bursting

1014
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,440
in the plane in the cargo so i've

1015
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,079
started drying the seeds a little bit

1016
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,080
more

1017
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,359
i just put them with uh what is it

1018
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,439
called it's not a boveda

1019
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,558
it's a silicate pack that just sucks up

1020
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,759
all the moisture

1021
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,278
i've got the number written down at the

1022
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,240
point i want to get it below once i'm

1023
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,839
below that point

1024
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,200
i know they won't rupture in the mail i

1025
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,798
know they won't rupture in cargo they

1026
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,399
won't rupture if they get too cold

1027
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,839
makes the seeds a little bit safer this

1028
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,599
is how much thought we're putting into

1029
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,639
keeping the seeds safe and fresh to get

1030
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,359
them to

1031
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,799
the grower we want you to have success

1032
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:47,918
if you don't have success with my seeds

1033
00:28:46,798 --> 00:28:49,839
you can email me

1034
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,200
and over time eventually you will get a

1035
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:52,558
replacement pack if you've got a good

1036
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,000
reason if you didn't [ __ ] them up being

1037
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,599
completely stupid

1038
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,278
i'd rather have good customer service

1039
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,678
and eat a pack than you hate me and

1040
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,960
spread

1041
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,720
[ __ ] [ __ ] on the internet about me

1042
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,640
because i do care about you so

1043
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,720
dry seeds is the main idea keep them

1044
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,640
nice and dry store them in a cool dry

1045
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,640
dark place don't freeze them

1046
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,559
heat will ruin them i don't prefer them

1047
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,759
in the freezer extremes of either way

1048
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:13,839
i don't think are good if you've got to

1049
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:15,200
go extreme one way cold is the best if

1050
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:16,398
you think about it they probably fell

1051
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,399
out of the plant they landed

1052
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,639
they stayed in the snow the snow melted

1053
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:22,239
it became water that water germinated

1054
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,360
the seed it grew up so i think the cold

1055
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,599
is preservation

1056
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,918
that's not as bad as heat all right so

1057
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,158
to recap i really recommend a cool dry

1058
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,759
dark place uh if you insist on putting

1059
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,278
them in the refrigerator i do recommend

1060
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,640
you put them in that crisper drawer try

1061
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,079
to keep them dry

1062
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,320
put them in an airtight container if

1063
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,319
you're going to put them in there

1064
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:41,839
once again i don't recommend the freezer

1065
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,720
if you're going to take them out and put

1066
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,918
them back

1067
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,319
if you're the kind of person that wants

1068
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,038
to show them off just a cool dry dark

1069
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:48,960
place

1070
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,240
uh like a corner in the basement a shelf

1071
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,840
in the basement something like that

1072
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,440
something no one's gonna get to

1073
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,119
uh none of your pets are going to find

1074
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,759
them and eat them something else i want

1075
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,599
to talk about

1076
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,038
is when you're restoring these seeds

1077
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,719
make sure that they are

1078
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,720
labeled they have a name on them are

1079
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,399
they in the original breeder packaging

1080
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,600
did you write the name on a baggie and

1081
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,038
every time you touch it you're rubbing

1082
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:08,398
that name off with your thumb

1083
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:10,398
and in a few years you won't even know

1084
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,359
what those seeds are think about how

1085
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:13,359
well labeled

1086
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:15,199
and sealed those seeds are also write

1087
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,798
down the date of when you put those in

1088
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,919
there so you know how long you've had

1089
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,319
those seeds around

1090
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,520
then also are they regular or feminized

1091
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:22,079
seeds i would write that down on the

1092
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,558
packaging

1093
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,278
as well i try to include as many details

1094
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:26,720
as i can

1095
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:29,038
in a package of seeds i like to be a

1096
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,558
little bit excessive i claim to be a

1097
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:31,919
sort of a cannabis historian or

1098
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:32,720
something like that i'm documenting

1099
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,720
cannabis

1100
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,720
i talk a lot about cannabis i argue a

1101
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,880
lot about cannabis i want to be correct

1102
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,759
so i try to make a lot of details

1103
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,600
uh in the future this cannabis stuff is

1104
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,558
going to be talked about the revolution

1105
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:46,398
of cannabis

1106
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,240
uh how cannabis became legal in some

1107
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,599
areas and we had medical cannabis and

1108
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,200
the growing and the breeding and all

1109
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:51,918
this culture will be talked about this

1110
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,840
will be

1111
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,759
uh we're pioneers if you're in this

1112
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,839
right now you are a pioneer

1113
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,359
and i was here from a lot of the

1114
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,959
beginning of this stuff and so it's kind

1115
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:02,798
of my responsibility with

1116
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,399
the way my brain works the way i talk to

1117
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:05,839
people with this show platform it's kind

1118
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:08,158
of my responsibility

1119
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:09,918
to make sure that history and cannabis

1120
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,360
lore and all of that stuff stays

1121
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,919
accurate i just had a

1122
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:14,639
a lacewing a baby lace wing crawl on my

1123
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,159
arm so my

1124
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,240
ipm is working because it jumped from

1125
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,159
this plant onto my arm a little baby

1126
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,558
lace wing freaked me out i felt it

1127
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,200
um yeah beneficial insects are the way

1128
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:24,639
to go

1129
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,840
um yeah if you've ever seen a little

1130
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,120
baby lacing it looks like a little

1131
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:28,558
crocodile looks like a little tiny

1132
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:30,398
dinosaur one of the ugliest little bugs

1133
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,240
ever and then it turns into a lacewing

1134
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:34,398
i got totally distracted by feeling that

1135
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,960
bug climb up my arm but i think i have

1136
00:31:34,398 --> 00:31:37,199
made

1137
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,200
my point for most of this episode

1138
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,720
because i really do not remember where i

1139
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,399
was so i think that is a good point

1140
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,679
uh just to start wrapping up the podcast
