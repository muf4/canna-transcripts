try to post an episode once a week but

28
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,280
sometimes the summer happens and I am

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,959
going to skip a couple of shows and

30
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,400

visiting a couple of friends uh I spent

33
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,000
a lot more time there than I had

34
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,960
anticipated but sometimes friends and

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,478
family are going to take precedent over

36
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:37,759
a podcast this was one of those times I

37
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,560
thought I would catch up later in the

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,560
week but I did not because I got the

39

82
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:09,840
emails I do have a website that website

83
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:12,359
is I genetics.com let me clarify

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,439

85

quite some time now is I tried a local

166
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:58,439
strain called lemon drop a while back

167
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,120
and it had the best lemon flavor and

168
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,439
effect on my mind that I've ever had

169
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,240
okay I love that you're after the lemon

170
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:06,639
Jeffrey because the lemon drop made you

171
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
happy uh I do agree that you may find

172
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,280
something with those lemon turps that

173
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,720
makes you happy makes you smiley that's

174
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:14,478
why I like the lemon Jeffrey it fixes my

175
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,560
my weird glitches and it makes me feel

176
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,598
like a normal person and it makes me uh

177
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,879
happy and smiley and chatty and rambly

178
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:24,439
which is a good spot for a podcaster to

179
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,240
be anyhow it says um I would like to ask

180
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:29,360
if there is a way I can be added to a

181
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,319
list for when these seeds restock thank

182
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,840
you in advance from your friend Matthew

183
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,240
um yes the elusive lemon Jeffrey packs

184
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:39,879
every time I put more lemon Jeffrey on

185
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,199
iir it sells out quite quickly no matter

186
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,519
how many I put on there um people just

187
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:45,319
buy them up I don't know if you guys are

188
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,198
waiting in line for it I don't know if

189
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,039
something uh happen somewhere where it's

190
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,598
super popular but I cannot keep them in

191
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,598
stock I cannot make them quickly enough

192
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,360
unfortunately I only have a couple of

193
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:56,759
packs left in my own private reserve

194
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,680
right now that I will not let go of

195
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,240
those are for me in case something were

196
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,478
to go wrong but but have no fear because

197
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,759
I will make more lemon Jeffree seeds in

198
00:07:03,478 --> 00:07:08,399
the very near future not right now not

199
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,080
this run but in the next couple of runs

200
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:12,359
there will be more lemon Jeffree seeds

201
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,399
created now this person asked Matthew

202
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,598
asked is there a way they can be added

203
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,279
to a list for when these seeds drop yes

204
00:07:16,598 --> 00:07:21,639
there absolutely is an amazing way to be

205
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:24,038
added to a list on the website where you

206
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,400
sent this message at I genetics.com

207
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:28,839
toward the bottom of that page there's a

208
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,439
spot that says uh stay up to date and

209
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:32,519
there's a picture of like a it's like a

210
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:34,560
letter like an envelope you can type in

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,400
trying not to spam you guys too much

219
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,759
because I was hitting you pretty hard

220
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,359
there for a few minutes with emails but

221
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:57,879
uh if you join that newsletter that is

222
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,639

and I try to send May one every other

224
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,560
week I try for one a month but sometimes

225
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,519

sandwich three emails in a row there but

231

I try not to overload you unless it's

232
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,560
really worth your time to go take a look

233

says hey rosta Jeff hopefully you had a

290
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,360
good Fourth of July holiday uh it was

291
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,800
excellent it was a great holiday let me

292
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,879
jump to the question part it says my

293
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,559
biggest pet peeve was after all these

294
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:31,759
years of growing when some somebody

295
00:10:29,559 --> 00:10:34,319
sells me a cut claiming it is something

296
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:37,799
popular and it turns out not to be the

297
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,160
real thing that is very frustrating uh

298
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,879
that is uh it's almost offensive I've

299
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,278
seen that breakup friendships I have

300
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:45,879
been sold uh somebody claimed they sold

301
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:48,159
me something it was not what they sold

302
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:50,120
me they took a lot of money from me and

303
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,000
now they act like I did something wrong

304
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,839
because I want some sort of

305
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
acknowledgement at [ __ ] least that

306
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,399
this guy gave me the wrong clones but he

307
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,399
doesn't care anymore I'm the [ __ ] for

308
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:01,240
pointing it out I understand how that

309
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,559
goes I kind of lost a friend possibly a

310
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,159
business partner because he sold me cuts

311
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:06,518
and he's like I got extras if you want

312
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:09,078
them and he knew that it wasn't what he

313
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:11,519
was giving me he knew that but anyhow it

314
00:11:09,078 --> 00:11:13,239
goes on it says uh it's not only a waste

315
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,200
of money time and grow space it's a

316
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,240
massive disappointment yes I agree with

317
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,680
that uh not only a disappointment it can

318
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,440
kind of piss you off a little bit

319
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:22,039
because you've been hyping it up you

320
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,079
told all your friends like bro I got

321
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:25,639
this new cut I got this new [ __ ]

322
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,439
space monkey balls and you're [ __ ]

323
00:11:25,639 --> 00:11:28,919
excited about it and you're telling all

324
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,360
your homies and you're sending pictures

325
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:32,399
and then you smoke it and you're like

326
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,320
this is [ __ ] blue dream like I've

327
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,360
been there before bro like yeah I've

328
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,519
been there not just massive

329
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,639
disappointment sometimes you're a little

330
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,078
bit flat out pissed off it depends on

331
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,399
how much you paid for that cut and how

332
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,838
many of them you bought and who you got

333
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:45,639
it from if it's just some random dude on

334
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,399
Craigslist that I met met in a parking

335
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,120
lot and gave him 25 bucks for a clone

336
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,240
that's on me that's my dumbass fault for

337
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,480
trusting that guy but if it's one of the

338
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,959
guys in the circle that I know that like

339
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,639
actually I know he has this cut he's got

340
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:59,319
the [ __ ] monkey Space Balls whatever

342
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,639
of that and he's like sure bro and he

343
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,159
sells it to me and I know he gave me

344
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,480
[ __ ] blue dream and I grow it and I

purchasing exclusively from you that is

391

couple more details on these strains

410
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:27,360
while we are here we're going to start

411
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,159
with fist bump fist bump is one of my

412
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,959
favorite strains one of my best selling

413
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,639
strains one of my most popular strains

414
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:35,479
right now uh fist bump is only available

415
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,799
in regular seeds that means you will get

416
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,759
male and female seeds out of the pack I

417
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,319
did not and I probably will not make

418
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,399
fist bump in a feminized form I've just

419
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,040
got a lot of other things in mind but I

420
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,799
just want to start by saying fist bump

421
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,919
is available in regular seeds only so

422
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,758
there will be males and females in this

423
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:54,799
package now I do have a few notes that

424
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:57,240
I'm going to try to use to try and keep

425
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,159
myself on track but we all know how that

426
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,879
goes if you've been here before now now

427
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:02,519
let's start with the name fist bump why

428
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,480
did I call the strain fist bump where

429
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,679
did that come from uh you guys know I'm

444
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,239
fist bump show we are connecting we got

445
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,319
some love for you we're on the same side

447
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:42,039
fist bump just a fist bump for all the

448
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,079
ganja Growers out there so that's where

449
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:46,599
fist bump came from now let's talk more

450
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,479
about the plants themselves fist bump

451
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:51,360
what are the genetics what is the cross

452
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,039
of fist bump that is a cross of Sour

453
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,318
Diesel and aise what uh that's a really

454
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,958
fast growing uh tall branchy plant uh

455
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:02,799
makes plants grow really tall really

456
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,198
quickly be ready for tall plants I want

457
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,519
to I want to say that a couple times

458
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:07,799
they're going to get tall they're also

459
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:11,078
going to get branchy all those branches

460
00:16:07,799 --> 00:16:13,679
are also going to get very tall if you

461
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:16,879
do not top the fist bump you will get a

462
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,278
very big fat dominant top cola if you

463
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:22,399
grow a really big fat top Cola make sure

464
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:25,480
you keep your VPD in line if you've got

465
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,399
a room that is known to get too humid or

466
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,159
have VPD issues I recommend topping fist

467
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,679
bump and growing a bunch of they won't

468
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,600
be tiny but you won't get this big

469
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,479
donkey dick style Bud that you normally

470
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,879
would you won't get that big baseball

471
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,879
bat you'll get a bunch of smaller

472
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:41,000
baseball bats which then will prevent

473
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,198
that powdery mildew or that bud rot

474
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,600
issue from happening that I said prevent

475
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,399
it will help stop that um you do have to

476
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,720
correct the room but if you do have an

477
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:51,679
overh humid room I recommend topping to

478
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,480
prevent that giant Cola set yourself up

479
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,479
for Success where else should we go from

480
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,120
here uh they're very vigorous they grow

481
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:01,079
very quickly that 21-day stretch these

482
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,440
plants are going to take off on you be

483
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:06,438
prepared for that these plants will

484
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,160
double if not more in size by the end of

485
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,079
flowers so however tall if it's a foot

486
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,199
tall when you put it into flow it'll be

487
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,639
two maybe 2 and 1/2t tall by the time it

488
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:18,038
is done be prepared for that they are

489
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,640
stretchy they're also heavy feeders in

490
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,640
uh veg they like a lot of nitrogen when

491
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,640
you put them into flour don't cut that

492
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,559
nitrogen off immediately all of my arise

493
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,400
crosses everything that came from King

494
00:17:27,558 --> 00:17:31,399
Solomon my arise man

495
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,880
is basically a pretty heavy feeder

496
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:35,200
you're going to want to give it a lot of

497
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,080
nitrogen when you flip to flour I don't

498
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,360
recommend cutting off that nitrogen like

499
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:42,038
a lot of Growers do I recommend tapering

500
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,599
it off slowly so slowly taper off that

501
00:17:42,038 --> 00:17:45,960
nitrogen so they don't Fade Out too

502
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,159
quickly on you if you see yellowing

503
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,160
early with fist bump or most of my stuff

504
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,000
that is bred with King Solomon I

505
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,200
encourage a foler feed with some

506
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,919
nitrogen to help that plant along

507
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,400
nitrogen is a mobile nutrient it'll get

508
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,159
on the leaves it'll move itself where it

509
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,200
needs to be uh that's the the short

510
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:03,679
version of what happens but don't let

511
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,480
that nitrogen get away from you let's

512
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:10,280
stay focused uh taper off the nitrogen

513
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,440
slowly uh then um let these plants

514
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:15,319
finish these plants are going to take

515
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:18,519
about 10 weeks if not a little bit more

516
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:20,480
sometimes 72 77 days is appropriate

517
00:18:18,519 --> 00:18:22,798
don't be afraid to let them go because

518
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,880
they will bulk up at the end and get

519
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,879
super fat on you that extra time will

520
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,880
pay off you will get extra weight in the

521
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,000
long run um I wrote down 10 plus weeks

522
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,320
as my note here um these plants they do

523
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,519
take well to trellising topping popping

524
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,599
scrogging you can abuse these plants

525
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,319
they will take it the the only

526
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:43,959
challenging part about the fist bump

527
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:45,918
plants well two challenging Parts

528
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,440
they're going to get big more quickly

529
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,600
than you're anticipating these plants

530
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,480
will get away from you they'll grow very

531
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,918
quickly if you're not paying attention

532
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,679
uh you'll think I've got time to put

533
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:56,600
some stakes in there or time to Trellis

534
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:58,240
that you don't do it now they're going

535
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:00,519
to get away from you the other struggle

536
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,159
you may face is feeding if you don't

537
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:04,679
feed them properly early on you'll never

538
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,799
catch up you'll be chasing the feeding

539
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:08,519
forever with these plants otherwise

540
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:10,440
they're fairly easy to grow I know that

541
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:12,480
sounds intimidating saying they get tall

542
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,120
and hungry but most Growers can handle

543
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,360
that most of you overfeed your plants

544
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:20,359
anyway so I think you're going to be

545
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:23,678
okay now the main question here was can

546
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:25,959
we talk about the Aromas and flavors yes

547
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,640
uh this is where it gets exciting um

548
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,640
fist bump since it's got that Sour

549
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,120
Diesel in there uh it comes out gassy

550
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,600
and fuy it's like a little it's got the

551
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:38,439
gassy top to it where gas like gasoline

552
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:41,038
has a a certain an alcohol smell to it

553
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,320
but it's also got diesel which is nasty

554
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:45,599
so it comes out with both of those TPS

555
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:48,079
then also from the Golden Goat it's got

556
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,519
some Citrus and some like tropical

557
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:53,119
sweetness so it's like a uh it's almost

558
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,960
like a Tropical Smoothie almost a not a

559
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,079
Orange Julius but a a tropical Julius if

560
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:00,319
that makes any sense to your turp flavor

561
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:02,839
mind it's like if you ate a tropical

562
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:05,359
Julius if you had a uh one of those uh

563
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,839
those Mexican ice cream fruit bars uh

564
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:07,959
from the gas station that are super

565
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:09,519
[ __ ] delicious you know what I'm

566
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,600
talking about you Southern California

567
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:14,200
people um one of those bars a pelletieri

568
00:20:12,599 --> 00:20:16,480
bar is that how you say it I'm a Greeno

569
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:18,240
it's all good uh next to the gas pump

570
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,759
next to the diesel pump that's what it's

571
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,038
like bro it's like Fruity gasoline at

572
00:20:20,759 --> 00:20:24,720
the same time and it's really desirable

573
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,679
I really love that sort of Buzz that

574
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,200
sort of turp now one thing I do notice

575
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:30,480
is that some of the structure will

576
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,720
indicate what the flavors are going to

577
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,000
be like I've noticed that some of the

578
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,240
phenotypes that display certain visual

579
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,960
characteristics also do come with

580
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,640
certain scents and Aromas the plant with

581
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,000
the chunkier or big thick top Cola that

582
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,640
one's going to be mostly Sour Diesel the

583
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,839
one with the fingerer sort of kind of

584
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,559
shaped buds that one is the Golden Goat

585
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,399
there is a phenotype in there that will

586
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:54,200
get really really tall and kind of

587
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:57,120
skinny it puts off one long tall skinny

588
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,400
Bud that I believe comes from the island

589
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,399
sweet skunk and Hawaiian sativa in the

590
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,320
Golden Goat it's got a a lot of the

591
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:05,519
Hawaiian sativa structure and the island

592
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:07,319
sweet skunk Aroma that's where I really

593
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,918
think that one comes from and you can

594
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:12,240
smell it and I can visually identify

595
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,520
those specific phenotypes uh there are a

596
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,120
lot of different phenotypes that come

597
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:16,720
from these they are not very uniform

598
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,879
you're going to see several different

599
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,440
phenotypes but you can see the Golden

600
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,120
Goat you can see the diesel and then you

601
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:24,558
can see a couple of the weirdos that pop

602
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:26,119
up as well but um I've been talking

603
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,519
about this when it comes to phenotype I

604
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,879
don't want to tell you too much about

605
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:33,119
phenotypes because I don't want to pick

606
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,480
for you um I brought you a variety pack

607
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:37,479
of amazing flavors and I want you to

608
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,558
choose if you want blueberry raspberry

609
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,079
strawberry lime Mandarin guava there's

610
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:43,720
one in there that's for you I want you

611
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:45,519
to choose that one I don't want to pick

612
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,558
that I think you'd be better at that so

613
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,599
choose the phenotype that works best for

614
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:51,759
you but the flavors and Aromas was the

615
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:55,000
main part of the question uh gassy

616
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,960
diesel Aromas with like a tropical fruit

617
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,640
sort of a thing on top of it so it's

618
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,278
like you ate some tropical sorbet or

619
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,759
took a bowl of mixed fruit and put that

620
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:05,880
in your mouth but then you had to sniff

621
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:08,000
gasoline or diesel fuel at the same time

622
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,480
that is my feedback my update my report

623
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,640
on fist bump now we are going to work

624
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,000
our way into another strain from here on

625
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
out I don't want any confusion I just

626
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,319
want it to be known from here right here

627
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,319
now we are now talking about another

628
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,678
strain we're going to work our way into

629
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,519
Red Line let's talk about Redline um I

630
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,200
think I started last time with why did I

631
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,639
name it red line uh red Line's got a

632
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,240
couple of different uh meanings to me

633
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,520
first of all it's red Lebanese hash

634
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,240
plant so you got the red in there uh red

635
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:40,200
Lebanese hash plant RL already Red Line

636
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,640
when I saw the red line I saw RL but red

637
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,519
red Lebanese hash plant to the same

638
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,759
arise that made the fist bump so that's

639
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,720
King Solomon to Red Lebanese hash plant

640
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:50,240
a red Lebanese hash plant always list

641
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,720
ladies first when you're talking about

642
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:55,440
the cross uh that's an important detail

643
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,440
red Lebanese hash plant to the arise why

644
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,038
did I name it Redline couple of

645
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,200
different reasons it's got read the name

646
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,119
already uh Redline Redline was a bicycle

647
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,120
company when it still could be a bicycle

648
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:08,199
company I have not kept up but I used to

649
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:10,719
be a bicycle Rider I was a BMX

650
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,278
Enthusiast I loved that movie rad uh I

651
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,038
loved Matt Hoffman uh I was into GT

652
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:18,000
Bicycles I like freestyle bikes uh BMX

653
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:21,079
biking uh any way that I could hurt

654
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,038
myself on a 20-in bicycle uh I was all

655
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:26,119
about it so the uh Redline was a popular

656
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:28,558
brand at the time I was a GT guy I rode

657
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:30,599
Gary Turner Bikes but uh Redline was

658
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,000
super popular a lot of people loved it

659
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:34,678
so that played into my culture uh my

660
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,679
childhood so that was part of my

661
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,798
memories Redline comes from that but

662
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:42,919
also but wait there's more um the first

663
00:23:39,798 --> 00:23:46,359
time I smoked Red Line my eyes got

664
00:23:42,919 --> 00:23:48,159
bloody bloody red they were blood red it

665
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:50,599
was like dangerously red it looked like

666
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,919
there was blood dripping down my eyeball

667
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:54,558
it was so red from smoking red line and

668
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:56,080
you guys have watched me take fat dabs

669
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,639
on Discord you see me come in here and

670
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,000
talk about I just took 72 dabs um my

671
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,840
eyes it takes a little bit to get my

672
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,960
eyes red they get a little pink

673
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:04,599
sometimes at the end of the day you can

674
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,079
notice I get a little I get the messed

675
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:08,199
up eyes from smoking too much but not

676
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:11,599
like most people would but the red line

677
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:13,440
my bro Red Line had my eyes bloody

678
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,240
dangerous Dragon red it looked like

679
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,200
there was something wrong with me and I

680
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,079
thought it was an an anomaly so I've

681
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,480
tried again and every time I smoke red

682
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:23,119
Lin something about it just my eyes just

683
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,558
get blasted red they're getting red

684
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,918
thinking about it right now I can feel

685
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,839
them subconsciously I can feel myself

686
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:30,799
getting red I just [ __ ] talk about

687
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,519
how much that makes my eyes red I don't

688
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,000
know what it is I don't know what uh

689
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,599
what turp or what uh cannabinoid is in

690
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,919
there but something in that red line

691
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:41,398
just makes my eyes red and it does it to

692
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,799
everybody that smokes it uh at least

693
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:44,639
everybody I've seen smoke it they all

694
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,240
get the super [ __ ] red eye so that's

695
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,679
part of why it got called Redline

696
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,759
because Redline Bicycles back in the day

697
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:53,278
and then just because uh Redline bro

698
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:55,038
your eyes are so red and also uh Red

699
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:56,440
Line because I got so high bro I was

700
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:58,519
like is it the red line there ain't no

701
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,600
there's no further to go that's his high

702
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:02,839
as I'm going to be after that you ever

703
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:04,278
smoked yourself sober or just like spent

704
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:06,119
yourself you're like I'm super high and

705
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,038
you take another dab and you're like

706
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,879
wait where'd it go hey you just you just

707
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,079
redlined you over the max you got to

708
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,440
start over now you got to start remoking

709
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:16,278
anyway I am rambly as [ __ ] Redline it

710
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,320
got called Redline because uh the

711
00:25:16,278 --> 00:25:19,398
Redline Bicycles you get red eyed and

712
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:21,079
you are as high as you're going to be

713
00:25:19,398 --> 00:25:23,239
you're hitting the red line and it's got

714
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:26,158
red Lebanese hash plant RL is already in

715
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,919
there let's keep moving uh red Lebanese

716
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,520
hash plant to arise I'll describe the

717
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,278
red Lebanese hash plant a little bit uh

718
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:35,000
the red Lebanese hash plant is a great

719
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:37,359
plant but in my opinion uh it's a little

720
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,599
bit wispy it could be more sturdy more

721
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,278
vigorous more structurally sound

722
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:42,918
everything else is awesome it Roots

723
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:45,480
quite quickly it tastes really good the

724
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:47,679
buzz is [ __ ] awesome um and real

725
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,360
quickly side note sidebar somebody

726
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,399
recently asked me if they're allowed to

727
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,519
smoke hash plants as flower or if it's

728
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:55,439
only for hash no bro enjoy the flow if

729
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,398
you grew that and it made good flour uh

730
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,519
smoke it that way it's just uh it would

731
00:25:57,398 --> 00:26:01,959
also make an excellent hash plant is

732
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:04,158
kind of why it got got called hash plant

733
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,399
and yes uh red line is a great washer

734
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,159
presser all that good stuff by the way

735
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,158
so the red Lebanese hash plant it's a

736
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,000
great hash plant uh it's got that old

737
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,278
school skunky sort of a turp to it the

738
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,200
only problem with it is it's not as

739
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:19,278
vigorous and structurally sound as I

740
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,480
would prefer uh it's got that oldw world

741
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:24,200
uh just land race sort of wispy

742
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,360
funkiness to it but um I knew that King

743
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:28,919
Solomon would fix it and he definitely

744
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:31,278
did so I bred the King Solomon a rise

745
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:33,159
male to the red Lebanese hash plant we

746
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,119
made red line let's talk about the

747
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:37,200
phenotypes that come out of that most of

748
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,918
the phenotypes are going to be bushy and

749
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,200
wide but also tall but not as tall as a

750
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,000
lot of my stuff it's still going to make

751
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,080
a big epical dominant top because that's

752
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,519
what King Solomon does but this one's

753
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,798
going to Bush out a little bit more

754
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:50,679
because that's what the red Lebanese

755
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,759
hash plant does it's not going to

756
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:54,159
stretch as much uh it's going to the

757
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,000
other one I said is going to double in

758
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,840
height this one uh not quite double but

759
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,599
probably close more like like what's the

760
00:26:58,839 --> 00:27:02,038
word uh it's going to 2/3 on you is

761
00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,240
about what it's going to do it's not

762
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:06,000
going to be as aggressively stretchy

763
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,120
that 21-day stretch isn't going to come

764
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,599
on and go shebang like the uh like the

765
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:11,639
fist bump it's going to stretch and then

766
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:13,599
just continue to grow it's not going to

767
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,038
be [ __ ] boom I'm stretchy out of

768
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,639
control it's going to do it more slowly

769
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,278
more controlled so you're going to get

770
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,360
less of a stretch but it is going to get

771
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:23,398
tall um if you top it I recommend to top

772
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,359
the red line take that big epical

773
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:27,719
dominant top out of there and top it and

774
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,000
you will get a bush of amazing beautiful

775
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,319
buds as especially if you are trellising

776
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,880
scrogging doing that sort of work then I

777
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:35,839
definitely recommend topping it take

778
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,000
that big top out of there uh you'll get

779
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,519
a lot more reaction from the plant in my

780
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,960
opinion in my experience make it bushy

781
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:46,000
and spread it out it's a fast grower it

782
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,798
is also a heavy feeder um don't feed it

783
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,319
as don't feed it as long as you would

784
00:27:47,798 --> 00:27:51,240
fist bump and I know you may not have

785
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:53,079
both to compare but the fist bump is

786
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:55,839
going to need more feeding than the red

787
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:58,359
line but again it is a moderately heavy

788
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,720
feeder it can handle uh one of the good

789
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:01,959
things about red line is it can handle

790
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,600
some temperature swings I don't

791
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,159
recommend getting your plants too hot or

792
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:07,879
too cold but if you do red line will

793
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,880
take it very well I've seen Red Line get

794
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,679
too cold in the winter I've also seen

795
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:13,399
Red Line get too hot in the summer it

796
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,759
seems to be able to handle both of those

797
00:28:13,398 --> 00:28:16,719
without getting too angry without

798
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,119
slowing down it still tasted good at

799
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,120
Harvest time it was still super

800
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,639
productive uh everything was perfect

801
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,759
even though we've had too hot and too

802
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,640
cold and in fact I've done both in the

803
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,119
same grow because I'm in Colorado I can

804
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,960
really [ __ ] up some plants here with my

805
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,959
environment and sometimes I really get

806
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,600
that opportunity and I have done it so

807
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,960
I've tortured red line and it seems to

808
00:28:32,599 --> 00:28:37,240
handle all abuse and temperature very

809
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:39,399
very well I can take droughts I haven't

810
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,038
overwatered it on purpose but I would

811
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:42,879
assume since it's got King Solomon in

812
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,119
there it can handle some [ __ ] it can

813
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,960
definitely take a drought because I've

814
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:47,719
drought tested it before all right now

815
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:50,000
let's talk about flowering time for Red

816
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:52,960
Line in most cases red line is going to

817
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
take around 9 or 10 weeks to flower

818
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,558
completely if you are flowering for

819
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,599
smokable flower now a lot of people that

820
00:28:57,558 --> 00:29:01,639
are going to grow Redline May grow it

821
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,119
for concentrates because this is a great

822
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:06,159
concentrate plant one thing you may

823
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:08,319
notice about Redline is that in some

824
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,000
phenotypes the tricomes do start to

825
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,240
develop early and these plants get

826
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,720
Frosty very early in the flowering phase

827
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,399
now I know a lot of you concentrate

828
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,319
makers you guys that wash the buds and

829
00:29:16,398 --> 00:29:20,719
then press it I know you guys like to

830
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:22,879
take the plants down early this may be

831
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,640
very advantageous for you to cut the

832
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
plants down early because the Tricom

833
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,399
start growing early which means they are

834
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,079
starting to develop early which means

835
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,239
you might even be able to cut down for

836
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:35,359
concentrates even earlier so that may be

837
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,120
advantageous for you concentrate makers

838
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,558
however if you're growing for flower I

839
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,879
do recommend letting it go that full

840
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:43,440
recommended 9 or 10 weeks all right now

841
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,159
once again let's wrap back around to the

842
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,320
main point of this question our friend

843
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,159
Richard was asking about the flavors and

844
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:52,398
Aromas of red Lon so let's focus on that

845
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,600
now uh the main thing I like about

846
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,278
Redline is what I call the oldw world

847
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,879
flavors and Aromas now I feel like

848
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,000
everything tastes like like some sort of

849
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,760
cake or some sort of dessert or some

850
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,759
sort of Little Debbie snack or something

851
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:07,038
at the gas station it all smells like

852
00:30:04,759 --> 00:30:09,440
that sort of snacks and treats now back

853
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:11,240
in the day weed smelled like weed it

854
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,558
smelled like cannabis it smelled like

855
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:16,000
ganja it smelled skunky it smelled

856
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,720
earthy it had a hint of spiciness to it

857
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,440
it had a very warm distinct smell it

858
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,919
wasn't hey I smell blueberries with a

859
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,440
hint of Muffins with a little bit of

860
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:26,038
frosting with a touch of Honey at the

861
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:28,278
end and it smelled like you might have

862
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:31,278
used a little bit of too much worm cast

863
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,440
and then I can smell a little bit of

864
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:33,919
what is that in there there's that bacon

865
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,720
grease at the end we didn't do all that

866
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,440
[ __ ] back in the day we went damn that

867
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:40,319
one's skunky or damn that one smells bad

868
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,000
that's how it used to be back in the day

869
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,398
and the redline turps smell like old

870
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,519
weed did back in the day it's got hints

871
00:30:45,398 --> 00:30:50,719
of gas it's got hints of skunk it's got

872
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:52,200
that warm spicy skunky smell to it that

873
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,960
we' had back in the day and that's

874
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,480
really one of the things I love about it

875
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,159
so my favorite descriptive words for

876
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,038
Redline are going to be skunky uh maybe

877
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,799
a little bit spicy and then warm weed

878
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:04,519
remember when weed hits when the smell

879
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,558
of cannabis hits my nose the first thing

880
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:09,278
I notice is warmth it smells warm it

881
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:11,079
smells Savory it doesn't smell like

882
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,960
candy most of the time and it's got that

883
00:31:11,079 --> 00:31:14,798
not candy smell to it now weed does

884
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,759
smell like candy but back in the day it

885
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,278
was warm and savory and skunky and

886
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:21,038
earthy uh maybe a little bit of like

887
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,720
different spices from the from the

888
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,440
kitchen might have been in there but it

889
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,240
didn't smell like candy and Bubblegum

890
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:28,440
and [ __ ] back in the day that's what I

891
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,159
think Red Line smells like is old School

892
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,320
oldw World turps old weed from back in

893
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:35,760
the day not not in a bad way but in a

894
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:38,480
classic way that a lot of us might miss

895
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,638
um before everything was uh blue dream

896
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,519
and Girl Scout cookies and biscotti and

897
00:31:40,638 --> 00:31:46,119
gelotti and [ __ ] Skittles and all

898
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,720
that it tasted like weed back in the day

899
00:31:46,119 --> 00:31:50,638
and that's what red line tastes like in

900
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,880
my opinion so my friend Richard um man

901
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:53,959
thank you for the great questions you

902
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,840
got me uh talking real good and you got

903
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,440
me to highlight two strains that a lot

904
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,240
of listeners have really been waiting

905
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,679
for some details on so ladies and

906
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:03,240
gentlemen boys and girls that is my

907
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,639
report on fist bump and Redline that's

908
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,399
my story and I am sticking to it before

909
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:09,240
I wrap this up I do want to give a shout

910
00:32:07,398 --> 00:32:11,158
out to my friend Kevin jodrey shout out

911
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,599
to Kevin jodrey a lot of you may know

912
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:15,159
Kevin from the ganier uh Kevin's a great

913
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,199
dude he's a great teacher he's an

914
00:32:15,159 --> 00:32:19,519
amazing [ __ ] grower uh a great

915
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,038
breeder a great dude all around I owe

916
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,000
Kevin a big shout out and a fist bump

917
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,278
shout out to my dude Kevin jodrey Kevin

918
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,679
I look forward to smoking a joint with

919
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:29,798
you soon my dude uh but anyway Kevin

920
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,159
jodrey has developed his um I'm not sure

921
00:32:29,798 --> 00:32:33,558
what he even calls it but he's got a way

922
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:35,919
of breaking down flavors in the Cannabis

923
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:39,879
industry and he has identified the main

924
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,080
flavors in cannabis as Earth fuel floral

925
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:44,120
and fruit and I definitely agree that

926
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,199
that is probably the base there maybe

927
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:47,638
some outliers in there I'm not sure uh

928
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,080
where everything would fall into that

929
00:32:47,638 --> 00:32:51,558
but if you can name a flavor I bet it

930
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:53,240
would fit closely in that color wheel uh

931
00:32:51,558 --> 00:32:56,000
so we'll talk about these a little bit

932
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,638
and this may in the future help you

933
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,240
understand my descriptions of cannabis

934
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:01,638
when I I say it tastes earthy it tastes

935
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,319
fuy it tastes like a mango um what is

936
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:05,278
what Kevin's trying to do is create a

937
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,798
language so when I say it tastes earthy

938
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:08,119
you understand what I mean instead of

939
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:09,599
just going Earth what the [ __ ] does that

940
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:11,239
taste like so I'm going to talk a little

941
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,839
bit about about that briefly then we're

942
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,038
going to wrap up this episode and go

943
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:18,240
take some dabs uh but the four things

944
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:19,839
Kevin talks about are Earth fuel floral

945
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,319
and fruit now I'm going to try to talk

946
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,398
about those flavors and maybe name a

947
00:33:21,319 --> 00:33:28,119
strain to go with each one of those

948
00:33:23,398 --> 00:33:30,798
earthy um Bubba Kush uh pre98 Bubba Cush

949
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:32,518
San Fernando Valley OG cush uh most of

950
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:34,079
your kushes are going to have that

951
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,120
earthy flavor it tastes a little bit

952
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:39,199
like dirt uh you may get a coffee flavor

953
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:41,439
sometimes it may translate to a

954
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,600
chocolate flavor Big Mountain fudge cake

955
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,480
has got earthy coffee dirt turps to it

956
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:49,599
so that is where the uh I think that is

957
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,278
where I think the Earth comes in as that

958
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,879
sort of a flavor that like uh the the

959
00:33:52,278 --> 00:33:56,558
cushy stuff the stuff that tastes like

960
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,760
dirt that smells like coffee uh that is

961
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:01,319
Earth how I would translate it now the

962
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:02,798
next one on the list is fuel fuel we've

963
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:06,278
all gotten gasoline right we've all

964
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:08,480
smelled diesel gas that is fuel what

965
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:11,079
strains smell like gas and fuel Sour

966
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,039
Diesel dude of course that classic sour

967
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:15,159
diesel smell is called diesel because it

968
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,960
smells like diesel fuel so that's where

969
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,599
the fuel comes from now let's get

970
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,760
creative here what if we had Earth and

971
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,599
fuel together what is that that's the

972
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,760
chem family in my mind that is where

973
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:28,720
chem comes in the chem dogs uh chem 4

974
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,399
chem 91 chem sister those are they've

975
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,279
got a little bit of fuel and a little

976
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,960
bit of Earth mixed in together that's

977
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,919
where you're getting that that that's

978
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,039
where the the Chim family lies that's

979
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,838
chemicals so when you put Earth and fuel

980
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:42,000
together that's where the chemical feel

981
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:43,398
chemical smell and Aroma comes from in

982
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,358
my mind I'm sure you guys can see where

983
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:47,918
this is going next we've got floral uh

984
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:51,119
the floral flavors are things like

985
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:53,000
lavender and lilacs and uh the strain

986
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,358
that comes to my mind well I'll say

987
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,679
Lavender is the first strain that comes

988
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:58,759
to my mind when we talk about floral but

989
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,599
if you if you smell lavender or lilacs

990
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,640
in your brain that's the Aromas that I

991
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:05,079
think of or roses even are floral that

992
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:06,799
sort of Flowery smell Grandma's bathroom

993
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,599
that sort of smell that's a flowery sort

994
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,800
of smell most of the time hopefully um

995
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,200
also Scarlet Bonas has a lot of Flowery

996
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,400
floral sort of turs to it in my opinion

997
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,799
in my

998
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:22,119
experience now the next one on our list

999
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,560
here is uh fruit and I'm sure most of

1000
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,400
the people in the room understand what

1001
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:27,920
I'm talking about when I say a fruity

1002
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:29,680
flavor what do I mean by fruit uh fruit

1003
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,559
can be anything from lemons to

1004
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:36,039
strawberries to mangoes to watermelons

1005
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:38,639
uh guavas kiwis um whatever fruit you

1006
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:41,440
can think of uh fruit that's a category

1007
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:42,879
of cannabis of ganja flavors of tpin so

1008
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,440
when we're talking about when I'm

1009
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,920
talking about these different flavors

1010
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,000
I'm just trying to give us all like a

1011
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,519
collective uh starting point to

1012
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,679
understand what I'm talking about and

1013
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:52,719
once again I want to give a big shout

1014
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:55,480
out to my buddy Kevin JRE for kind of

1015
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,598
listing and establishing this Baseline

1016
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:59,599
for naming these flavors this definitely

1017
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,519
defitely helps us all communicate better

1018
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,280
and together if we all know that when I

1019
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:05,719
say fruit I'm talking about fruit and

1020
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,200
then we can expand on that by saying

1021
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:10,519
lemons or oranges or watermelons or

1022
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:12,239
mangoes or guavas or cherries we can we

1023
00:36:10,519 --> 00:36:13,679
can make more categories from there but

1024
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:15,759
I think most things are going to fit

1025
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,879
into these four categories anyway I just

1026
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,359
wanted to touch on the way that a lot of

1027
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,119
us in the Cannabis industry think about

1028
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,799
flavors and Aromas and how we describe

1029
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,760
it and try to get everybody on the page

1030
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,160
here so that when we talk about turps we

1031
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,800
all kind of know what we're talking

1032
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,679
about and I'm going to rant about one

1033
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:31,800
more thing just to make it fun uh you

1034
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,199
don't hear me talk about the word tpping

1035
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,119
profile a lot you don't hear me talk

1036
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,838
about TPS a lot you don't hear me say

1037
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,838
this strain is high in humulene this

1038
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:41,679
train this strain is high in uh

1039
00:36:38,838 --> 00:36:43,279
terpinolene because uh the average bear

1040
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,598
the average cannabis consumer doesn't

1041
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,440
know what the [ __ ] that means anyway if

1042
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,559
I said yeah this one smells a lot like

1043
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,318
trinoline with some humulene in it and

1044
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,000
it's got some caropine in it people are

1045
00:36:51,318 --> 00:36:54,759
