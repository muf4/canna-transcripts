tab for most of the strains i say most

159
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,320

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:06,879
nice now i'm [ __ ] rambling let's talk

235
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,399
about some cannabis cultivation things

236
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,520
that's what this podcast is all about

237
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,519
we've been going for a long time i

238
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:13,359
haven't talked about cannabis yet

239
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,120
um i recently got a message from

240
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,840
somebody who was saying that they want

241
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,199
to start a new seed company they said

242
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:20,638
that they look up to my company that

243
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
they see that what i've been doing is

244
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,879
obviously working and they wanted ques

245
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,199
they had questions about how important

246
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,160
is seed packaging and how to package

247
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,879
seeds

248
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,560
i'm going to focus mainly on like seed

249
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,000
company with branding and all that sort

250
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,239
of stuff like an official company that's

251
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,559
going out for a seed vendor for retail

252
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
sales let's think about uh that type of

253
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,639
packaging and we'll also talk about just

254
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,278
brodabro peer-to-peer seed exchanges and

255
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,278
that sort of stuff uh when it comes to

256
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,919
commercial packaging something that's

257
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,000
very important is branding some people

258
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,079
are not going to know who you are what

259
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,679
you're about what your vibe is what your

260
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,839
motto is they don't know anything about

261
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,199
you except this package of seeds that

262
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,200
they've got in their hand that's the

263
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,440
only thing that is representing your

264
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,040
company your seeds your expectations of

265
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,480
those beans

266
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,879
so i think ah branding is very important

267
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:13,039
have the company name on my packaging

268
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,958
you can prominently see irie genetics

269
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:17,039
displayed at the top then it says

270
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,958
premium seeds it lets you know these are

271
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,719
premium seeds it tells you what the

272
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,319
brand is and what is in the package when

273
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,560
you flip it over on the back it tells

274
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,399
you the strain now in the middle of the

275
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,000
pack it says the straw on the top once

276
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,440
again it says irie genetics because i

277
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,600
want it to be redundant when you flip it

278
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,120
over you see it's irie genetics in the

279
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,120
middle i use a sticker that says the

280
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,278
strain it indicates what strain it is

281
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,959
sometimes i will put how many weeks it

282
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,360
takes to flower on that package

283
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,958
depending on how old my labels are

284
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
sometimes i do that sometimes i don't i

285
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,518
should be more

286
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,839
more fluid with doing that more

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
regularly but i'll put the brand the

288
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,640
brand on top the strain in the middle

289
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
then on the bottom something i find to

290
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,958
be very important i put my website

291
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,639
address why not have the web address on

292
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:58,639
there that way if there are any

293
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,080
questions any problems anything you want

294
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,399
to know more details you can go to the

295
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,639
website on my website there's a full

296
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,799
report on that string possibly with a

297
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,958
link to a podcast of that strain

298
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,319
possibly with discord info all kinds of

299
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,239
great [ __ ] linked up to it that you can

300
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,519
read about the whole strain get the info

301
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,919
you need so

302
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,759
the main things i think about are the

303
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,120
company name what's your company name

304
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,519
what are you called i'm obviously

305
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,839
iriegenetics that's printed on the very

306
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,560
front then it says premium seeds i

307
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,320
created a logo i did not create i had an

308
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,078
artist create me a logo big up to my

309
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,920
artist friends name's adam i believe

310
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,639
they made me a very cool logo that i

311
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,719
feel represents my brand very well um

312
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:38,319
obviously uh the name is irie which is a

313
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,079
jamaican word it's a patchwhile word

314
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,079
that means uh it's got a lot of meanings

315
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,919
to it but basically means to feel really

316
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,919
good it's most powerful the most

317
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,838
pleasing feeling you could ever imagine

318
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:48,958
i describe it as kind of like if you're

319
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,959
sitting on the beach or if you're

320
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,879
sitting on a hill a grassy hill and the

321
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,879
sun is setting and you see the waves

322
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,320
going maybe and you got your girl on one

323
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,000
side and the dog on the other maybe

324
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
you're smoking a fat joint and

325
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,360
everything is just cool man there's

326
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,200
nothing bothering you nothing's wrong

327
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,919
nothing could go wrong everything feels

328
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:09,040
right that is irie feeling irie got the

329
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:12,078
irie genetics so i my vibe and my brand

330
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:13,519
is obviously got that rasta reggae irie

331
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,359
sort of vibe to it so there's a lot of

332
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,039
red yellow and green colors in there

333
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,680
then i use a cross logo that comes

334
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,958
heavily from rasta culture then on the

335
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,399
back when we flip it over it's got a

336
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,599
cool little design there's another

337
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,600
little design hidden under the main

338
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,040
design also that you may not notice but

339
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,959
then on the back

340
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,039
i feel like it's got my face on it and a

341
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,399
website address i feel like putting my

342
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,240
face on there really puts a lot of

343
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,480
transparency to my brand that is me i'm

344
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,240
the guy to that brand uh you know who to

345
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,759
talk to when you email it you know when

346
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,120
you email my company you know who you're

347
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,480
talking to you know who the customer

348
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,879
service guy is you know who made the

349
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,720
seeds you know whose ideas these are you

350
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,559
know who you're representing uh and

351
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,240
whose product you're buying so on the

352
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,518
top it says irie genetics in the middle

353
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,839
it's got the strain on the bottom it's

354
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,278
got the website with my little face logo

355
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,200
on the bottom of the packaging so i feel

356
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,799
like we cover most of the important

357
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,120
aspects that are on the outside we've

358
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,599
got branding and we've got contact info

359
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,679
and we've got product information a lot

360
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
of people will put disclaimers of some

361
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,039
sort this is a novelty item souvenir

362
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,040
purposes only it depends on where you're

363
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,719
shipping your product that is legal

364
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:14,078
stuff that i would consult your legal

365
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,240
team with i don't add that to my

366
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,719
packages because many of my vendors will

367
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:20,480
staple a card to the package or a big

368
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,920
order will get one card that says

369
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,519
whatever it needs to say depending on

370
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:26,000
where it is going if it's a novelty a

371
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,240
souvenir a cbd a hemp item that will be

372
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,399
attached later on as necessary depending

373
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,919
on where it's being distributed so the

374
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,000
first thing i think about is branding

375
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:35,599
put your brand name on there this is the

376
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,759
one op this is like your business card

377
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,079
this is the one opportunity people get

378
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,838
to identify your brand associate it with

379
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,838
something in their head if you draw a

380
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
dagger on it some people may not be into

381
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,040
that but the people that are into

382
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:49,360
daggers are definitely going to remember

383
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,120
it if you put a lollipop on there some

384
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,800
of my packages have really cool logos

385
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
the lollipop logo gets a lot of

386
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,799
attention the blue raspberry truffle

387
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:58,399
logo gets a lot of attention orange gasm

388
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,719
has a fancy logo it gets a lot of

389
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,958
attention those packages get noticed

390
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,639
after many strains get success i will

391
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,159
create a specific package for that

392
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,240
stream but most of my stuff comes in a

393
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,078
generic package with irie genetics

394
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,079
premium seeds the cross logo you flip it

395
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,838
over it's got the brand the strain name

396
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,439
and the website on the bottom keep it

397
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
simple but give all of the pertinent

398
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,360
information that is needed then people

399
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,879
can contact me from there kind of got

400
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,240
rambly forgot where i was going the next

401
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,720
thing we should think about is

402
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,320
protecting those seeds what is inside

403
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,399
that package is the most important part

404
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,360
the branding is great contact info is

405
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,919
good

406
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,440
having a an identity on a table filled

407
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,278
with seed packs in your seed packets

408
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,639
standing out that is really cool but are

409
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,559
the seeds in there crushed because

410
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,039
they've got to get mailed handled and

411
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:43,039
delivered so always put them inside of

412
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:45,198
some sort of protective

413
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,120
packaging of some sort i buy

414
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,559
bubble containers from a company called

415
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,198
lacontainers.com they're quite expensive

416
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,399
i buy them by 3000 at a time to be quite

417
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,479
honest with you and it is quite

418
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,399
expensive shipping on those things is

419
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,360
super expensive they ship from la via

420
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,679
ups uh really expensive that that eats

421
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,480
up a big cost of seed sales right there

422
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:08,719
it's just the packaging uh so i use the

423
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,320
bubbles with the foam insert i open up

424
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,839
the clam shell bubble put the seeds in

425
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,639
there put the foam insert over it and

426
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,440
then i close it then that goes inside of

427
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:19,440
a 3x3 baggie with the folded card inside

428
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:22,959
with all the info those all slide

429
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,040
together then just for security purposes

430
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:27,518
for safety for peace of mind i like to

431
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,360
heat seal most of my packages if you get

432
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,720
them directly from me they might not be

433
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,480
heat sealed but if i send them to a

434
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,000
vendor i try to make sure they're heat

435
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,360
sealed before they go out so they cannot

436
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,639
be tampered with

437
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,159
if they come from me and they're not

438
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,440
heat sealed they came straight from me

439
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,120
bro the only person that [ __ ] with

440
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,800
them was me and then if you plan on

441
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,839
reselling them or something just tell

442
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,719
them you got them straight from me it

443
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,800
should be legit but um yeah i seal most

444
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,800
of the packs that go out so they are in

445
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,919
a protective bubble in a foam so they

446
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,120
don't rattle around too much in the

447
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,958
packaging and also so they don't go

448
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
flying out when you open that

449
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,638
that gets put inside of a baggie which

450
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,000
has got a card folded inside of it for

451
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,519
all the info also that card um keeps the

452
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,958
light out now the seeds are protected

453
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,720
from the light then that gets heat

454
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,719
sealed then i bundle them in packs of

455
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,160
five they go into a container that is

456
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,879
labeled properly

457
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,639
that's how those go but mainly think

458
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,559
about branding put your brand name on

459
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,720
there the strain name as much strain

460
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,799
info as you can and then some contact

461
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,639
info i think my website info is great

462
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,479
sometimes i do include a sticker on the

463
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,240
inside with a link to my discord so if

464
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,839
people want to join the discord they can

465
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,919
check that out as well but i try not to

466
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,240
put too many confusing things inside

467
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,639
there now keep this in mind i do come

468
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,680
from the music industry so when you look

469
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,159
at my packaging my packages are designed

470
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,758
as record labels if you look at an album

471
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,319
like an album yeah guys we're going that

472
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,079
old people vinyl is coming back back in

473
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,519
the day we had these big now this is

474
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,000
older than me even but back in the day

475
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,399
we had vinyls i grew up with cds it's a

476
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,879
square case with a square design all the

477
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,879
cd covers were a square i always wanted

478
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,958
to be in a [ __ ] successful rock and

479
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,240
roll band or some [ __ ] i had fun i did

480
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,078
my thing but this is where i'm supposed

481
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
to be is in the cannabis industry but i

482
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,239
did tour with a lot of bands i did a lot

483
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,479
of work with a lot of bands a lot of my

484
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,600
uh art and design and branding ideas

485
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,959
come from the music industry so it's all

486
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,120
about catching somebody's eye and

487
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,039
standing out and kind of identifying

488
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,519
your so in the music industry if you're

489
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,679
metal or some sort of hard rock stuff

490
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,198
use skulls and like that blood drip sort

491
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:26,479
of [ __ ] logo right we already know

492
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:28,240
what that is uh if you use um a certain

493
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,680
kind of font we know that you're a rap

494
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,519
group if you use a certain kind of font

495
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,120
we know that you're a pop group we've

496
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,720
just identified certain things with

497
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,078
certain if you see the k you know that's

498
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,278
kmart if you see that lady with their

499
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,879
legs behind her head you know that's

500
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,078
starbucks they're just certain things

501
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,320
inside of our brain they give us a

502
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,399
certain idea i've learned how to do that

503
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,079
through branding through bands with my

504
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,879
seed company so i've learned how to

505
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:51,039
identify myself create a vibe and stand

506
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:53,039
out with my packaging so i think a lot

507
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,399
of that came from the end the music

508
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:56,480
industry is where i get a lot of that

509
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,759
vibe a lot of those ideas if you notice

510
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
a lot of my [ __ ] looks like a record

511
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,839
label it's like the band name the album

512
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,839
name you flip it over the songs are

513
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,600
listed on the back here's our website

514
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,360
that's a lot of how albums do it that's

515
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,879
kind of how i was doing it and then i

516
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,038
found a really cool artist shout out to

517
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,360
my buddy kevin who does great art for me

518
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,119
also shout out to dp710

519
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,958
but these guys do great art and then i

520
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,239
put those on the packages that makes it

521
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,318
a lot of fun all right i've been

522
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,318
rambling for a little bit here i did say

523
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,480
i was going to read a cannabis

524
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,918
cultivation question i do have one great

525
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,279
question here in front of me i said one

526
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,520
great question i hope you guys enjoy it

527
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,759
as much as i do this one came from our

528
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:33,519
friend who calls himself used to be cool

529
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,359
every time i read that i say you're

530
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,000
listening to the podcast bro so you are

531
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,519
still cool in my book don't ever think

532
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,200
you're not cool bro you're cool until

533
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,960
you decide you're not cool anymore it's

534
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,880
just like getting old you're not old

535
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,480
until you decide you are i'm rambling

536
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,840
let me stay focused a little bit this

537
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,160
one says i had five plants in my 4x4

538
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,240
which included two orange gasm plants

539
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,200
all of them but one orange gasm finished

540
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,200
between 55 and 60 days the remaining

541
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
orange gasm appears to be within

542
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,840
appeared to be within 10 days of

543
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,600
finishing so to help it along i followed

544
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,319
your pro tip about switching the lights

545
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,839
back to 18 6. let me talk about that

546
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,918
because maybe people don't listen to

547
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:13,519
every episode i've talked about this in

548
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,840
several episodes this is a technique and

549
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,079
a method that i do use quite often when

550
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,480
i'm flowering my plants at the end of

551
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,079
flower approximately 10 to 14 days

552
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,319
before harvest around the same time that

553
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:27,119
i begin to flush i put my grow lights

554
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:30,079
back on an 18 hour on and six hour off

555
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:32,479
cycle my theory and what i've proven by

556
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:34,399
doing this several times is that my buds

557
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,960
get chunkier they get more dense and

558
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,480
they finish up more quickly so that is

559
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,200
why i'm doing this i'm turning my lights

560
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,200
to 18.6 for a faster finish and a

561
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,640
chunkier product now let's talk about

562
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,840
what our friend is doing and what has

563
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,280
happened here

564
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:51,119
i followed your advice and switched the

565
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:53,359
lights to 18 6. i'm now on day 67 and

566
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,839
the remaining orange gasm still looks

567
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,359
like it's about 10 days from finishing

568
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,199
i'm not sure what to do if it doesn't

569
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,759
finish within the 14 days of the light

570
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,480
switch can i go back to 12 12 if it's

571
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,759
not done and then okay i know i know

572
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,000
where we are it says thanks for any

573
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:11,519
advice you can offer now this is a great

574
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,038
question i'm going to start off by um

575
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,359
i'm not going to scold you but i'm going

576
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,119
to give you some constructive criticism

577
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,119
that i keep saying when we talk about

578
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,759
the 186 because i need to get this piece

579
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,558
of advice out and make it more clear

580
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,000
many people have taken to the 18 6 idea

581
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,319
at the end of flower it seems to be

582
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,919
successful for a lot of people

583
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,240
one thing i want to make clear and

584
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,679
reiterate and remind you that i think is

585
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,880
a better practice

586
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,280
is to not do this the first time you run

587
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,120
a plant run the plant the first time

588
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,240
find out how long that plant takes to

589
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,599
finish then do this the second time we

590
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,319
don't know how long that plant is going

591
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:50,159
to go our dude used to be cool here

592
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,519
started too early now the plant is not

593
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,798
done because he didn't know the plant

594
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,798
doesn't have any experience with this

595
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,480
cultivar and now he's got himself in a

596
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:59,279
weird position and he's not sure what to

597
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:01,200
do so my very first piece of advice is

598
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,359
don't do this on the first run with a

599
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
new plant run that plant once run that

600
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,599
plant maybe twice find out how long is

601
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,918
ideal for that that plant to finish that

602
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,918
particular plant to finish up then do

603
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,600
this technique the second time and see

604
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:15,200
if you can reduce the flowering time

605
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,759
have some data to compare it to the

606
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,919
first time would be my suggestion now

607
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,000
unfortunately we're past that we can't

608
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,520
go back in time we can't grow this one

609
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,759
more time and then figure it out we've

610
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,440
got to work with what we've got so let's

611
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:30,158
find a solution

612
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,640
what i would do is keep going the way

613
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,880
that you are going keep going do not put

614
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,759
it back to 12 12. you've already gone

615
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,760
from 18 6 to 12 12 back to 18 6. we

616
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,200
don't want to confuse this plant anymore

617
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,480
that's when you may get seeds that's

618
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,480
when you may get manners that's when you

619
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,159
may get problems that's when it just may

620
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,240
completely [ __ ] freak out and ruin

621
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,880
everything so i would not go back i

622
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,279
would keep going until the moment i see

623
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,520
signs of absolute re-veg once you know

624
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,720
it's for sure re-vegging on you that's

625
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,319
when i would cut down you should be

626
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,919
flushing already so it's going to be

627
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:01,759
ready to cut whenever you're ready to

628
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,679
cut it so as soon as you see that

629
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,279
revenge cut but

630
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,360
um it'll take a little bit it's not

631
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,119
going to happen to re-veg right away

632
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:10,719
you've got a pretty strong plant if it's

633
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,158
still taken away if it's still taking

634
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,000
time to finish that means it will take

635
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,440
longer to re-veg as well

636
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,359
that's just a commonality in the

637
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,120
genetics if it takes longer to finish it

638
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,519
will take longer to revenge so that's a

639
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,119
good thing keep it going wait until you

640
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:26,079
see signs of revenge you've got more

641
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,479
than the 14 days i say 10 to 14 because

642
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:33,199
that is ideal you won't see signs of

643
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:35,200
revenge until at least 17 21 maybe 24 26

644
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,558
days pay attention to the plant keep

645
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,960
going and as soon as you see that

646
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:40,158
revenge then cut it down that's what i

647
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,720
would do

648
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,480
um i would not do the 12 12 it's had

649
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
enough i said this before it's already

650
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,079
stressed out it's already had enough uh

651
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,319
it will get confused it'll get pissed

652
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,399
off i don't know what it will do uh if

653
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,439
you put it back under 1212 that that

654
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,559
really could freak that plant out so i

655
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,159
think uh

656
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,599
the number one thing to take away from

657
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,120
this and my dude i know it's already too

658
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,719
late we can't go back in time but the

659
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:05,199
number one thing that i would take away

660
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
from this is do not do this with new

661
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,720
cuts that we don't know how long they

662
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,120
take to finish because that is how you

663
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,960
run into this exact situation to wrap it

664
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:15,119
up i would keep going until you see

665
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,640
signs of reef edge uh reef edge will be

666
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,798
little leaves poking out of the top of

667
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,640
the buds uh the bottom leaves will start

668
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,960
curling up kind of weird i would keep

669
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
going until you see that you're already

670
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,600
flushing so it'll be clean by the time

671
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,200
you cut it down as soon as you see that

672
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:30,719
revenge starting cut it down unless it

673
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,240
gets ready before that which it might

674
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,200
that's another thing i wanted to touch

675
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,798
on

676
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,120
since you're going at this light pace it

677
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,480
is finishing more rapidly than you think

678
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,038
uh you're saying it appeared to be

679
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,120
within 10 days looks like it's still 10

680
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:46,000
days if it doesn't finish in within the

681
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,599
14 within the next few days this plan is

682
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,359
going to show a lot of progress it is

683
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,879
getting a lot of light it is going to

684
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:53,439
progress much more quickly than you're

685
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,960
anticipating because it is at the end if

686
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,320
it's not already turning yellow the

687
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,720
leaves are getting droopy that will

688
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,960
happen very soon uh it will begin to go

689
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
into senescence and it will be done uh

690
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,038
before too long just naturally because

691
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,639
the plant knows that it's just about

692
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,200
time for that plant to be done so i

693
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,400
think you'll be all right and if not

694
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,480
you're gonna have to cut down a plant

695
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,200
that is a little bit too early it's not

696
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,798
quite done but ah that's a learning

697
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,798
lesson and

698
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,798
if you cut down orange gasm i think

699
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,879
you'll still have if you cut down orgasm

700
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,319
too early i think you'll still be happy

701
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,440
you'll still have a satisfying outcome

702
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,839
because it's still going to be a head

703
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,279
ringer of a buzz that sativa buzz is

704
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,279
really strong when you cut it down early

705
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,639
so even if it's a little bit early you

706
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,798
still may get a real head ripping

707
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,960
psychedelic sativa buzz out of that even

708
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,960
though it didn't finish as long as we

709
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,640
could have let it go my dude used to be

710
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,919
cool it's been great hearing from you i

711

grateful so thank you for that let's

747
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,158
keep moving it says leading to the

748
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,720
question i found two plants that i have

749
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,640
selected to breed for very different yet

750
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,679
specific reasons and then he talks about

751
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,600
the plants i don't think i'm going to

752
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,159
talk too much about that

753
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:05,839
he says one has lateral branches okay we

754
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,360
can skip a lot of this it says the

755
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:08,959
second plant they talk about the second

756
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:10,399
plant now i know the answer to this

757
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,159
question is which is why i'm able to

758
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,240
skip over some of this i did pre-read

759
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,000
this it goes on it says i know part of

760
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,480
this was covered in a previous episode

761
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,679
but i cannot seem to find it but which

762
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,240
of these plants should i reverse my goal

763
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,919
is basically to get buds and terps as

764
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,839
well as the shorter flowering time from

765
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:30,720
the tall skinny one and get the

766
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,720
structure and vigor from the short one

767
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,960
it seems logical to reverse the taller

768
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,640
one as it will seem it will have an

769
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,480
easier time pollinating the shorter

770
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
plant more thoroughly that's a good

771
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,880
logical approach to that but i'm not

772
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,200
sure the best way to go just because it

773
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,600
seems to make sense to me i attached

774
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,120
pics he goes on to say i did attach pics

775
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:50,719
i did look at the pictures i'll have

776
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,239
some feedback on that it says

777
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,038
respectively and i hope they give you a

778
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,798
better uh mean to my goals thank you for

779
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,960
the time bro any advice would mean a lot

780
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:01,519
to me i'll be sure to give my mom a hug

781
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,400
for both of us as well p.s okay and then

782
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,798
he said there's no need to give him a

783
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,400
shout out so i skipped a lot of the

784
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,400
plant description here because in this

785
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,159
message your plant descriptions are not

786
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,200
uh super important to the audience i

787
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,640
know what your goal is i know what

788
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,319
you're going for i don't need to read

789
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,559
the long descriptions here you've got

790
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,798
the right idea i think

791
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,200
you answered your own question with your

792
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:23,278
own intuition you said it seems logical

793
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,960
to reverse the taller one

794
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,798
something inside of you was saying to do

795
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,480
that and if you don't do that you're

796
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,038
always going to wonder what you would

797
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,798
have done if you what you would have

798
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,519
done if you did that and didn't do the

799
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:37,278
other thing so my first advice is always

800
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,519
follow your intuition if something

801
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,839
inside of you says to reverse that one

802
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:43,599
as a breeder as a plant grower as the

803
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,839
person in charge of this product as the

804
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,918
artist involved here do what your heart

805
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:50,000
is telling you to do what your intuition

806
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:51,759
says when it comes to breeding i often

807
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,519
say learn about mendel charts learn

808
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,359
about alieal charts learn about dominant

809
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,400
recessive genes learn about codominant

810
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,359
genes

811
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,679
learn about filial generations learn how

812
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:03,439
to label things then once you've got all

813
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,120
that stuff figured out

814
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,558
forget about it and grow from your heart

815
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,719
and breed with love and use your

816
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,798
intuition when you look at two plants in

817
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,319
a grow room something's gonna go man if

818
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,759
that plant and that plant got together

819
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:16,000
and made seeds and made plants they

820
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,798
would be amazing do that it seems like

821
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,960
you're on that path which is the passion

822
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,480
the desire the grow from your heart the

823
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,798
breed with love that's the most

824
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:27,038
important part of it um then seeing what

825
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,119
comes out of it is the most fun if you

826
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:31,519
are making a project that is assigned by

827
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,759
me that's an assignment that's work uh

828
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:35,599
that's a project that you're just doing

829
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,079
do what you love to do do what your

830
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,158
heart is calling for you to do and

831
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,480
also my next piece of advice is do the

832
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,760
other way also because ah this isn't

833
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,839
going to be your last time breeding

834
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,519
seeds your only time breeding do them

835
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,000
both and see what they both do then in

836
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,200
the future breed them together that's i

837
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,359
know it sounds crazy it sounds like a

838
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,038
lot but as a breeder who's way ahead of

839
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,719
you in this breeding game who knows how

840
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,158
this uh i don't want to say addiction

841
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,679
but that's how this addiction goes but

842
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,600
that's how this passion goes you're

843
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,200
going to make some seeds out of plant a

844
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,639
to plant b and you're going to grow them

845
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,558
and you're going to go hmm and you're

846
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,360
going to do plant b to plant a and

847
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:08,398
you're going to grow up and then you're

848
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:10,158
going to see two plants and they're

849
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:12,479
going to go oh [ __ ] and then you're

850
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,480
going to cross those and that one is

851
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,240
going to be your [ __ ] the mastermind

852
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:18,240
right there that's going to be the ninja

853
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,319
samurai warrior yoda buddha right there

854
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,480
that you're looking for so my first

855
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,439
advice is use your intuition follow your

856
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,000
heart

857
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,600
do what your heart told you to do if not

858
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,278
that's almost

859
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,359
a lot of things in life follow your

860
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,278
heart use your intuition because if you

861
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:35,119
don't if there's something that you want

862
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:36,398
to do and you don't do it when you're

863
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,000
too old to do it you're gonna be like

864
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,759
[ __ ] i should have done that i'm gonna i

865
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,200
wish i would have done that like you're

866
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,558
gonna you're gonna really that's when

867
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,840
you have regrets is when you don't do

868
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,359
the [ __ ] that you thought you should do

869
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,599
so get that [ __ ] done do the one you

870
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,519
have the idea for use that taller one as

871
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,439
your first pollinator then again the

872
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,278
second time reverse that [ __ ] do the

873
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,798
other one and let that tall one receive

874
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,519
pollen um

875
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:59,119
also it really depends on who and we

876
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,200
don't know this until we breed we don't

877
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,798
know which plant has dominant and uh

878
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,000
recessive and co-dominant traits we

879
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:05,839
don't know which traits are gonna take

880
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,119
over the mix you've never bred with

881
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,199
either one of these plants we don't know

882
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,079
what either one of them adds so we don't

883
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,840
know what to expect you could uh

884
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,599
possibly and this is just hypothetical

885
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,678
you could reverse plant a and pollinate

886
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:20,240
plant b and the outcome could either be

887
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,080
all plant a or all plant b you could do

888
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,319
the opposite and both of those effects

889
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,839
could be the out the outcome or you

890
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,240
could reverse plant a and pollinate

891
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:30,319
plant b and it could be a 50 50 mix you

892
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,319
could reverse plant b and pollinate a

893
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,158
and it could be 70 30 on the outcome on

894
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,079
the phenotypes we don't know what

895
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,840
they're offering it could be all

896
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,759
intersex plants it could be all

897
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:42,079
intersects if you do it one way and all

898
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,919
solid fems if you do it the other way so

899
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,599
really we just have to breed with these

900
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,360
plants is really the only true way to

901
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,918
find out you have to breed them make the

902
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:52,079
crosses grow them take a lot of notes

903
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,520
and pay a lot of attention but that is

904
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:55,759
where the passion comes from that is

905
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,359
what the passion is all about that's why

906
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:00,240
we're growing from our heart and

907
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,000
breeding with love my dude who wants to

908
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,240
remain anonymous i really hope i gave

909
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
you some useful advice my main piece of

910
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,839
advice with this one is follow your

911
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
intuition do the thing that first
