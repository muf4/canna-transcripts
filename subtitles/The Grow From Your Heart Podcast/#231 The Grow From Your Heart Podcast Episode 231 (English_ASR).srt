00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,900
let's talk about what I'm dabbing on I

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,879
just took a giant dab of some lemon

28
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,410
Geoffrey hi cannabinoid full spectrum

29
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,359
extract with a little bit of height herb

30
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:19,810
full spectrum extract pour it into the

31
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:22,090
banger and it can I change my BAE I wish

32
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:23,590
you guys were here to dab with me one of

33
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,270
these days maybe right I want to talk

34
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:27,159
about a new toy I got you guys I picked

35
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:28,450
up a thing called a thermal banger I've

36
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,670
talked about a banger on the show before

37
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,740
a banger is basically it attaches to a

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,540
rig which is basically a small bubbler

39
00:01:32,739 --> 00:01:36,640
or a pipe or maybe even a bong I prefer

40
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,940
a smaller bubbler I like a handheld

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,000
sidecar size sort of bubbler thing

42
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,859
Google a hitman hammerhead sidecar those

43
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,478
are some of my favorite rigs they're

44
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:47,739
affordable and I like the style and the

45
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,459
function of the size and shape it's

46
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:52,359
perfect but anyway I get the 14 mil mail

47
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:54,250
attachment coming out here the the joint

48
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,439
coming out then the banger attaches to

49
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:57,819
that it's got a 14 millimeter female

50
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:59,679
then it comes up and it's got a 90

51
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:01,059
degree turn on it been on that it's got

52
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,440
like a it looks like maybe an

53
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,420
upside-down thimbles made out of glass

54
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,950
it's all glass it looks like a thimble

55
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,689
and then on the inside of that is a

56
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:09,969
smaller thimble on the inside so it's

57
00:02:07,689 --> 00:02:11,349
maybe like a big like a soda bottle lid

58
00:02:09,969 --> 00:02:13,389
or a water bottle lid it's about that

59
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:14,739
diameter then a little bit taller than

60
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:16,238
that maybe one and a half of those tall

61
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:18,640
then on the inside is another one

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,379
another cylinder I guess you could say

63
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,179
it looks like a cup with a cup inside of

64
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:24,069
it a bowl with a cup inside of it and

65
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:25,930
you keep the outside and you put the dab

66
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:27,459
on the inside one and then he put so

67
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,140
when I bought it they didn't have these

68
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:32,049
caps available I bought it over at

69
00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,548
elevate glass on 517 south they own when

70
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,659
I bought the thermal banger is what it's

71
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:35,830
called they didn't have these bubble

72
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:37,090
caps so I bought it and I took it home

73
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,320
and I tried to take a dab with a normal

74
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,729
carbon cap but it just wasn't doing it

75
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,829
for me a senators I like that kind of

76
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:43,629
sucks the next time I went to higher

77
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,820
elevations masterpiece productions which

78
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,409
is elevates sister store just across

79
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:48,879
town like hey how'd you like your

80
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:49,840
thermal banger I was like it sucks and

81
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,250
they're like do you have a bubble cap

82
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,170
for it and I was like no sir I do not

83
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,340
and they're like let's get you a bubble

84
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:57,799
cap for us and I've got a bubble cap

85
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,909
and let me tell you the buffle cap in

86
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,310
the thermal banger make an amazing

87
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:03,469
[ __ ] dab I've been getting extra high

88
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,789
lately I mix the dabs I already take

89
00:03:03,469 --> 00:03:07,520
gigantic dabs and it just makes the

90
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:09,139
gigantic dab I take seem even gigantic

91
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,840
her which I know isn't even a word but

92
00:03:09,139 --> 00:03:13,729
it is now when you dab with me take

93
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,039
gigantic her dabs that should be a

94
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:18,949
bumper sticker take gigantic er dabs

95
00:03:16,039 --> 00:03:20,090
it's good for you anyway let's talk

96
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:21,379
about what I'm smoking on that's put me

97
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,120
in this condition I talked about the

98
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:24,979
lemon Geoffrey high cannabinoid and

99
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,759
Haider full-spectrum extracts I've also

100
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:29,719
got some of this star dog ambrosia I

101
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,768
just held it up to the microphone like

102
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:32,209
you guys would be able to smell it

103
00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:33,920
that's that's how high that [ __ ] made me

104
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:36,170
anyway I've also got some screaming

105
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:37,609
tangerines which smells it just screams

106
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:39,349
tangerines we need to add that the whole

107
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,330
room smells like a tangerine for a

108
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:42,439
little bit I've also got the gorilla

109
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,060
glue we talked about in a previous

110
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:45,979
previous episode I went back and bought

111
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,860
more because I like what it does to my

112
00:03:45,979 --> 00:03:51,139
face it makes me nice and high that's my

113
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:54,350
the lemony stuff is the rectory are the

114
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:55,939
medical cannabis for me a little better

115
00:03:54,349 --> 00:03:58,039
I think that when I'm dabbing stuff that

116
00:03:55,939 --> 00:03:59,479
has like citrus and lemons that's kind

117
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:01,429
of more medical for me when I smoke this

118
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,919
gassy flavored stuff that's recreational

119
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,900
that gives me a recreational high trust

120
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,059
me I think if I take enough dabs of any

121
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,560
strain it becomes recreational but still

122
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,569
recreationally use as medical use

123
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,640
because if it makes you feel better it

124
00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:14,750
makes you feel better it's mental health

125
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,089
it's physical health it's all related

126
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:19,910
anyway the gorilla glue gets me really

127
00:04:17,089 --> 00:04:21,768
high they had some oh I've got some star

128
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:23,180
dog batter also what else do we have

129
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,829
sitting here's some Clementine I like

130
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,689
this Clementine it's more flavour then

131
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:28,250
he gets me high but maybe that's because

132
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:29,990
it's fixing something that I'm not

133
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:32,720
noticing but I really do enjoy the

134
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:36,319
flavor of the Clementine and also what

135
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,210
did I get the the sour amnesia it

136
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,439
smelled really good in the jar and it

137
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:40,819
smells pretty good in the jar I've

138
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,639
stirred it up and I've dabbed out of it

139
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:44,990
a lot but the flavor I'm smelling it

140
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,449
again the flavor just doesn't come

141
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:48,769
through in a DAB it doesn't that flavor

142
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,599
I was hoping it different there would be

143
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:53,240
more flavor to it the high is okay it's

144
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,229
acceptable but I that flavour just

145
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,970
didn't come through that was what I

146
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:57,288
bought it for anyway I've got a whole

147
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,510
bunch of tasty hatcher I've been dabbing

148
00:04:57,288 --> 00:05:01,939
a whole smorgasbord of it today I've

149
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:03,560
also got some lemon Geoffrey terms and

150
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:05,089
I've got some of the Clementine Terp so

151
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,490
I don't dunked a little bit of the

152
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:09,269
Clementine batter into the Clementine

153
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,370
turps and took a little

154
00:05:09,269 --> 00:05:13,469
that citrus flavor is always nice I've

155
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:15,629
learned that if I overheat the

156
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,700
Clementine if a Clementine dab gets too

157
00:05:15,629 --> 00:05:20,189
hot in my opinion it tastes a little bit

158
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,680
like orange chicken or some sort of

159
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,939
orange flavored Chinese food which I

160
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,670
know sounds weird because I don't even

161
00:05:23,939 --> 00:05:27,990
eat chicken but it tastes like some kind

162
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,660
of Chinese food is what it reminds me of

163
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,300
orange syrup II think that like sticky

164
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,740
orange syrup that comes on Chinese food

165
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:37,560
maybe I'm crazy no I certainly am crazy

166
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:38,639
but maybe that opinion is crazy because

167
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,139
I'm gonna take a quick drink I'm not

168
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,430
even gonna press pause she's gonna take

169
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,909
a drink moisten up throat and we'll keep

170
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:43,910
talking here

171
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:51,500
all right hopefully that keeps me going

172
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,660
for a couple of minutes so let's update

173
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,100
you guys on a breeding project I've been

174
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,650
talking about a breeding project quite

175
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,080
frequently on the podcast and I am proud

176
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,219
to say that those seeds have been

177
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,769
successfully harvested there are quite a

178
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,390
few great new crosses some of them were

179
00:06:03,769 --> 00:06:07,189
just testers that will probably be kept

180
00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:09,259
privately for myself the Platinum tangi

181
00:06:07,189 --> 00:06:11,120
to arise I don't know how how much

182
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:12,620
that'll get spread out that'll probably

183
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,000
stay right here in my vault I'll grow

184
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:16,550
those out find the great ones and then

185
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,199
maybe breed with or two that the Kim for

186
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:20,689
to arise won't go too far but things I

187
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,250
do plan on making for like a production

188
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,209
run I have to test them you guys have to

189
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,379
see if they're worth a [ __ ] but

190
00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:25,819
something I know they'll be good just

191
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:27,800
because I'm a good breeder I have a good

192
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:29,420
intuition I grow from my heart breed

193
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,180
with love I know these are gonna be well

194
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,819
the Capleton to arise the Kalonji to

195
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,350
arise flow to arise those things are

196
00:06:34,819 --> 00:06:37,668
gonna be bred I'm sure that those will

197
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,280
get released because I like to make a

198
00:06:37,668 --> 00:06:41,649
lot of those the Platinum tangi was just

199
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:44,689
kind of a personal project for myself

200
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:46,819
the Platinum tangi came before a couple

201
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:50,149
those won't go anywhere but Capleton

202
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:52,189
flow Kalonji Kush maybe even the

203
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:53,539
redheaded stranger to arise but like I

204
00:06:52,189 --> 00:06:54,560
said I got a test them all see if

205
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,669
they're worth a [ __ ] before I let

206
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,290
anybody even touch them

207
00:06:55,668 --> 00:06:59,060
once I've tested a few I'll give them

208
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,080
out to other people to test so they'll

209
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,850
go through two or three rounds of

210
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,800
testing before they were ever even be

211
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,919
giving out as freebies or for sale

212
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:08,600
anywhere so that'll be a while but

213
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:11,418
there's a lot of whole new great [ __ ]

214
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:14,600
there's Jeff Shoji to arise hell's OG to

215
00:07:11,418 --> 00:07:18,349
arise Kalonji kush canadensis

216
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,600
camphor critical mass platinum tangi did

217
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,070
a whole bunch of cool stuff to arise to

218
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,410
see the plants have been so the way I

219
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:26,418
did it this time I cut down the plant ID

220
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:27,830
foliated it heavily I took almost all of

221
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:29,930
the leaves off of the plant then I

222
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,609
bucked the buds off of the sticks and

223
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:33,168
then I just put all of the buds into

224
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,639
Tupperware dishes and they're carefully

225
00:07:33,168 --> 00:07:36,439
labeled with what plant they are and

226
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,360
they're all sitting in a little area

227
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:40,579
they're just drying out now and when

228
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,900
they dry I will go and just crumble them

229
00:07:40,579 --> 00:07:43,279
up into the little Tupperware dish

230
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:44,509
they're in then you just basically tip

231
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:45,829
it to the side and all the seeds were a

232
00:07:44,509 --> 00:07:47,389
lot and all the bud stays up at the top

233
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:48,680
they just gather up all the seeds put

234
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:50,509
them in a jar label it and then I go

235
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,150
through in the future and sort out all

236
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:55,219
the bad lookin seeds and those go to

237
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:56,389
actually in his burn feed or I just

238
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,910
throw them away or did they end up his

239
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,229
chicken

240
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,310
mainly they go into the mix with the

241
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,569
chicken feet just to make you go a

242
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,740
little bit further there's not a lot of

243
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:02,790
them but something's got to happen with

244
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,530
them so they just get thrown in with the

245
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:05,879
chicken feeder with the bird feed not my

246
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:07,889
chickens are my Birds they get taken

247
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,529
somewhere else for that Oh what else was

248
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:13,469
I gonna say about the breeding project

249
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:15,599
oh here we go if you're breeding with

250
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:18,570
multiple females and one male in a room

251
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,160
timing is a [ __ ] the lemon skunk that I

252
00:08:18,569 --> 00:08:21,629
bred with yes I did breed two lemons

253
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,939
smoked to make more Firefly seeds and I

254
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:25,620
also made more morning dew seeds the

255
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:27,719
grateful dog to arise there's more of

256
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,430
that the lemons going to arise there's

257
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,050
plenty more of that but what I was gonna

258
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,240
say the lemon skunk is it really strong

259
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:35,009
sativa it takes longer than almost

260
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,229
everything else in that room to flower

261
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:38,879
and it really showed me that when I

262
00:08:37,229 --> 00:08:41,340
tried to breed with it I should have put

263
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,320
that plant in to flower a week to ten

264
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:44,490
days before everything else and it would

265
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,920
have made more seeds it made a very

266
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:48,210
minimal amount of seeds because I tried

267
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,439
to time it with everything else so my

268
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:51,300
advice to you is if you're going to

269
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,890
breed and in the future I do have an

270
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:54,089
email about breeding I'm going to get to

271
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,669
it I'm just overwhelmed with emails

272
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,340
working my way through them when when

273
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:02,099
you do breed think more about plants

274
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,340
that time up better because I put a 72

275
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,340
day plant in with 56 and 60 day plants

276
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,840
and tried to breed and it kind of [ __ ]

277
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,759
up they didn't do anything wrong it just

278
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,930
everything probably made like a thousand

279
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,819
seeds and this one made like five

280
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:16,829
hundred that's that's what went wrong

281
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:18,600
and once it'll run so did I tell you

282
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,950
guys that I was breeding in cups most of

283
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,259
my plants in the breeding project were

284
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:23,700
in larger pots but I had some that I

285
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:24,750
just wanted to make a few for myself

286
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,970
like we talked about earlier the

287
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,590
Platinum tangi the chem for those plants

288
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,840
were in beer cups you guys I had them on

289
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,670
a table in a beer cup and I floured them

290
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,070
all the way out in the beer cup i bred

291
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:37,469
to them in a beer cup they made about

292
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,180
fifty seeds each plant and as a breeder

293
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,680
that's all I need for myself to do

294
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:42,629
plenty of stuff so if you're looking to

295
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,339
breed don't be intimidated don't be

296
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:45,960
afraid you can do it in very small pots

297
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,550
and make fifty to a hundred seeds for

298
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,670
yourself with no problem

299
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:52,919
so that's really easy to do I wouldn't

300
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:54,509
breed under anything smaller than a 600

301
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:56,699
watt light I tried to breed with the 400

302
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:58,799
and it didn't make [ __ ] for seeds the

303
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,000
600 did okay honestly a thousand is

304
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,909
where it's at if you're trying to breed

305
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,529
and make healthy solid seeds so you

306
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:06,870
can't do small pots if you just want to

307
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:09,149
do like a 5x5 space of cups or three

308
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:10,710
gallon pots or I like six-inch net pots

309
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,889
however you want to do it you don't have

310
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,230
to

311
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,789
to do a breeding project the timing is

312
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,220
the crucial part is what I think I was

313
00:10:14,789 --> 00:10:19,669
trying to say when I got off on a rant

314
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,959
anyway the seed project has been

315
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:23,969
harvested what's my next order of

316
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:26,578
business I owe a shout out to a couple

317
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,798
of really kind and generous people I'll

318
00:10:26,578 --> 00:10:30,238
give a shout out I'm not sure if either

319
00:10:28,798 --> 00:10:32,188
of these guys want me to say their names

320
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:33,959
because they have contributed on patreon

321
00:10:32,188 --> 00:10:35,998
and I try to keep it kind of private and

322
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:39,418
not blast everybody's name of a big

323
00:10:35,999 --> 00:10:40,970
shout out to John B and Steven P patreon

324
00:10:39,418 --> 00:10:43,588

a guy putting out a podcast every week

345
00:11:15,058 --> 00:11:18,958

those funds to pay for the cost of my

365
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:56,188
website I have a website which is where

366

I host this podcast it does cost me a

367
00:11:56,188 --> 00:12:00,480
few bucks every year to keep that up I

368
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:01,769
post a lot of content so there's a lot

369
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,860
of bandwidth there's a lot of storage

370
00:12:01,769 --> 00:12:06,480
that I pay for there are 230 episodes

371
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,188
the podcast that means that there are a

372
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,839
hundred of them are available on the

373
00:12:08,188 --> 00:12:12,058
feed if I can learn how to make my

374
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,559
website show more I'll put them all up

375
00:12:12,058 --> 00:12:15,269
there I just cannot learn how to do that

376
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:17,129
my web guy doesn't know how to do it if

377
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:18,328
we can figure out how to get all 231

378
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,558
available they would be there on the

379
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:21,448
website for you I just don't know how to

380
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:22,828
make that yeah find that damn button to

381
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:24,298
click yet anyways got to be there

382
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:24,689
somewhere but what I'll do with your

383
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:25,889
funds

384
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,360
maybe I'll pay somebody who's better at

385
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:29,879
web hosting I'm just kidding my guy's

386
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,259
good he's just busy ah but I will pay

387
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,399
for the website with the funds that you

388
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:34,200
send my way I also these little

389
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,340
microphone covers I'm rubbing this one

390
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,020
right here I have guests on the show

391
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,700
quite often I try to replace these when

392
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,889
Mike comes over I try not to make Mike

393
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,020
use the same microphone cover that maybe

394
00:12:40,889 --> 00:12:44,669
granny or Lindsay or Chris whoever else

395
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:46,230
has been on the show in the past I try

396
00:12:44,669 --> 00:12:47,429
not to make them share I think that kind

397
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:49,200
of gets a little funky if you have them

398
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:50,699
on there for too long I can smell my own

399
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,020
if I use it for too long and if I can

400
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,700
smell my own that means other people can

401
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:54,899
smell other people's even sooner and

402
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:56,820
that's just gross to do that to them so

403
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,459
I swap out these microphone covers I

404
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,470
also have to buy new memory cards from

405
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:03,600
my zoom h6 occasionally because it eats

406
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,399
them for some reason just basic stuff

407
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,720
like that I'm not begging but if you

408
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,189
feel like you want to contribute that's

409
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,910
what it would help me with and I would

410
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,290
appreciate it

411
00:13:08,909 --> 00:13:11,699
also there's little things on their tour

412
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,589
if you donate if you contribute a

413
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,780
certain amount it puts you in line to

414
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,070
get your questions answered first email

415
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,509
me or something when you do that let me

416
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,460
know that you did that because patreon

417
00:13:18,509 --> 00:13:22,439
isn't good at notifying me of that stuff

418
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,519
I have to go check every month so send

419
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,980
me an email and say hey dude I just

420
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,240
contributed this much on patreon and I

421
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,320
would like my question answered and I

422
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,090
will get it I'll put you right at the

423
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,190
top of the list all print your email out

424
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:33,120
and then I will write on it patreon then

425
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,250
I'll make sure to give you a shout out

426
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,870
and I will also read your email so

427
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:38,460
patreon.com slash go from your heart

428
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,200
that would allow you as a listener to

429
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,670
financially contribute to the podcast

430
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,310
now I will quit begging and we'll move

431
00:13:41,669 --> 00:13:46,199
forward with the podcast what else has

432
00:13:44,309 --> 00:13:47,459
been going on in the world of Rasta Jeff

433
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:50,190
and I read genetics and the girl from

434
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:52,920
your heart podcast for those of you who

435
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:55,290
do not know I am the lead cultivator for

436
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,939
three rivers there's a dispensary in

437
00:13:55,289 --> 00:13:59,399
Pueblo called Three Rivers we have a

438
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:00,540
medical side and a recreational side if

439
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:02,340
you live in Colorado and you're a

440
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,899
medical marijuana patient you can shop

441
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,920
on the medical side if you do not have

442
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,049
your medical marijuana recommendation

443
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:08,969
from a doctor if you're coming from out

444
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:11,370
of state and you're 21 and over you are

445
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,720
allowed to shop on the recreational side

446
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,850
i think i said that right the medical

447
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,170
side and the recreational side but i am

448
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,909
currently running the grove for the

449
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:19,559
medical side we are building a very

450
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:21,509
large facility that will host more

451
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:24,539
medical and our recreational grow and i

452
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:27,779
will be running that grow as well

453
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:29,309
recently we had a a volunteer inspection

454
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,929
a compliance inspection from the

455
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:33,539
Department of Agriculture

456
00:14:30,929 --> 00:14:35,069
if you run or work in a large grow in

457
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:36,360
Colorado any type of girl if you're

458
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,310
growing tomatoes if you're growing

459
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:39,600
lettuce if you're growing whatever

460
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,879
happened down there cantaloupes or

461
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,930
peaches but cannabis right now is where

462
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:44,250
they're focused but if you're growing

463
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:46,829
anything if you have a farm that's

464
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,720
licensed you will be visited and

465
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,550
inspected by the Colorado Department of

466
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,500
Agriculture their goal and their main

467
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:55,379
mission is to make sure that you are not

468
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,299
putting any humans or animals in danger

469
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:58,559
they don't want you to kill animals they

470
00:14:57,299 --> 00:14:59,819
don't want you to kill people and they

471
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,009
don't want you to kill the environment

472
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,330
that is their main goal it was a little

473
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:05,009
nerve-racking when I was told hey the

474
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:06,360
Department of Agriculture is coming to

475
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:07,919
inspect your facility to tell you the

476
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,810
truth I got like Oh what is that like

477
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,370
but I have a compliance officer that

478
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:13,199
guides me through things at the grow and

479
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:15,000
we got together and they make a

480
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,610
checklist the Department of Ag makes it

481
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,720
very easy they make a checklist that you

482
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,789
can go through and make sure that

483
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,470
everything is order in order they tell

484
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:24,000
you what you are allowed and are not

485
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,680
allowed to have on premises they tell

486
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,330
you what you are and are not allowed to

487
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,789
do and as long as you're following basic

488
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,379
safety rules you're already doing these

489
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:33,059
things I have been trained in worker

490
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:35,009
protection safety by the Department of

491
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:36,779
Agriculture so I already knew what I

492
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:38,759
needed to look for and prepare for what

493
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,250
I needed to train my guys on so these

494
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:43,080
guys if you have a grow they will be at

495
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,669
your if you're running a cannabis grow

496
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,980
they will be at your cannabis grow

497
00:15:44,669 --> 00:15:49,709
eventually if they have not been there I

498
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:52,920
recommend that you call and you schedule

499
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:54,780
a voluntary compliance check if they

500
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,759
come for a voluntary compliance check

501
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:58,110
unless they see I think the guy said

502
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,330
he's looking for anything that would

503
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:02,700
cause immediate threat to human or

504
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:04,590
animal safety unless they see anything

505
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,990
that's a blatant [ __ ] unless you're

506
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:09,629
doing something stupid if you call for a

507
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:11,460
voluntary compliance check they are not

508
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:12,960
going to write you up or find you for

509
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:14,460
anything we didn't have anything to be

510
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,650
written up for but they were very happy

511
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:18,300
with us and they said hey we want you

512
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:20,340
guys to call so that we can come out

513
00:16:18,299 --> 00:16:22,469
here and tell you what to do because you

514
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,389
don't know what you're doing wrong until

515
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:26,550
you're corrected so if you've got a

516
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:28,289
facility I would recommend you call the

517
00:16:26,549 --> 00:16:30,599
Colorado Department of Agriculture and

518
00:16:28,289 --> 00:16:32,699
schedule a compliance check a voluntary

519
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,680
compliance check this could prevent the

520
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,990
things like we spoke about in a previous

521
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,069
episode where people were not applying

522
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,720
the proper pesticide

523
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:41,100
they're not applying them properly if

524
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,660
somebody woulda came out there and spoke

525
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,980
with those folks they could have gotten

526
00:16:42,659 --> 00:16:46,589
it correct and they would not have had

527
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,090
as large of a problem if you schedule

528
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,379
them to come out there they'll come out

529
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:51,060
there and look at your girl all they did

530
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:52,200
they looked at our pesticide logs I'm

531
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:53,549
not sure how much I'm supposed to talk

532
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:57,090
about they looked at our pesticide logs

533
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:59,009
they looked for our MSDS logs which is

534
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,600
the material safety data sheets you have

535
00:16:59,009 --> 00:17:02,669
to have every pesticide and product

536
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,769
that's in the grow you have to have the

537
00:17:02,669 --> 00:17:06,539
material safety data sheet available in

538
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:08,699
a central location they made sure we had

539
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:10,289
I wash stations they honestly didn't

540
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,670
even check for fire extinguishers we had

541
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:13,500
fire extinguishers in all the proper

542
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:15,570
places they did not even check for those

543
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,449
they asked us a lot of questions about

544
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:20,039
our pesticide application procedures how

545
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:21,779
do you do it where do you do it what do

546
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:23,338
you wear when you do it they just

547
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:24,779
basically wanted to make sure that we

548
00:17:23,338 --> 00:17:26,250
were doing everything safely and

549
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:27,720
correctly there were a couple of things

550
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,279
he's like hey you do that right but have

551
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,720
you ever thought about this and then he

552
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:32,579
would encourage thought in my mind and

553
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,230
he would make me think of a better safer

554
00:17:32,579 --> 00:17:36,119
more practical way to do some things

555
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,860
because I'm a smart dude but honestly

556
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:39,329
I'm gonna miss some [ __ ] we're all going

557
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:41,069
to miss a few things and a little bit of

558
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,629
guidance should be appreciated a little

559
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:44,519
bit of education should be appreciated

560
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:45,570
so I was grateful if this dude pointed a

561
00:17:44,519 --> 00:17:47,430
couple of things out there was no

562
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:48,539
violation or anything but he's like did

563
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:50,370
you ever think of this did you ever

564
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,960
think of this and he just gave us a few

565
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:54,359
ideas on ways we could improve safety

566
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:57,120
there was really no reason for me to be

567
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:58,589
nervous or intimidated by a Department

568
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,849
of Agriculture inspection the guy was

569
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:02,339
really cool he was very knowledgeable

570
00:17:59,849 --> 00:18:03,599
and he did not want to write anybody up

571
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:05,250
for anything he wanted to make sure we

572
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,449
were doing things correctly he wanted to

573
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,970
leave us a list of things we could

574
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,500
improve and then as we were talking the

575
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:12,360
dude was just very knowledgeable and he

576
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,680
seemed to know a lot about pesticide

577
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,449
application he knew a lot about

578
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,160
agriculture he was just a very

579
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,350
knowledgeable guy so as we spoke he

580
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:21,029
taught me a lot of great things he was

581
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:23,579
taught me a lot about respirators a lot

582
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:25,200
about respirator use because we're

583
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:26,939
required to have respirator training and

584
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,230
I was unaware of that it's not in some

585
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:30,029
of the paperwork that I've got but it's

586
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,039
in the updated paperwork and he was like

587
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:33,809
hey that's new [ __ ] you have this many

588
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:36,029
days to get that taken care of so I'll

589
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:37,470
be back in 60 to 90 days to check on me

590
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:39,569
and to tell you the truth we've already

591
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,890
scheduled all of the respirator training

592
00:18:39,569 --> 00:18:42,599
everything will have been handled very

593
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,130
soon you guys if you're using a

594
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:45,839
respirator make sure you're using the

595
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,030
right cartridges on the respirator and

596
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,849
maybe even go to a doctor and make sure

597
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:51,230
your lungs are properly equipped to wear

598
00:18:50,849 --> 00:18:52,759
that

599
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,019
sprayer and then maybe even get a fit

600
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:56,058
test and make sure you're wearing the

601
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:57,769
respirator correctly because there are

602
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:59,178
if you're not wearing it properly there

603
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,519
are leaks and you're just breathing in

604
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,559
the pesticide anyway and you make little

605
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,329
little air holes that actually bring in

606
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,220
more than you would if you just opened

607
00:19:05,329 --> 00:19:09,980
it freely as you create a little suction

608
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:11,089
anyway the Department of Agriculture was

609
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,579
great I had no reason to be intimidated

610
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:16,339
and if you have a facility I recommend

611
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:18,079
that you call and volunteer for a

612
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:19,849
voluntary compliance check I learned a

613
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,529
lot of things and that way if you are

614
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:22,819
screwing up they'll come tell you hey

615
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,139
you're screwing up they don't show up

616
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:25,428
surprisingly bill I can't look you

617
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,960
[ __ ] up you got this in this together

618
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,390
basically you have to keep your

619
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,890
pesticides away from all your nutrients

620
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:32,509
and you have to have all your equipment

621
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,640
accessible you have to have your safety

622
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:36,950
equipment accessible you have to have

623
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,500
all of your paperwork your spray logs or

624
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,910
MSDS sheets and all of your Department

625
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,859
of Agriculture posters that racist

626
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:44,600
poster you have to have that accessible

627
00:19:42,859 --> 00:19:46,609
and also you need I wash stations and

628
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,199
they're going to ask you a lot of

629
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:50,479
questions about what happens if your

630
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,919
worker sprays pesticides in his eyes

631
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,640
what are you going to do how's this

632
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:53,900
gonna happen

633
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,610
who's going to drive them to the

634
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,350
hospital where is the hospital who does

635
00:19:55,609 --> 00:19:59,178
he notify if something happens be

636
00:19:57,349 --> 00:20:01,159
prepared for those types of questions

637
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,480
fortunately I'm a smart dude we're kind

638
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,490
of prepared and I have a great

639
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,620
compliance officer so I answered all of

640
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,539
those questions correctly then they pull

641
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:10,428
aside all of the growers anybody that

642
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:12,259
applies pesticides or any sort of sprays

643
00:20:10,429 --> 00:20:15,169
using the pesticide application device

644
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:17,029
ah they ask them a lot of questions also

645
00:20:15,169 --> 00:20:18,830
and they also inspected all of the

646
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:20,089
pesticide applicators we've got a paint

647
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:22,009
sprayer and then we've got some smaller

648
00:20:20,089 --> 00:20:23,209
things that we use they inspected all of

649
00:20:22,009 --> 00:20:24,950
those they asked us how we clean them

650
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:26,390
how often we clean them there were a lot

651
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:28,190
of questions basically make sure you're

652
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,860
doing [ __ ] right and everything will be

653
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,230
okay but if you don't schedule the

654
00:20:29,859 --> 00:20:34,579
voluntarily voluntary inspection they

655
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,710
can just show up and inspect and then if

656
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:37,849
you [ __ ] up they can find you they can

657
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,900
do whatever they want but basically

658
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:41,240
they're making sure you're not causing

659
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:42,919
any immediate threat to human health or

660
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,269
safety as well their main goal so

661
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:46,130
shadows my new friend at the Department

662
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:47,900

663

668
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,669
even press pause let's just take a DAB

669
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,558
together and then then we're gonna get

670
00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:02,179

671
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,798
out because I gotta get my [ __ ] in a

672
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:04,990
pile I got this email right here I'm

673
00:21:03,798 --> 00:21:08,319
trying to set myself up for

674
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:09,400
success y'all um let's dab some of this

675
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,779
what do we want to get into let's get

676
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,160
into some Clementine it's not real heavy

677
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:14,170
doesn't [ __ ] me up too bad it makes me

678
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:15,460
functional let's say I'm out of the one

679
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:18,880
I've already opened that's a freshie

680
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,860
right there got the Clementine

681
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,690
there we go that's one I've been dipping

682
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:23,889
into you gets me nice and high and gives

683
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,570
me a good buzz but it doesn't [ __ ] me

684
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,920
that order can't function and think

685
00:21:25,569 --> 00:21:28,599
about a podcast where you get all weird

686
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,980
sometimes I get quiet when I take dad

687
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:31,289
sometimes I ramble when I take dad's

688
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,579
gonna depends on what I'm smoking

689
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:34,720
apparently right now I'm rambling so

690
00:21:33,579 --> 00:21:36,699
we're getting adapt together I got a

691
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,950

692
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:43,569

695
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:48,220
hammerhead perk on the inside honestly

696
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:49,870

697
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,450
hits well I like to flirt out mouthpiece

698
00:21:49,869 --> 00:21:54,519

787
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,670
and how I got it here's the answer you

788
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:06,229
guys I've been cylinder since I started

789
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:08,240
high school and high school was a point

790
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:10,220
that I basically only owned black shirts

791
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,870
and black or blue jeans one day we were

792
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:13,519
playing hacky sack and my buddy [ __ ]

793
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:15,229
decided to give me the name skinny black

794
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,210
which I didn't know as a character and

795
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:18,529
hustle and flow I was given the name

796
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,289
because he's skinny and I always wore

797
00:25:18,529 --> 00:25:22,940
black I'm almost immediately it changed

798
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:24,710
to just skinny a couple years later I

799
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,450
was listening to a song called seen

800
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:28,670
Jamie and I would replace Jimmy with

801
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:30,410
skinny whenever it came up in the song

802
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:33,580
I put seeing skinny is my middle name in

803
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:35,779
facebook as a joke and it just stuck I

804
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:37,579

for all the info about yourself I like

842
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,790
knowing stuff about my friends

843
00:26:50,779 --> 00:26:54,200
that's pretty rad why did they call me

844
00:26:52,789 --> 00:26:56,149
Rasta Jeff I guess would be fair

845
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,529
cuz I've got dreadlocks down to my ass

846
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,240
and I listen to reggae and I'm a Rasta

847
00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:00,649
man - my name is Jeff so just Rasta Jeff

848
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,599
was just an easy nickname for me to

849
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:05,240
acquire a lot of my friends call me

850
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:07,539
wookie because I'm six five and I have

851
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,220
dreadlocks and kind of a Chewbacca I

852
00:27:07,539 --> 00:27:12,500
prefer not to wear shoes too often and

853
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,819
sometimes I could use a shower so that's

854
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,140
why they call me wookie and then back in

855
00:27:13,819 --> 00:27:15,859
the day my friends used to call me hippy

856
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,720
ah

857
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:20,089
because I was just a great big hippy I

858
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,620
worked in a place and one of the old

859
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:23,240
guys asked my best friend why do you

860
00:27:21,619 --> 00:27:25,009
call him hippy and my buddy's response

861
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,720
was because it's better than calling him

862
00:27:25,009 --> 00:27:28,009
up [ __ ] in front of everybody and I

863
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,180

874
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,350
dude grows crew is dude grosses another

875
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:53,240
podcast about cannabis it's a different

876
00:27:51,349 --> 00:27:54,730
style than my show Scotty real and the

877
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:57,349
dudes sit around to talk about a

878
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,579
recharge all day so give them a listen

879
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,779
you guys might enjoy the podcast I

880
00:27:58,579 --> 00:28:01,220
listen when I can I can't listen

881
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:03,769
constantly I listen to so many podcasts

882
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,029
but I do listen to the dude bro show and

883
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:08,549
I definitely will be at the dude grow

884
00:28:06,029 --> 00:28:11,129
if they throw another event I will go I

885
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:12,599
may even compete because last time one

886
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:14,490
of my strains won second place and I

887
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,259
didn't even grow it it was at second or

888
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:17,700
third it was a tie for it became it I

889
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,769
don't remember sue the second or third

890
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,809
place but one of my strains lemon Jeffry

891
00:28:19,769 --> 00:28:23,099
won an award and I didn't even grow it

892
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,659
so I imagined that if I grew and I

893
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:26,789
entered it it would [ __ ] win right

894
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:28,290
that just makes sense all right skinny

895
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:30,269
thanks for the messages dude I hope mom

896

doing well mama all right you got

902
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,510
another email this one starts off and

903
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,759
specifically says please don't use my

904
00:28:45,509 --> 00:28:49,230
name you can call me Parliament thanks

905
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,660
and with that being said let's get down

906
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,549
to the brass tacks man if I'm not

907
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,830
mistaken biochar is carbon-based

908
00:28:53,549 --> 00:28:58,109
material that is burned without air I

909
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:59,879
was looking at the wood chips the wood

910
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:01,740
oh and wood pellets from my electric

911
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,040
smoker and noticed that they were burned

912
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:07,650
but not ash is that biochar is it good

913
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,779
to use as an amendment to cocoa can it

914
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:11,940
be used in a tea I would imagine it

915
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:13,859
would be great for compost I know that

916
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,660
wood ash contains a lot of potassium but

917
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:17,759
goodies can be gained from this

918
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,259
by-product or but can goodies be gained

919
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,839
from this byproduct of carnivorous

920
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:23,519
indulgence business out of the way on to

921
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:25,289
the pleasantries I would like to say

922
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:27,119
that it was made aware of your podcast

923
00:29:25,289 --> 00:29:28,829
from the dude grow show your show has

924
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,029
become one of my favorite podcasts and I

925
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:31,859
never miss an episode

926
00:29:30,029 --> 00:29:33,210
I'd love to throwbackthursday episodes

927
00:29:31,859 --> 00:29:35,429
and the fact that they are super long

928
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,079
don't be afraid to put out long episodes

929
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:39,750
like 2 or 3 hours

930
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:41,220

00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,800
for the email bro um I love the good

973
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,630
question because biochar

974
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,490
I never thought too much about biochar

975
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:01,530
I've heard of them using biochar a lot

976
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,789
at the warm factory but I have not

977
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:04,410
thought about too much of it as in a

978
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:06,059
cocoa amendment until you spark that

979
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:09,300
thought in my head so let's talk about

980
00:31:06,059 --> 00:31:11,009
biochar for just a second one thing that

981
00:31:09,299 --> 00:31:12,240
you said is that biochar is one of the

982
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:14,369
main things was that it was made without

983
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,740
oxygen and you were doing that it sounds

984
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:18,389
like but how are you removing the oxygen

985
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,039
is there a vacuum there is there an

986
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:22,020
absence of oxygen or is there just

987
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,049
free-flowing oxygen as their passive

988
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,309
oxygen I'm not doubting you or your idea

989
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,139
that there is an oxygen there I'm just

990
00:31:26,309 --> 00:31:29,759
wondering is there oxygen flowing

991
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:32,100
through there is there some oxygen

992
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,170
but anyway I'm also one of the things

993
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:36,209
that identifies it as biochar is the

994
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:37,710
specific temperature it says

995
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:39,029
temperatures of four to five hundred

996
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:41,819
degrees produce more char while

997
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:43,950
temperatures above 700 favor the yield

998
00:31:41,819 --> 00:31:45,689
of liquid and gas component so you'll be

999
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:47,519
pulling out more liquids and gases at

1000
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:49,830
higher temperatures so it kind of

1001
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,180
depends on if what temperature you're

1002
00:31:49,829 --> 00:31:52,859
getting into and how much char is

1003
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:55,049
happening and also biochar is really

1004
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:57,659
fine so if you're gonna make the biochar

1005
00:31:55,049 --> 00:31:59,700
out of that stuff I would almost start

1006
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:02,279
the char wants and then shred it up real

1007
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,960
fine or break it up even smaller make

1008
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:06,029
the pellets even smaller and then reach

1009
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,079
are them maybe if you can crush them up

1010
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:09,149
or break them in half or something

1011
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,490
because the biochar the smaller it is

1012
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,110
the more surface can get charred I'll

1013
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:15,029
see you have more surface area that is

1014
00:32:13,109 --> 00:32:16,229
burned and it's got the carbon available

1015
00:32:15,029 --> 00:32:18,029
you're making the carbon available it's

1016
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:19,289
that dusty part the part that kind of

1017
00:32:18,029 --> 00:32:20,670
sticks to your fingers and makes your

1018
00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:22,619
fingers all black and you end up looking

1019
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,970
like a coal miner that's the part that

1020
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:25,889
you're kind of looking for I think and

1021
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:26,490
you want to make as much surface area as

1022
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:28,590
you can

1023
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:30,809
so char as much as you can and then it

1024
00:32:28,589 --> 00:32:31,259
will work better as an amendment if it

1025
00:32:30,809 --> 00:32:33,509
is

1026
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:35,819
and more available one thing I think

1027
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:37,710
about the biochar is they feed it to

1028
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:39,750
worms and the worms pass it and it makes

1029
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,690
it smaller and more bioavailable and the

1030
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:44,880
worms also love it so I think make it

1031
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:46,860
smaller burn it again and then feed it

1032
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,419
to earthworms red wigglers and stuff

1033
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:49,889
like that and then I think you're

1034
00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:51,509
basically making biochar but you're

1035
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:53,130
close already I think you're mostly

1036
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:55,619
correct and I'm just getting my

1037
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:57,679
information from the internet and you're

1038
00:32:55,619 --> 00:32:59,759
really close you are making low budget

1039
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,929
biochar you're off to a good start but

1040
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:03,150
there are a couple more things that

1041
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:05,040
sounds like you could probably do and I

1042
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:07,350
hope that answered your question my

1043
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,269
advice would be like I said char it

1044
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:10,918
crush it again cardigans wear all of it

1045
00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:12,389
is charred make sure that every but I'm

1046
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,590
not I don't I haven't used your pellet

1047
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:15,360
stove so I don't know how burned it's

1048
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:17,189
getting on the inside or on the outside

1049
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:18,808
of the pellets but make sure it's all

1050
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,610
charred make sure it's really fine and

1051
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:22,710
then use some of it and then maybe if

1052
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:24,719
you have the availability feed some of

1053
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:26,490
that to some red wiggler worms and then

1054
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,019
use that and then see if you see a

1055
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,000
difference in the one the plant without

1056
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,289
the biochar the plant with the homemade

1057
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,240
biochar and then the plant with the

1058
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:35,639
biochar fed to worms and if you see

1059
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:37,558
differences take notes that's the way

1060
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,360
that you really would know if you did it

1061
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,548
correctly and if it's biochar it sounds

1062
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:42,959
very similar it really does sound like

1063
00:33:41,548 --> 00:33:44,099
you're close and it's probably going to

1064
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,840
do the same thing it's going to add that

1065
00:33:44,099 --> 00:33:48,000
carbon to it it's gonna help it's gonna

1066
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:51,058
help so I think you're onto the right

1067
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,869

old agriculture feed if you don't know

1117
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:25,379
about agriculture the show was

1118
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:26,699
originally called agriculture I was kind

1119
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,920
of forced to change it that was already

1120
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:30,000
somebody else's business name they work

1121
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,190
with colleges and they make

1122
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,900
college-level horticultural materials I

1123
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:35,250
didn't want to step on anybody's name so

1124
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,660
I changed my name to the girl from your

1125
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:38,130
heart podcast which is much more

1126
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:39,989
appropriate because I grow from my heart

she was in a conversation with a doctor

1153
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,309
who said that strains don't matter when

1154
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:32,338
it came to medical cannabis and she

1155
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:35,250
definitely did her job of standing up

1156
00:36:32,338 --> 00:36:36,808
for specific strains and strain names

1157
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:38,369
and she stood up for breeders and she

1158
00:36:36,809 --> 00:36:40,528
made me proud and she actually mentioned

1159
00:36:38,369 --> 00:36:41,579
