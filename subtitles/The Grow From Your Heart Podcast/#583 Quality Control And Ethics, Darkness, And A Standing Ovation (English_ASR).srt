23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,960
you know i like to start this podcast

24
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,438
off by talking about what i'm smoking

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
today i've been taking dabs of doses and

26
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,639
mimosas

27
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,320
live batter this is a blend of bottle

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,000
wash and tahitian punch

29
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,559
on the package the flavor is described

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,560
as citrus lavender and champagne

31
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,320
you know i really got the citrus flavor

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,600
the champagne is definitely abundant

33
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,798
when you hit it and taste it

34
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:24,319
i never got the lavender flavor or aroma

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,000
but that is a good thing because i am

36
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:28,719
not a big fan of lavender

37
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
or lilac flavors or aromas so it worked

38
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:31,519
out perfectly for me

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
i'm sure if i went a little bit hotter

40
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,039
or a little bit cooler maybe i'd pull

41
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,478
out that lavender but i'm not gonna try

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,159
because i feel lucky that i didn't get

43
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:39,599
that flavor in my mouth

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
on the back of the package it says the

45
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:45,438
product does contain 68.21

46
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,959
thc and non-detectable amounts of cbd

47
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,719
i feel like i've got a nice head buzz

48
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:50,640
i'm nice and rambly i feel like i'm

49
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:51,039
going a little bit fast but that may be

50
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
good

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,880

52
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680

disservice

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,120
if i did not mention how much i laughed

144
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,519
at a new show

145
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,680
called the cabin that's right my friend

146
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,680
bert kreischer has a new show on netflix

147
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,720
it is called the cabin

148
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,400
the first 30 seconds had me sold i knew

149
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,639
that i was not going to leave the couch

150
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:47,839
the tv the netflix for the duration of

151
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,079
however many shows

152
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,279
were on that [ __ ] series i sat there

153
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,680
and watched them

154
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,599
smoked dabs until i was unconscious and

155
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,360
watched every episode of the cabin

156
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
i promise you within the first 30

157
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,680
seconds you know exactly what you're

158
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,319
getting into

159
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,439

160
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,439
seconds tells you

161
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:07,279
exactly what to expect it sets the tone

162
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,959
sets the pace so

163
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,038
without gushing too much about my friend

164
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,599
bert kreischer i highly recommend his

165
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,839
show

166
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,280
called the cabin so i'm gonna follow

167
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,198
that up with another recommendation and

168
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:20,159

223
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:45,679
i said i was going to read some patreon

224
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,120
messages i've got a couple of great

225
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,639
messages here from friends who support

226
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,720
the show on patreon

227
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
this one comes from a fine young man who

228
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,160
calls himself yee mo

229
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:56,560
[ __ ] ha and that's he spelled it

230
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,199
perfect yee ma [ __ ] has exactly what

231
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,519
it says

232
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,038
it goes on it says i do have a question

233
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,680
to the best of your knowledge has the

234
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,360
strain name standing ovation been taken

235
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,959
or even ovation

236
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,319
bro that's a great [ __ ] name let me

237
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,198
explain to you how he came across this

238
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,960
name it says

239
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,319
i was just glassing in the grow room

240
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,279
this morning and looking at all the

241
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,960
praying leaves

242
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,638
seeing healthy happy plants thinking

243
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,198
about the incredible results i have had

244
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,639
lately

245
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,639
and just thought the name would be so

246
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,000
appropriate for so many

247
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,038
reasons yeah i get it when you're in

248
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,639
there looking at the plants in the

249
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,079
morning they've got their leaves up in

250
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,918
the in the air they're [ __ ] praying

251
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:29,598
they're giving you that standing ovation

252
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,359
i get it dude i see when you said the

253
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:32,079
name i knew where the inspiration came

254
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,759
from

255
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,199
i think i may have written that down

256
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,879
before i don't want to take credit for a

257
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,759
name that i don't promise you is written

258
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:39,839
on the list but

259
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,360
i think it was standing o and we'll talk

260
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:43,598
about that in a moment but

261
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,919
it says i feel like you yourself should

262
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,759
take a bow as we all applaud your work

263
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,439
that's pretty good bro thank you

264
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
then it says and you know how it feels

265
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,399
when friends try your herb and they're

266
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,000
like god damn and sometimes you deserve

267
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:55,598
a standing ovation

268
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,439
plus there's a linguistic connection

269
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,478
between a rise innovation that i thought

270
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,160
was interesting

271
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,439
but i was high yes you're high but this

272
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,439
is still great bro some of the best

273
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,279
ideas come out of us when we are baked

274
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,478
it says if it resonates at all with you

275
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,959
and hasn't been taken

276
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:09,839
i hope you consider the suggestion much

277
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,159
respect

278
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,959
my dude um so instead of using it for a

279
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,520
rise

280
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,799
how about also good idea bro bravo great

281
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,079
idea i'm gonna give you [ __ ] some

282
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,960
cheers for that one uh you get a

283
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:22,639
standing ovation

284
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,560
i'm gonna [ __ ] stand up and [ __ ]

285
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,639
there you go you officially literally

286
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
got a standing o out of me for that one

287
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,918
so what we're gonna do instead of using

288
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,080
it for a rise

289
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,199
i think it would work better with orange

290
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,440
gasm because

291
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,680
i've always tried to make hashtag oh

292
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,080
face a thing when i'm advertising orange

293
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,519
guys i'm

294
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,440
never caught on but now maybe that i've

295
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,240
said it out loud it was mine that was my

296
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,880
intention

297
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
hashtag oh face for orange asm i thought

298
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,679
it would be funny marketing i thought it

299
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,278
was funny i tried that when i posted it

300
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:50,799
up to instagram nobody even noticed that

301
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:54,240
i was posting

302
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:57,120
oh face it got overlooked but um the

303
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,720
standing ovation the o face uh that

304
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,399
those could be different phenotypes we

305
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,680
could name a phenotype

306
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,600
of the orange gasm the standing ovation

307
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,519
or that oh face that's just something

308
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,278
that could go along with the marketing

309
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,959
for the orange gasm i don't think i'm

310
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,159
going to use it as a strained name

311
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:13,679
if there's another breeder out there

312
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,319
that wants to use that as a strain name

313
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,639
i don't

314
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,320
it doesn't fit my stuff uh it kind of

315
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,319
does but i'm not going to go for it i

316
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
think it would be more of a phenotype

317
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,320
name like we labeled that phenotype the

318
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
roster jeff cut the mean girl cut

319
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,680
the pungent cut and now you got the

320
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:29,679
standing o cut and the o

321
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:30,799
face cut that's where i find it would be

322
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,239
more appropriate

323
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,639
i do appreciate the feedback i hate to

324
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,278
reject your name here on a show but i do

325
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,240
love that name suggestion it is just not

326
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,000
for me right now

327
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,600
however it may come up in the future if

328
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,240
somebody else beats me to it that's a

329
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,080
great name

330
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,360
somebody should market that [ __ ] all

331
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,759
right we're going to keep moving because

332
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,879
i've got a couple of great messages here

333
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:53,120
this one comes from our friend hg

334
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,879
and it says hey ross to jeff i'm a big

335
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,759
fan of the show and i've recently

336
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:58,480
become able to supply my own medicine

337
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,039
due to

338
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,399
largely your tips ah man thank you

339
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:03,679
that's [ __ ] that's a hard sense for

340
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
my brain to figure out what to say it's

341
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,239
hard to read but

342
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
once i figured it out i'm glad you were

343
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,600
growing great medicine

344
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,039
and supply your own medicine largely due

345
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,159
to my tips it makes more sense when i

346
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,120
said it out loud again

347
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:16,240
you saved my summer 2019 from death so

348
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,839
thank you

349
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,440
bro i'm glad i could rescue your summer

350
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,360
2019 crop

351
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,040
it says on a recent episode you and

352
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,560
white mike and i actually corrected you

353
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,838
on that one it was jesse that said this

354
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,719
on the episode i think it could have

355
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,880
been mike

356
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,160
90 sure jesse is the one that said what

357
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,240
you're going to talk about here

358
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,679
it says uh you and jesse talked about

359
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,600
how you guys used to cut around

360
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,799
caterpillar damage but now that you've

361
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,240
learned more uh

362
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,879
you've learned more so now you just cut

363
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,639
that [ __ ] away can you please elaborate

364
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,480
as to what you have learned and some

365
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,958
detail as to how your practices are

366
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,480
different

367
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:50,479
now um so yes in the outdoor episode

368
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,240
we did talk about how back in the day if

369
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,079
we found a bud with caterpillar damage

370
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,799
in it we try to cut that part away

371
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:57,838
and now we do things differently now we

372
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:00,719
would simply

373
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,560
throw the damaged contaminated buds away

374
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,120
there are several reasons for that

375
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,479
um now we're not greedy uh back in the

376
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,159
day we were

377
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,600
and i hate to say we were black market

378
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,958
growers where we had to do things

379
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,800
sneakily and we didn't have big

380
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,479
facilities and every [ __ ] gram

381
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:16,559
counted to pay the rent and

382
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,240
all the other things now it's not such a

383
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,078
cutthroat it is cutthroat but there's

384
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,680
also quality assurance i've got

385
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:26,239
uh less ego less uh less struggle

386
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,679
less strife what is the uh the mentality

387
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,120
when there's not enough to go around i

388
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:30,479
used to have that mentality

389
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,240
now there's enough to go around so i

390
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,920
don't have to try to market that

391
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,519
terrible product that's not safe and

392
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,199
dangerous i'm not as greedy

393
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,679
i've got better morals i've got better

394
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,600
ethics and everybody deserves

395
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,519
better better quality that stuff with

396
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,920
the caterpillar damage the bug [ __ ] in

397
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,919
it

398
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,199
that's not rasta jeff quality that's not

399
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:50,479
up to my ethics

400
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,480
my responsibility is to provide a better

401
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,278
product my responsibility is to find

402
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,440
that problem

403
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,399
and make sure that doesn't get to people

404
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,959
we're making

405
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,639
a medical marijuana product it says

406
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,838
medical marijuana on it so people that

407
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,600
are consuming this

408
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,600
have a medical condition i don't know if

409
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
it's a broken knee or a lung disorder

410
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
but i don't want to give somebody with

411
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,639
the lung disorder

412
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,000
buds with [ __ ] caterpillar damage in

413
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,278
it i don't want to give them buds with

414
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,278
powdery mildew in it i don't want to

415
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:15,519
give them buds with spider mite eggs in

416
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,919
it

417
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
so it's my responsibility to have better

418
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,199
standards than that than to

419
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,120
just cut around it and give them the

420
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,000
part that looks good you just throw the

421
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,078
part that isn't good

422
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
away and you save your reputation you

423
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,519

424
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,040
and you save the patients their patients

425

427
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,199
i don't want to make them sicker when

428
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,559
people consume the product that i grow

429
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,278
and create

430
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,879

way i did that but that's what i see it

436

flopping because they're loosened up and

445
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:04,000

446

457
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,599
jubilation may be the appropriate word

458
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,360
i've never used jubilation before

459
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,639
there we go but it fills me up with all

460
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,079
kinds of good feelings

461
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,079
i want to feel good about what i'm

462
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,078
giving my patients my friends the people

463
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,319
that consume the products i grow

464
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:39,039

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,159
feel good about it

468
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,519
i would say and i'm gonna use my buddy

469
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,360
old doug as an example

470
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,120
old doug's not the healthiest [ __ ]

471
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,639
old guy on the planet old doug could

472
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,159
probably smoke some healthy cannabis and

473
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,759
be just fine if we gave him some

474
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,799
contaminated [ __ ]

475
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,399
in probably three five seven to ten days

476
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,000
doug's gonna start coughing up weird

477
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,278
[ __ ] doug's gonna tell me bro i just

478
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399

479
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:03,838
days and i'm gonna go

480
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,600
oh man i wonder if it was because of

481
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,199
that caterpillar weed that i sold him or

482
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,759
that [ __ ] powdery mildew weed that i

483
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,240
sold him

484
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:11,120
and i'm gonna feel like [ __ ] that's not

485
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,399
what i'm here for

486
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,560
i don't want to feel like [ __ ] about

487
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,240
anything that i do to people i i did

488
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:16,958
enough of that [ __ ] [ __ ] when i was

489
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,440
younger

490
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:20,719
20s early 30s those are [ __ ] days

491
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,240
i'm i'm a [ __ ]

492

grown-ass man things and step up so

494
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,159
that is the long way of saying i've just

495
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,799
learned a lot about

496
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,838
myself about my goals about my ethics

497
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,919
about quality

498
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,920
about maintaining a business it's not

499
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,120
about making that extra eighth out of

500
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,599
the bag today

501
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,560
it's about making a long-term customer

502
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,320
and patient

503
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:45,518
that wants to buy 365 eighths every day

504
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,920
through the next year because they

505
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,480
didn't get one moldy one from me today

506
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,519
they'll buy 364 days in a row with

507
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,159
intentions to buy

508
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,639
the next 365 but if you sell them one

509
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:56,639
eighth

510
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,440
that they find some [ __ ] in it you

511
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,399
just lost 365 eighths worth of sales

512
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
from that person

513
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,240
because there are plenty of dispensaries

514
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,759
growers and other people distributing

515
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,240
the same product as us you've got to

516
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:08,639
have

517
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,079
high standards good quality and you

518
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,278
gotta have good ethics and good morals

519
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,198
so i think i went on

520
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,039
long enough about that part i'm gonna

521
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,278
keep going um

522
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,639
the trimmers so usually we said we used

523
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,198
to cut that part out

524
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,799
this is where the trimmers come in as

525
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,639
the quality assurance

526
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,240
part of the cultivation facility a lot

527
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,959
of people downplay the importance of the

528
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,720
tremors

529
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,958
they think the lead growers the [ __ ]

530
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,800
king the cultivation team

531
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:34,479
are like the the knights and [ __ ] and

532
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,519
then the trim crew or the peons

533
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:38,159
the villagers that is in no way the

534
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,000
truth

535
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,838
the [ __ ] trim crew is just as

536
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,720
important as the lead grower and the

537
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,480
growtex

538
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,680
just as important as the security guard

539
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,360
the manager the owner and the

540
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,399
consultants those trimmers

541
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,159
are quality assurance they touch every

542
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,600
single bud that goes through the

543
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,519
cultivation facility

544
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,120
we chop it down we hang it up while

545
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,240
they're cutting it they see it while

546
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,078
they're cutting it down

547
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
while they're leafing the hanging plants

548
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:02,958
they see it they're looking at it

549
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,600
they're touching it hands on face to

550
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:05,599
face

551
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,199
they have a closer relationship with

552
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,399
some of those plants than i do sometimes

553
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:09,838
because they've cut it up into little

554
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
pieces and got to hold on to it like

555
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,920
this

556
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
when i saw it it was in a pot it was

557
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,000
[ __ ] huge they get to get up close

558
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,320
and very personal so they're trimming it

559
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,078
they've got a big magnifying glass it's

560
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,360
probably the size of an ipad and it just

561
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,039
sits right over the buds and they put

562
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,120
their hands on their scissors under that

563
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,958
they can see powdery mildew caterpillar

564
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,480
damage spider mite damage

565
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,078
seeds anything that may be in there

566
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,079
they're going to spot it they

567
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,838
are my quality control their quality

568
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:35,599
assurance they touch every bud

569
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,040
every flower that goes into your jar

570
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,399
past the tremors hands

571
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,240
they inspected it while they were

572
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
trimming it they saw that caterpillar

573
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,440
damage so

574
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,120
the trimmers are the ones that find that

575
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,680
that is where the quality control

576
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,959
happens

577
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,958
so you guys if you're thinking that the

578
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,000
trimmers aren't [ __ ] super important

579
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,439
without them your ship will

580
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,360
crash and they are quality control so

581
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,399
don't buy machines and take good care of

582
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,000
your trimmers that's where i'm headed

583
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,919
with that there is more to this

584
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,759
it says i am in spring outdoor flower

585
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,679
with a lot of caterpillar damage

586
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,038
i've caught so many and cut away so much

587
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,879
already i may

588
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:08,640
have to do everclear extract for the

589
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,720
first time just for sanitary reasons

590
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,959
because i see caterpillar dung

591
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,558
everywhere by the time i'm reading this

592
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,640
message you've probably harvested that

593
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,240
outdoor this was sitting in the pile

594
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,839
just cooking i apologize for taking a

595
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
long time to get to that message

596
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:23,678
however i hope i did answer your

597
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,360
question about cutting parts out and why

598
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,280
we changed our methods

599
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,038
because we simply grew up we've learned

600
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,000
how to manage ourselves our businesses

601
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:31,759
and our crops

602
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,599
a little bit more professionally and we

603
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:36,319
know that the people relying on us

604
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,000
deserve better than that from us and we

605
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,759
should teach people better as well

606
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,759
uh lead by example that's a thing that

607
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,919
i've been taught so i want to keep going

608
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,160
because i can get quite rambly

609
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,000
i've got one more uh question for this

610
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,919
episode and it goes like this

611
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,759
it says hey rosted jeff hey bro thanks

612
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,038
for reaching out says i want to start by

613
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,798
saying thank you for the wealth of

614
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,558
knowledge you are consistently sharing

615
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,038
and thanks for taking care of the audio

616
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,038
as well as you do thank you for noticing

617
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,798
i've got all new equipment here so i

618
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,558
hope the audio sounds as good as you are

619
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:05,759
expecting i hope i'm up to par

620
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:07,200
i've still got to learn where to keep

621
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,640
this microphone i feel like right here

622
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,080
is best but now it's in my view for

623
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
reading so there's some negotiating to

624
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,798
be done

625
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
but i do appreciate the compliments let

video i keep mentioning video and i

628
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,038
haven't said the most important part if

629
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,519
you are not watching on youtube at this

630
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,119

634
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,360
super crispy in my opinion

635
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,720
i'm still learning how to work the

636
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,519
lighting i'm learning some camera

637

638
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,879

639
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,480

643
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,000

quit talking about what you're dabbing

664
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,440
we don't [ __ ] care

665
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,038
you're just showing off you're rubbing

666
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,880
it in i live in a place where i can't

667
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,400
get that and all you do is piss me off

668
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
so i'm glad that you appreciate it and

669
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,600
that you can live vicariously through me

670
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,080
that's what i'm trying to do

671
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,678
i'm trying to let you know what i smoked

672
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,359
what i got to experience

673
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,120
what the flavor was like what the terps

674
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,439
were like and then i tried to tell you

675
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,359
uh how it made me feel also that will

676
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,600
give you an indication of why i'm

677
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,918
[ __ ] talking so goddamn fast which is

678
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,079
from this doses in mimosas it's got me

679
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,520
firing on all cylinders that is for damn

680
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,599
sure i like it it's a good thing

681
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,519
but sometimes when i smoke the tkd

682
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:52,639
number 10 that one puts me like kind of

683
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:53,200
chilled out and i get a little bit

684
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,720
slower

685
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,640
so that's why i share because i like you

686
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
guys to know kind of bring you in with

687
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
me

688
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,960
and also some of my friends live near me

689
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:02,720
or in the same state and all over

690
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,600
colorado you can get the doses and

691
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
mimosas

692
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:06,480
so maybe they're dabbing the same thing

693
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,359
and they'll grab a jar of it and go hey

694
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,720
me too

695
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,158
they're hitting the doses and mimosas

696
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,200
with me and then we're both talking too

697
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,480
fast

698
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,319
unity that's all i'm trying to do is

699
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
bring you in bro share my life i'm glad

700
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,480
you enjoy it

701
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,839
let's keep going it says i'm about to

702
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,640
harvest some of my plants and i've

703
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:20,720
always heard

704
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,400
mild bro science regarding hours of

705
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,480
darkness prior to harvest

706
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,519
i've heard you talk about your last few

707
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,360
days being 18

708
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:28,960
6 but i'm not sure i remember if you

709
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,199
talked about darkness

710
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,120
i have seen some test results that seem

711
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,640
to show some different cannabinoid

712
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,479
levels when harvested

713
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,919
different uh during different intervals

714
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,759
of light deprivation

715
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,679
i'm sure that is accurate so what we're

716
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,519
talking about is at the end of harvest

717
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,280
those last couple of days so your plants

718
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,038
say they go 65 days

719
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,759
we're going to put them for 65 days in

720
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,679
flower than 67 68 69

721
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,879
total [ __ ] darkness that's what this

722
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,798
guy is talking about

723
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,840
that is not uncommon i hear about that a

724
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,359
lot it's usually 24 or 48 hours of total

725
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,399
darkness this guy is going to go three

726
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,639
full days

727
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,919
um i guess that can't be a huge problem

728
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,200
it's not they're already in the dark

729
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,038
they're not gonna herm out or

730
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,640
anything like that they don't have time

731
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,400
um so

732
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,080
he says he has seen different

733
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
cannabinoid levels

734
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,759
uh from different uh levels of light

735
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,960
deprivation i completely agree with that

736
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:18,319
and believe that

737
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,919
they're going to change and kind of

738
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,439
freak out toward the end there so you're

739
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,960
going to see different things by doing

740
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,159
different things to them that completely

741
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,919
makes sense

742
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,480
um i actually do 18 6 for the last 10

743
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,759
days

744
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,120
and i don't do a dark cycle a long dark

745
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:35,038
cycle right now

746
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,798
honestly most of what i'm growing is

747
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,400
either a phenohunt run

748
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,079
so i don't want to do something super

749
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,120
crazy to that so i do just 12

750
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,839
12 or 11 13 on my phenohunt test runs

751
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,678
my seated crops they all finish at 18 6.

752
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:49,759
my smokable flower runs

753
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,679
uh sometimes i do them 18 six for the

754
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:53,759
last two weeks or 10 days

755
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,200
but a lot of times i don't have room and

756
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,720
manipulation space because i have other

757
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,640
things in the rooms

758
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
but most of the time it's 18 six for the

759
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,400
last 10 days if i can

760
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,200
but i don't do that longer uh dark

761
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,360
period

762
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,200
if they're seeded i do them 18 6 for

763
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,199
like [ __ ] 30 full days

764
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,319
maybe even longer but those are seeded

765
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,000
plants my

766
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,439
my my world is crazy when it comes to

767
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,038
growing let me keep focused so i don't

768
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,759
give any weird advice here

769
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,038
it says i just toss my uh three plants

770
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,960
into a dark room for

771
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,720
what will amount to 36 hours of total

772
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,720
darkness prior to chop tomorrow night

773
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,079
after work so we got 36 hours not three

774
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,240
days i misread that

775
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,079
uh can you speak to the efficacy or lack

776
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,079
thereof of darkness

777
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,558
prior to harvest thanks again for

778
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,158
everything you can use my name if needed

779
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,319
uh shout out to my friend evan thank you

780
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,760
for the great message uh evan you said

781
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:40,000
in the beginning of the message that you

782
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,359
have

783
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,440
heard a bunch of bro science i'm going

784
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,000
to back your bro science up with a whole

785
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,400
bunch

786
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,919
of bro science i don't have a lab i

787
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,038
don't have testing equipment

788
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,480
but i've got experience in my opinion my

789
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:57,759
experience is

790
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,279
as valid as a book as a lab because i

791
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:01,440
can see what's happening i'm pretty

792
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,599
observational i'm pretty smart

793
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,200
but again this is bro science from

794
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:07,279
things i've read and things i've seen in

795
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,840
my own grow so

796
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,200
what i understand is light degrades

797
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,199
terpenes as the

798
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,038
powerful grow light is shining down onto

799
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,440
your plants and hitting your trichomes

800
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:18,240
the terpenes are being uh disrupted

801
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,159
volatized

802
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,440
destroyed uh there are other words that

803
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,240
we can use vaporized

804
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,759
in the process so darkness would

805
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,919
probably in theory

806
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,960
increase terps you ever go in the room

807
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,360
during the day

808
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,960
and it smells like moist grow room you

809
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:33,519
go in the grow room during the dark

810
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,679
cycle

811
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,960
it smells like [ __ ] dank weed that

812
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,880
kind of gives me the belief that

813
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,480
something's happening in the dark cycle

814
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,559
it's not just a transpiration or a

815
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,480
respiration thing i think there are more

816
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,079
terps present in that dark cycle because

817
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,960
the heat and the light are not breaking

818
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,918
them down

819
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,720
so dark for tert preservation is a good

820
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,919
start

821
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,798
also heat breaks down your terps so the

822
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,960
cold in there

823
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,158
when it's not as bright it's not as hot

824
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,919
so that cool dark

825
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,080
you may be building up more terpenes

826
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,240
that may be a real thing

827
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,599
also i have experienced that some

828
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,679
cultivars do

829
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:09,359
gain in density they get tighter in

830
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,400
structure the buds tighten up they get a

831
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:13,119
little chunkier

832
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,000
i have noticed that in like more indica

833
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,239
dominant

834
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,759
wider leafed purple kind of plants they

835
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,400
will do that a little bit more

836
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,119
the thinner leafed longer skinnier

837
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,759
sativa

838
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,319
kind of plants they don't do it as much

839
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,400
so

840
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,158
ah that's something that i've noticed

841
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,798
also i don't think your plants are going

842
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,480
to make

843
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,000
more trichomes while they are in the

844
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,798
dark we've only got 72

845
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,440
hours or 36 hours that's a day and a

846
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,319
half

847
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,919
if you do produce more trichomes those

848
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,278
plants have been in flower for days

849
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,038
we've been waiting for those trichomes

850
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,038
to get ripe any new trichomes that pop

851
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,798
up aren't going to have time to ripen

852
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,839
so that's why we're going to see varying

853
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:53,440
test results in my theory in my opinion

854
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,399
also i think lab testing is the only way

855
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,240
you're going to get

856
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,240
totally completely accurate information

857
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,880
on what we're doing keep in mind i did

858
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
say bro

859
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,960
science this is totally bro science i

860
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,319
gave a lot of disclaimers on that

861
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,000
but what i think happens when you put

862
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,439
your plant in the darkness like that it

863
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
kind of goes in panic mode

864
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,360
and it knows that it's over it's like

865
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,919
hey the plant relies on the sun the sun

866
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:14,079
tells it

867
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,440
hey it's springtime it's supposed to veg

868
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,558
then it goes hey it's fall time i'm

869
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,159
supposed to flower

870
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:20,158
and then it starts going hey the days

871
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,880
have been getting short i better hurry

872
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,039
up and finish

873
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,799
my whole goal in life is to get

874
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:25,759
pollinated so i can reproduce and make

875
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:26,720
seeds and if you're not going to

876
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:28,240
pollinate me

877
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,759
and let me produce seeds i'm just going

878
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,720
to get bigger and bigger and make bigger

879
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,879
fatter buds

880
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,919
so when you turn off the sun it goes

881
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,080
dude it's the [ __ ]

882
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,440
end so those buds just beef up and swell

883
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,678
the best they can at the end

884
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,120
then you've got that darkness that

885
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,960
darkness provides

886
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,639
more terpenes i think and then you've

887
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,000
got that cool which provides more

888
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,440
terpenes i think so

889
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,038
you're going to get swelling you're

890
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,840
going to get ripening of the trichomes

891
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:51,839
because they don't have

892
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,959
the daytime cycle the plant's just going

893
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,119
to freak out some of the

894
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,038
processes aren't going to happen so it

895
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,798
may help you ripen up it may help you

896
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:00,960
get a little more density

897
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,119
and it may add to flavor this is going

898
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,440
to be strain specific this could be

899
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,759
cultivar specific this could just be

900
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,519
very specific to the plant you were like

901
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,798
one out of seven plants in your grow may

902
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,079
love this how many plants you see you've

903
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:13,519
got you've got three

904
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,599
one of them may hate this two of them

905
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,599
may hate this they all three may love it

906
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,959
it's going to be based on the plant that

907
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,719
you were doing this with but

908
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,640
in most results it doesn't cause in most

909
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,278
experience it doesn't cause problems

910
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,120
it causes more uh increase in density

911
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:29,278
and flavors and aromas

912
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,038
all right my buddy evan i do appreciate
