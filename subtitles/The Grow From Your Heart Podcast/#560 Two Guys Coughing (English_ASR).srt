00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,519
description but it's got that

35
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,959

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,520
labs since you were kind enough to ask

45
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,118
i am smoking i took a dab of a beautiful

46
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:49,920
combo i was kind of a smart ass here

47
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:52,719
i've got some

48
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,118
bananas foster live batter and i've also

49
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,239
got

50
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,000
honey banana full spectrum extract uh i

51
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:58,478
wanted to go full banana on this bad

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,399
[ __ ]

53
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,478
so i took a little scoop i took it like

54
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,000
a three quarters of a normal size dab of

55
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,118
both of them so it was still bigger than

56
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,959
a normal dab

57
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:08,399
i took a big chunky dab it was a nice

58
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,399
blend of the batter and the full

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,199
spectrum extract and bro it was [ __ ]

60
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
bananas

61
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,639
ah that was a really nice dab uh the one

62
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,680
is described as

63
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,399
uh the flavor is banana and sugar and

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,959
oatmeal

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,520
and the other is frosted banana pastry

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,719
it was

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,640
like a banana runs candy or sometimes

68
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,759
when i get those uh cheap when i used to

69
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:29,359
eat those like cheap

70
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,280
i like a zingers or something i got a

71
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,720
lot of vanilla flavor it almost had that

72
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,878
sort of a sweet vanilla

73
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:36,000
banana pastry the frosting that cream

74
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:37,919
cheese frosting on the top

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,759
it had that in there as well really good

76
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:40,958
flavor so that was a nice combo i'm

77
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,318
really glad i decided to

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,640
to do that also it punched me right

79
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,639
in the face that combo was beautiful

80
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,359

81
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,039

114
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,519
extraction methods basically but it's

115
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,519
like our

116
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,640
our sops are just this much different

117
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,480
possibly i don't know

118
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:53,839
but i mean if one of them does something

119
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,598
just a little bit different the product

120
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,598
comes out so vastly different

121
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:59,518

289
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,360
you're saying because i love this topic

290
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,278
i don't go to comedy shows anymore there

291
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,959
aren't comedy shows to go to

292
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,799
my favorite things to do are comedy

293
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,958
shows and concerts and those are the

294
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,519
first things that we cannot do right now

295
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:07,518
like so i'm kind of going stir crazy in

296
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,080
my mind i love being out with the people

297
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,440
and [ __ ]

298
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,839
laughing laughter you guys if you listen

299
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,279
to the show from the beginning i've

300
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,560
talked about comedy i've tapered it off

301
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,759
because i feel like i'm rubbing it in a

302
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,079
little bit people don't care too much

303
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,319
about every [ __ ] comedy show i go to

304
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,000
but i've made friends with the people at

305
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
the comedy clubs i've made friends with

306
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,839
comedians i go to a lot of so my point

307
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,120
is i'm not doing that anymore i'm going

308
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,360
[ __ ] stir crazy

309
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,399
and i can only buy so much clothes and

310
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,839
shoes online

311
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,440

312
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,640

319
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:44,559
i got new shoes on right now just

320
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:45,360
because i can't [ __ ] wear them

start getting a throw tickle is hydrate

353
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
and minimize my consumption of smoke

354
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,079
like just dabs and hot smoke over the

355
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,360
throat i did a 36 hour stretch without

356
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:50,799
taking a dab

357
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,720

built usually each plant gets its own

489
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,480
special dripper and that leads to a lot

490
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:52,159
of [ __ ] headaches

491
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,680

496
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,240
need to get the same amount of water

497
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,399
right

498
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,759
you just need to saturate the soil there

499
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,078
so uh

500
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,159
yeah we've just got big emitters like

501
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,958
you'd put for uh

502
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,719
a yard or a flower bed or something in

503
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,479
the corners of the boxes

504
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,079
and we didn't even do all four corners

505
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,600
we did on the

506
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:26,159
the two square boxes i've got diagonals

507
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,839
so um like one in the front right and

508
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,159
one in the back left

509
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,680
and then on the long rectangle box i've

510
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,120
got uh

511
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:37,120
two corners on one side and a big 180

512
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,039
shooting in the middle on the other side

513
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,399
and it seems to be covering everything a

514
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,679
hundred percent

515
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
the amount of veggies we're getting out

516
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:44,078
of this thing is [ __ ] ridiculous dude

517
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,399
they

518
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,638
taste good they were really sweet really

519
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,500
really sweet nine yellow squash in my

520
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,799

521
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,240
[Music]

that we've harvested over the last

523
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,360
couple days that we haven't managed to

524
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,440
eat or give away

525
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,800

526
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,800

licking your finger and checking the

535
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,559
wind and [ __ ] every day and just out

536
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:20,319
there doing what you know how to do

537
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:21,758
i fire up my morning coffee and while

538
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,839
i'm drinking my morning coffee i go

539
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,360
stare at it like i'm doing stuff

540
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,160
it just gets me away from the kids while

541
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,600
i get half a cup of coffee in me

542
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,679
and then i get out there with the kids

543
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,839
for like half an hour in the evening

544
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,120
and we pull weeds and pick veggies that

545
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,800
are ready and

546
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
it's a great little time killer oh

547
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,679
that's a cool experience for the kids

548
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,360
dude they're bringing food in from their

549
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,559
yard that they grew that you guys

550
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,680
made and then they get to have it for

551
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,198
dinner yup you need to see a process

552
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,198
they actually get to do it and they're

553
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:52,240
uh like i'm gigantic people i'm

554
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,758
six three 250 pounds um

555
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:57,680
if i'm being nice i'll let you have it

556
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,360
like i can't squeeze through some of the

557
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:00,000
corn and [ __ ] or like tiptoe through

558
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,600
some of the

559
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,199
the stuff and they can they're tiny so

560
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,838
that's been really helpful too like

561
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:13,360
that's cool little tiny helper bots

562
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:13,359
little box little uh useful opa loompas

563
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,120
yeah i think i do wants a dab buddy i'm

564
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,318
pretty rambly already no it's perfect

565
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,918
but i kind of was hoping that we could

566
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:20,480
kind of turn it into a ramble cast

567
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,919
because

568
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,439
they do and it's been pretty intensive

569
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,120
lately everything has just been [ __ ]

570
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,519
less and less and learn learn and

571
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:29,038
it's been intense shows have been really

572
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,038
good you talk for like seven seconds

573
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,558
i'll take a dab and then i'll cover you

574
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,279
sounds good to me i'll wait onto eating

575
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:37,519
that then so uh

576
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:39,200
i really like the last couple episodes

577
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:42,480
on safety

578
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,759
um a lot of the cannabis forums i've

579
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,640
been reading lately

580
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,558
you can tell that people haven't thought

581
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,200
all the way through

582
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,079
their grow setup so they've thought

583
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,919
about

584
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,279
i want to grow cannabis and they've

585
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,880
thought about maybe where they're going

586
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,678
to get the seeds

587
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,919
or which light they're going to use but

588
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,798
they haven't thought about

589
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,880
all of the steps all the way to the end

590
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:11,119
so they haven't thought about

591
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,799
planting or transplanting or cloning

592
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:16,479
harvesting which hours of the day

593
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,160
they're going to run their lights i mean

594
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,038
during the summer right now

595
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,720
i saw like 130 in death valley might be

596
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,798
a world record

597
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,919
vegas right now is breaking all kinds of

598
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:27,679
records

599
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,440
like if you're running your grow lights

600
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,280
during the day right now

601
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,240
like oh lordy you're fighting yourself

602
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,798
140 degrees in your grow

603
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,839
a lot of people don't think to wait i

604
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,400
can just run them

605
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,119
from night to morning like plant don't

606
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
give a [ __ ]

607
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,719
like it don't have to be to work the

608
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,640
next day yeah you can write it on

609
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,440
whatever schedule you want

610
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,360
and just learn taking the time to really

611
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,440
think through all the steps

612
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:54,558
especially drying here i know so many

613
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,798
people

614
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,038
that i mean you spend a ton of money on

615
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:01,119
good equipment and good grow lights and

616
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,640
good nutrients and you invest

617
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,479
all the time to get your plant to

618
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
harvest and then they throw it in a

619
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,960
cardboard box or stick it in an

620
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,679
oven like how many times have we seen

621
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,480
that bro oh

622
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,720
yeah we used to run a shop so we got

623
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,079
everybody bringing everything to us

624
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,360
and they would tell us what they did

625
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:18,639
they thought they were cool by doing

626
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,678
dumb tricks

627
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,840
yep everybody yeah it's

628
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,679
a little different this time oh why

629
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,918
because we set it on the door of the

630
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,679
oven and turn the oven on 400 for three

631
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,960
hours instead of letting you dry and

632
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,640
cure for two years i can't remember that

633
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,319

636
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:40,000
confidential let's not go let's not have

637
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,120
too many details but yes no but that was

638
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,558
the strain right

639
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,119
yeah we're thinking of the same kid same

640

pound ruined weed

644
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,079
yeah the safety episode like honestly

645
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,839
that safety episode came from

646
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,279
uh working in multiple commercial

647
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:00,879

scissors in their damn pocket

662
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,240
forgot about it and stabbed themselves

663
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:29,759
half an hour later with him

664
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,839
and that's how i put that episode

665
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,440
together basically i've seen the [ __ ]

666
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,959
i've been in countless grows around

667
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,519
countless growers

668
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,440
and i've seen hungover people i've seen

669
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,079
stone people i've seen sober people in a

670
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,159
hurry

671
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,439
i've seen people clearing wood chippers

672
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,559
with broom handle

673
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,240
aluminum broom handles i've seen i've

674
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:48,798
seen a lot of crazy [ __ ] so that's how i

675
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,079
know

676
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:52,079
like you're gonna cut yourself you're

677
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,319
gonna stub your toe you're gonna [ __ ]

678
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:55,519
spray a chemical in your eye one day

679
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,599
you're gonna [ __ ]

680
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,839
you ever see two guys hold the two by

681
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,879
six and another guy walk on the two by

682
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:05,279
six to change a light bulb

683
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,919
because we have you ever seen a guy put

684
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:08,960
a ladder on a scissor lift and raise the

685
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,480
scissor lift to get

686
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,679
up high enough to get to that [ __ ]

687
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,159
light because we did

688
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,679
um yeah man we've seen and done a lot of

689
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,440
crazy [ __ ] that we probably shouldn't

690
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,120
even admit to having seen or done in a

691
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,759
commercial environment

692
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:26,239
come in in the morning and the 300 pound

693
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,319
carbon filter is smashed on the floor

694
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,798
15 feet below where it was hanging when

695
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,480
you left that last night like a big

696
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,400
ring of carbon around it and [ __ ]

697
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,919
like 12 plants in a tray just

698
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,480
smashed yeah we yeah uh

699
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,120
snakes and lights because we've seen

700
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,558
this

701
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:46,399
birds and [ __ ] exhaust fans uh

702
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,000
squirrels i was wondering if you were

703
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,679
gonna mention your finger in the fan on

704
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,440
that episode yeah i think i did this

705
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,038
episode's about safety i was like oh

706
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,400
he's gonna tell the finger story

707
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,158
uh you made me think about something i

708
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,519
wanted to add to the safety episode and

709
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,640
it just totally [ __ ] left my head

710
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,279
because there were so many good thoughts

711
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,799
happening

712
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,240
that it may come to me or maybe maybe

713
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:02,879
i'll just watch this episode and rethink

714
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,558
about it

715
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,240
uh something that happens in [ __ ]

716
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,639
random grows but yeah

717
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,519
we've had some crazy [ __ ] happen dude uh

718
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,280
the squirrel

719
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,639
squirrel that chewed on the [ __ ] big

720
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,000
cable outside and killed the power of

721
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,200
the whole [ __ ] building and we went

722
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,519
outside and found

723
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,240
a squirrel it was as stiff as my [ __ ]

724
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,400
bic pen

725
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,159
like from head to toe that squirrel was

726
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,200
barbecued and just stiff

727
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,720
like yeah we've seen some weird [ __ ] uh

728
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,919
the rattlesnakes

729
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,400
we had to grow uh [ __ ] 15 minutes

730
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,000
from here

731
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,840
where we found multiple [ __ ]

732
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,640
rattlesnakes outside i had another grow

733
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,158
where we found tarantulas inside

734
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,000
a bunch of crazy [ __ ] used to happen at

735
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,240
some of these commercials

736
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,839
lizards was common yeah lizards they

737
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,038
didn't even bother anybody after a while

738
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,158
right here's another lizard just run

739
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:50,319
them outside

740
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,640
what happens when the co2 tank that's

741
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:58,079
like 80 feet tall blows the seal

742
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,360
and dumps your whole new co2 delivery

743
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:02,480
out

744
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:02,479
in like an hour

745
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,480
i can walk it outside one day and i'm

746
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,038
i'm at the front of a long building

747
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,200
building's half a city block

748
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,970
and i'm in the front of the building and

749
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,319
i hear

750
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:18,000
[Music]

751
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,759
and i know that's a curious sound and i

752
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,880
start walking towards it it gets louder

753
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:22,158
and louder and louder and louder and

754
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,320
louder there's a certain point

755
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,400
i can't hear anymore because it's the

756
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,759
sounds so oppressive it's blocking out

757
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,440
other sounds

758
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,000
you can walk it around and there's this

759
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,320
nice fog emitting from the back of the

760
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,319
building

761
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:39,119
yeah just money flying out of that

762
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,959
canister

763
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,319
it's so hard to plan for all the [ __ ]

764
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
you're gonna run into when you grow

765
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,200
cannabis

766
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,359
yeah well then uh what happened that day

767
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,558
was so we have big canisters outside of

768
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,278
the building and a truck phil

769
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,359
comes up and hooks up a line and fills

770
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,359
those canisters with co2 so we don't

771
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,000
have to move canisters all the time

772
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:59,918
uh the machine is worth the co2 should

773
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,359
have been 10 or 14 days the guy fell

774
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,278
asleep in his truck bro

775
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,278
and he froze the line because co2 is a

776
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:06,640
cold gas it froze the lines

777
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,640
and it didn't stop so when he

778
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,880
disconnected everything was frozen

779
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,880
it also froze the lines inside the grow

780
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,000
and it was just spinning co2 in all the

781
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,320
grow rooms

782
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,599
at a ridiculous rate yeah the alarms

783
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:18,079
went off in the building we had to

784
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,240
evacuate

785
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:23,199
the building and [ __ ] yep yeah that was

786
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,960
that was pretty ridiculous

787
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,038
i've seen walls collapse wow because

788
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,159
people put up too much weight and it was

789
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:32,079
just a cheap little

790
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,200
cardboard or they're not cardboard

791
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,720
drywall

792
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,840
over over plywood so it's just

793
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,159
you never know what you're going to run

794
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,879
into folks safety first

795
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,159
then teamwork don't put [ __ ] scissors

796
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,120
in your pocket

797
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,200
yeah right scissors in your pocket yeah

798
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,158
i've taken plenty of people to

799
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,319
the emergency room for dumb dumb things

800
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,919
pesticide exposure was my least favorite

801
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,839
to go to the hospital for

802
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,200
because every time you walk in you're

803
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,278
like i've got uh

804
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,240
i'm a manager at a cultivation facility

805
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:05,119
and this employee

806
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,720
has a pesticide exposure like something

807
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,239
goes off and everybody that's like we

808
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,919
need to contaminate you

809
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,319
and we're always like no no no no no no

810
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,400
contaminate this was yesterday like we

811
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,000
i've always got to explain like he got

812
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,759
hit yesterday with the pesticides he

813
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,640
sees a rash today we're fine i wasn't

814
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:19,759
even in the room

815
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,520
he's the only sprayer we're not

816
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,200
contaminated i have always have to talk

817
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,599
fast to get us out of that one

818
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,200
yep like yeah yeah if one of the grow

819
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:28,798
techs went and just went by themselves

820
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,319
and said it i think they'd probably end

821
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:33,119
up in a decon unit

822
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,319
[ __ ] lockdown and [ __ ] yeah yeah but

823
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,158
i've seen too many of our friends get

824
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,599
steroid shots and [ __ ]

825
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,600

00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,079
need for the marker because by lunch

872
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,240
[ __ ] from his

873
00:26:56,079 --> 00:27:00,319
kneecap to his collarbone he looked like

874
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,319
somebody had clawed him or something

875
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,599
and the doctor said that that pesticide

876
00:27:02,319 --> 00:27:05,918
that he was exposed to

877
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:07,759
was heat activated the heat in his body

878
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:09,278
was making him get a worse rash and we

879
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,519
were working on a grow and we were long

880
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,679
sleeves and [ __ ] so he was definitely

881
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,558
uh but yeah so he got a funky eye and it

882
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,440
just happened

883
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,798
uh within 12 24 hours it went from that

884
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,640

yeah they gave him whatever that pill is

889
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,440
claritin or that doesn't sound right

890
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:31,359
but they gave him something like that

891
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,880

941
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,600
part of the grow

942
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:08,480

something

944
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,599
and they moved the container that those

945
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,080
were soaking in and it didn't have a lid

946
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,759
it just had a i think it was a piece of

947
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,278
tape over the top that said

948
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:21,119
you know don't touch yeah it said what

949
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,798
it was on it actually said what it was

950
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,398
because i remember this very well

951
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:25,918
and i know exactly the person she said

952
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:27,519
on their hand and ended up with a

953
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:30,880
chemical burn

954
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,558
um and yeah like five minutes later they

955
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,039

956
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,200

959
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,559
zero tall and their hand was turning

960
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,679
white and puffy and the skin was kind of

961
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,158
dying a little bit

962
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,600
yeah jeff was there i remember exactly

963
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,960
the day in that purse because they tried

964
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,199
to they're like what do i do and i was

965
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,120
like

966
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,319
don't don't [ __ ] around because they

967
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,199
were [ __ ] around that's why they got

968
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:55,839
hurt that's

969
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,840
yeah yeah yep

970
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,359
yeah see i knew what it was immediately

971
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,880
when i shoo when i saw

972
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,558
the skin reaction i knew what it was

973
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,039
immediately like you got zero tall on

974
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:07,119
you

975
00:30:05,038 --> 00:30:08,079
and i bet it came from that like it's

976
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,439
just

977
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,798

there is

990
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:32,398
zero tall in this cup because we're

991
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,319
cleaning these emitters like make make

992
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,558
that [ __ ] known like mark stuff

993
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,240
i like to keep a big dry erase board and

994
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,839
every cultivation every room has a

995
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,960
dedicated dry erase board we can mark

996
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,879
down what's going on

997
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,480
when mike does something like this room

998
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,480
needs to be defoliated by the end of the

999
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,599
day michael do it mark his initials

1000
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,519
and if i don't like the way it's

1001
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,959
defoliated i know to go cuss mike out

1002
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:52,720
for it

1003
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,960
it's when you were talking about that on

1004
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,759
the the episode i was thinking how nice

1005
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,480
it is that

1006
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:59,759
that we can do that in legal land now

1007
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,000
that used to be like the

1008
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:05,119
one of the top five tips for being a

1009
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:08,159
grower during prohibition times was

1010
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:11,038
don't keep like if you keep records make

1011
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,159
it in code don't make it obvious because

1012
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:17,440
your notes are evidence yep

1013
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,840
and yeah now it's there's a lot less

1014
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,558
than that we're in colorado we can just

1015
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,359
have a big whiteboard have sops have

1016
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,359
logs

1017
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:30,479
all that [ __ ] makes life so much easier

1018
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:32,558
yeah yeah the sops are one of my at

1019
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,519
first i was uh

1020
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,359
afraid of or intimidated or whatever

1021
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,519
turned off by sops

1022
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,639
and now i love a good sop like it's kind

1023
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:42,079
of there's something in me

1024
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,840
like if you want to pay me to write you

1025
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,119
sops like oh yeah

1026
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:46,398
that's like one of my favorite things to

1027
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:47,839
do let me come look at your building

1028
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:50,158
look at what you got we'll write

1029
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,079
[ __ ] from walking in and washing our

1030
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,760
hands we'll write an sop

1031
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,038
from using the time clock all the way to

1032
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:57,919
clocking out i'll get you [ __ ]

1033
00:31:55,038 --> 00:32:00,319
programmed with sops i love that [ __ ]

1034
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,200
it cracks me up i've had more than one

1035
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,918
outfit

1036
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,399
that paid me to help tweak theirs and

1037
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,440
then

1038
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:09,759
six months later i come back to

1039
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,120
do a follow-up and they're not following

1040
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,558
any of it and they can't figure out why

1041
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:13,918
she's not better

1042
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:15,599
and it's like well have you tried

1043
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,759
following the steps and it's all new

1044
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:19,599
employees that weren't there before

1045
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,599
and so you show that new staff the

1046
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,879
actual sops you pull them out you pull

1047
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,599
up the file and you go like have you

1048
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,278
ever read

1049
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,359
this and they go oh that's such a good

1050
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,119
idea let me come back in like three days

1051
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:30,639
and like yeah the tremors are faster

1052
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,079
the [ __ ] weight room is faster the

1053
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,360
quality control is faster everything

1054
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:33,918
seems to be smoother here i don't know

1055
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,798
what happened

1056
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,840
like yeah we wrote sops like yeah yeah

1057
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,398
we do it

1058
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,678
now step by step sometimes it looks like

1059
00:32:40,398 --> 00:32:43,359
the lead grower

1060
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,720
is just losing his mind standing there

1061
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,759
staring at the plants and looking off

1062
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,679
into space but

1063
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,960
uh we've got sops and [ __ ] in our brain

1064
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,000
we're like oh man we're gonna have to

1065
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,679
[ __ ] do these next

1066
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,599
seven [ __ ] steps because we already

1067
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,278
know like we got the map in our head

1068
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:59,119
sometimes we just get that weird

1069
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:01,200
weird [ __ ] look right no it's i don't

1070
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:06,000
envy that part of the

1071
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,319
part of the grow i'm i'm i like my end

1072
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,200
uh and i don't care for your end of the

1073
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,278
grow so that's beautiful

1074
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,880
you want to talk about metric before we

1075
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:17,759
even tell them what it is

1076
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,360
yeah tell them in three words explain to

1077
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,519
me how you feel about metric and then

1078
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,199
we'll tell them what it is after that

1079
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,038
[ __ ] that spinning wheel i think that

1080
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,880
was more than too many words but

1081
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,398
that's going to be the general consensus

1082
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,000
for anybody who

1083
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,759
has to deal with metric [ __ ] that

1084
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,079
spinning wheel metric

1085
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,038
is the marijuana enforcement tracking

1086
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:38,558
blah blah blah

1087
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:42,879
system the software system and

1088
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:47,519
it can be like i get why it exists but

1089
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,440
it it is what it is

1090
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:51,440
you just want them to come after me i

1091
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,278
don't work in the med anymore ah

1092
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,960
i don't with metric i mean i work with

1093
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:56,240
med but i work with metric

1094
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,278
i work in the back end so i don't really

1095
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,720
have to talk to him i hand you a

1096
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,798
clipboard and you do all that metric

1097
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,480
[ __ ] for me thank you bro

1098
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,079
that [ __ ] program sucks and needs

1099
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,720
some [ __ ] updates and it's the

1100
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,119
biggest

1101
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,679
waste of time in people's days it's a

1102
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,159
good program when it works the idea the

1103
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,960
goal

1104
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,720
this [ __ ] purpose is [ __ ] awesome

1105
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,119
execution

1106
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,078
thumbs down zero [ __ ] that [ __ ]

1107
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,320
service dude

1108
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,320
uh mike said [ __ ] that spinning wheel

1109
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,159
when uh everybody's first question when

1110
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,800
they get into metric is it supposed to

1111
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,720
randomly eat a third of your day

1112
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,919
yeah apparently that's not a bug that's

1113
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:33,039
a feature yeah

1114
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:34,799
um anytime we cut a clone try not

1115
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,759
transplant but move a plant from another

1116
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,679
room

1117
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,440
uh anything that really happens with

1118
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:42,000
plant relocation

1119
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,119
uh recreation time you cut the clone to

1120
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,159
the time you

1121
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,280
you harvest it it's it's getting moved

1122
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,519
around in metric

1123
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,200
yeah it gets into close it's harvested

1124
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,119
it gets weighed out and re-entered into

1125
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,118
metric and then that's in metric too

1126
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,039
all the waste gets put into metric all

1127
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,358
the packages get put in the metric

1128
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,960
so you cut a clone that goes into metric

1129
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:03,119
the clone gets a number

1130
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,199
uh the plan a comes from has a mother

1131
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,880
plan number which is also included

1132
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,480
in that [ __ ] clone number so you got

1133
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,160
clone number seven five five

1134
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,159
five five that came from plant number

1135
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,679
seven five four four four

1136
00:35:12,159 --> 00:35:15,519
uh we can follow all the way down the

1137
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:16,000
line where each clone of each clone of

1138
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:18,159
each clone

1139
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,159
came from which is cool because then we

1140
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:21,679
can tell you uh once it's harvested they

1141
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:23,358
go into batches and we can tell you what

1142
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,358
pesticides were applied

1143
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:26,880
for [ __ ] seven generations of those

1144
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:30,159
plants hypothetically

1145
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,000
uh did you see why all this is exists

1146
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:34,159
during when we have a recall

1147
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,760
yeah and it's like the 12 stores that

1148
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,920
bought plants that were harvested

1149
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:40,320
between these dates at this facility

1150
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,280
all have to get and they can track it

1151
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,480
down to the

1152
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:47,200
the pre-rolls on the counter yep it uh

1153
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,838
it's a nice system it's just not at all

1154
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,358
smooth out

1155
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:50,960
well half the time when you go to use it

1156
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:51,838
it just the [ __ ] you get this little

1157
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,119
wheel of death

1158
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:54,880
that just spins in the middle of your

1159
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,320
[ __ ] screen it looks like the little

1160
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,320
thing from uh there's used to be a

1161
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,838
trivial pursuit game and it looks like

1162
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,480
the [ __ ] trivial pursuit thing just

1163
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:02,639
spinner the

1164
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,000
windows [ __ ] thing just spit or the

1165
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,279
apple thing that just spins right in the

1166
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,280
middle of the [ __ ] screen

1167
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,800
but usually with like windows or apple

1168
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,160
even windows i'm an apple guy [ __ ] a

1169
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,280
windows machine in my opinion

1170
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,719
but it works better than goddamn metric

1171
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,560
that thing eventually does something

1172
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:18,159
metric just goes [ __ ] you [ __ ] you [ __ ]

1173
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,880
you [ __ ] you [ __ ] you and just spins in

1174
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:20,559
circles in it

1175
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,559
it's like middle fingers just coming at

1176
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,480
you and the shittiest part is

1177
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,159
uh this wasn't my end of the building

1178
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,800
but i witnessed this plenty of times

1179
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,879
because

1180
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,640
delivery drivers would come to pick up

1181
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,920
product from the commercial cultivation

1182
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:33,838
you have to pick it up there's

1183
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,519
dried trim cured ready to go product it

1184
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,039
has to leave there mike just doesn't

1185
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,320
throw on the car and take it a courier

1186
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,519
comes and gets it

1187
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,680
and they take that to either a

1188
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,199
processing facility or to a dispensary

1189
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:45,679
for retail sales

1190
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,279
for that product to leave our commercial

1191
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:49,598
cultivation facility

1192
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,880
it's got to be in metric as a package

1193
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,680
that package has to be

1194
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,039
on a manifest for a transport or for a

1195
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:58,000
transfer

1196
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,800
if metric freezes you cannot make the

1197
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,440
manifest

1198
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,359
for the transfer and the package has to

1199
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,519
sit there in our facility

1200
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:07,759
even if that delivery driver drove from

1201
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,679
boulder to pick it up to take it to a

1202
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,920
concentrate processing facility or an

1203
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,559
edible facility in boulder

1204
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,920
until metric works again everybody just

1205
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,480
hurry up and wait

1206
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
so we've had delivery drivers just

1207
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,320
kicking it in the office just

1208
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,680
hey do you have a phone charger like

1209
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,960
i've been here for like oh and i'm not

1210
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,399
leaving because i mean i can't go

1211
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,838
anywhere else because none of the other

1212
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,039
facilities can do anything because

1213
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,679
metrics frozen

1214
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,119
everywhere so they just kick it yeah

1215
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,159
there's a there's a thai food restaurant

1216
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,680
right over there it's pretty good

1217
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,279
there's an indian food place that way

1218
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,480
but other than that bro just hang out

1219
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,800
have a good time

1220
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,039
yeah metric will ruin your whole [ __ ]

1221
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,039
day

1222
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,440
yeah so a lot of times i'm lucky because

1223
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,720
when i cut the clones that i talk about

1224
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,240
have to be put into metric

1225
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:52,399
i do it on a clipboard because i got

1226
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:53,598
dirty ass hands i'm dirty i'm in a hurry

1227
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,280
and i don't want to go to the computer

1228
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,200
and [ __ ] take off my gloves and type

1229
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,640
in six clones of [ __ ] chem dog and go

1230
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,078
back and put on gloves and cut more and

1231
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,000
then wipe off again

1232
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,359
so i keep a [ __ ] marker and a big

1233
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,480
piece of paper and i scribble it and

1234
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:05,838
mike has to [ __ ] put it in the

1235
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,519

for damn sure and

1263
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,598
i always hated it when a delivery driver

1264
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,000
was early

1265
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,838
and it was like all right dude now i

1266
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,800

gonna play nice if you showed up on time

1270
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,320
and then people are gonna say well why

1271
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,920
don't you make the manifest at the start

1272
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:11,599
of the day or the night before

1273
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:13,280
there's a time limit you can only make a

1274
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,640
manifest within a certain time frame

1275
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,200
before the delivery leaves

1276
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,440
also we need the delivery drivers

1277
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,439
identification while he's on site we

1278
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,079
need the vehicle license plate number

1279
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,159
we need the driver's identification his

1280
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,400
driver's license and his medical or his

1281
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,440
colorado marijuana enforcement division

1282
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,680
badge number

1283
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,440
so we don't know if kyle the delivery

1284
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,279
driver is coming in the subaru

1285
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,639
uh we don't know if tom is coming in the

1286
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,640
[ __ ] mitsubishi

1287
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,719
uh we don't know if [ __ ] kyle is

1288
00:39:38,639 --> 00:39:42,960
driving a different car this time so

1289
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,759
unless you can contact them and then by

1290
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,519
lunchtime

1291
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,320
traffic from [ __ ] boulder to pueblo

1292
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,920
that's three hours uh kyle may bail out

1293
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,599
[ __ ] tom maybe end up being our

1294
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,200
[ __ ] delivery driver today so

1295
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,280
then we gotta tear up the whole [ __ ]

1296
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,960
manifest cancel the delivery and redo

1297
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,800
the whole [ __ ] thing so

1298
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,440
that's why we don't do the manifest in

1299
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,680
the morning we've tried

1300
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,960
you only redo three or four manifests

1301
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:07,440
before you stop trying to

1302
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,400
to prep them too early yeah and it's

1303
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,318
brutal

1304
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,599
you have you redo too many of them and

1305
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:13,119
then all of a sudden somebody's got

1306
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,000
questions about why you're redoing them

1307
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,960
and

1308
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,480
it's just the whole says i i've tried to

1309
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,000
explain to people that are like man

1310
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,679
legalization's gonna be awesome i'm

1311
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
gonna grow weed in my basement and sell

1312
00:40:21,679 --> 00:40:25,919
it to stores it's like that's

1313
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,519
that part of legalization disappears

1314
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,519
quick yeah that's for like

1315
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:31,199
six months in a new market you get that

1316
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,559
wild wild west vibe

1317
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,480
uh unless you're michigan it feels like

1318
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,679
they hung out hung on to that [ __ ] for a

1319
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,838
while but

1320
00:40:35,679 --> 00:40:39,598
oklahoma tightened up quite quickly

1321
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,159
california definitely trus

1322
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,720
tried is trying i don't know it is

1323
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:45,759
trying

1324
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:47,759
cali's a unique stitch they dragged

1325
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,240
their feet for like 18 years which is

1326
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,480
why they're having so much trouble but

1327
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:53,919
the the newer emerging legalization

1328
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,199
markets there's

1329
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,680
they seem to to launch with much more

1330
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:02,318
rules and regs in place originally than

1331
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:03,919
than some of the early launches did like

1332
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:06,159
when colorado and cali and

1333
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,440
in washington first went it was just

1334
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:11,440
like weeds legal now

1335
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,440
dot dot dot like here like uh so

1336
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,480
tell me to figure out the taxes a cut

1337
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,079
goes to schools that's the whole rule

1338
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,559
you can carry two ounces and you can

1339
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,359
have 99 plants that's pretty much

1340
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,279
the rules that we know of okay cool

1341
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:26,239
let's have a good start rule wasn't even

1342
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,440
really a rule

1343
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:31,919
it was a pre-existing federal

1344
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:33,280
amplifier right where the feds had a

1345
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,200
rule in place for

1346
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,800
it wasn't even a written down rule it

1347
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,799
was just a rule of thumb

1348
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,480
if they catch a guy with 99 plants the

1349
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,160
federal government doesn't care

1350
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,519
if the federal government finds you 100

1351
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:48,559
plants they consider you al capone

1352
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:51,838
so that became just the de facto

1353
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:54,000
in colorado and then people for a while

1354
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:56,000
were going with 499 because that was

1355
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,719
another federal cut off

1356
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,480
where you got one penalty for 499 and

1357
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:04,159
another penalty for 500.

1358
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,960
man so yep yeah those were the days bro

1359
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,399
wild west days are fun people just open

1360
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,639

1362
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,838

1363
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,119

1364
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:16,799

1365
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:19,760

1366
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,760
different jars and

1367

1377
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:38,159
the best of ways

1378
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,639

1380

1381
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,318

1382
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,480
stoned and comfortable

1383
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,920
that i just like rolled down and just

1384
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,280
stood up and walked out of it

1385
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,960
like it was just like how it was meant

1386
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,839
to be like i didn't fall i just

1387
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,400
didn't use my feet to get down because

1388
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,400

1389
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:04,318
awkwardly beautiful it uh

1430
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,078
[ __ ] gram of some other random [ __ ]

1431
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,200

that while you're home so if you like

1436
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,760
that and you got a lot of options and we

1437
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,039
got a lot of people set up on medical

1438
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,960
marijuana you'd be able to come back and

1439
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:19,119
just smoke a bowl back there

1440
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,240
uh the lady that owned the place or the

1441
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,119
owner's wife

1442
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:25,358
she loved to bake and they grew and her

1443
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,318
favorite thing was to make edibles

1444
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,199
her second favorite thing so it's such

1445
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:30,480
good homemade

1446
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,559
they were delicious too that was an

1447
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,480
amazing process like

1448
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,159
grandma made banana bread kind of

1449
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,480
[ __ ] edibles like not like

1450
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,759
store-bought like weird but like the

1451
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:43,280
fudge dude

1452
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,000
oh the fudge i am like 99 vegan nobody

1453
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,000
cares i'm just

1454
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,440
i am like mostly vegan but if some of

1455
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,920
that fudge showed up i'd have to take a

1456
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,920
bite

1457
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,920
like that stuff was so freaking good and

1458
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,079
it's like really mostly dairy

1459
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:56,159
but this lady i said her favorite thing

1460
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,880
was to make amazing edibles her second

1461
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,118
thing

1462
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,559
was to bring them to the dispensary and

1463
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:02,160
tell mike and i

1464
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,719
you got to try them because we can't put

1465
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,799
them on the shelf without trying them

1466
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,118
and this was before lab testing lab

1467
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,440
testing used to be like this

1468
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,160
it tastes good three people ate it an

1469
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,679
hour later had a conversation about it

1470
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,078
if one of us was asleep on the couch

1471
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,118
we'd probably sell that product the

1472
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,720
first time

yup it was like

1487
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:52,480

1488
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:53,279
the [ __ ] puddle on the floor ball it

1489

1490
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,880
and you on the floor as one of us like

1491
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,639
quite often one of us had to go sit in

1492
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,280
the car and [ __ ] get an extra lunch

1493
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:00,960
break

1494
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:02,319
uh i'd find you out on the back patio

1495
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,760
stairs and road joints

1496
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,358
yeah yeah i'd find it you on that back

1497
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,319
patio upstairs smoking a cigarette with

1498
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:07,920
this look on your face

1499
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:09,519
like oh he just got too high on his

1500
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:11,760
break he'll be back in a few minutes

1501
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,559
like he's got to leave mike alone but

1502
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,160
there was always

1503
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,239
enough of us in there we could just

1504
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,598
juggle it like we never i managed a 40

1505
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:19,279
lane bowling center it always seemed to

1506
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,640
be the same way one of us would be like

1507
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,440
oh you gotta you gotta hide from the

1508
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:22,799
boss

1509
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,559
and like the rest of us would just make

1510
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:26,240
the [ __ ] work and his job would get done

1511
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:27,838
or her job would get done

1512
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:29,679
it always seemed to work that way at the

1513
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,599

00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:59,599
yeah shout out to those guys i don't

1563
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:01,279
want to say both of their names because

1564
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:04,000
i said too much already but

1565
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,720
without them uh we wouldn't be where we

1566
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,480
are mike so

1567
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,000
i always like to remember that and pay

1568
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,000
some homage and tribute to those folks

1569
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,199
because that was the catalyst

1570
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,039
yeah his court trial uh introduced me

1571
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,118
to being comfortable in a courtroom and

1572
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:19,199
understanding that process

1573
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,880
and i think he relied on you for a lot

1574
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:24,159
of that sort of stuff as well

1575
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,960
and when uh when the city ended that

1576
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:29,199
like they did

1577
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:33,039
that anger that and fueled me to do

1578
00:48:29,199 --> 00:48:36,159
years of city council [ __ ] just years

1579
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:38,079
off that one injustice

1580
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,598
so what mike is talking about is uh we

1581
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,119
had the privilege

1582
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,880
um i've talked about this before on the

1583
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,519
podcast we had the privilege of being a

1584
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:48,480
large part of the very first dispensary

1585
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,920
within the city of pueblo colorado

1586
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:52,559
i found some people who were trying to

1587
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,240
open a dispensary no offense to them

1588
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,839
they were older they're of another

1589
00:48:54,239 --> 00:48:58,078
generation they didn't have

1590
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,838
the hip edge that a dispensary needed

1591
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,200
and they didn't have any balls

1592
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,039
they had little balls they were trying

1593
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,919
to get it started they tried to do it on

1594
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,239
a third floor

1595
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,159
office space i moved the dispensary to

1596
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:09,039
the [ __ ] ground floor and put a sign

1597
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:10,960
out front

1598
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,318
and [ __ ] we turned that little idea

1599
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,720
into a [ __ ]

1600
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,000
flourishing business it was crushing and

1601
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:17,519
then one day

1602
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,559
uh some city officials came in and

1603
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,800
they're like nomas and they shut us down

1604
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,040
they gave us a letter that it literally

1605
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,599
said we're closing your business

1606
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,639
because you're breaking the rules we're

1607
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,519
discussing

1608
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:36,480
passing into law so you have to close

1609
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:38,079
and that's just how can you shut a

1610
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,519
business down for passing rules that

1611
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,599
don't exist yet that's

1612
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,679
insanely [ __ ] and they did not know we

1613
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,119
were breaking rules that did not exist

1614
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,159
yet until we paid them

1615
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,920
21 000 in the tax payment

1616
00:49:48,159 --> 00:49:51,118
that was our retail sales tax that we

1617
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,480
paid them and then they asked how did

1618
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,680
you make so much money in such a short

1619
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,199
time and they came to figure out what

1620
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,440
kind of business we had

1621
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,199
after we'd been on the news talking

1622
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,960
about our business after we'd made a

1623
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:01,759
solid business plan with the letter of

1624
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,760
intent

1625
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,119
all of that was filed appropriately but

1626
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,599
then one day they're like they made 21

1627
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,720
000

1628
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:12,240
in taxes let's go close that [ __ ] down

1629
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:15,199
this was back when there were what

1630
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,159
four five six dispensaries in the state

1631
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,439
yeah

1632
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:19,199
uh there may have been more than that

1633
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,280
because uh

1634
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,558
when i got to take weekends off

1635
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,400
eventually i worked there for [ __ ]

1636
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,280
six days a week for like six months dude

1637
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,720
but when i finally

1638
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:31,119
right after they opened there was a

1639
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:31,679
little bit of a explosion across the

1640
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:33,599
state

1641
00:50:31,679 --> 00:50:34,879
the broadsword they were one of the

1642
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,800
first ten

1643
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,240
yeah i would agree with that but then

1644
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,440
one of my jobs

1645
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:44,558
the owner would give me a budget to go

1646
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:46,559
cruise to other dispensaries in colorado

1647
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,599
springs denver boulder fort collins

1648
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:49,280
wherever i could go

1649
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,800
if i was going somewhere that weekend

1650
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,640
he'd be like well make sure to hit

1651
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,240
whatever here's your budget and you'd

1652
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:54,719
[ __ ] throw me money dude he'd like

1653
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:56,879
make sure

1654
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:58,799
and we'd come back and we'd all uh there

1655
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,160
would be back then we could smoke in the

1656
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,599
dispensary and [ __ ] we had a little

1657
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,039
employee area and we'd all just gather

1658
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:04,400
around on monday morning and see what

1659
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:05,838
jeff brought from denver

1660
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:07,280
[ __ ] this is what i got a kind love

1661
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:08,558
this is what i got at the ganja gourmet

1662
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,920
this is what came from the clinic this

1663
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,200
is what came from cam

1664
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,720
and we'd all just set it all on the

1665
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:14,399
table and just puff because the owner of

1666
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:16,078
that store bought it wasn't really mine

1667
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:17,440
but he gave me the money to go see

1668
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:18,160
what's available at all these other

1669
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,159
places

1670
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:22,000
that was really fun and they would just

1671
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:22,639
let me just [ __ ] here's 300 bucks get

1672
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,639
us like

1673
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:26,400
a few eighths of good [ __ ] like okay

1674
00:51:24,639 --> 00:51:28,960
that's always a good time

1675
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:30,639
uh i would walk out of stores back then

1676
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,240
um i would go into stores and i'd be

1677
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:35,759
like yeah i really don't want anything

1678
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:38,639
we did that a lot we did that a lot

1679
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,359
and nah i remember when rigs first

1680
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:45,679
started going down we did it again

1681
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:48,159
to see how each outfit was implementing

1682
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:49,199
new rules that had come down the pipe

1683
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:50,960
and it was always

1684
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:54,000
curious when you'd run into a shop that

1685
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:55,358
was like oh we decided [ __ ] the new memo

1686
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,800
we're not going to do any of that [ __ ]

1687
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,318
you'd see two weeks later they're gone

1688
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,839
and you're like wow

1689
00:51:58,318 --> 00:52:01,440
you don't wonder what happened to them

1690
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:02,639
man there are still a couple of shops

1691
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,519
there's one around here that you

1692
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:04,400
mentioned to me that

1693
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:05,599
i'm not going to say their name on the

1694
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,720
show sorry guys i know a lot of times

1695
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,240
you ask me to do that but i don't want

1696
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:09,279
to i don't need to call businesses out

1697
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:10,799
and start rivalries

1698
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,119
we're older than that now we're past

1699
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:14,960
that uh but there's one shop around here

1700
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,240
i go there occasionally to get green dot

1701
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,800
concentrates because when the other

1702
00:52:16,239 --> 00:52:18,879
spots

1703
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,318
out or i've bought all the flavors there

1704
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,519
or maybe i've gotten my [ __ ] limit

1705
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:22,239
for the day and i gotta hit another shop

1706
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:23,679
or whatever

1707
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,039
i'll go to this place and get some green

1708
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,358
dot it's affordable it's effective

1709
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:27,279
they're

1710
00:52:25,358 --> 00:52:28,799
they're nice but i look around and i'm

1711
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,040
like violation number one

1712
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,318
a violation number two that's like at

1713
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:33,519
least a ten thousand dollar [ __ ]

1714
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:35,119
ticket right there

1715
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:36,800
oh you just brought out instead of

1716
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,760
bringing up the jar they bring out the

1717
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,440
[ __ ] 10 pound

1718
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,960
bag of flour and just weigh it with

1719
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,679
their hand and scoop out your ounce like

1720
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,280
this

1721
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:44,719
into a baggie on the scale and i was

1722
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,119
like that's

1723
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,879
that i see just seven violations like

1724
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,318
just in that transaction

1725
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,920
and they're still there though like

1726
00:52:50,318 --> 00:52:53,920
they're [ __ ] they thrive there's

1727
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,920
always a line outside that [ __ ] place

1728
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:57,680
some of that [ __ ] blows my mind because

1729
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,358
i've been in i've been involved in both

1730
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:01,279
sides of the coin i've had metric

1731
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:04,239
come down on us and the med come down

1732
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,680
like this little thing that you did

1733
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:07,279
and i've also called them and been like

1734
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:08,159
yeah i've got a major [ __ ] problem

1735
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,240
and they're like hey thank you for

1736
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,239
calling we'll solve this not a big deal

1737
00:53:10,239 --> 00:53:13,759
so it's hard to guess what yeah i've

1738
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:14,000
been on both sides of that [ __ ] coin

1739
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,119
with

1740
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,760
metric yeah it's such a weird

1741
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,440
but i catch it too when i when i walk

1742
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,599
into their obvious stuff and just like

1743
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:27,119
how are you getting away with this

1744
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:29,359
or uh there's one of my favorites is

1745
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:30,640
there's a rule that you can't have a

1746
00:53:29,358 --> 00:53:33,759
window

1747
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:36,879
where product is visible from the street

1748
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,960
and there's i've been to multiple shops

1749
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,599
where there's a giant window in the bud

1750
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,920
room

1751
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,880
that looks out on the street and for

1752
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,159
some reason

1753
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:49,440
it hasn't occurred to any regulator or

1754
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:51,838
inspector there's one on the way

1755
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,720
on the way to the grow that we managed

1756
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:54,239
out there

1757
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,000
there's a shop on the left side of the

1758
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,919
road on your way out there that

1759
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,358
uh there's always a pretty girl standing

1760
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,639
in the [ __ ] window and it's the bud

1761
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:02,480
room she's just standing by the window

1762
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:04,078
to get fresh air but there's always

1763
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,440
one of the pretty girls [ __ ] standing

1764
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,800
there and i'm like that's the bud room

1765
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,559
i've been in that dispensary

1766
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,000
she's gonna weigh the weed right there

1767
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:11,119
when a customer comes in and you can see

1768
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,280
her in the window

1769
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,358
like it's [ __ ] plain as this place

1770
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,200
only higher it's pretty girl so like

1771
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:18,558
if it was up to me that wouldn't be a

1772
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:20,879
rule but

1773
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:22,240
it is one and i honestly have no idea

1774
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,519
how they haven't gotten slapped for that

1775
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,358
yet

1776
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,519
just especially that place because the

1777
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:29,358
led doesn't like them

1778
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:30,559
how many different places don't swap

1779
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:33,279
their um

1780
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,400
carbon filters though we were required

1781
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,359
to filter

1782
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:38,000
like everything that leaves the building

1783
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:40,798
but there are

1784
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,920
so many grows that haven't swapped their

1785
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,679
carbon filters

1786
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,000
since they built to grow originally four

1787
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:48,399
or five years ago 15 minutes west of

1788
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,280
here smells like a [ __ ] skunk

1789
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:52,559
like there's a couple of spots in town

1790
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,280
that are just like

1791
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:56,720
oh man those filters are old as [ __ ] if

1792
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,960
they're even hooked up anymore

1793
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,358
yeah oh they're not they're blind into

1794
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,358
the road

last year all right

1898
00:58:18,719 --> 00:58:23,358
we got a lot of people up we got lucky

1899
00:58:21,838 --> 00:58:26,318
in a facility because there was a hot

1900
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:29,440
water heater installed just kind of on a

1901
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:32,159
it was as close yeah you know who did it

1902
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:33,440
and i mean those guys were the redo crew

1903
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:35,039
instead of the build it crew they had to

1904
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,480
come back twice for everything

1905
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:37,838
but we got lucky because that inspector

1906
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,798
that didn't give a [ __ ] about his job

1907

and they take out these little tweezers

1956
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:07,598
and they pull the weights

1957
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,279
out of the weight case with tweezers and

1958
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,838
they [ __ ] dust your scale off and

1959
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,920
they blew

1960
01:00:09,838 --> 01:00:14,078
air into it with the air sprayer and

1961
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:16,720
they calibrated it like 14 times

1962
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,599
and certified our scale it had to have

1963
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:20,239
taken up four

1964
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:20,960
[ __ ] hours to certify our scales like

1965
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:22,798
yeah

1966
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:25,358
the more scales you have the longer that

1967
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,440
dude's there and

1968
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:28,480
i can't remember if it's once a year or

1969
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,679
twice a year

1970
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,440
or once every other year it was too

1971
01:00:31,679 --> 01:00:36,239
often though because he takes

1972
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,200
so [ __ ] long i was like are we paying

1973
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:40,639
this guy hourly

1974
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:42,639
because like he's [ __ ]

1975
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:45,118
the in the dispensaries they have to be

1976
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:47,358
certified really frequently

1977
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,440
and it would shut the bud room parts of

1978
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:52,078
the bud room down for

1979
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:52,960
all oh yeah [ __ ] day all day but he

1980
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,640
takes the weights

1981
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,480
scale the scale the scale out of a

1982
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:57,920
little container

1983
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,000
out of like uh it looks like when you

1984
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,519
got a bunch of drill bits

1985
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,280
uh but the weights are in those little

1986
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:04,960
drill bit holders so you guys

1987
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,000
could say yeah yeah socket set it's

1988
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,519
that's similar what i'm thinking but

1989
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,358
they're all wrapped in a little [ __ ]

1990
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:10,079
fabric package too because you can't get

1991
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:14,639
any moisture

1992
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:16,559
on them uh moisture and [ __ ] uh

1993
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,239
well if i sneeze at it that'll make it

1994
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:20,480
way different like this is point

1995
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:22,318
one and point one is so light so like in

1996
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,000
this point two and this point three

1997
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:25,759
he cleans them off as he gets them out

1998
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,119
he's got this little rag and he [ __ ]

1999
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,640
cleans them off and then he puts him on

2000
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,318
the scale and he cleans it again and

2001
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:32,798
puts it on the scale again

2002
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:33,519
and i'm like bro that scale is accurate

2003
01:01:32,798 --> 01:01:35,440
like

2004
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,239
i'd put my money on it like [ __ ] move

2005
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,079
the [ __ ] on dude like

2006
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:41,679
i don't know it was just making my blood

2007
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:44,400
boil watching him take [ __ ] four

2008
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:46,798
hours to calibrate six [ __ ] scales

2009
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,318
watching them do the the hanging scale

2010
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:51,679
that we weighed

2011
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:54,798
um harvested plants on like

2012
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:56,159
the scale unit itself looks like kind of

2013
01:01:54,798 --> 01:01:59,119
like a game boy

2014
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,838
with a metal hook hanging out of one end

2015
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,318
and then it's

2016
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,038
zip tied to a metal bar that's on a

2017
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:06,000
rolling

2018
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:07,119
like a cla if you had a closet bar on a

2019
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:11,679
roll rack

2020
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:15,119
or a doorway um

2021
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:18,558
so the rack itself is framed out maybe

2022
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,039
five feet tall six foot long the whole

2023
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,480
thing's

2024
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,520
coated in trichomes and parts of plant

2025
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:25,760
leaves and

2026
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:26,880
a little bit of dirt the wheels on it

2027
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,200
are all [ __ ] up

2028
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:32,079
and janky and coated with [ __ ] and ache

2029
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:35,199
with leaves this poor kids

2030
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,599
trying to get it to weigh whatever on

2031
01:02:35,199 --> 01:02:38,558
the

2032
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:40,880
oh man he was not amused i was not

2033
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:42,640
amused it was taking so long

2034
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,240
we were trying not to lose it on each

2035
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:47,118
other because

2036
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:48,159
and that scale sucks that's like a a

2037
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:50,160
fish scale

2038
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:53,199
that's kind of what that resembles like

2039
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:56,639
yeah but a digital fish scale

2040
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:58,159
yeah yeah so good to deal with a lot of

2041

is has gotten them hooked i've got a a

2344
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,480
couple of family members that have found

2345
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:45,439
some facebook group where it's a page

2346
01:11:44,479 --> 01:11:47,759
where

2347
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:48,479
these two women are running like a

2348
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:50,800
little

2349
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,319
they find something they do a package

2350
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:55,600
for like 100 bucks

2351
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:57,920
and then they sell 15 10 tickets so

2352
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,360
it's like 50 going into the bank and

2353
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:02,880
then somebody for

2354
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:04,799
a 15 ticket or whatever a 10 ticket

2355
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,400
gets a hundred dollars with the stuff

2356
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:09,600
and so everybody goes home

2357
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:12,960
happy well everybody-ish yeah um

2358
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,719
and they're so hooked on that um

2359
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,198
i've got another family member that is

2360
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,640

like mad

2362
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,880
but with the time this ends their house

2363
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,520
is gonna be worth substantially more

2364
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,920
than it was when they the plague started

2365
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:27,199
i know

2366
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,600

2399
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:31,120
machine they're using

2400
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:32,559
it just it tastes different than what

2401
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,119
you make in the microwave

2402
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:38,080

2404
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:41,359
i don't know if they put a little heroin

2405
01:13:39,439 --> 01:13:41,839
in it or some [ __ ] but it's so much

2406
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,158
better

2407
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,640
sprinkle a little crack on it yep pour a

2408
01:13:44,158 --> 01:13:48,639
little crack on it just a little crack

2409
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:50,400
uh there's a thai food restaurant in

2410
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:51,760
colorado springs that

2411
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:53,359
there's nothing like it so i know what

2412
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:54,560
you mean like i've eaten at a million

2413
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:56,158
thai food places and i'm like can we

2414
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:57,360
just go there why are we wasting our

2415
01:13:56,158 --> 01:14:00,399
time there's the one

2416
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:01,759
like i found it in college i would not

2417
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,198
routinely because i couldn't afford it

2418
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:05,920
routinely but when i wanted

2419
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:07,198
chinese food i would save up so that i

2420
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,480
could go get my 100

2421
01:14:07,198 --> 01:14:10,319
order from the place that was an hour

2422
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,879
and a half away because

2423
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:15,759
it was a three hour round trip you'd go

2424
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:19,520
get enough to last you all goddamn week

2425
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:20,800
it was just uncomparable any other place

2426
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:22,640
is a cheap knockoff

2427
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:24,560
i'm gonna make some people time travel

2428
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:29,520
right now back in the day

2429
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:32,640
uh 99 2000 2001 maybe 2002 2003

2430
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:35,199
that era uh the jam band scene was

2431
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:37,199
cranking it up like the string cheese

2432
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:38,960
incident and all that level of bands

2433
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:41,039
there's a theater in boulder called the

2434
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:42,960
fox theater

2435
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:44,800
my buddy robbie and i would drive to the

2436
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,760
fox theater and park in the same little

2437

2598
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:55,199
get it set back up again hopefully it

2599
01:19:53,359 --> 01:19:57,279
still works so it was your intention

2600
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:58,879
just to put the bubble hash

2601
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:00,319
kind of break it off the chunk break it

2602
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,840
up into kind of smaller pieces so it's

2603
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:03,759
got more surface area and then just put

2604
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:05,039
it directly into the wand part of the

2605
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,800
vape

2606
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:11,359
yeah the the vape loads up a lot like uh

2607
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,039
a pipe would it's got a little screen in

2608
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:16,399
it you throw some

2609
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:20,079
i usually break off like two

2610
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:22,719
green peas worth a hash and throw

2611
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:23,600
those size chunks in there do a couple

2612
01:20:22,719 --> 01:20:25,760
of draws

2613
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,920
with it hooked up to the heating element

2614
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,639
so that the hash softens

2615
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,000
and then get in there with a dab tool or

2616
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:34,319
a paper clip

2617
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:35,840
and give it a stir and really open up

2618
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:38,639
that surface area

2619
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,560
in your next three or four poles it's

2620
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:43,199
like it hit the face of the shovel

2621
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:44,800
perfect it's wonderful yeah we're gonna

2622
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:46,638
have to get you some solvent list to try

2623
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,119
like that as well

2624
01:20:46,639 --> 01:20:49,760
yeah i uh and the bubble actually is

2625
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:52,238
solvent

2626
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:53,360
but i mean some like some sho some

2627
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:56,399
solventless honey oil

2628
01:20:53,359 --> 01:20:59,119
it looks like batter it's hard with

2629
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,238
covid in the [ __ ] plague going on but

2630
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:03,039
i'd like to hit

2631
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:05,039
a handful of shops and really do just

2632
01:21:03,039 --> 01:21:06,960
kind of a tour of southern colorado and

2633
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:08,800
see what people have for concentrate

2634
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:11,439
that's not

2635
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,119
bho or solvent extracts something that

2636
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:15,439
would actually work in that that

2637
01:21:13,119 --> 01:21:16,880
tabletop vape

2638
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:19,039
for a while there were a bunch of

2639
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:23,279
different companies doing

2640
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:24,479
bubble or key for dry sift

2641
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:26,399
and they had a number of different

2642
01:21:24,479 --> 01:21:27,359
products on the market but for the last

2643
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:29,839
couple years

2644
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:31,920
i mean i haven't been looking but it

2645
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:33,279
seems to me like most of the shops have

2646
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,840
moved to

2647
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:36,399
um solvent extract yeah diamonds and

2648
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:38,000
sauce

2649
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:40,399
there's a lot of uh solventless out

2650
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,198
there uh solvent lists were like raws in

2651
01:21:40,399 --> 01:21:43,198
and

2652
01:21:41,198 --> 01:21:44,479
solventless honey oil pressed stuff

2653
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:46,238
that's out there that's in big demand

2654
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:48,079
but it's expensive right now

2655
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:49,599
that's like its own special niche i talk

2656
01:21:48,079 --> 01:21:52,158
about uh

2657
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:53,520

2658
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:54,799
seed hoarders and collectors are a

2659
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,639
special group of nerds but then

2660
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,239
autoflowers and then like land race

2661
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:59,840

accessories but i did come home with

2793
01:26:00,079 --> 01:26:04,960
almost 200

2794
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:06,000
in t-shirts one of them better have hank

2795
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,158
hill on it

2796
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,158
no no hank hill it's just the store

2797
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:11,679
that's got the propane refill also has

2798
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:13,119
the best shirts so

2799
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,760
you make it sound like we live next to

2800
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:16,719
like like the [ __ ] hicks gas station

2801
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:20,840
in town now

2802
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:22,319
we do we do get propane insurance at

2803
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:25,119
walmart uh

2804
01:26:22,319 --> 01:26:26,399
big r that was my next guest bro that

2805
01:26:25,119 --> 01:26:29,119
was my next guess

2806
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,399
carhart shirts and propane yo our lives

2807
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:33,519
are different buddy

2808
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:37,279
they are our lives are different it's

2809
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:39,520
all right

2810
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:41,039
this is an off the rails [ __ ] show

2811
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:41,679
but i've been trying to keep it that way

2812
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:44,079
too i've seen

2813
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:45,600
opportunities 200 episodes i've seen

2814
01:26:44,079 --> 01:26:47,359
good opportunities to talk about

2815
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:48,560
cannabis and i just flat out refused i

2816
01:26:47,359 --> 01:26:51,679
was like nope we're gonna go

2817
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,120
route b for this it's just been fun

2818
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:55,279
it's been a long show we've been going

2819
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:57,119
for probably an hour and 25 minutes bro

2820
01:26:55,279 --> 01:27:00,800
so if you do get tired you need to break

2821
01:26:57,119 --> 01:27:03,439
probably mention that the last two times

2822
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:05,840
i bought flower in town it was trimmed

2823
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:07,919
so people are listening

2824
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,279
they took that advice thank you for

2825
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,440
trimming your [ __ ]

2826
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:12,719
yeah thank you guys we do prefer trimmed

2827
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:15,439
weed

2828
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:16,800
yup now next step now that we're

2829
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:20,638
trimming it

2830
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:20,639
get rid of the goddamn boveda packs

2831
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:26,239
i'm torn on the boveda packs in the

2832
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,239
dispensary because that damn jar is open

2833
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:30,718
and closed so many times

2834
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:32,158
that i don't know i kind of i've got do

2835
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:33,920
you want the crunch or do you want the

2836
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:35,279
boveda pack that's like your options

2837
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,199
right now and it's i know it's like

2838
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:38,479
[ __ ] [ __ ] sandwich or a [ __ ] punch

2839
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:41,759
to the balls

2840
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:46,238
but you take your pick it

2841
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:48,800
uh it is a toss-up and it is difficult

2842
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:51,039
and i don't envy the people that have to

2843
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:54,880
fight with the humidity levels in the

2844
01:27:51,039 --> 01:27:58,639
in the jars of the product but um

2845
01:27:54,880 --> 01:28:00,480
the system where they open the jar in

2846
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:03,279
the morning and select

2847
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,479
a display nug and that's the one they're

2848
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:05,759
showing to people and there's a [ __ ]

2849
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:07,279
playground so it's not like people are

2850
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,400
smelling [ __ ] now

2851
01:28:07,279 --> 01:28:11,759
right um the the shops i've been going

2852
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:15,679
to lately

2853
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:18,400
they've just moved a glass display case

2854
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:20,158
and they get the the jar close to you

2855
01:28:18,399 --> 01:28:20,479
yeah so that you can see it good but you

2856
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:22,000
can't

2857
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:24,399
smell it because now you're looking at

2858
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:26,158
it through a layer of glass and it's

2859
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,519
still in a jar

2860
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:29,119
you don't know what it smells like to

2861
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:31,360
you get it home and you open it up and

2862
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:34,479
take a whiff but uh

2863
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:37,279
um that little display jar that people

2864
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:40,319
could smell and look at

2865
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:41,920
before the plague hit was uh was my

2866
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:43,679
favorite method and then at the end of

2867
01:28:41,920 --> 01:28:44,319
the day you take that one nug that has

2868
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:45,920
gotten

2869
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:48,079
dried out from getting sniffed by 80

2870
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:52,079
people you throw that back in the

2871
01:28:48,079 --> 01:28:53,760
the larger jar to rehydrate and even up

2872
01:28:52,079 --> 01:28:56,559
and it keeps the whole jar from getting

2873
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:59,199
aired out 15-20 times a day

2874
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:02,639
the other solution is pre-packaged dates

2875
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:04,559
and people [ __ ] hate pre-packs

2876
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:05,679
they think for some reason they're going

2877
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,159
to rip me off

2878
01:29:05,679 --> 01:29:09,279
like bro it's a dispensary we're not the

2879
01:29:08,158 --> 01:29:11,039
[ __ ]

2880
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:12,880
we're not some shady dealer we're right

2881
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:14,880
here we're right here on this address

2882
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:16,400
every day the signs out front

2883
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:17,840
like if you think it doesn't away come

2884
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:18,559
back we'll check it out it'll be all

2885
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:22,000
right

2886
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:25,520
like the last two pre-packs i bought

2887
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:28,319
weren't bad the two before that

2888
01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:28,960
were crap um but i knew what i was

2889
01:29:28,319 --> 01:29:32,079
getting

2890
01:29:28,960 --> 01:29:33,760
it's you can always tell

2891
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:35,198
when it's half the price it's supposed

2892
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:38,239
to be there's oh yeah

2893
01:29:35,198 --> 01:29:39,519
yep um and if it's in a store that

2894
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:41,759
reason's probably not because it's

2895
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:45,280
stolen it's probably because it's shitty

2896
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:46,159
so if it's in an alley it could go

2897
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:47,599
either way

2898
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:49,439
one of my favorite shops in denver it

2899
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:51,440
doesn't exist anymore but they've one of

2900
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:53,119
some of the regulations they gave up but

2901
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:54,799
they were one of the first that i

2902
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:55,279
appreciated their pre-pack because they

2903
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:58,480
were

2904
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:00,399
slamming busy and i don't need i don't

2905
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:01,919
need the reason we used to weigh our

2906
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:03,839
weed in front of each other

2907
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,239
is because i don't trust you you want to

2908
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,840
see that it says 3.5 on the scale

2909
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:09,039
you want to know that and i'm going to

2910
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:11,039
count your money you're going to watch

2911
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:13,198
the scale that's how business works

2912
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:14,800
it's a dispensary i don't they do weigh

2913
01:30:13,198 --> 01:30:16,000
your meat if you go to the butcher but

2914
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:17,199
you don't get your cereal weight in

2915
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,639
front of you you don't get

2916
01:30:17,198 --> 01:30:20,559
everything weighed out in front it comes

2917
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:22,000
in cans and boxes and you trust that it

2918
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:24,000
says eight ounces

2919
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
[ __ ] on the package i think cannabis

2920
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,600
is we're there with the cannabis so

2921
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,880
uh it's so much quicker there'd be a

2922
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:30,239
line out the door at this place because

2923
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,679
they were the slamminess dispensary and

2924
01:30:30,238 --> 01:30:32,319
it was a little tiny [ __ ] shack of a

2925
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:34,000
shop

2926
01:30:32,319 --> 01:30:35,439
and they'd just spend all night

2927
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,560
pre-weighing [ __ ] so that tomorrow the

2928
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:37,839
shop can flow

2929
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:39,600
instead of [ __ ] two blood tender

2930
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:42,079
center going 3.5 again

2931
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,840
3.5 again what do you want an 8 of this

2932
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:45,600
in eighth of this okay 3.5

2933
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:47,119
seal it up put a sticker on it put the

2934
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:48,960
jar away get the other jar out

2935
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:50,319
nah they sat there all night or there's

2936
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,158
somebody in the back right now

2937
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:53,599
just weighing out this whole pound will

2938
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:54,960
be eights and if you want eights

2939
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:56,239
we got them if you want a quarter you

2940
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:57,279
get two eights if you want an ounce you

2941
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:58,879
get eight eights

2942
01:30:57,279 --> 01:31:00,399
like they just bet they're busting them

2943
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:01,119
out it's way better i think it's way

2944
01:31:00,399 --> 01:31:04,079
more efficient

2945
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:04,960
and the product stays fresh vastly more

2946
01:31:04,079 --> 01:31:07,198
efficient

2947
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:07,198
but

2948
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:11,519
they didn't weigh all my concentrates in

2949
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:12,239
front of me and i trust them [ __ ] out of

2950
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:17,199
me

2951
01:31:12,238 --> 01:31:22,000
i uh it's not that it's knocking away

2952
01:31:17,198 --> 01:31:26,158
when it's um the last two i bought

2953
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:27,679
they were in a clear packaging it looked

2954
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:30,000
i mean it was a different shape but it

2955
01:31:27,679 --> 01:31:32,639
was essentially the packaging you get

2956
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,719
a cheap toothbrush in like there was a

2957
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:36,400
backing to it and then it had a clear

2958
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:39,760
plastic bubble

2959
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:41,679
that was full of herb and it was

2960
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:44,320
colorado packaging compliance so it was

2961
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:46,719
a [ __ ] to open in yada yada but

2962
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:47,920
you could see into the pack and tell

2963
01:31:46,719 --> 01:31:50,800
that

2964
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:52,319
it was quality looking herb that was

2965
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:55,920
well trimmed and

2966
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:57,679
not all stems and the the two

2967
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,440
that i pre-packs that i bought before

2968
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:01,600
that that were bad

2969
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:04,479
both of them were like little pebble

2970
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:08,159
nugs little gravel sized nugs

2971
01:32:04,479 --> 01:32:12,319
and had [ __ ] fan leaf in it

2972
01:32:08,158 --> 01:32:15,599
not sugar leaf not wasn't trimmed well

2973
01:32:12,319 --> 01:32:19,679
actual chunks of fan leaf

2974
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:22,239
and in the pre-packaged tins

2975
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:23,520
chunks of fan leaf and then huge sticks

2976
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:25,439
for no reason

2977
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:28,880
like there's a little popcorn nug on the

2978
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:32,479
end and then a long stick for no reason

2979
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:34,560
it's like why is this in my container

2980
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:35,519
yeah a packager did this on purpose they

2981
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,639
should be fired

2982
01:32:35,520 --> 01:32:41,040
yeah yeah just not accepting that

2983
01:32:38,639 --> 01:32:42,480
the first time you end up with that it's

2984
01:32:41,039 --> 01:32:45,760
so hard to buy a pre-pack

2985
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,718
after that um my experience with

2986
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:49,199
pre-rolls

2987
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:51,920
three four years ago or why i haven't

2988
01:32:49,198 --> 01:32:55,039
had a pre-roll in three or four years

2989
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,960
it's just i can't trust it i don't like

2990
01:32:55,039 --> 01:32:57,760
when people go to the dispensary and buy

2991
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,840
the cheapest

2992
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,760
product in the store and then leave a

2993
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,039
bad review based on the cheapest product

2994
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:05,119
they could have [ __ ] bought

2995
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:06,399
that drives me crazy i bought a pre-roll

2996
01:33:05,119 --> 01:33:08,238
and it tastes terrible it was one of the

2997
01:33:06,399 --> 01:33:10,960
two dollar pre-rolls well

2998
01:33:08,238 --> 01:33:12,718
bro what did you expect yeah they didn't

2999
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,158
put the gold on the [ __ ] bottom shelf

3000
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:16,079
for two bucks you got to buy at least a

3001
01:33:14,158 --> 01:33:17,039
middle shelf product to leave a quality

3002
01:33:16,079 --> 01:33:20,000
review

3003
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:21,679
the only time i really really supported

3004
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:24,639
that complaint

3005
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:27,760
was when a shop was doing if you're a

3006
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:29,199
veteran you get a pre-roll for

3007
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,880
i can't remember if it was a penny a

3008
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:34,000
dime or a quarter or a dollar

3009
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:36,079
i think it was a quarter um

3010
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:37,840
it was stupid cheap for a pre-roll it

3011
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:39,439
was seven or eight or nine dollars

3012
01:33:37,840 --> 01:33:41,119
cheaper than anywhere else

3013
01:33:39,439 --> 01:33:43,759
but you had to be a vet to go get the

3014
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:45,359
deal and i had more than one

3015
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,679
vet telling me that they heard about the

3016
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:49,599
deal were excited about it

3017
01:33:47,679 --> 01:33:50,800
went in and tried it and ended up

3018
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,560
getting

3019
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:57,199
like trim material rolled into

3020
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:59,360
a cone and were they were really pissed

3021
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:03,279
that they were getting sold leaf

3022
01:33:59,359 --> 01:34:06,319
um and told it was a standard quality

3023
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:08,000
from that place um i thought

3024
01:34:06,319 --> 01:34:09,439
i thought at that point they really had

3025
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,039
a decent complaint but it's just a

3026
01:34:09,439 --> 01:34:13,119
regular person

3027
01:34:11,039 --> 01:34:14,960
like if you ask me for the cheapest [ __ ]

3028
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:17,198
on the the shelf don't be surprised

3029
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,480
it's not also the best quality cheapest

3030
01:34:17,198 --> 01:34:20,399
[ __ ] on the shelf

3031
01:34:18,479 --> 01:34:21,759
uh you just reminded me of a random oh

3032
01:34:20,399 --> 01:34:23,759
go ahead i'm gonna write down my topic

3033
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:27,039
but you keep going and i'll take a dab

3034
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:29,600
i saw a shop uh this spring

3035
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:31,279
that uh they had their normal jars on

3036
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,760
the shelf and a couple of

3037
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:35,599
manager special sales or whatever but

3038
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:36,960
one of the shelves it was a jar that was

3039
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:38,960
mark special

3040
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,719
with a sign that said last year's

3041
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:43,760
outdoor seated

3042
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:45,359
and then it was 50 an ounce instead i

3043
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,880
think their next cheapest out the door

3044
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:51,439
ounce was 89.99 or 99 bucks or whatever

3045
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:52,400
um so it was substantially cheaper per

3046
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:55,039
gram or whatever

3047
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,559
per ounce but you knew what you were

3048
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:58,719
getting going in it wasn't like you'd

3049
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,800
get it home and discover

3050
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,399
that it was that's why it's cheaper yeah

3051
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,560
that's legit if you tell me

3052
01:35:02,399 --> 01:35:06,399
i saw that and i was like why is that

3053
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:07,600
hard why can't other people just be up

3054
01:35:06,399 --> 01:35:10,238
front like that

3055
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:12,480
it's so easy to just throw that up on

3056
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:15,678
the side and let people know

3057
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:18,799
for those of you not watching on youtube

3058
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:23,118
jeff's taking a nice size dab here

3059
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:26,480
really pretty butter nice big dab

3060
01:35:23,118 --> 01:35:27,679
nice big vapor cloud he's going to be

3061
01:35:26,479 --> 01:35:30,959
quiet for a minute while

3062
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:34,079
that goes to his brain so i'll just keep

3063
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:35,600
rambling if you need a rescue i totally

3064
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:37,760
have a good ramble

3065
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,679
do you just give me two good topics uh

3066
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:41,520
we had a jar show up at a dispensary we

3067
01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:43,520
didn't know what it's called

3068
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:45,920
random weed in a baggie somebody forgot

3069
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:48,960
to label it you know stoned owners

3070
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,239
i labeled it stinky peter

3071
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,760
and that sounds like somebody's name

3072
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:52,399
right now sounds like a guy named stinky

3073
01:35:51,760 --> 01:35:53,920
peter

3074
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:56,238
until the first customer everyone's like

3075
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:57,279
why'd you call it stinky peter the first

3076
01:35:56,238 --> 01:36:00,479
customer came in and

3077
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:01,439
said can i smell your steam they stopped

3078
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:03,118
themselves

3079
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:04,719

throughout the day and it was well worth

3086
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:17,839
putting that [ __ ] label on the jar

cone shortage raw cannot provide

3101
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:46,560
cones because the company the factory

3102
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:51,519
that makes them is shut down

3103
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:54,080
due to corona so the pre-rolls and cones

3104
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:56,159
are out for them at their grow at their

3105
01:36:54,079 --> 01:36:59,039
facility they don't have any more that's

3106
01:36:56,158 --> 01:36:59,839
[ __ ] they can't order anymore and

3107
01:36:59,039 --> 01:37:02,158
pretty soon

3108
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:02,880
that will ripple out to other states and

3109
01:37:02,158 --> 01:37:04,079
areas

3110
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:06,239
my lighting just went weird in the

3111
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:08,399
camera that was strange but

3112
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:11,519
yeah pre-rolls are [ __ ] they can't

3113
01:37:08,399 --> 01:37:11,519
get any cones dude

3114
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:18,159
the the ripples from covid

3115
01:37:15,118 --> 01:37:19,679
are going to keep bouncing coast to

3116
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:22,079
coast for

3117
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:24,000
honestly i put my money on christmas

3118
01:37:22,079 --> 01:37:27,279
next year

3119
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:29,760
is the earliest

3120
01:37:27,279 --> 01:37:31,439
we're gonna really head back to normal

3121
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:33,199
to what it was like in the middle of

3122
01:37:31,439 --> 01:37:37,359
2019

3123
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:40,079
um but every day it seems like i hear

3124
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:42,639
about a new one where somebody's like

3125
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:43,359
can't get watermelons it's like why not

3126
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,960
it's like

3127
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:47,118
because the trucks that ship them don't

3128
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:50,239
have tires because the tire factory

3129
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:51,759
yep like there's so many of those yeah i

3130
01:37:50,238 --> 01:37:54,399
was wondering when it was gonna really

3131
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:59,679
start [ __ ] with the cannabis industry

3132
01:37:54,399 --> 01:38:01,359
um immediately i kind of smiled because

3133
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:03,118
like i really doubt they're doing their

3134
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:06,880
gorilla inspections

3135
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:09,118
now where they go hit 55 shops in a day

3136
01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:11,118
oh yeah that's not expectations that's

3137
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:13,519
not happening right now yeah

3138
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:14,799
there are growth in any industry there

3139
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:16,800
are shortages of

3140
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,000
soil you can't get soil deliveries right

3141
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,239
now uh

3142
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,319
soil is short nutrients are short a lot

3143
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:26,238
of [ __ ] is sure all the plastic stuff is

3144
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:28,639
in demand the

3145
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:32,319
i mean on the commercial scale how many

3146
01:38:28,639 --> 01:38:32,319
different trucks show up every week

3147
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:37,520
it's daunting um there's a truck guy

3148
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:40,079
there's a nutrients guy there's a pots

3149
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:42,639
guy there's a piping guy

3150
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:43,279
there's some places have a water guy

3151
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:45,440
yeah

3152
01:38:43,279 --> 01:38:47,840
there's a co2 guy co2 guy that falls

3153
01:38:45,439 --> 01:38:51,279
asleep um

3154
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:53,679
so many different deliveries if any part

3155
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:56,639
of that chain hitches

3156
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:58,719
like your co2 guy can't come for a

3157
01:38:56,639 --> 01:39:00,800
couple weeks that's gonna [ __ ] up your

3158
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:02,000
harvest oh yeah your harvest is your

3159
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:03,360
harvest is 30

3160
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:05,118
smaller than it was last time that's

3161
01:39:03,359 --> 01:39:05,599
going to [ __ ] with your store supply you

3162
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:07,439
can't get

3163
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,639
soil delivered or cocoa delivered

3164
01:39:07,439 --> 01:39:10,079
[ __ ] cones

3165
01:39:08,639 --> 01:39:11,920
dude the cones are really gonna [ __ ]

3166
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:12,880
with people there's whole dispensary

3167
01:39:11,920 --> 01:39:15,440
outfits

3168
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:16,319
whose sole business is based on cones

3169
01:39:15,439 --> 01:39:18,319
existing

3170
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:20,319
i know a couple of people who their jobs

3171
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:22,559
are to roll cones all day

3172
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:24,960
that's what they do i just read an

3173
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,960
article

3174
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:28,639
some dispensaries somewhere not in

3175
01:39:26,800 --> 01:39:30,560
colorado it was in another state it just

3176
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:34,159
had to

3177
01:39:30,560 --> 01:39:35,679
um destroy thousands of free

3178
01:39:34,158 --> 01:39:37,519
i think that's totally fake the chick

3179
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:41,118
was licking

3180
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:43,600
guarantee guarantee you there's another

3181
01:39:41,118 --> 01:39:47,198
one where they have to toss

3182
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:48,800
it was 2.6 million dollars at cartridges

3183
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:50,719
and that the company's destroying it

3184
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,800
because they won't move

3185
01:39:50,719 --> 01:39:55,439
and they're trash now because the the

3186
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:59,600
market base has no confidence

3187
01:39:55,439 --> 01:40:01,759
that the state can test for

3188
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:03,119
i think in that state the big fear is

3189
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:06,320
lead

3190
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:06,960
um but coming off all of the vaping

3191
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:10,238
freer

3192
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:11,920
from last year it was clearly a cutting

3193
01:40:10,238 --> 01:40:14,319
edge in the cartridges

3194
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:16,399
so yeah what happened to that some

3195
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:19,920
cartridges just

3196
01:40:16,399 --> 01:40:22,638
the now we got murder hornets tiger king

3197
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:22,639
murder hornets

3198
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:27,520
vape carts killing people i think what

3199
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:29,118
happened predominantly

3200
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:32,159
now the little kids are in wayfarer

3201
01:40:29,118 --> 01:40:35,759
cabinets that's what happened um

3202
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:35,759
i think the black market

3203
01:40:35,840 --> 01:40:42,400
business just they got hit hard

3204
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:45,520
and the anyone still surviving in that

3205
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:47,759
marketplace has drastically re-uh

3206
01:40:45,520 --> 01:40:51,440
restructured their business model

3207
01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:54,880
they might have had to allegedly

3208
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:56,879
i knew a guy whose twin brother's cousin

3209
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:58,000
would buy a packaging that looks just

3210
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,760
like that

3211
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,960
you can order that packaging on a

3212
01:40:59,760 --> 01:41:03,840
website i won't say the name of the

3213
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:04,960
website you can buy that exact packaging

3214
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,079
and you can buy

3215
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:10,480
those carts and they're empty

3216
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:12,158
and allegedly i knew a guy that in

3217
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:13,519
another state his hustle was to buy

3218
01:41:12,158 --> 01:41:15,198
carts that looked like that and fill

3219
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:17,920
them up with his homemade oil

3220
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:19,599
and sell them as that brand's carts for

3221
01:41:17,920 --> 01:41:20,239
a [ __ ] premium price in an illegal

3222
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:21,760
state

3223
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:24,319
and then all this scarab [ __ ] carts

3224
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:28,639
came out and his business went

3225
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:31,840
to zero yep there's uh

3226
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:34,239
it doesn't surprise me at all um

3227
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:36,159
unless you can be sure that you're

3228
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:39,439
buying a regulated safe

3229
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:42,319
inspected tested yep um

3230
01:41:39,439 --> 01:41:43,198
if it [ __ ] me up there's a a method for

3231
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:45,359
me to be like

3232
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:46,799
why did you do that jeff like you can

3233
01:41:45,359 --> 01:41:48,799
track it back to whoever

3234
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:52,239
yeah we can see which plant it came from

3235
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:52,239
we could see which facility it was made

3236
01:41:53,039 --> 01:41:56,158
i'd be shocked if that's still a thing

3237
01:41:54,719 --> 01:41:58,880
and that's clearly where all the nasty

3238
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:00,638
carts were coming from

3239
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:01,760
yeah i've got some numbers on the back

3240
01:42:00,639 --> 01:42:02,719
here i don't know which one is which but

3241
01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:05,199
i could see the

3242
01:42:02,719 --> 01:42:06,800
uh the growth facility the processing

3243
01:42:05,198 --> 01:42:07,839
facility and a couple other numbers on

3244
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:09,600
here so if something went wrong with

3245
01:42:07,840 --> 01:42:12,159
this i would know who to contact

3246
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,800
would be pretty easy the distributor

3247
01:42:12,158 --> 01:42:14,960
number

3248
01:42:12,800 --> 01:42:15,840
the processing lab number and the grow

3249
01:42:14,960 --> 01:42:18,319
number and

3250
01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:19,360
and batch number yep it's all right

3251
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:20,880
there on the back

3252
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:22,479
yeah so you'd call the dispensary or go

3253
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:25,118
there and say hey this is moldy

3254
01:42:22,479 --> 01:42:26,959
and then [ __ ] call the producer or

3255
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:28,079
just roll down the chain

3256
01:42:26,960 --> 01:42:32,239
they'd probably just give you a free one

3257
01:42:28,079 --> 01:42:33,840
but you know it feels worse than that

3258
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:36,319
one for a penny because you can't do

3259
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,079
free in colorado that's true

3260
01:42:36,319 --> 01:42:39,439
uh mike i'm stoned and [ __ ] running

3261
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:40,559
out of energy buddy i'm getting tired
