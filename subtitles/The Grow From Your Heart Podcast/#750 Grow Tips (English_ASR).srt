about before we jump into the grow

116
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,519
questions i want some feedback do you

117
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,399
like the podcast episodes with just me

118
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,120
or do you prefer a guest at the table do

119
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,358
you guys like zoom podcasts would you

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,360
prefer me do the show solo or do you

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,359
like somebody on zoom zoom shows kind of

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,520
bug me uh recently i was on another

123
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,199
podcast and you can see me hesitating to

124
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,279
reply and you can see us kind of talking

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:34,000
over each other because zoom has just a

126
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,519
a micro second of a a millisecond of a

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,519
delay so i'll be like hey how was your

128
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,519
day and then it'll be just a quick delay

129
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,959
before the other person replies and then

130
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,319
by the time they've replied i'm already

131
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,000
going are you cool bro can you hear me

132
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,918
and they go i can hear we can and

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,079
there's this weird just [ __ ] stumble

134
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,000
over each other zoom drives me crazy but

135
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,599
it's better than nothing so if you guys

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,959
are into seeing people on zoom let me

137
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,400
know if you'd prefer me to have people

138
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,439
here let me know

139
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,758

140
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,918

141
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,439

142
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,879
necessary let me know what you think

143
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,918
about the show you guys that is all i'm

144
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,680
asking for

145
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:07,359
now let's talk about the main topics of

146
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,199
today's podcast i do want to talk about

147
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,199
a couple of grow questions first i'm

148
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,520
going to mention something that i saw in

149
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,919
a grow recently i was at a friends grow

150
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,680
just a regular home grow and my friend

151
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,240
was watering their plants with the

152
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,918
runoff from their dehumidifier and i did

153
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,439
express my concern because i'm not sure

154
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,038
that that's a really

155
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:27,279
good idea

156
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,199
the inside of that dehumidifier is gross

157
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,038
all the all the gunk and grime that's in

158
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,038
your environment is gathering up on all

159
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,639
the parts inside of that dehumidifier i

160
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:35,918
don't know exactly what's in there i

161
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,439
know that there are coils i know there

162
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,279
are a lot of things happening i know

163
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:42,240
that there's water collection i know the

164
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,319
water runs down a tube that dehumidifier

165
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,240
anytime i've taken apart a humidifier or

166
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,360
dehumidifier it's been disgusting on the

167
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,519
inside

168
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,840
i could only imagine that disgusting

169
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:53,599
[ __ ] is landing right in your water so

170
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,799
unless you're able to test that water

171
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,960
and you're making sure that it's clean

172
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,800
there's nothing funky in that water i

173
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,478
really wouldn't recommend watering your

174
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,639
plants with the runoff from your

175
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:04,639
dehumidifier people are going to say

176
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,759
also your air conditioner condensation i

177
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,439
feel the same way about that it's

178
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,560
basically the same function

179
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:11,038
people are going to say that's clean

180
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
distilled water but i do not trust the

181
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,478
equipment it's got to run off of

182
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,319
something so whatever it ran off of

183
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:18,800
dribbled off of could be dirty could be

184
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,240
funky could have metals in it could have

185
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,079
funk in it is the bottom line that i'm

186
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,800
worried about so i don't want that i

187
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,680
would not i would not recommend using

188
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,439
the water from your dehumidifier to

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,199
water your plants maybe do use that to

190
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,719
like uh if you got a power washer or a

191
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,400
power spare maybe use that to clean the

192
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
tables or something use that for

193
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,638
cleaning use it for gray water but do

194
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,720
not use that for feeding the plants that

195
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,800
is just my recommendation if you've got

196
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,880
a uh a qualified argument that you'd

197
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,720
like to say why it is okay go ahead send

198
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:48,719
me the feedback i am open to feedback

199
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,440
we've had this conversation before my

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,199
opinion still stands i do not recommend

201
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,038
feeding the plants your dehumidifier

202
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,759
water another thing that i saw my friend

203
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,439
doing was he was not shaking the bottle

204
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,560
nutrients enough

205
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,719
if you guys are feeding bottled

206
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,319
nutrients to your plants when you pick

207
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,599
up that bottle before you even unscrew

208
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,759
the lid before you even think about

209
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,079
doing anything with it i usually place

210
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,439
my forefinger over the top of the cap to

211
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,120
make sure the cap is sealed on there

212
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,800
pick it up give it a twist make sure the

213
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,199
cap is sealed then i shake the [ __ ] out

214
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
of that bottle those products have a lot

215
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,280
of heavy stuff in there you got to shake

216
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
them if not the for the first few weeks

217
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:23,679
is your feeding you're just going to

218
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,960
feed it water and as you get down you're

219
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,918
going to feed it all of the main stuff

220
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:27,439
and as you get to the bottom you're

221
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,758
going to have a bunch of chunks left

222
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,360
shake your nutrient bottles vigorously

223
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,199
before you feed them to your plants

224
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,520
before you mix up your nutrients also

225
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,840
check the expiration dates those things

226
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,279
don't last forever they will expire they

227
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,279
will start bonding weird things will

228
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,038
happen inside the bottle once you mix

229
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:44,959
that weird product with other products

230
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:47,199
even more weird [ __ ] will happen so

231
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,239
check the expiration date one piece of

232
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,400
advice

233
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,319
i do recommend you mix your potassium

234
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,159
silicate first if you're putting

235
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,120
silicates in the water put that in the

236
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,520
water first then give it a stir then mix

237
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,598
in your other stuff uh it doesn't matter

238
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,758
to me very specifically which other

239
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,279
products you put in which order i would

240
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
go the silicates then your base

241
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,439
nutrients then kind of follow up with

242
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,598
whatever needs to be done uh the calmag

243
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,639
the potassium uh just whichever bottles

244
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,560
you're buying i don't know the order

245
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,879
then adjust the ph then add your

246
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,478
microbes what i was going to say is stir

247
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,199
in all of your products everything

248
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,918
except your microbes then adjust the ph

249
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,759
i recently saw somebody adjust the ph of

250
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,198
their water using the little ph adjuster

251
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,000
and some drops right so they got the

252
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,919
water to 6.4 then they added their

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,599
nutrients to it then they added their

254
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,838
microbes to it then they fed it to the

255
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,680
plants that is not the correct order

256
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,000
let's think about that why that's not

257
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,838
the correct order we want the nutrient

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,240
solution which we are feeding our plants

259
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,240
to be somewhere between six two and six

260
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,159
five six six probably about six two six

261
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,200
four is where i hover do your thing in

262
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,120
your grow if you're saying different

263
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
numbers do that what works for you i'm

264
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
talking about what i standardize what i

265
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:56,799
normally do so we'd mix the water up and

266
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,278
then we watched our friend put the

267
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,120
nutrient the ph drops in there to get it

268
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:03,360
to the right ph now when we add

269
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,600
nutrients it's going to drastically

270
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,080
change the ph so you would put your

271
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,320
nutrients in first put the put your

272
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
potassium silicate shake the bottle put

273
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,519
the potassium silicate in there get your

274
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:14,958
next bottle probably your base nutrient

275
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,879
shake the [ __ ] out of it measure it out

276
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:18,639
put it in there uh in whatever size

277
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,240
container you're mixing i usually mix in

278
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,000
uh if it's a small batch i got a 5

279
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,560
gallon if it's a big batch it's a 55

280
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
gallon sometimes it's 500 gallons i'm

281
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,919
going to assume you're mixing into a 5

282
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,759
gallon bucket so you got your 5 gallon

283
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:30,639
bucket mostly filled with water most of

284
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:31,838
the way

285
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,600
then you start with your potassium

286
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,360
silicate shake the bottle put it in your

287
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,399
measuring unit pour it into the end of

288
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,919
the container

289
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,360
then clean give it a little wipe give

290
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,039
your measuring unit a little bit of a

291
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,320
wipe if i use a shot glass or maybe

292
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,719
something bigger depending on how big

293
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,399
i'm measuring wipe that out shake up

294
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,639
your next bottle pour out the desired

295
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,559
amount toss it into your res clean that

296
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,480
out repeat the process until you're done

297
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,239
then adjust the ph that is when you put

298
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
your ph meter in there and you start

299
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,759
putting your drops in there to get it to

300
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,600
the amount that you want also you can

301
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,879
check the ec at that time also if you

302
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,720
would like but

303
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:04,078
adjust adjusting the ph is the final

304
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,360
step you want to do that right before

305
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,120
you feed it to the plants because it

306
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,879
will change if you do anything else to

307
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,799
it if you do anything else to it other

308
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,639
than add microbes that's the only thing

309
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,120
i would recommend doing after the ph but

310
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,240
anything else it will change the ph of

311
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,159
your solution if you're going to add

312
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,680
more water because it's not full enough

313
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,879
or if you have if you've gotten too high

314
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:25,120
of an ec or a ppm adjust that ph after

315
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:26,399
all of those adjustments then water

316
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,159
carefully here's something else i

317
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,759
noticed that my friends grow

318
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,759
if you've got big pots if you've got a

319
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:34,159
three or a five gallon pot i don't

320
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:36,799
recommend dumping all of your water

321
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:38,879
directly into the middle of that pot

322
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,639
water around the outer edge of that pot

323
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,879
so you got your plant sticking up you

324
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:45,519
got so probably a 10 12 maybe a 14 inch

325
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,120
diameter plant or a pot water the outer

326
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,639
edge and then work your way in with the

327
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,078
water the water is going to work its way

328
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,399
in anyway

329
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:54,479
all of the roots of that plant that want

330
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,639
that water are out at the outer edge of

331
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,399
the pot they're not on the inside think

332
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,639
about look at the shape of a cannabis

333
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,720
plant look at the shape of most plants

334
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,799
that you see in nature if we look at the

335
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,480
shape of a cannabis plant it is shaped

336
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,719
kind of triangular shaped right but if

337
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,519
you look at the top leaves they work

338
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,200
like the shingles of a roof those top

339
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
leaves when the water hits them they

340
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,480
will droop down

341
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,399
and the water will run down those leaves

342
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,800
right down to the next set of leaves

343
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,200
then it will gently run it down and

344
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,479
outward as it goes down it goes outward

345
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,000
every time that's just kind of the way

346
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,360
that the leaves in the plant are shaped

347
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,879
and what it does

348
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,079
then when it lands on the ground you'll

349
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,919
notice

350
00:11:30,078 --> 00:11:33,919
there's a nice circle around your plants

351
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:35,838
if you just get a nice light rain a nice

352
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:37,759
little spring sprinkle and you don't

353
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,120
over over rain too much i almost said

354
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:41,200
over water we don't have any control of

355
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,039
that if you don't over rain too much

356
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,399
you'll see just a nice circle around

357
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,319
your plants around the bottom like they

358
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,159
were sitting under an umbrella they're

359
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
providing their own umbrella effect they

360
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,199
don't want all that water right there on

361
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,639
the toes they want it out there on the

362
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
roots the feet are roots that are out at

363
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,639
the edge of the plant so water that

364
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,959
outer edge of your pots of your buckets

365
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,399
of your containers and water the inside

366
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,319
a little bit lighter because that's

367
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,159
where you run the risk of over watering

368
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,600
is flooding that inside now my

369
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,120
disclaimer if you're running little

370
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,519
plants in large pots and they're not

371
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,278
fully established at this time water as

372
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,120
necessary water where the roots are but

373
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,480
once you get that pot filled with roots

374
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,240
the plant's really established and

375
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,079
really banging that's when you want to

376
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,600
go ahead and start watering the outer

377
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,599
circumference i think is the word i'm

378
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,759
looking for the outer edge of those

379
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,680
plants then work your way in toward the

380
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:27,600
center those outer roots are the thirsty

381
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,958
roots those the roots they need the

382
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
water they're searching they're already

383
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,879
going out there to get the water keep in

384
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,360
mind that umbrella idea the shingles

385
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,480
idea the roofing idea really keep that

386
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,200
in mind when you're thinking about

387
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,278
watering the plants don't over water

388
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,560
them now another thing i want to touch

389
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,519
on before we start wrapping up the

390
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:48,239
episode is don't overlook the importance

391
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,839
of your vegetative space i've seen

392
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,560
several grows recently where you can

393
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,279
tell that the grower obviously put

394
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,679
75 to 90 percent of their funding energy

395
00:12:55,278 --> 00:13:00,078
effort and time into the flowering room

396
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:03,838
and the veg space you can tell that they

397
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:06,399
put 10 15 maybe 25 of their time energy

398
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,680
budget effort love and care into that

399
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,000
veg space

400
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,759
the veg space is your foundation that is

401
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,039
where it all starts we all get excited

402
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,120
in the flower room when you drag the

403
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:16,958
plants into flower it's like oh yeah

404
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,639
flowers are coming money is coming the

405
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,599
pictures are coming the progress is

406
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,000
coming

407
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,240
but without a solid foundation you're

408
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,159
not going to get the money the pictures

409
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,240
the crop the harvest the potency the

410
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,278
weight none of that stuff will come if

411
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,600
you don't have a quality veg set up so

412
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,480
stop overlooking the importance of the

413
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,879
vegetative phase the vegetative space

414
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:41,680
start allocating more of your budget to

415
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,439
that veg room the veg space especially

416
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,958
the veg feeding i see a lot of people

417
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,560
under feeding and veg they think that it

418
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:47,919
could just kind of veg then when it

419
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,000
comes to flower they'll start really

420
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,399
feeding it but our plants take up and

421
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,799
absorb and store a lot of their their

422
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,039
nitrogen during the vegetative stage a

423
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:58,879
lot of their nutrients come from veg so

424
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,039
build them up get them strong you

425
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,399
wouldn't put so a lot of people say it's

426
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,559
just a weed i don't need to feed it

427
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,000
right well think about it like this do

428
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,000
you want high performance cannabis

429
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,159
plants or do you just want lazy couch

430
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
potato plants you can grow plants that

431
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,799
look like me i'm six foot five and i

432
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,039
weigh about 190 pounds i can hide behind

433
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,120
a flagpole i'm super skinny i'm in

434
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,879
pretty good shape but i am super skinny

435
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,480
my point is i am not training for any

436
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,078
fights i'm not going to get in the ring

437
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,800
i'm not going to do anything anytime

438
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:29,919
soon i'm just fine i work i do what i'm

439
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,838
doing i get the job done or or your

440
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,599
other option i could go to the gym every

441
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,680
[ __ ] day i could pound protein shakes

442
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,360
i could put steroids in my neck i could

443
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,719
do all kinds of crazy [ __ ] i could

444
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,240
anavar up

445
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,680
and then i could be the big brock lesnar

446
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,600
looking dude but i'd have to put in a

447
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,519
ton of [ __ ] more work to do it you

448
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,278
can have cannabis plants that look like

449
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,278
me or you can have cannabis plants that

450
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,799
look like brock lesnar that is up to you

451
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,159
do you want to feed them do you want to

452
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,319
do the work to them do you want to give

453
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,919
them the the work the extra love the

454
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,519
extra care the extra attention or do you

455
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,879
just want to water them and just let

456
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,720
them survive and let them grow up and be

457
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,120
tall and skinny like me i think

458
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,879
everybody really wants deep down inside

459
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,198
we don't want the [ __ ] brock lesnar

460
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,720
ultimate warrior [ __ ] ninja warrior

461
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,559
[ __ ] savage plants that's what we

462
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,160
really all want but to get to that kind

463
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:13,759
of a crop you've got to do the work

464
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,759
every single day there are details that

465
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,278
need to be managed the room needs to be

466
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,039
checked on the equipment needs to be

467
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,039
inspected the water needs to be perfect

468
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,799
the watering timing needs to be right

469
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:24,559
did you defoliate on the right day did

470
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,078
you pop and twist on the right day is

471
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:28,479
the fan coming on it's just the right

472
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,519
time there's a lot of details to dial in

473
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,000
if you want to get that brock lesnar bud

474
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,399
the buds can only be in the end your

475
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,720
buds can only be as powerful potent

476
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,278
heavy dense they can only be as quality

477
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,199
as your veg was so if your veg is like a

478
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,039
five out of ten your flowers are going

479
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,359
no matter how good your flowering room

480
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,439
is your flowers are gonna come out maybe

481
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,199
a five maybe a six or seven out of a ten

482
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,959
that's the best you're ever gonna get if

483
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,559
your bedroom is shitty if your bedroom

484
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,399
is a seven or eight you've got the

485
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:57,599
potential of eight or nine buds coming

486
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,278
out of there but you're not gonna do

487
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,600
great if you're not paying a lot of

488
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:03,519
attention to the veg area get your

489
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,199
lighting right a lot of people overlook

490
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:07,039
the importance of a light and veg they

491
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:09,039
have a light that will get the plants to

492
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,639
grow what if those plants [ __ ] grew

493
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,399
what if they exploded what if they had

494
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,159
vigorous growth what if they were

495
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,720
growing so quickly and so healthily that

496
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:18,958
you had to cut clones and harvest or cut

497
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,160
clones and get into flower early what if

498
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,239
what if you were using the right

499
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,919
equipment what if your airflow was

500
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,759
better in your veg space i see a lot of

501
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,958
people with terrible airflow because

502
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,680
they say oh it can take the high

503
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,599
humidity your plants will thrive if you

504
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,198
give them a better vpd that vapor

505
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,600
pressure deficit

506
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,039
will make a huge difference i wrote down

507
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,278
feed make sure you're feeding these

508
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,599
plants they do need food even in the veg

509
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,439
phase give them nitrogen give them the

510
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,959
calmag that they need give them microbes

511
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,880
to get them going give them anything you

512
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:48,159
can imagine to get them boosted then

513
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,240
while you're in there give them some

514
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:51,679
general maintenance and care clean up

515
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,360
the bottoms if you want the plants to

516
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,359
grow up and get thick take off all that

517
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,440
[ __ ] off the bottom that's wasting

518
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,800
time energy and space you don't need to

519
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,800
grow that the light's not going to get

520
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,479
down there you're just wasting plant

521
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,000
energy by producing all that are you

522
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,838
popping and twisting the stems at the

523
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,318
right times that will definitely help

524
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,838
your plants and get more strength get

525
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,759
more robust it will slow down the

526
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,198
vertical growth when it comes time are

527
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:15,599
you doing all that maintenance that

528
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,079
needs to be done all of that stuff adds

529
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,279
up to strong vigorous plants in flower

530
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,038
if you don't train them if you don't

531
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,959
prepare them when you send them into

532
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,640
battle they will not be prepared they

533
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,640
will not be what you are expecting you

534
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,480
will not get the desired outcome you're

535
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,640
going to pay for the electricity no

536
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,079
matter what you do the electricity the

537
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,919
electric company you can't call them and

538
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,279
go hey i kind of [ __ ] up this crop we

539
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,280
didn't get as many buds as we were

540
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,319
hoping for we're like half a pound short

541
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,000
you think you give me a deal on

542
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:41,439
electricity they're going to go haha

543
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,480
[ __ ] you pay the electric bill and if

544
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,400
you don't we're turning it off and you

545
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,759
don't get to grow anymore at all so you

546
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,600
got to get the crop you got to get the

547
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,759
electricity you're going to be in there

548
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:51,359
spending time why not put quality time

549
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:52,960
in that grow a lot of people just hang

550
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,719
out stare at the plants i do that that's

551
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,240
called the grower's gaze i learn a lot

552
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,919
but don't just be in there wasting time

553
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,319
don't go play video games until all the

554
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,320
work is done pay attention spend the

555
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,678
time that you need to spend in there

556
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,359
that's when the you're going to spend a

557
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,798
lot of time on it why not spend a few

558
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,240
extra minutes and make it great you

559
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:10,160
could spend a few minutes and make it

560
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,839
good or you could spend a lot of minutes

561
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,279
and make it [ __ ] great if you're

562
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,199
going to feed the plants feed them

563
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,038
quality nutrients at a quality time on a

564
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,558
good schedule you got to pay for the

565
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,160
nutrients you're going to buy them

566
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,720
you're going to spend the money why not

567
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
feed the plants properly the airflow get

568
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,000
the airflow right you guys see where i'm

569
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,480
going if you're going to do it do it

570
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:30,480
right grow the best herb that you can

571
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,319
get that veg space set up get that veg

572
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,240
space dialed in that way when you move

573
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,079
them into flour there's no transition

574
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,160
skip they just go oh yeah we're waiting

575
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,839
for that time to flower here come the

576
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,320
buds and a few weeks later you start

577
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:44,319
