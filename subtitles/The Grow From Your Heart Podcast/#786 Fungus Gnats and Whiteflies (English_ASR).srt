84
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,179
asking me for more content new content

85
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,860
multiple podcasts a week it's hard for

86
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:12,000
me to do that right now with my uh my

87
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,340
work and living and my whole life

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,259
situation uh one podcast is a week a

89
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,180
week is what I can do but there are a

90
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:19,739
lot of older episodes that you can go

91
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,800
back and listen to there are many many

92
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:24,658
episodes there are apparently 785

93
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,640
episodes before this one that you can go

94
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:29,399
back and listen to unfortunately YouTube

95
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:31,378
has taken down a few of those if I show

96
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,879
plants in the videos YouTube likes to

97
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,679
take down those videos so there's a

98
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,359
video where I cut clones that they took

99
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,860
down there's a video about popping and

100
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,900
twisting and lollipopping that they have

101
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,280
taken down uh they've taken down a lot

102
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,439
of the videos where I do any sort of

103
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,299
consumption but YouTube takes some down

104
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:46,859
other than YouTube taking them down most

105
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:52,019
of the videos are still up and available

106
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,879
uh 785 other videos the first 20 videos

107
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,620
uh the podcast was called something

108
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:57,840
different it was called I grow culture

109
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,759
for a little while for 20 episodes then

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,560
I was informed politely and gently with

111
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,598
the uh by the form of a season desist

112
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,400
letter that I grow culture was already

113
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:07,500
something being used and I could not use

114
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,060
that so we promptly changed the name to

115
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,340
the grow from your heart podcast my

116
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,019

number 580 and they say in that podcast

129
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,780
you answered a listener question

130
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,819
concerning purple petioles and you

131
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:44,039
mentioned if the plan is also showing

132
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,439
crispy leaves it is likely too much

133
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,580
light yes uh that from what I've read in

134
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,959
the rest of your email that is

135
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,000
definitely the case of what's going on

136
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,620
here so let me just keep going it says

137
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,360
you will be pleased that the least

138
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,399
affected strains in the grow are the

139
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,680
machine and the blue pill with the blue

140
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:00,539
pill being far by far the happiest

141
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,879
looking plant in the tent

142
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,680
it goes on though it says well I'm only

143
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,360
in my first indoor grow with several

144
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,579
different strains and about half of the

145
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,620
plants have purple petioles and all of

146
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:13,258
them now are getting some crispy looking

147
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,660
leaves with this being worse on the more

148
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,879
purple petiole plants so the plants that

149
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,919
have the more purple petals are showing

150
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:21,120
the purple crispy problem I'm just

151
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:22,859
trying to put a bunch of peas into a

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,560
sense to be silly there we get what's

153
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,660
going on here it says however at six

154
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,120
weeks into 12 12 the buds on all of the

155
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,860
plants are looking good so this you just

156
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,478
keep us solidifying the idea that yes

157
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,300
the light is too intense is what's going

158
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,538
on here it says I am growing in a 5x5

159
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,220
tent with an hlg scorpion Diablo light

160
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,300
I'm not super familiar with that light I

161
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,400
have heard a lot about it I know that

162
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,780
hlg makes great [ __ ] I know a lot of

163
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,819
people run that line I know that it is

164
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,219
quite powerful it says I had the light

165
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:52,860
set 16 inches over the canopy at 50

166
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,780
intensity and things were getting crispy

167
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:57,000
about 10 days ago I lifted the light to

168
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:59,339
26 inches over the canopy at 50

169
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,199
intensity and the plants sure do look

170
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,758
happier so we're giving supporting

171
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,919
statements supporting evidence that this

172
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,259
is probably a light issue you've got

173
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,418
that light a little bit too close maybe

174
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:11,819
turned up too high you did the right

175
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,560
thing you raised that plan when you get

176
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,180
those new LED lights I would definitely

177
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,918
do whoever you are I'm talking to

178
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,819
everybody out there if you get a new LED

179
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,060
light

180
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:22,379
I highly recommend doing some research

181
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,939
research that particular light find out

182
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:26,159
how far they recommend you put that

183
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,839
plant or that light from your canopy and

184
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,580
then go a little bit further and then

185
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,739
also reduce the intensity a little bit

186
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,538
more than they recommend like we've seen

187
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,220
here these plants they've taken too much

188
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:36,599
light they will start to burn the leaves

189
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,039
will start to crisp up they'll turn

190
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,680
purple they will slow down the growth

191
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:42,719
things will go wrong if you get too much

192
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,160
light the leaves crisp up and you can't

193
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,020
fix that if you're not getting enough

194
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,460
light the plants will start to stretch

195
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,500
and get a little bit extended we can

196
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:51,599
turn up the light and fix that more

197
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,000
easily than we can take back the crispy

198
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,080
Leaf so start lower and slowly ramp

199
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,579
yourself up that's going to be something

200
00:06:55,079 --> 00:07:00,000
we talk about here toward the end of

201
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,680
this message it does go on it says I did

202
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,418
spend a bunch of money did I spend a

203
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,340
bunch of money on the wrong light also

204
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:07,079
is there a strategy I can use for the

205
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,698
remaining four weeks that will will

206
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:11,219
allow me to increase the intensity

207
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,780
setting on the light for my next girl I

208
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,340
believe I will induce CO2

209
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:16,439
supplementation that will absolutely

210
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:18,359
help it'll help with food uptake it'll

211
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:19,860
help the plants take more light and also

212
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,620
help them manage a little bit more heat

213
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,180
but then it says thanks for all you do

214
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,620
signed from your friend Soul Train

215
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:27,060
there's a little personal joke in there

216
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,860
that I almost read out loud that is just

217
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:31,379
between us I cannot share that with you

218
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,419
fist want for the funny joke bro

219
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,759
so our friend Soul Train you are

220
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,379
absolutely right uh by moving that light

221
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,180
up by assuming that the light was too

222
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:41,098
intense one of the major questions that

223
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:43,860
you ask in here is did I spend a bunch

224
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:46,019
of money on the wrong light I don't

225
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,939
think so I think if you Ray if you

226
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,038
lifted the light to the top of the tent

227
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,079
and turn it down and the plants are

228
00:07:50,038 --> 00:07:53,879
small that intensity for the small plant

229
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,439
should work out and then here's what I

230
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:56,819
want to talk about what I would have

231
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:58,379
done it's too late to do this now this

232
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,780
is what I'm going to suggest you do in

233
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,279
the future and on future runs what I

234
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:04,198
would do is raise that light all the way

235
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:06,239
up and turn it as low as it will let you

236
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:07,620
go that's probably 50 or 30 percent most

237
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,840
of those lights only go down to about 50

238
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:11,939
or 30. so raise the light turn it down

239
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,159
then start your seedlings or your small

240
00:08:11,939 --> 00:08:15,660
plants down on the very low part of that

241
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,819
tent so you've got as much space as

242
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:19,800
possible then pay attention to how those

243
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,240
plants are acting do you need to lower

244
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,740
the light a little bit or do you need to

245
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,120
raise the intensity a little bit pay

246
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,800
attention if they're getting stretchy if

247
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,300
they're getting leggy they may want a

248
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,280
little bit more light I may recommend

249
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,319
lowering that light at this time just a

250
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,478
little tiny bit and do not increase the

251
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,918
intensity just lower the light down so

252
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,139
that you can get that light closer to

253
00:08:34,918 --> 00:08:39,598
the plants then as the plants begin to

254
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:41,519
grow you can turn that light up just a

255
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,680
little bit I would say turn it up just a

256
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,659
small fraction just maybe five percent

257
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,338
maybe ten percent just a little bit as

258
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,379
they start growing then if you start

259
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:51,120
seeing shaded shadowy areas in the tin

260
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:52,679
the plants aren't growing the maximum

261
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,778
efficiency maybe turn it up just a

262
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:56,399
little bit then raise that light all the

263
00:08:54,778 --> 00:08:58,860
way to the top and then now what I do

264
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,360
know is when I use the Canon LEDs is

265
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,459
that I like to have them about 50

266
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,320
intensity when I put my plants into

267
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,259
flour so I start I think those go to

268
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,700
like 30 percent then I start vegging I

269
00:09:07,259 --> 00:09:10,319
slowly crank them up they veg a little

270
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,580
more I slowly crank them up they veg a

271
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,620
little more I slowly crank them up by

272
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,278
the time I go into flour my lights are

273
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,899
at 50 intensity then every week or two I

274
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,759
just knock it up just a little bit so

275
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:22,559
you're gonna get 10 weeks in flour in

276
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:24,600
there we want to go up to me I don't

277
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,099
even know if we need to go to 100 you've

278
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,839
got to pay attention to what the plants

279
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,100
need which is going to lead me into the

280
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,720
next part that I want to talk about but

281
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,300
I would slowly ramp that up don't go

282
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,278
from low intensity just cranking it all

283
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:37,319
up all the way I would start low and

284
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,480
then slowly over we've got these plants

285
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:42,120
in there for 100 days go from 50 to 100

286
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,560
percent over that hundred day period you

287
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,600
may not even need to Max it all the way

288
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,278
out there's something that we do need to

289
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,959
think about though

290
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,820
um we can give them too much light we

291
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:52,079
can also give them the wrong Spectrum if

292
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,820
they're not getting the right color then

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,139
that's too much wasted light but

294
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,720
something else we should talk about is

295
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,278
DLI the plants will take up so much

296
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,860
light and then they will simply have had

297
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:03,480
enough and they will shut off so you can

298
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,700
save electricity you can save lighting

299
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,920
by figuring out the DLI of your specific

300
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,019
plant The Daily Light integral hit that

301
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,699
point and then reduce or cut off the

302
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,919
lights to save that electricity and that

303
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,259
Photon energy now there's something else

304
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,759
we should talk about this is uh the

305
00:10:16,259 --> 00:10:19,559
technical way to figure out if your

306
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,120
plants are getting enough light this is

307
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:23,278
going to take some equipment you need a

308
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,959
par meter here some sort of a meter that

309
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,120
will read how much light is getting to

310
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,099
your plants some of the cell phone

311
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,959
makers do have a decent app for a par

312
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,120
meter however I would recommend a real

313
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:35,518
power meter for this the cell phone apps

314
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,620
are not a hundred percent perfect yet

315
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,480
now if you're going to use a par meter

316
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:44,639
we are looking for a range of 500 to 700

317
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,920
ppfd now what is ppfd this was all this

318
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,419
term was all the rage all the uh this

319
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:49,860
was the hot phrase it used to be Terps

320
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:52,139
for a minute uh and then it was

321
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:55,200
phenotype for a little while and then uh

322
00:10:52,139 --> 00:10:57,360
for a little while ppfd was the the word

323
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
in the grow industry what is ppfd that

324
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,039
is photosynthetic Photon flux density

325
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,419
what does that really mean

326
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:05,458
um I don't understand a lot about

327
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:07,259
lighting let me admit right now when it

328
00:11:05,458 --> 00:11:09,719
comes to Lighting in cannabis that is

329
00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:11,399
where I lack knowledge I know about the

330
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,259
plants I understand the processes of the

331
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,299
plants I understand soil I understand

332
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:17,458
most of everything that needs to be done

333
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,620
to a cannabis plant but lighting my

334
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:21,299
brain uh just doesn't want to absorb

335
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,159
that bit of information my brain isn't

336
00:11:21,299 --> 00:11:25,078
interested and my brain's not interested

337
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:27,899
I just have a hard time learning about

338
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:29,819
that [ __ ] I have a very uh a rudimentary

339
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:31,860
understanding of lighting so let me try

340
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,560
to teach you a very General

341
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,139
understanding of ppfd photosynthetic

342
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:39,000
Photon flux density right I think I said

343
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,860
it correctly even okay think about this

344
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,720
this is how we measure say that you've

345
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:44,579
got your light above you imagine you

346
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,500
could see little raindrops of light

347
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,299
falling down that's basically what we're

348
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,278
measuring how many raindrops of light

349
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:52,439
are coming down from your light and

350
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:54,059
we'll measure at certain distances from

351
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,760
that light to find out the intensity of

352
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:59,639
that light at certain distances so at

353
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:02,759
your canopy I would use a par meter and

354
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,819
the desired ppfd at canopy level is

355
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:08,159
between 500 and 700 that is the range

356
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,620
that you were looking for you need a par

357
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,600
meter or an app or an app on your phone

358
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,100
to find that that is not something that

359
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,778
you can do with your eyes you need a

360
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,459
meter for that so you'd hold the meter

361
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:20,759
right at canopy level and see is that

362
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:22,439
between 500 and 700 ppfd if it's too hot

363
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,179
too much light of course turn those

364
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,160
lights down or raise the light if it's

365
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,078
too much do the opposite increase the

366
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,939
light or lower the light closer to the

367
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,620
plants the thing is when you lower the

368
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,240
light you get a little bit more Shadow

369
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,339
area because it's not spreading as far

370
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,899
but it is more intense if you raise that

371
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:38,279
light you will get less Shadows but it

372
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:39,539
is not intense so that's one of the

373
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:40,919
things that you've got to figure out

374
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:42,838
there so

375
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,819
um a thousand is really high if you're

376
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,320
hitting that thousand ppfd your plants

377
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,360
are going to start showing problems if

378
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,579
you're under 500 you're not going to get

379
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,259
that optimal growth once again uh it

380
00:12:50,578 --> 00:12:53,458
seems to me in my studies and the

381
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:56,519
Cannabis realm and everything I've

382
00:12:53,458 --> 00:13:00,119
looked at online uh they're between 500

383
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,339
and 700 ppfd is ideal for our ganja

384
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,959
plants so I think you are spot on with

385
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:05,459
your first assumption that these plants

386
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,138
are just getting a little bit too much

387
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:08,699
light then the second part of your

388
00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,860
question was your concern that you spent

389
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,360
too much money on this light and you

390
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,639
wasted all that money on too much light

391
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,139
for your space I don't think that is the

392
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,240
case I think you've got a good quality

393
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,579
light I think if we figure out how far

394
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,959
to keep that light from the canopy then

395
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:24,000
we'll be in big business because that's

396
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,500
a quality life that's a good company and

397
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,179
I've never heard bad things about that

398
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,100
light so as long as we keep the

399
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:30,838
appropriate distance between the light

400
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,480
and the canopy and we turn that light

401
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:35,700
down onto the appropriate ppfd the right

402
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,379
intensity then we should get that dialed

403
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:40,079
in another thing the main thing I'm

404
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:41,578
going to recommend is slowly ramping up

405
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,319
the intensity of that light we don't

406
00:13:41,578 --> 00:13:44,638
need all of the light on the seedlings

407
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,079
they just need a little bit of light and

408
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,519
as they get bigger then they can

409
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,319
metabolize more they can be more

410
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,459
functional they can handle more light so

411
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,260
maybe wait till they're a little bit

412
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:54,539
bigger to start giving them that super

413
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,299
intense light so my main advice is to

414
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:59,219
next time slowly ramp up that light and

415
00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:01,019
then pay attention to the ppfd if you

416
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,360
can get that par meter and measure the

417
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:05,820
ppfd at canopy level you will be golden

418
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,740
my friend alright Soul Train thanks once

419
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:09,540
again for the great message uh you were

420
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:11,820
six weeks into flower when you sent this

421
00:14:09,539 --> 00:14:13,439
you have probably harvested by now I'm

422
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:14,879
really curious how did this crop turn

423
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,279
out how did it look how did it smell

424
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,379
have you got to sample it yet and also

425
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,000
let's get that next crop on track if

426
00:14:19,379 --> 00:14:23,338
you've got any questions please do reach

427
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,500
out we'll get you going all right this

428
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:27,300
next email came from our friend Zach J

429
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,700
big shout out to our buddy Zach J for

430
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:32,458
the good question this one goes a little

431
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,200
bit like this it says yoga pasta Jeff I

432
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,838
just discovered what I believe are white

433
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,759
flies and or fungus gnats the first

434
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,100
thing I would do there bro is identify

435
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:43,439
if you've got white flies and or fungus

436
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,180
gnats or both uh it's very possible that

437
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,100
you've got both it's very likely that

438
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:48,719
you've got both but if you've only got

439
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,579
one or the other it may be easier to

440
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,800
treat for just one if we know more

441
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:54,719
specifically what we are targeting or we

442
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,939
may have to use multiple methods of

443
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,639
attack here but the first step is

444
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,839
identify which one you are battling are

445
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,240
they white do they look like a little

446
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,860
piece of rice on the stems when you tap

447
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,079
the pots does it look like ashes come

448
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:08,459
flying out or are they little black bugs

449
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:09,778
those are the fungus gnats the white

450
00:15:08,458 --> 00:15:11,819
ones are the white flies that should be

451
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:14,519
obvious let's identify which one we've

452
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,540
got in the grow then it goes on there's

453
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,980
a little bit here that we're going to

454
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:19,559
skip but then it goes on to say I've

455
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:21,480
already ordered neem oil without doing a

456
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:24,179
whole lot of research do you have any

457
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,220
thoughts on neem oil also does a new

458
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,019
layer of all-purpose sand on top of the

459
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,600
soil change the way I need to feed or

460
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:33,299
water my plants at all much love and

461
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,159
respect from Zach all right this is a

462
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:37,559
great question white flies and fungus

463
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:39,360
gnats are very very common in a grow

464
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:41,759
they come in house plants they come in

465
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,860
all of the soil if you buy a bagged

466
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,838
potting soil a soilless mix almost

467
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:48,600
anything in a bag from a grow store

468
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:50,699
whether it's like your local Randy's

469
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:53,159
grow or Mike's grow shop or if it's grow

470
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:56,099
generation or way to grow or if it's

471
00:15:53,159 --> 00:15:58,139
Home Depot or Lowe's or even Target had

472
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,000
Fox Farm soil the last time I was there

473
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:02,220
all of that soil

474
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,559
people want to blame specific Brands I

475
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,720
got this bug from this soil that soil's

476
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,000
got this bug in it now bro all the bugs

477
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,259
are in all of the soil they are made in

478
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,879
different places but then they're

479
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,860
shipped to a warehouse where they're all

480
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:15,778
put on a pallet together on a dock

481
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,579
together put on a pallet put on a truck

482
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:19,439
and moved around the country together do

483
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:21,120
you think the white flies went I like I

484
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,279
like Fox Farms better or hey I like

485
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,659
Roots Organics better they went there's

486
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:26,039
a bunch of places to live and they went

487
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:27,778
in all the [ __ ] soil and they lived

488
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:29,819
in all of it it's just all about where

489
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:32,100
that soil came from was stored how it

490
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,079
traveled what it got exposed to it's

491
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,360
your responsibility as the farmer to

492
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:38,638
make sure that there are no bugs in your

493
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,320
soil anyway my point is the white flies

494
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,639
and fungus gnats they're very easy to

495
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,800
get they come from all over the place

496
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:46,198
they're very common I bet many many

497
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:48,179
Growers have had them in their grow the

498
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,500
fungistats are not that big of a deal

499
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:50,698
when there's only a couple of them

500
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:52,500
they're just kind of annoying they're

501
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:53,879
gross they bug you they make the

502
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,100
pictures look like [ __ ] they remind you

503
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:57,778
that you over watered a little bit but

504
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,699
once you get a lot of fungus gnats then

505
00:16:57,778 --> 00:17:01,980
they can become a vector for disease if

506
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:03,539
you've got problem in one plant those

507
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,039
fungus gnats will just move that root

508
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:07,078
disease right over to the other plants

509
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,759
or whatever is going on if you've got a

510
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:10,619
small problem and fungus gnats the

511
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:11,640
problem compounds same thing with the

512
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,019
white flies

513
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,240
a couple of white flies they just look

514
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,619
annoying after a little bit get a bunch

515
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,880
of white flies and it's gross and you're

516
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,678
like I've got a major [ __ ] problem

517
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,900
that's just a hint of the overall health

518
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,579
of the garden so white flies and fungus

519
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,798
gnats are very common one of the most

520
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:27,119
common causes of these bugs is simply

521
00:17:25,798 --> 00:17:28,918
well they come in they get in that's

522
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,899
they're not caused they arrive but the

523
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,700
reason they stick around is because of

524
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,679
over watering they like to be around in

525
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,960
that moist soil that soil right around

526
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:38,400
where your pot drips into the saucer

527
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,019
right around there where there's always

528
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,759
that little bit of there's a dry spot

529
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,259
for them to be safe but enough moisture

530
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,359
for them to lay some eggs have a party

531
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,099
get some water it feels like the Bahamas

532
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,199
there for them that's where they like to

533
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:50,939
chill the white flies like to chill just

534
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,340
above the top of the soil and climb up

535
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,500
your sticks they like to live right on

536
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:57,538
the the stalks of your plants there's a

537
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,460
very common bugs they're very easy to

538
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,440
get rid of now the first question the

539
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:04,140
first attempt here was that our listener

540
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,179
Zach Jay thought about using neem

541
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:08,820
I'm going to cut you off right there I

542
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:11,038
do not like neem oil for anything there

543
00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:13,558
is no application for neem in my garden

544
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:15,599
in fact uh in the state of Colorado

545
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,519
according to the Colorado Department of

546
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,439
Health and environment and the Colorado

547
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,359
Department of Ag and the Colorado

548
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,360
medical are the Colorado marijuana

549
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:26,038
enforcement division all neem based

550
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:28,259
products are banned in commercial

551
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,960
cultivation we can't use Neiman cannabis

552
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:32,640
at all legally in commercial cultivation

553
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,500
in Colorado we can do it in our home

554
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,720
grow because we're not regulated but I

555
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,519
refuse to use neem for several reasons

556
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,500
first of all a tasting smells like [ __ ]

557
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,720
if you get neem on your gloves on your

558
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,759
skin on your clothes anywhere it's going

559
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,798
to stink so bad forever and it never

560
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:48,839
ever goes away if you've ever tasted

561
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,418
neem it is one of the worst tasting

562
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:53,159
things ever if you smoke flowers or a

563
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,980
concentrated product and it tastes a

564
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,779
little bit fishy and oily and maybe a

565
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:59,940
little bit spicy that possibly probably

566
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:02,099
was because there was neem oil applied

567
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:03,660
to that flower the neem oil never goes

568
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,058
away it's going to be there forever in

569
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:07,558
my opinion I think I can always taste it

570
00:19:06,058 --> 00:19:10,259
that might be in my mind but I think

571
00:19:07,558 --> 00:19:12,178
neem is gross and also there are many

572
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:13,980
toxic traits to neem neem has been

573
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:16,140
banned in many countries for many uses

574
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,599
uh it's known to do reproductive damage

575
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,580
to men and women and it's not good uh

576
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,079
for the environment or your body so

577
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:24,058
there are a few reasons why I don't

578
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,619
recommend to use neem

579
00:19:24,058 --> 00:19:27,178
um it just tastes like [ __ ] and it

580
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:29,279
doesn't go away and there are better

581
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:30,600
options uh now that I told you I don't

582
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,399
like the product you said that you've

583
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:34,619
already ordered which I do apologize for

584
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,900
uh let's talk about products that will

585
00:19:34,619 --> 00:19:39,418
help you to get rid of these white flies

586
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:41,640
and or fungus gnats the first thing uh

587
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:43,860
Step One is let's identify positively

588
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,660
identify what we are battling if we're

589
00:19:43,859 --> 00:19:47,819
battling just white flies I'm going to

590
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,679
recommend uh just one product if we're

591
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:51,418
battling fungus gnats I'm going to

592
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,400
recommend a different product if we've

593
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:55,140
got them both we may mix up these

594
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,960
products together and spray them at the

595
00:19:55,140 --> 00:20:00,179
same time it depends on how strong these

596
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,740
bugs are attacking uh and which one it

597
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,480
is if there's fungus gnats they're in

598
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,099
the they're more living in the soil if

599
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,019
they're white flies they're a little bit

600
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:08,879
in the soil and more on the stalks and

601
00:20:07,019 --> 00:20:10,679
under the foliage of the plants two

602
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,620
different uh means of treatment two

603
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,600
different modes of attack but let's talk

604
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:17,159
about it let's identify the bugs that

605
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,139
you've got that is the very first step

606
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,640
the second step is let's stop over

607
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,900
watering these plants you did address

608
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,880
that here in the message you understand

609
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,340
that part of the problem is from over

610
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,020
watering let's reduce the water also is

611
00:20:26,339 --> 00:20:30,058
there standing water I don't know if

612
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,038
your grow is in a commercial building if

613
00:20:30,058 --> 00:20:34,259
it's in your home if it's in a hotel if

614
00:20:32,038 --> 00:20:35,940
it's a train station if it's in the city

615
00:20:34,259 --> 00:20:38,759
if it's on a farm I don't know any of

616
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:40,740
those environmental factors but possibly

617
00:20:38,759 --> 00:20:42,720
you've got water standing somewhere else

618
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,880
or a source of moisture somewhere else

619
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,860
those white flies and fungus gnats will

620
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,080
be drawn to that source of moisture as

621
00:20:46,859 --> 00:20:50,759
well as well as all of the other insects

622
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:53,579
they're going to come to the water first

623
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,259
Warm Water Aroma the bugs are going to

624
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:57,480
show up so let's get rid of the water

625
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,558
the over water the excessive water the

626
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,700
lingering moisture they're like

627
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,139
mosquitoes they're going to come where

628
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:02,940
there's water so let's get rid of that

629
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,679
now let's identify a couple of

630
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,259
pesticides that I would recommend mid

631
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:09,900
for let's start with the white flies if

632
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:12,240
you've just got white flies I would do a

633
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:14,580
little bit of defoliation you probably

634
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,779
need to defoliate anyway the white flies

635
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:17,759
are going to be hiding under the leaves

636
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:19,079
let's pull off some leaves let's glove

637
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,298
up let's put on some clothes we don't

638
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:23,460
really like a whole lot and go defoliate

639
00:21:21,298 --> 00:21:25,139
let's just go manually remove a bunch of

640
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,240
the white flies from the room and also

641
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,860
remove their hotel take away their party

642
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,200
spot they won't come to party so let's

643
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:33,899
defoliate a little bit put all of those

644
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,819
defoliated leaves into a trash bag that

645
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,259
you can tie up and seal and remove from

646
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,359
The Grow environment if you've got a

647
00:21:37,259 --> 00:21:41,220
fire pit put that bad [ __ ] in the fire

648
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:42,538
pit and burn those [ __ ] leaves get

649
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,700
rid of them we don't want those white

650
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:46,859
flies coming back let's do a little bit

651
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,298
of defoliation now here's another trick

652
00:21:46,859 --> 00:21:50,459
that you may laugh at but this is

653
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:53,158
definitely going to work I get a shop

654
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,779
vac and I put the shop vac nozzles kind

655
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,059
of big I've got a little tapered device

656
00:21:54,779 --> 00:21:59,038
that makes the shop vac nozzle smaller I

657
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:00,960
will smack the plants with a stick and

658
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,279
as the white flies come flying out I

659
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,200
suck them up at the shop vac they're

660
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,879
going to fly directly to the light stay

661
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,860
right there near the light smack the

662
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,600
plant they come flying out you're just

663
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,859
sucking them up as they come out that's

664
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,359
one good way to get rid of them you're

665
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:14,099
going to suck up a bunch into the vacuum

666
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,418
if you've got the shop vac with the

667
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,038
filter bag in there I recommend that

668
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:19,320
because they're tiny uh you want to

669
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,419
catch the little [ __ ] so defoliate

670
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:22,740
shop vac a bunch of them off then at

671
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,380
this point this is what I wouldn't

672
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:28,079
consider when I would consider a foliar

673
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:30,179
application of a product called Monterey

674
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,158
Garden spray I usually don't recommend

675
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:35,640
specific products nobody pays me for

676
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,340
this this is the product to use for this

677
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:42,000
um there is a beneficial bacteria in

678
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:44,099
Monterey Garden spray I call it BT it

679
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,319
may be pronounced bacillus thuringisis

680
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:47,819
or something similar to that I'm not the

681
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,500
best guy at pronouncing [ __ ] but I can

682
00:22:47,819 --> 00:22:51,899
read well I can see it on the paper I

683
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,579
recognize it that ingredient and that

684
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,919
product is going to eliminate the white

685
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,599
flies it a fungus it is a fungus that

686
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,580
occurs and they bought in the bottom of

687
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,439
rum barrels and they've learned how to

688
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:02,819
make a pesticide out of that we apply

689
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,980
that to the plants it is basically

690
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:07,019
harmless to the plants but the white

691
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,759
flies they want nothing to do with it so

692
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:11,038
that BT will get rid of the white flies

693
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:13,798
the that will also slow down your fungus

694
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,019
gnats now let's focus more on the fungus

695
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:17,519
gnat and the white fly combination let's

696
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:19,679
say you got both of these bad [ __ ]

697
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,058
attacking the garden the white flies

698
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,919
like I mentioned are going to stay

699
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:23,940
mainly on the foliage they may go a

700
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:25,440
little bit into your dirt but they're

701
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:27,538
going to stay mostly on the foliage

702
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,400
mostly on the underside of the leaves

703
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:31,440
the fungus gnats are going to burrow

704
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,419
down into the soil so the fungus gnats

705
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,460
are going to be down in your roots so to

706
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,320
take care of them we need to do more

707
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,840
than just spraying a foliar application

708
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:42,119
we may need to do what is called a soil

709
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,798
dredge that is where you take an amount

710
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:46,319
of water how much you ever water your

711
00:23:43,798 --> 00:23:48,720
plants usually mix up that much water

712
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:51,619
get that much water and to that mix of

713
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:55,019
water we are going to add 15 to 30

714
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:57,479
milliliters per gallon of Evergreen

715
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:59,819
pyrethrum spray the product is called

716
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,500
Evergreen it's mainly pyrethrum based

717
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:03,839
it's a very good product for getting rid

718
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,339
of fungus gnats white flies and most of

719
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:07,259
your basic common pests in the garden

720
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:08,939
honestly this is one of my go-to

721
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:11,640
pesticides one of my most recommended

722
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,740
pesticides it is simply called Evergreen

723
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,140
in my opinion it's affordable and it's

724
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:17,940
very effective and it is also approved

725
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,740
by the Colorado Department of

726
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,360
Agriculture the Colorado Department of

727
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:23,159
Public Health and environment and the

728
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:26,099
Colorado marijuana enforcement division

729
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:27,900
so the product is called Evergreen I

730
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,879
would mix up the water and I would water

731
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,880
the plants with the Evergreen solution

732
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,059
again somewhere between 15 and 30

733
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:38,760
milliliters of Evergreen per gallon of

734
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:40,259
water 15 to 30 per gallon so you're

735
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,058
going to mix up that water and water it

736
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:43,798
right through the plants this will

737
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:45,178
stress the root zone of your plants the

738
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:47,639
plants will show you that they were a

739
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:49,620
little bit bothered by this but one

740
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,020
maybe two applications of this will get

741
00:24:49,619 --> 00:24:55,500
rid of your soil-borne pests most of

742
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:58,619
anything in that soil will go away

743
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,900
so depending on the level of the

744
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:02,819
infestation and the strength of your

745
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,380
plants that would help me determine how

746
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:07,139
much of this product to put in the water

747
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,240
somewhere between 15 and 30 mils if the

748
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:11,340
bugs are real bad you want that 30 mils

749
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,259
but if the roots aren't super strong go

750
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,538
closer to 15 milliliters you can figure

751
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:18,658
this one out mix that up water the

752
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:20,640
plants then wait a couple of days then

753
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,380
water it again with this same solution

754
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,179
do it again if they didn't look too beat

755
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,500
up the first time do it again if they

756
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:27,480
got the [ __ ] beat out of them on the

757
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,400
first try maybe wait on this but then

758
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,798
water them again with the same solution

759
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,080
that second application should knock out

760
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:36,359
all of the root-borne problems then

761
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,460
after that I recommend watering with a

762
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,019
really nice mix of nutrients and put a

763
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,179
bunch of microbes in there to resupply

764
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:44,220
the microbes to that rhizosphere get

765
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,960
everything back in action in that pot

766
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,400
the bugs are gone let's get the roots

767
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,798
banging let's get the roots healthy

768
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,200
again now while I'm doing these root

769
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:54,240
dredges I would also do a foliar

770
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,400
application of either the Monterey

771
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,339
Garden spray or the ever green let's hit

772
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,860
the top and the bottom if we just soak

773
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:03,658
the soil or the cocoa or whatever the

774
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:05,278
plants are in the bugs are going to go

775
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,080
up and hang out on the leaves and fly

776
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,778
around and just go other places and then

777
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:11,579
when all that [ __ ] dries they'll go back

778
00:26:09,778 --> 00:26:13,740
we got to hit the foliage too so there's

779
00:26:11,579 --> 00:26:15,960
nowhere for these bugs to go hit the

780
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:18,120
foliage with the Evergreen hit the soil

781
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,919
with the Evergreen I would do the foliar

782
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,599
spray and the dredge on the first day

783
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,159
and then wait two or three days maybe

784
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:25,980
four days depending on your wet and dry

785
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,480
cycles and do it all over again now all

786
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:29,759
the bugs should be gone with those two

787
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,038
applications if it is fungus gnats and

788
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,419
or white flies other pests may have a

789
00:26:32,038 --> 00:26:35,759
little more resistance but that should

790
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:38,278
bang out your problem so really quickly

791
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,859
if it's fungus gnats then we're going to

792
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:42,720
use Evergreen at 15 to 30 milliliters

793
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,000
per gallon we're going to do a soil

794
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,980
dredge and to foliar application then

795
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,259
we're going to wait uh three maybe five

796
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,620
days and repeat the process if it is

797
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,599
only white flies let's just spray

798
00:26:51,619 --> 00:26:56,639
frequently with the BT of the Monterey

799
00:26:54,599 --> 00:26:59,158
Garden spray with the bacillus during

800
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,799
Genesis in there let's hit that like day

801
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:03,299
one day three day six and then we'll

802
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:05,220
wait and see how they look maybe do it

803
00:27:03,298 --> 00:27:07,079
again on day 10 but they should be going

804
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,120
away by then if not you've got a bigger

805
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:11,038
problem than I realized uh we've got to

806
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:12,658
get in there and make take some nuclear

807
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:15,599
measures or perhaps start thinking about

808
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:17,640
letting go some of those Predator bugs

809
00:27:15,599 --> 00:27:19,678
there are plenty of Predator bugs that

810
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,960
will get in there and destroy your

811
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,759
fungus gnats and your white flies all

812
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,100
right my friend Zach J I think I

813
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,619
answered most of your question on my

814
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:30,899
notes here it says Ah bacillus thuring

815
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:33,839
Genesis from Monterey Garden spray or

816
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:35,880
Evergreen stop over watering shop vac

817
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:37,079
another thing I wrote down was yellow

818
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,000
cards

819
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:41,339
I'd recommend putting some yellow sticky

820
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,200
traps in the garden some at soil level

821
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:44,939
some right below the bottom of the

822
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,798
canopy and some at the top of the canopy

823
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,200
that will help you identify the presence

824
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,179
of pests those yellow sticky traps are

825
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,519
not there to eradicate bugs in any way

826
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:54,960
they are there to alert and indicate the

827
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,720
presence of pests that will let you

828
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,700
monitor your progress in your battle if

829
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,259
there are more there uh yesterday than

830
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,058
there are today you're making progress

831
00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:05,099
if there's more there tomorrow than

832
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:07,139
there were today they're making progress

833
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:08,879
so you've got to adjust your uh your

834
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,919
measures based on the progress which you

835
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,600
and those bugs are making it's a battle

836
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:13,620
and I wish you the best of luck you're

837
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:16,259
gonna win bro because you've got

838
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:18,719

00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:19,859
