www.ctvn.org

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:35,729
the package the flavor is described as

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,590
tropical fruit cocktail I would totally

11
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:39,449
agree with the tropical fruit cocktail

12
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,550
there's also something real Jolly

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,020
Rancher and kind of sweet candy flavored

14
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:44,878
in there it really sticks around on your

15
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,219
mouth for a long time and it makes the

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,409
room smell amazing after you smoke some

17
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,179
dabs I left the room I came back and it

18
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,159
smelled amazing in here so I'm really

19
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,289
enjoying the mai tai full spectrum

20
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,628
extract from Green Dot labs on the back

21
00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,989
it says it contains sixty five point

22
00:00:57,628 --> 00:01:03,058
four one percent total THC all right

23
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:06,090
podcast world I am recording on a cold

24
00:01:03,058 --> 00:01:07,978
April evening if you hear some smacking

25
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:09,540
noises or some weird random noises in

26
00:01:07,978 --> 00:01:11,879
the background that is because we are

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,118
currently experiencing a windstorm that

28
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,228
is including small bursts of hail so if

29
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,390
you hear weird noises in the background

30
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:20,549
hopefully that is just the wind and the

31
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,159
hail beating against the side of my

32
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,900
house I really hope all of this weather

33
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,150
passes and clears up quickly because

34
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,520
this weekend is the weekend of the dude

35
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,560

Rasta fist bump to Remy redeye and a big

70
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,600
grove from your heart thank you to my

71
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,090
friend Full Monty

72
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,210
all right podcast world a few episodes

73
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,680
back I talked about using co2 in your

74
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:55,200
garden and somebody asked if I

75
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,689
recommended or suggested turning off or

76
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,849
reducing co2 late in Flour

77
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:03,689
or at some point in the flowering phase

78
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:06,210
I recommended to use co2 throughout the

79
00:03:03,689 --> 00:03:08,219
entire grow cycle as soon as you can

80
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:09,990
start using it start using it and use it

81
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,810
and increase it all the way up to

82
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:14,939
harvest time I received a comment on my

83
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,580
youtube video from a viewer and the

84
00:03:14,939 --> 00:03:19,650
comment goes like this they said hey

85
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,380
Rasta Jeff thank you for all you do I

86
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,420
think the guy asking about stopping co2

87
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,669
and flower was talking about comments

88
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,309
from ocean grown seeds a few of their

89
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:32,429
breeders strongly recommend stopping co2

90
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:34,920
at week six a flower to avoid too much

91
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,750
leaf production what are your thoughts I

92
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:38,819
would love to know and that's from a

93
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:41,400
friend on YouTube I don't know if they

94
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,319
want their name said on the show however

95
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,760
if you scroll and troll the YouTube

96
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,489
channel long enough you will find their

97
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:49,530
comment and you will know who they are

98
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:51,090
so I am going to completely disagree

99
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,709
with the recommendation of another

100
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,500
breeder however I'm going to do it

101
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:57,420
completely respectfully I don't know the

102
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,550
rest of their grow tactics we are not

103
00:03:57,419 --> 00:04:01,469
doing everything the same we are

104
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:04,110
probably doing everything completely

105
00:04:01,469 --> 00:04:05,639
differently growing has a lot of freedom

106
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,780
there are a lot of options there are a

107
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:09,208
lot of methods there are a lot of

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,060
techniques and tactics and many of them

109
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,949
will work I've said before the only way

110
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,500
you're doing it wrong is if the plants

111
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,569
die or if you are not happy with the

112
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,430
final outcome I've got nothing but love

113
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:21,988
and respect for the folks over at ocean

114
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,220
grown seeds I don't know what they're

115
00:04:21,988 --> 00:04:23,879
doing I don't know they're growing

116
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,729
method

117
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:29,699
it sounds like they may recommend that

118
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:32,728
we stop using co2 around week six I

119
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:34,379
respectfully disagree they recommend to

120
00:04:32,728 --> 00:04:37,500
stop doing it because it produces too

121
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,269
much leaf I am known for defoliating

122
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,819
quite heavily throughout the entire

123
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:43,859
flowering process so creating too much

124
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:46,800
leaf is not really a problem for me I

125
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:48,090
like to go in and D foliate I really

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,680
like spending time in the garden doing

127
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,899
that I've got a crew that does it in a

128
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,280
large facility so too much leaf is

129
00:04:51,899 --> 00:04:55,409
really not an issue for me I'm

130
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,569
defoliating anyway I'm in there taking

131
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,919
out leaves to increase light penetration

132
00:04:57,569 --> 00:05:01,050
I'm in they're taking out leaves to

133
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:02,879
increase airflow I'm in there taking out

134
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,439
leaves just to minimize the amount of

135
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,050
leaf in the room when it comes time to

136
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,569
harvest it helps with respiration and

137
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:11,280
transpiration it helps keep the VPD in

138
00:05:09,569 --> 00:05:13,889
line I just think it's very advantageous

139
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,199
to defoliate heavily throughout the

140
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,029
flowering period anyway so we grow

141
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:19,889
differently I'm not disrespecting them

142
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:21,629
I'm not arguing with that company I'm

143
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:22,769
just saying we do it differently that is

144
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,899
not how I do it

145
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:26,579
I feel that you may get a lot of leaf

146
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,918
development if you're using a lot of co2

147
00:05:26,579 --> 00:05:31,259
and certain nutrients I haven't seen

148
00:05:28,918 --> 00:05:33,299
that also you get a lot of blood

149
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,550
development so I think it is worth it I

150
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,710
think it's a positive trade-off I do it

151
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,300
differently I'm not disrespecting

152
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:41,549
anybody again I completely respect

153
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,620
everybody's grow method as long as it is

154
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,810
working for you however that is not the

155
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,490
way I do it so if you're following my

156
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,348
grow method if you're using all of my

157
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,660
grow methods and techniques and lessons

158
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:52,978
I would recommend continuing the co2 if

159
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,930
you want to grow with the way the other

160
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:57,060
guys taught you do that if it works for

161
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:59,189
you do that do what works for you and

162
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,410
makes you happy or try to make a hybrid

163
00:05:59,189 --> 00:06:03,329
of all of the above as long as it works

164
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,919
out the plants are the boss as long as

165
00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:05,939
the plants are happy and as long as you

166
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:08,279
were happy with the final outcome

167
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:10,079
everything is working but that other

168
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:12,719
company and myself we just do it

169
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,250
differently no hatred no animosity just

170
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,599
different things like I said earlier

171
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:17,519
different bands playing different songs

172
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,500
so that's my answer to that YouTube

173
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,659
question hey thank you for the great

174
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:23,160
YouTube question I do like answering the

175
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,410
YouTube comments however it would be

176
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,020
easier for myself and it would probably

177
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:30,270
be more beneficial for you and more

178
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:31,918
likely to get your question answered and

179
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:34,948

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,408

183

five-star rating so far most folks have

224
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,189
left a five-star rating I'm looking on

225
00:08:03,629 --> 00:08:06,479
my phone so I can't see the exact amount

226
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:08,218
of stars it shows me that at least one

227
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,288
or two people have left a one and a four

228
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:12,509
star rating which is just fine with me I

229
00:08:10,288 --> 00:08:14,728
am not for everybody I encourage you to

230
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,559
leave the amount of stars which you feel

231
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:18,688
I deserve after that type in a little

232
00:08:16,559 --> 00:08:21,269
comment and let everybody know what you

233
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:23,579
think about the podcast I'm going to

234
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:25,559
read some recent reviews for the show

235
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,788
let's start with this one it comes from

236
00:08:25,559 --> 00:08:29,429
somebody who calls himself

237
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:32,519
Darth Knight 3 this was left on February

238
00:08:29,428 --> 00:08:34,588
28th the headline is the cannabis

239
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:37,799
content I've been craving and the review

240
00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:39,509
goes a little bit like this I am

241
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:41,908
planning my first grow it was very

242
00:08:39,509 --> 00:08:43,769
excited to find this show and it is no

243
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:45,990
disappointment jeff paints a vivid

244
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:48,720
picture and has a passion for educating

245
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:51,269
people in all aspects of cannabis mike

246
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,670
is awesome he sounds kind of like Joe

247
00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:54,389
Rogan in my opinion this show is so good

248
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:56,159
we

249
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:59,340
let the podcast play over the shop

250
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:01,980
stereo for hours while we work I love

251
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,170
this show man that is a great message

252
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,909
I'm glad that you found us while you're

253
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,799
planning your first grow I hope you have

254
00:09:05,909 --> 00:09:10,230
checked out the grow lessons I hope

255
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:12,359

256
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,129
you think I paint a vivid picture and

257
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,230
I'm glad that you can see my passion for

258
00:09:14,129 --> 00:09:17,279
educating and my passion for canvas it

259
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:19,259
means a lot to me

260
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,600
cannabis means a lot and I want to

261
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,250
dispel all of the rumors about cannabis

262
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,870
and I want people to just do the best

263
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,399
with cannabis put it in the best light

264
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,929
so I'm glad that you see that and thank

265
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,269

thanks for noticing that and then you

272
00:09:38,789 --> 00:09:42,389
say he sounds like Joe Rogan in your

273
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:44,700
opinion you probably mean mic because I

274
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,679
don't think I sound like Rogan but to

275
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,300
have somebody on the show called like

276
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,859
Rogan you got the word Rogan in there

277
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:51,689
that's always a compliment to us so

278
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,220
thank you for that the show is so good

279
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,350
you just let it play over the shop

280
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:57,240
stereo that is awesome I'm curious what

281
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,830
kind of shop you've got is it a retail

282
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,480
shop is it where you're working are

283
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,920
there more people walking in and being

284
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,269
exposed to the show as you're listening

285
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,069
to it I'm just curious

286
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,230
my mind gets curious when you say you're

287
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:09,090
playing it in a public area makes me

288
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,680
want to know who's listening but man I'm

289
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:12,360
glad more people are being exposed I'm

290
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,909
glad you're playing it and most of all

291
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,680

296
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:26,699
the next one this next one comes from a

297
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:28,740
person who calls themselves willies

298
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,780
armpit what's up willies armpit I love

299
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,389
that name for some reason the headline

300
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,639
says bad memories let's read this it

301
00:10:33,389 --> 00:10:37,620
says love the podcast very informative

302
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,960
with easy-to-follow descriptions

303
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:42,960
absolutely love the idea of having all

304
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,490
the past episodes to refer to in 87 I

305
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:47,070
tried my first indoor girl with

306
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:49,860
absolutely no idea what I was doing what

307
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,000
a miserable failure it was isn't it so

308
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,230
much easier now that we've got the

309
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,720
Internet and a little bit of guidance

310
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,909
I'm so glad I can help you out the

311
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,980
review keeps going and says if I only if

312
00:10:56,909 --> 00:11:00,389
only I had someone like Ross to Jeff I

313
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,190
could have listened to every Monday and

314
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:05,399
Thursday I might not have wasted those

315
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,990
huge watermelon sized skunk seeds oh I

316
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,860
bet those were great I'm sorry we wasted

317
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,720
those but

318
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:12,240
we've got more seeds don't worry he goes

319
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,370
on to say it was the nastiest skunk

320
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,320
smell losing from the bags at that time

321
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,210
four years in Florida you could not

322
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,190
count on the skunk bud between or you

323
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,070
could count on the skunk bud between

324
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,480
October and December like clockwork

325
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:26,040
deliciously nasty skunk bud you're

326
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,300
making my mouth water every time you say

327
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:29,069
that you were in love with that skunk

328
00:11:27,299 --> 00:11:30,689
but and I think my taste buds and my

329
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,270
nose are into that why do we love the

330
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:34,920
most disgusting like the worst aromas

331
00:11:33,269 --> 00:11:36,149
are really the best when it comes to

332
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:38,129
cannabis you like it kind of smells like

333
00:11:36,149 --> 00:11:39,809
puke and skunk and dirty feet and like

334
00:11:38,129 --> 00:11:42,149
cool I'll take two please it's really

335
00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:44,279
strange they were like that the review

336
00:11:42,149 --> 00:11:46,230
continues it says never to be smelled

337
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,789
again now I'm heartbroken I just built

338
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:49,830
myself up to get my heart broke and

339
00:11:47,789 --> 00:11:51,389
that's miserable then it says what I

340
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,930
would give for another try at those

341
00:11:51,389 --> 00:11:55,169
seeds

342
00:11:51,929 --> 00:11:57,000
damn it man bad memories well if you're

343
00:11:55,169 --> 00:11:58,229
a seed shopper if you were into shopping

344
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,879
for seeds on the internet I would

345
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,629
recommend you find something called road

346
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,519
kill

347
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:04,710
skunk if you can find some good roadkill

348
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,879
skunk they'll be hard to find they may

349
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:07,410
not be available on a lot of the

350
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:09,659
commercial websites but if you can find

351
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:12,089
some of the rks grow that out you may

352
00:12:09,659 --> 00:12:13,889
get some of that old nasty disgusting

353
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,950
delicious skunk smell that you're

354
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,840
talking about I am sorry and you're

355
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,250
welcome that I'm bringing back terrible

356
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,350
memories of your failed to grow

357
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,850
experience but now that you've got me

358
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:25,740
around now that you've got the Internet

359
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,620
hopefully we can fix that hopefully your

360
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:30,240
next grow is top-notch hopefully we can

361
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,070
put some fresh new memories in your head

362
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,810
and wipe out that old memory or maybe

363
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,370
you can compare the two we'll leave them

364
00:12:33,809 --> 00:12:36,659
both in there you probably smoked enough

365
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:38,580
to wear that old memory is kind of hazy

366
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:39,929
anyway so let's get you growing some new

367
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:41,220
stuff you've got some girl lessons

368
00:12:39,929 --> 00:12:42,569

369
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,279
some good advice and I'll answer your

370
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:45,629
questions so let's get you growing let's

00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:48,899
look at the new harvest and then you can

373
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:51,240
try to remember back on that old one and

374
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:52,679
you can just feel proud inside for how

375
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,080
much you've improved and how much you've

376
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:56,849
learned and how far you've come and well

392
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:29,528
review goes like this most informative

393
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,759
and entertaining gross show ever I

394
00:13:29,528 --> 00:13:31,929
should just stop reading right there oh

395
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,299
no I should keep going because it says

396
00:13:31,929 --> 00:13:36,578
Rasta Jeff is my hero man that is the

397
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:37,990
coolest review ever most informative I

398
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:40,149
like that you didn't say best because

399
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:42,220
best is a relative term I like that you

400
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:44,110
feel I am the most informative as well

401
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,389
as the most entertaining that means a

402
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:47,980
lot to me thank you being your hero is

403
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:49,389
kind of a lot of pressure and you need

404
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,769
better heroes but thank you that is a

405
00:13:49,389 --> 00:13:52,149
great compliment I'm just trying to play

406
00:13:50,769 --> 00:13:54,039

407
00:13:52,149 --> 00:13:56,559

somebody who is our senior and I've got

416

449

the review goes like this fantastic

471
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:12,818
content specific actionable and clear I

472
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:13,929
think those were the exact goals so

473
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:16,599
thank you I appreciate that

474
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:18,998
I love how Jeff doesn't babble in tribal

475
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,459
knowledge and bro science well I

476
00:16:18,999 --> 00:16:23,319
appreciate that sometimes I try to make

477
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:25,748
things understandable for everybody and

478
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,429
I'm glad it doesn't seem like I'm bro

479
00:16:25,749 --> 00:16:29,740
sciencing things when I do that I want

480
00:16:27,429 --> 00:16:31,359
everybody to be able to to enjoy and

481
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,009
appreciate the show I want everybody to

482
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,709
be able to learn from the show people

483
00:16:33,009 --> 00:16:37,089
who are thinking about buying grow set

484
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,859
up and people that have been running

485
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:40,990
commercial facilities I want them both

486
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:43,028
to be entertained so sometimes I do have

487
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,500
to take a huge concept and kind of make

488
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:46,028
it a little simplified for the new

489
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,769
people to figure it out but I also have

490
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:49,480
to stay entertaining for the people have

this one comes from a friend who calls

530
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,880
himself Charlie Moody the title of the

531
00:18:10,808 --> 00:18:15,369
review is really enjoying this and of

532
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,380
course we got another five-star rating

533
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:20,048
the review goes like this

534
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:21,400
I started where did it go the screen

535
00:18:20,048 --> 00:18:23,500
move there we go I started with the

536
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,150
planning your grow episode when I got to

537
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,750
the repeats I went back to the early

538
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,269
hundreds

539
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:30,400
I just finished number 161 man you've

540
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:31,750
heard a lot of content and I think you

541
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,730
did very well by starting with the

542
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:36,369
planning your grow episode and your all

543
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:38,048
the way back to 161 that is crazy you

544
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:39,909
have listened to a lot of content he

545
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:42,308
goes on to say I appreciate the detail

546
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,340
the wealth of experience and the good

547
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:47,048
humor I love that and all of the reviews

548
00:18:45,339 --> 00:18:49,000
every time I read a Bachelor of reviews

549
00:18:47,048 --> 00:18:51,009
there's always one person that mentions

550
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,839
the attempt at humor I'm glad that

551
00:18:51,009 --> 00:18:55,929
somebody enjoys it I try to have fun

552
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:58,389
with this I did not have fun in school I

553
00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,940
loved learning but I did not like

554
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,580
sitting somewhere for eight hours being

555
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:05,919
told that I can't tap my foot or that I

556
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:07,418
can't just stare off into space yeah I'm

557
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,770
listening I'm just staring off into

558
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:10,330
space because that's how my brain

559
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:11,500
absorbs stuff they want me to look at

560
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:13,629
the teacher I just didn't like being

561
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,369
there I had teachers that were

562
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:18,429
entertaining I had teachers that told me

563
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:20,678
jokes those are the classes that I chose

564
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:21,820
to go to more frequently later on in my

565
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:24,070
school career there were a lot of

566
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:27,069
classes I would skip because the teacher

567
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:28,750
was not enjoyable I hated that class I

568
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:30,369
just wouldn't go if the teacher was

569
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:32,079
better if he was funny if she was funny

570
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:33,819
I had much more of a chance of going to

571
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,069
that class so I try to teach with a

572
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:37,418
little bit of humor I think I think it

573
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:38,918
makes everything stick a little bit

574
00:19:37,419 --> 00:19:40,690
better I fill you up with a whole bunch

575
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:42,040
of knowledge and then I just seal it in

576
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:43,330
there with a joke so that it you kind of

577
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:44,889
whole bunch of stuff whole bunch of

578
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:46,869
stuff and then a joke so it doesn't feel

579
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:48,700
stressful normal learning can be kind of

580
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:50,048
stressful trying to cram a bunch of

581
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,370
stuff into your brain can kind of be

582
00:19:50,048 --> 00:19:53,918
stressful and overwhelming sometimes

583
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:55,209
then if you tell a joke at the end wash

584
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,470
it off with a little bit of laughter

585
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,029
hopefully a lot of that knowledge

586
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:59,890
retains and then it doesn't feel

587
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:01,509
stressful at the end of the lesson so

588
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:02,710
I'm glad you enjoy my attempt at humor

589
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,250
and I want to give you a big thank you

590
