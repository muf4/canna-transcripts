i'm smoking today I've been taking dad's

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,080
of Wi-Fi and Broza from apothecary farms

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,939
I picked this up at the Pueblo location

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,339
the label says it is eighty two point

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,590
five percent THC with the total of

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,930
ninety five point seven percent total

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,180
cannabinoids I really enjoy this

16
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:41,670
concentrate I generally like to buy a

17
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:43,320
concentrate they lifts me up it makes my

18
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,289
head kind of spin it makes me super high

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,789
this Wi-Fi is the exact opposite this

20
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,890
was like a punch in the face and made me

21
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,390
sit back in the chair made my eyes super

22
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,878
heavy it made my body nice and heavy

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,649
this is some chilling out medicine this

24
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,718
is some nighttime medicines is probably

25
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,759
if you've got some super heavy pain this

26
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,899
would probably knock your pain out if

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,849
you're just trying to get nice and

28
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,890
stoned and nice and mellow this would be

29
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:07,320
a perfect get stoned and sink into the

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,719
couch kind of concentrate so big up to

31
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:11,938

night so I left the microphones on we

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,900

40

52
00:01:51,629 --> 00:01:55,259
checks on my Instagram live feeds he

53
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,640
sends me some emails he's a really good

54
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,049
supporter of the girl from her podcast

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,269
he's on the Huayra army he asked us what

56
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,880

57
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:07,590
cannabis legalization in his area he's

58
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,859

me anonymity anonymity say thank you

61
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:17,608
I've never tried to say that I did not I

62
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:19,828
didn't snap a picture of the comment

63
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:21,748
because it was an Instagram live but it

64
00:02:19,829 --> 00:02:24,510
was something the effect of how do I

65
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:27,299
keep the corporate suit and tie job in a

66
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:30,358
prohibition state and still fight to

67
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:32,700
legalize cannabis yes and the answer is

68
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:36,840
very carefully

69
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:43,949
I I've been where you are now

70
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:46,169
and I remember being in it started

71
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:49,339
oddly enough I pulled the [ __ ] topic

72
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:52,500
out of the Hat in seventh grade debate

73
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:53,789
we did this the class project where you

74
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,459
write down the top I can throw it in the

75
00:02:53,789 --> 00:02:58,560
Hat and then you pull out the topic and

76
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:00,438
you pull you have to [ __ ] debate

77
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,639
whatever side of the argument you pull

78
00:03:00,438 --> 00:03:04,289
all that I'm Devon he's gonna take a

79
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,989
damp I was just about that so you had

80
00:03:04,289 --> 00:03:09,000
debate class in school and was cannabis

81
00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:12,180
you're not cannabis was the subject that

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,370
you had to debate worse ok worse I had

83
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,870
to I had to be the the pro used

84
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,539
marijuana while you're pregnant

85
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,188
that was that was my argument that's a

86
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:21,418
whole nother podcast I tried to get some

87
00:03:20,188 --> 00:03:23,008
ladies to come on the show and talk

88
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,239
about that and nobody wanted to come on

89
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,078
the show so hey ladies if you're out

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,250
there and you'd like to be on a podcast

91
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,079
talk about using cannabis during

92
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:29,609
pregnancy pros and cons I like to find

93
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:32,009
one lady who was Pro while lady was con

94
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:33,540
then maybe with some medical profession

95
00:03:32,008 --> 00:03:36,358
they could come on to talk about that

96
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,769
well maybe uh that OBGYN is that who I

97
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:39,419
need to talk about that the pregnancy

98
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:41,310
doctor you wanted them to come on tell

99
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:43,739
me what you think they're gonna say no

100
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:45,780
but still want their presence just for

101
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:46,919
their voice you'll CNN then every time

102
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,329
they get John I'll just turn them their

103
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:50,340
[ __ ] mind but like I do when Mike's

104
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:52,049
coffin just like that just shut off his

105
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,549
mic there we go like I'm trying to

106
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:55,049
ramble on cuz you're purple and your

107
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:56,819
sweaty and you're coughing but

108
00:03:55,049 --> 00:03:57,989
eventually the listeners are gonna catch

109
00:03:56,818 --> 00:04:07,560
on that I'm just [ __ ] talking out of

110
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:10,199
my ass so that you can cost a couple

111
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:15,049
seconds ago oh how do for our friend how

112
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:18,239
do so brought this story up is because

113
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:19,620
I've been forced to debate this topic

114
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:26,218
since long before I was comfortable with

115
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,620
it so take your time bro take your time

116
00:04:26,218 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm just trolling

117
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,500
like it wasn't a totally high story the

118
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,509
dab came at a bad time he's really

119
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,170
purple he's really as purple that was a

120
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:38,849
little bad - I'm sorry it was a I was

121
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:40,110
worried about it being too cold because

122
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,050
I've kind of gunked-up the nee of the

123
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:49,230
night doing too cold went a little hot

124
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:51,540
but that first experience with debating

125
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:56,370
cannabis taught me a couple of really

126
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:57,960
useful things one the real trick to

127
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,939
debating any topic is doing your

128
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,539
research

129
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:05,879
- if you take a controversial topic and

130
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,100
decide to stand up and talk about it be

131
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:08,579
prepared to get a lot of people laughing

132
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,220
at you

133
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:14,069
and that's just something that you have

134
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,870
to take from the first like there's a

135
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:17,159
famous quote I don't I think it's gone -

136
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,439
you're something that's like first they

137
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,790
laugh at you like first they ignore you

138
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,769
then they laugh at you then they fight

139
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:24,689
you then you win

140
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:31,079
but like the laughing is a long time

141
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:33,269
usually and if you go back to like and

142
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:38,810
there will always be lappers well for

143
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:44,240
sure but if you go back to like 96 98

144
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:47,399
2000 and look at how cannabis advocates

145
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,780
even advocates from like the National

146
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:52,199
Organization for the Reform of Marijuana

147
00:05:48,779 --> 00:05:55,500
Laws normal when they're heavy-hitting

148
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:57,379
lawyers would go give press releases or

149
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,790
put out statements or talk to the press

150
00:05:57,379 --> 00:06:02,668
the anchor would be laughing in their

151
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:05,040
face and it's like this is a lawyer they

152
00:06:02,668 --> 00:06:06,599
have a degree from a good university

153
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,390
they have 20 years experience in our

154
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:12,960
field this is an educated informed

155
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:14,668
opinion you're just laughing at them but

156
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,000
we've passed that point in history now

157
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:21,120
so even if like as long as you're in the

158
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,829
US this is true depending on which

159
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,259
country you're listening from this might

160
00:06:22,829 --> 00:06:28,139
not be very true for you hopefully it's

161
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:32,009
truer than it was ten years ago

162
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:34,889
but as far as the u.s. goes if you start

163
00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:38,189
talking about pro-legalization topics in

164
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:39,659
an informed manner you're not going to

165
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:44,610
get met with laughter and

166
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:47,189
more you'll still get ignored and people

167
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:50,009
will fight you but the laughter is

168
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:52,829
pretty much gone and that's because a

169
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:55,349
lot of what's not funny

170
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:59,819
has been made abundantly clear over time

171
00:06:55,350 --> 00:07:01,530
the disparities and arrest rates what

172
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:07,829
the black market is capable of doing

173
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:09,409
with 30 or 40 billion a year it's an

174
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:13,229
amount of money that's almost

175
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:14,730
inconceivable there's a good meme going

176
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:16,410
around that's like the difference

177
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,200
between a million seconds in a billion

178
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,990
seconds like one's like 11 hours and the

179
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,399
other ones like 30 days like I got all

180
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,680
of those numbers wrong but if you look

181
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:28,289
it up the disparity is huge

182
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:33,389
and it's it's so big that most people

183
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:35,160
don't understand how big it is and that

184
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,409
amount of money in the black market like

185
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,570
the cosmetics industry all make ups only

186
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:43,860
35 billion it's huge and all of that's

187
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:48,120
underground and the amount of people

188
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:51,150
that employ is the amount of disputes

189
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,850
that creates the amount of taxes that

190
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:55,469
could get paid on all that like all of

191
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:58,200
those are things that people kind of

192
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,760
understand at least a little bit now and

193
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,039
I started doing this none of that should

194
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,439
exist it we do not have the seem to sail

195
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:07,500
model we didn't have any nothing you

196
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:09,689
have examples yeah when we were talking

197
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,879
about legalizing marijuana five six

198
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,850
years ago here in Colorado people were

199
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:17,009
like what does that look like blank

200
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,740
stares were all anyone had I mean anyone

201
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:22,469
in the room the Moses model we had was

202
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,970
the medical marijuana dispensary models

203
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,340
that were starting here and in

204
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,260
California well one of the biggest

205
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:33,299
problems Kali's had this year is they

206
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:37,468
ignored their medical market from 96 to

207
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:39,929
late 2015 and in all that time the

208
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:43,710
market didn't ignore it itself

209
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:46,500
it grew evolved changed fell apart got

210
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,780
raided rebuilt itself countless times

211
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,330
and now that they finally has tried to

212
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,939
settle down and regulate and license

213
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:56,040
this whole kind of giant monster that

214
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,890
they've ignored for twenty years it's

215
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:01,139
nearly impossible with all the

216
00:08:58,889 --> 00:09:02,460
grandfathering in and you know how can

217
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,960
this place not meet the new rules

218
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,639
they've been open for twenty years

219
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,560
the Mayor was there ribbon cutting we

220
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,840
love these people how can they be

221
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:11,129
illegal now right there's a lot of that

222
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,370
right now and it all has to do is get

223
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:16,320
just ignoring it and so the upside for

224
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:21,179
people still living in prohibition land

225
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:24,570
is by now even in places like Arkansas

226
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:27,479
Texas Tennessee Virginia there are

227
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,470
already legislature members of the

228
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,570
legislature the state Senate governors

229
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:36,840
City Council people actively talking

230
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:39,240
about marijuana legalization even the

231
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,350
ones that are against it are currently

232
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:45,930
thinking about if it happens anyway how

233
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:49,529
do we mitigate [ __ ] like duis and tina

234
00:09:45,929 --> 00:09:51,689
access and advertising and stuff like

235
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,159
that and so they're already willing to

236
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,560
have a conversation that they weren't

237
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:57,419
willing to even think about five seven

238
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:59,429
years ago well they know it's coming it

239
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:01,019
was it's gonna happen around them one

240
00:09:59,429 --> 00:10:03,659
day if they're ready for it or not yep

241
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:07,590
the other big upside to this is you're

242
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:10,699
no longer the squeaky wheel like all of

243
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:15,210
the wheels are squeaking 60 to 70%

244
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:17,910
statistically so for someone who has a

245
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:21,389
job that they want to protect or a life

246
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:24,539
they want to protect to send an email to

247
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:26,429
an elected representative to say hi I'm

248
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:28,769
a voter and I would like you to support

249
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:31,829
the legalization of cannabis and one way

250
00:10:28,769 --> 00:10:34,980
or another medical access whatever the

251
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:39,270
topic is in your area to send that email

252
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:42,300
is not opening yourself up to any sort

253
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:45,509
of blowback these people receive a

254
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,219
million emails a month I think that the

255
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:49,139
amount of Correspondence they get from

256
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,090
constituents and people around the

257
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,500
country is just bananas make them

258
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:55,019
another email address if you don't want

259
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,250
to use it's a hundred percent simply not

260
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,919
to create your own

261
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:02,190
yep and it's real easy to make you look

262
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:03,899
like a legitimate human being when

263
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,840
you're not because there's not an

264
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:09,240
investigative portion to sending your

265
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:11,340
governor and email that says vote for

266
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,080
legal cannabis now if you send an email

267
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,879
that's like I'm gonna eat you and you

268
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,070
know tomorrow or I'm gonna have to set

269
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,320
your house on fire or oh you better look

270
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,030
out different [ __ ] story yeah don't

271
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,070
do this a bunch of investigative people

272
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:26,639
that will look into your [ __ ] but if you

273
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,950
send an email that says my state's not

274
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,799
currently looking at legalization anyway

275
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,629
I would love for you to be the elected

276
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:37,679
representative in our area to lead on

277
00:11:33,629 --> 00:11:39,029
this issue or I'd like you to vote for

278
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,609
something that somebody else is

279
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:43,350
proposing you can do all of that without

280
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:46,889
any sort of fear of reprisal at this

281
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:48,570
point and people from all over the

282
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:50,159
country do it like I email people that

283
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:53,070
aren't my elected representative at

284
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:56,519
least twice a month 2019 is going to be

285
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,870
huge for cannabis all sorts of states

286
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,850
that don't have any sort of good

287
00:11:57,870 --> 00:12:02,580
cannabis laws right now they're talking

288
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:04,080
about doing it by the by legislature

289
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,240
because they're scared the public's

290
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,250
gonna do it without them and they want

291
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,350
to get ahead and get out in front of it

292
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:12,840
so there's like already 100 or 200

293
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:14,550
cannabis bills up for debate in the

294
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:17,910
coming year that we know about already

295
00:12:14,549 --> 00:12:19,439
nice I'm so odds are that the person

296
00:12:17,909 --> 00:12:23,159
that asked this question and thousands

297
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,310
like him are in a place where cannabis

298
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:28,169
is already being debated and so joining

299
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:31,549
that conversation through email or a

300
00:12:28,169 --> 00:12:31,549
phone call to your elected

301
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:45,709
representative s your company has

302
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,210
business before the City Council or your

303
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,509
County Commission or whatever governs

304
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:53,460
the area you live in

305
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:55,850
that they don't follow that news so

306
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:58,889
unless you go and make a bunch of noise

307
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:02,029
the odds that anyone outside of that

308
00:12:58,889 --> 00:13:04,500
room hears your message is pretty slim

309
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:07,199
those are televised those are not public

310
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:10,919
TV I wouldn't do that I had a couple of

311
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,370
fun instances where old family friends

312
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:14,699
might

313
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:17,159
ads that live in the next city up the

314
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:20,310
highway would watch our City Council

315
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,019
meetings for some reason in Sami and

316
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:25,529
called him and we're like your kids on

317
00:13:22,019 --> 00:13:26,340
TV and some old people don't have

318
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:28,829
anything to do

319
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:33,000
yeah it's cable access so it is one of

320
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:34,920
the free channels but the odds that your

321
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,789
boss is watching that and that's gonna

322
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:41,279
blow back on you are slimmer the other

323
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:43,889
option there is there's even if you go

324
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,319
talk publicly there isn't in my

325
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:49,379
experience anyone confirming that you're

326
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,570
really Jeff and so you can go sign up is

327
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:53,039
Jeff you can go sign up it's Paul as

328
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:55,590
long as you're not like Elvis Presley

329
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:58,469
pitch like they're not gonna check it

330
00:13:55,590 --> 00:14:00,750
they're not even gonna care um the guy

331
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:02,580
that had to type in the names that would

332
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,549
pop up on the TV screen while you spoke

333
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:07,350
always used to give me [ __ ] because just

334
00:14:05,549 --> 00:14:10,469
out of nervousness I would give another

335
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,450
version of my name every time I went up

336
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:15,300
and so he never knew if I was gonna say

337
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:17,759
my first in my last my first my middle

338
00:14:15,299 --> 00:14:19,469
my last my middle in my last if I was

339
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,059
gonna add the junior it's gonna that's

340
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:22,470
why people are like how many [ __ ]

341
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:24,839
names does Mike Evitts cuz he's a junior

342
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,820
so sometimes throw out the first name

343
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,160
and the last sometimes he skips it and

344
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,810
goes with the middle and the last say

345
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,639
both confuse me the first time you said

346
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:34,529
first the real name I was like wait

347
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,850
you're Oulu it made me laugh there's a

348
00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,579
couple of the people that were trying to

349
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:41,850
fight our local cannabis rate rags

350
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:45,240
really thought I was three people like

351
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,740
they thought there was yeah all of my

352
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,360
different names that I had happened to

353
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,799
use on camera were different people they

354
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,169
were like their brothers they all looked

355
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:53,429
very similar like I think only one of

356
00:14:52,169 --> 00:14:54,209
those got earrings and a different one

357
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:57,059
wears glasses

358
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:59,070
oh you [ __ ] are just bad could I only

359
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:00,629
know two of the names so I'm [ __ ]

360
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:03,980
lost on the third one and it's [ __ ]

361
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:06,389
awesome yeah I was like Mike Michael

362
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:07,620
okay there's a lot of variation the

363
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,879
other guy you had to type in the names

364
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,090
would always kind of give him you look

365
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,159
like like I had it when you walked up I

366
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,889
typed it in though the one you use and

367
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:21,120
now it's different I had two on a fly

368
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:23,460
strike on you mr. pink yeah ba you don't

369
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,528
have to to even really give your legal

370
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:27,028
name there another

371
00:15:25,528 --> 00:15:29,759
and that I've actually had people do in

372
00:15:27,028 --> 00:15:33,629
different campaigns is the official

373
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:37,639
campaign will write a number of op eds

374
00:15:33,629 --> 00:15:40,139
or letters to the editor so like

375
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,669
Charlotte's gonna vote on marijuana and

376
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:43,499
we think you should for these reasons

377
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:45,448
proud of myself I wrote letters to the

378
00:15:43,499 --> 00:15:47,939
editor instead of releasing that letter

379
00:15:45,448 --> 00:15:50,789
to the editor is like from the weed

380
00:15:47,938 --> 00:15:53,308
corporation they have it go out as like

381
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:55,078
from some random person yeah and it

382
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:58,679
appears in the paper is like from Bob

383
00:15:55,078 --> 00:16:01,138
Huxtable and that's just how it prints

384
00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:02,878
up in the paper I see this all the time

385
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:04,829
on all sorts of different topics like

386
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:11,159
I'll I'll know the person that submitted

387
00:16:04,828 --> 00:16:12,448
it or know of them in the language in

388
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:15,600
the article is something that they're

389
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:18,058
not capable of clearly you're submitting

390
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,069
this on behalf of someone else yeah but

391
00:16:18,058 --> 00:16:22,289
that's another thing to feel free to

392
00:16:20,068 --> 00:16:24,088
write in a letter to the editor and you

393
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:27,568
can submit it under whatever name you

394
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:30,000
want make sure your whatever submitting

395
00:16:27,568 --> 00:16:31,438
it on doesn't include your tagline at

396
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,058
the bottom on all your emails because

397
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:39,778
that would be awkward sent from roster

398
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:41,458
Jeff's iPhone right but I mean there's a

399
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:44,610
bunch of different ways you can stay

400
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:47,188
anonymous you can contribute financially

401
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:50,009
to different campaigns dude are you

402
00:16:47,188 --> 00:16:52,500
reading my [ __ ] notes no this is my

403
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:56,610
thunder bro good ways to help the cause

404
00:16:52,500 --> 00:17:00,269
anonymously you can have one-to-one

405
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:02,639
conversations or huge like people would

406
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:05,669
get really offended a couple years back

407
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,529
when the comparison between the the

408
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,990
cannabis legalization movement and the

409
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,908
gay rights movements were being made but

410
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,949
the part of that argument that I always

411
00:17:11,909 --> 00:17:16,409
that always really rang true to me was

412
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:19,279
its the one-to-one conversations with

413
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:22,860
people they really end a lot of the

414
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:25,648
nonsense stigma that society's thrown at

415
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:27,240
the topic and I know personally that

416
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:30,389
sitting down with my anti cannabis

417
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,410
family members and being like hey why do

418
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,800
you care

419
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:37,600
do you see me right you heard like it

420
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:40,149
clearly hasn't ruined my brain it hasn't

421
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:42,309
[ __ ] up my future it hasn't made me

422
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:44,110
anti-social none of the [ __ ] they taught

423
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:47,619
you in school was true it was all alive

424
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:50,849
you can see the lie in motion right now

425
00:17:47,619 --> 00:17:53,379
it's just the the stigma just melts away

426
00:17:50,849 --> 00:18:01,299
and so family members that were

427
00:17:53,380 --> 00:18:04,030
staunchly anti-cannibalism those

428
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:06,309
one-to-one conversations if you're not

429
00:18:04,029 --> 00:18:08,049
really up for those you can always just

430
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:10,629
submit letters to the editor in their

431
00:18:08,049 --> 00:18:14,289
favorite newspaper and newspapers are

432
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:16,930
dying for content and they hate having

433
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:20,200
to pay people for it and so we send them

434
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:22,180
letters for free that take up ad space

435
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,460
as long as you follow whatever one or

436
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,250
two rules they have and your letter it's

437
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,450
not insane they'll print it so if you're

438
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,730
talking about I think we should legalize

439
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:31,990
weed a hundred percent that letter is

440
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,519
gonna get printed as long as you don't

441
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:35,109
use curse words and you stick to their

442
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,000
word limit that's all you got to do

443
00:18:35,109 --> 00:18:38,259
there you go maybe even pass them if

444
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,910
they have a word let me go read some of

445
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:41,740
the articles that do get pretty super

446
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:45,490
easy gonna use that as a template okay

447
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:48,789
so go to any go to any newspaper on

448
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,980
their website click on the opinion

449
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,680
section there will be letters to the

450
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,450
editor tab and there will be an easy tab

451
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,279
that tells you would you like to submit

452
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:58,420
a letter to the editor and if you click

453
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,799
on it tells you everything you need to

454
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:01,509
know some of them even bring up a little

455
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,490
pop-up box for you to write it and

456
00:19:01,509 --> 00:19:05,769
passion to there I'll show you that

457
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:08,410

458
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:10,420
an email email address that you can

459
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,670
submit it to if you do that little box

460
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,009
where it lets you submit it copy it and

461
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:16,750
paste it to a note file and save it and

462
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:21,089
if they don't publish it send it back in

463
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:25,000
a week stay on [ __ ] I always recommend

464
00:19:21,089 --> 00:19:27,159
writing those in a different different

465
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,029
program oh yeah word or Google Docs

466
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:29,590
wherever you're using

467
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:32,349
cuz they'd so that you can spell check

468
00:19:29,589 --> 00:19:34,179
and grammar check and all that thing

469
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:36,339
disappears occasionally your web browser

470
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:38,590
will refresh and your damn writing is

471
00:19:36,339 --> 00:19:40,179
gone but almost all of them have an

472
00:19:38,589 --> 00:19:41,449
email address where you can email their

473
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:44,330
opinion letter editor

474
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:45,860

475
00:19:44,329 --> 00:19:49,399

letters to the editor this week there

481
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:03,350
you go top six off the stack and print

482
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:05,080
them um it might take a couple of weeks

483
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:07,099
but they print a lot of those I've had

484
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:08,298
twenty letters to the editor printed

485
00:20:07,099 --> 00:20:09,980
over my life yeah and I know when

486
00:20:08,298 --> 00:20:13,160
they're you I know when I see them click

487
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:17,450
it and now almost all of those were

488
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:20,120
printed under my name but it's it's

489
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:22,370
really not as difficult or scary as you

490
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,558
think it is and there's a lot options I

491
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:25,819
see the one you've underlined repeatedly

492
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,970
do you want to go ahead and do that one

493
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:30,710
well vote that's the most obvious way

494
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:33,319
you can do your part to help legalize

495
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:35,480
chemistry oh and vote yeah vote that's

496
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:38,359
I've learned over the past few years I

497
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,160
think you and our other friend Wade you

498
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,048
encouraged me very strongly to become a

499
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,190
voter and it feels good to [ __ ] you

500
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:44,269
know they made it super easy now a

501
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:47,480
little piece of paper comes to your

502
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:49,009
house you unfold it you ask him to help

503
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,240
you and then he explains [ __ ] and you go

504
00:20:49,009 --> 00:20:51,470
google it to make sure your friends not

505
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,519
full of [ __ ] and you realize that Mike

506
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:54,500
pretty much knows what he's talking

507
00:20:52,519 --> 00:20:56,720
about you could just believe in him I

508
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,548
like you when people chat fact-check me

509
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,880
oh yeah well I mean because some of the

510
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:03,349
wording I'm like wait wait wait like

511
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,120
that a lot of times it's designed to be

512
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:06,349
tricky yeah so I'd call you I'm like he

513
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:07,969
explained these three words in a row

514
00:21:06,349 --> 00:21:09,829
does that mean that I am or again I am

515
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:13,069
NOT up to I don't know if I like this or

516
00:21:09,829 --> 00:21:14,599
hate it but dude voting's huge in I've

517
00:21:13,069 --> 00:21:17,480
said it before and I've said it again if

518
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:20,959
even half of the people that consume

519
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,970
cannabis every year took a minute to

520
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,910
come out publicly and say we're Pro

521
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,769
cannabis so we vote we would be the most

522
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:32,600
powerful voting bloc in the United

523
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:34,429
States we outnumber everybody everybody

524
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,709
but people like our friend who sent us

525
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:39,559
the message they maybe they kids a huge

526
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:41,870
a huge majority of them to risk and

527
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:43,579
voting booth is private and that little

528
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:45,168
ballot that comes in the mail is private

529
00:21:43,579 --> 00:21:46,579
I dropped mine off in a little box and

530
00:21:45,169 --> 00:21:48,290
there were like 10 cars in front of me

531
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:49,879
and 10 cars behind me bro that they have

532
00:21:48,289 --> 00:21:50,899
no idea which one was mine unless they

533
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,429
could tell that I was the heavy-handed

534
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,019
mother [ __ ] grim one than that but

535
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:54,680
there's no they don't know who sent that

536
00:21:54,019 --> 00:22:00,139
in

537
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:01,730
I used to have a weird like my life has

538
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,520
always been kind of segmented in like

539
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:07,220
weird chunks and for a while one of

540
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,289
those chunks involved fancy dinners with

541
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:12,490
governors Supreme Court justices in

542
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:14,149
Colorado Senate members house

543
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,759
representative members the [ __ ]

544
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,320
governor and I would be the table was

545
00:22:16,759 --> 00:22:20,180
like the district attorney and our two

546
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,099
state senators from from Pueblo and

547
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:24,920
there'd be eight of us at the table we

548
00:22:22,099 --> 00:22:27,079
don't be chit-chatting and these were

549
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,509
great opportunities for me to just

550
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:32,089
randomly mention pro cannabis things and

551
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:35,269
I was always delighted because

552
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:37,490
especially with our two senators they

553
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:39,470
always had cannabis questions for me

554
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:41,029
they were they knew I would be there

555
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,490
they knew I was gonna be at their table

556
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:44,899
and they had to that they wanted answers

557
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:46,430
to and they knew I was a person comes to

558
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:50,750
you and that was after several of these

559
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:54,560
dinners but you might not have that kind

560
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:56,240
of peace in your life but you everyone

561
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,720
has a peace in their life where you can

562
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,200
take good informed supported cannabis

563
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:05,720
knowledge and disseminated to people

564
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:10,100
that need it find those opportunities

565
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,420
and take advantage of them I know people

566
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:15,079
in the medical field

567
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:16,730
that have transformed how the department

568
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,549
they work with or the doctor's office

569
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,710
they work in views cannabis views

570
00:23:19,549 --> 00:23:26,269
cannabis consumers views medical

571
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:28,250
marijuana all because they had a very

572
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:31,160
uncomfortable conversation with their

573
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:35,240
boss at one point and slowly started

574
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:37,910
bringing in information and watch their

575
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,799
workplace convert from anti cannabis to

576
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:41,570
pro cannabis this certainly isn't

577
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,000
possible for everybody and then honestly

578
00:23:41,569 --> 00:23:46,309
if you're making real money I wouldn't

579
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,609
[ __ ] with my paychecks just to be pro

580
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:52,399
we'd use a piece of that paycheck to

581
00:23:49,609 --> 00:23:53,779
fight for the cost for you that leads to

582
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,340
another thing I don't know if you can

583
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,960
see the little sloppily written dollar

584
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:59,629
sign that I've got written down here my

585
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,190
my methods of helping be an activist

586
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:05,270
behind the scenes but contribute

587
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:07,130
financially to activism um if it is not

588
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:08,509
this person actually contributes to the

589
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,580
podcast through patreon

590
00:24:08,509 --> 00:24:12,410
so do things like that also contribute

591
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:14,808
to your local cannabis legalization

592
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,490
efforts or also the National

593
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:18,769
legalization if it's local if it's

594
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,720
statewide if occasionally you've got a

595
00:24:18,769 --> 00:24:22,400
normal chapter in your state I was gonna

596
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,319
say anybody was specific but go with

597
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,700
normal they're always reliable do the

598
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,798
biggest the best the first the original

599
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,150
yep yep since the early 70s you see

600
00:24:27,798 --> 00:24:30,710
Tommy Chong and Cheech wearing normal

601
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,410
shirts in their movies back in the day

602
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,079
there's a reason yeah so contribute some

603
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,460
money to some activism vote with your

604
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,808
dollars is what our friend Scotty real

605
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,150
taught us so get in there and send some

606
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:42,619
money where you can and this person does

607
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,030
they contribute to this podcast I would

608
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:45,349
assume they contribute to the dude grows

609
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:46,548
I bet you they contribute to several

610
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:48,319
others because they're a great person

611
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:50,089
but that is always a great way to

612
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:54,139
contribute send money to normal send

613
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:56,928
money to your local activism group so

614
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,790
the next thing that that leads me to is

615
00:24:56,929 --> 00:25:00,470
if you're gonna send money to somebody

616
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:02,389
and it's your local group why not get

617
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,710
involved with your local group even if

618
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,630
you can't attend the meetings and show

619
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,700
your face it's the digital era you can

620
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,290
get a digital newsletter to that fake

621
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,450
email address you made so that you can

622
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:14,418
send those emails to your local reps and

623
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,460
to the newspaper so get some newsletters

624
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:18,590

625
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,759

627
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:23,859

628
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,509
your feedback to that newsletter or

629
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:27,859

630
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:29,599
your role and you can do that

631
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,159
anonymously you can do that from your

632
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,539
computer and your underwear while you're

633
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,970
listening to the show you can jot down

634
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:36,470
ideas you can get it going and that can

635
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:37,970
be your service to the community behind

636
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:40,519
the scenes with nobody ever seeing your

637
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:42,730
face when honestly Pueblo for sensible

638
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:45,529
cannabis laws exists for two reasons one

639
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:49,190
we had an idiot pop group daddy this

640
00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:52,308
sort of so exists that was putting out a

641
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:53,870
lot of bad information and that

642
00:25:52,308 --> 00:25:56,149
information needed to be counted and the

643
00:25:53,869 --> 00:25:59,389
other part of that and this is like 75%

644
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:02,600
of it is one of my nieces was like who

645
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:05,299
was ragging on my facebook page because

646
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:07,279
it's everything was cannabis related at

647
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:09,019
least so it wasn't explicitly pro

648
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,678
cannabis it was a cannabis related news

649
00:26:09,019 --> 00:26:14,119
story or something and she just like it

650
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:18,110
was just one dinner where she had like

651
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:20,269
three good burns that we're all focused

652
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:21,929
on my my personal Facebook page being

653
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:25,420
overly cannabis related

654
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:27,310
so I wanted another outlet for that and

655
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,620
there's literally nothing stopping you

656
00:26:27,309 --> 00:26:32,529
from starting a Facebook group in your

657
00:26:29,619 --> 00:26:35,189
area or a Facebook page or a Twitter

658
00:26:32,529 --> 00:26:38,259
page under a separate account that's not

659
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:42,039
overtly related to you where you can do

660
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:45,460
all sorts of digital activism that's not

661
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:48,670
overtly under your name or is gonna come

662
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:51,730
up in a simple background search can

663
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:54,130
always start a podcast you can you most

664
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:56,529
certainly can't thank although to be

665
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,480
honest I you get used to the microphone

666
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:00,670
and you you admit things that you might

667
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,549
not want to admit to the world sometimes

668
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:05,529
and so having someone like you that's

669
00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:08,169
really good with GarageBand they can

670
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:11,319
take out some of the insanity is kind of

671
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:13,980
necessary there if you're looking to get

672
00:27:11,319 --> 00:27:16,509
involved I'm thinking you're not

673
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,370
currently involved and so honestly like

674
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:20,890
research and emailing and letter-writing

675
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:23,079
I think is a great place to start

676
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:25,600
and honestly campaign donations of

677
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:28,000
voting they're super easy they're not

678
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,589
time-consuming and they're incredibly

679
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,480
effective I'm proud of myself for

680
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:35,079
writing down campaign donations and

681
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,870
boning them I'm pretty confident I loved

682
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:40,569
the donate $4.20 to two different

683
00:27:37,869 --> 00:27:44,409
candidates campaign that was run during

684
00:27:40,569 --> 00:27:46,839
the last election cycle because one

685
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:50,380
thing that all politicians see is their

686
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:52,659
donations and they may not see every

687
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,760
donation explicitly and like who it's

688
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,529
from but they're gonna thumb through the

689
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:58,420
pages and see how they did that week at

690
00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:00,430
some point and if they're flipping

691
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,830
through the behind or just fanning

692
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:05,049
through the pages and they've received a

693
00:28:02,829 --> 00:28:07,269
hundred donations or thirty donations or

694
00:28:05,049 --> 00:28:08,799
whatever it is for the same amount it's

695
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:11,920
gonna stand out yeah they say why am i

696
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:14,019
adding for twenty the number explicitly

697
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:16,300
tells you why you got that donation yeah

698
00:28:14,019 --> 00:28:19,809
it's super simple it was incredibly

699
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:22,839
effective messaging and

700
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:27,940
I got to watch in real time politicians

701
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:30,339
change their tone on the topic as these

702
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:34,660
this donation platform rolled out people

703
00:28:30,339 --> 00:28:36,609
went from not discussing it to having a

704
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,850
campaign challenger or a primary

705
00:28:36,609 --> 00:28:41,169
challenger bring it up once or twice to

706
00:28:39,849 --> 00:28:43,269
having it be centerpiece of that

707
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:44,500
campaign - they've already pledged to

708
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:47,230
get it done within the first year

709
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,240
whatever their time and often because

710
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:51,069
they see all those 420 donations coming

711
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:53,650
in they saw the support also and they

712
00:28:51,069 --> 00:28:55,359
saw how far the tides turned on this

713
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:57,580
issue from just a few years ago yeah

714
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,539
it's come quickly yeah it can happen

715
00:28:57,579 --> 00:29:00,220
really quickly

716
00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:02,680
there were a lot of unanswered questions

717
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,630
five years ago I mean we didn't know if

718
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,890
like the UN was gonna lose their [ __ ]

719
00:29:04,630 --> 00:29:08,250
because we've signed international

720
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:12,400
treaties that say we won't realize this

721
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:15,119
there's more than one there's all sorts

722
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:17,769
of state and federal rules I mean

723
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:19,389
there's nothing stopping the DEA from

724
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:21,700
showing up and trying to shut us down

725
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:24,790
right there's there's absolutely nothing

726
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:27,580
stopping them nothing at all every grow

727
00:29:24,789 --> 00:29:29,529
every dispensary what's stopping them is

728
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:32,169
logistics in the reality of it in public

729
00:29:29,529 --> 00:29:34,629
opinion and if public opinion were

730
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:37,570
really against us they'd be trying to

731
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:40,150
knock us down three a day and they'd be

732
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:42,339
trying real hard yeah and it'd be all

733
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,040
over the news and they know that if they

734
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:47,079
hit three on Monday on Tuesday they're

735
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,119
gonna have 200 and 300 people outside

736
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:51,849
everyone they try to hit on Tuesday and

737
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:53,649
by Wednesday we're gonna be stopping

738
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:55,240
highways and [ __ ] he just gave me like I

739
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:57,340
was as you were building up to that I

740
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,900
was building the most insane visual in

741
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:00,220
my head of like well [ __ ] they took down

742
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,030
three dispensaries yesterday there were

743
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,710
this many cops

744
00:30:01,029 --> 00:30:04,839
let's all go surround our favorite

745
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:06,579
dispensaries and fight back and it's

746
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:08,559
battle in my head that's [ __ ] so

747
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:09,789
funny in my mind history loves to repeat

748
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:11,919
itself but we did this in California

749
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:13,420
already a couple of times I mean there's

750
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,120
great footage and a couple of the good

751
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:18,610
cannabis documentaries I'm like waiting

752
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:20,889
to inhale and stuff where the feds show

753
00:30:18,609 --> 00:30:23,619
up to raid a very popular farm with a

754
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:26,020
huge number of patients that was growing

755
00:30:23,619 --> 00:30:28,089
in the best way they could and giving

756
00:30:26,019 --> 00:30:30,970
away as much as they could yeah and the

757
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:33,519
feds are raiding these people and the

758
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:35,230
feds have to do negotiations

759
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,450
that involves letting the people they

760
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,799
arrested that morning call the crowd

761
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:40,930
that has formed while they were -

762
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:44,740
cutting all the plants down to beg the

763
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:46,269
crowd to disperse - please not do

764
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:49,660
anything - please let these officers

765
00:30:46,269 --> 00:30:51,220
pass peaceably and they roll up their

766
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:55,150
windows they tuck tail and they [ __ ]

767
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,620
ran and they did not come back yeah what

768
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,090
would happen if we threatened no we're

769
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:59,979
just gonna burn down all the bars and

770
00:30:58,089 --> 00:31:02,049
breweries no more alcohol for everybody

771
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:04,630
we wouldn't even have to do we wouldn't

772
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:06,430
even have to damage stuff the there's

773
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,290
this one of the things that nobody

774
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:12,730
understands about politics and numbers

775
00:31:08,289 --> 00:31:15,819
is once you reach a certain size of the

776
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:17,769
crowd you can achieve anything and if

777
00:31:15,819 --> 00:31:20,559
you look at history wonderful things

778
00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:22,089
have been achieved horrible atrocities

779
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,740
have been achieved they've both been

780
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:25,359
achieved the same way you get a whole

781
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:29,230
crowd hyped up about one thing or the

782
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:32,609
other he's wrong with it and I honestly

783
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,960
think that if the DEA showed up and just

784
00:31:32,609 --> 00:31:36,159
for an example they started one into the

785
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,190
state they try to work their way to the

786
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:41,680
other they can only bus there's only so

787
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:43,480
many DEA agents even if they had every

788
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:45,310
d-- age and on the planet show up in

789
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,480
southern colorado they couldn't do

790
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:52,480
trinidad in a day and so literally by

791
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,759
the end of day one there's enough news

792
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,309
footage there's enough press footage of

793
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:59,980
this happening and this being the plan

794
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:02,889
to disseminate across the globe news

795
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:05,230
goes out instantly now and there's

796
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,550
enough of this just in colorado that if

797
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:08,259
we all hopped on our cars and took the

798
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:10,149
three-hour drive we could end it all in

799
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:12,670
a minute just by showing up and being

800
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:14,560
like hey now go away we don't want you

801
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:15,789
here yeah that's all we'd have to do we

802
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,829
wouldn't have to shout we wouldn't have

803
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:22,629
to yell we just have to show up at once

804
00:32:17,829 --> 00:32:25,230
and Satan unison and we used to do it

805
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:29,130
once a year on 4/20 down a Civic Center

806
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:32,049
before medical before legalization in 98

807
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:35,460
2004 a hundred thousand people would

808
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:39,490
just walk in the Civic Center Park and

809
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:42,400
the cops if this was any other day would

810
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,970
ruin a month or more of your life if you

811
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,280
lit up cannabis

812
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:48,650
and a hundred thousand of us just did it

813
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:50,779
together and there was not thing they

814
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:52,070
could do about it because they knew that

815
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:53,359
if they started grabbing one of us

816
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:55,490
they'd have to deal with a hundred

817
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,939
thousand of us and we weren't hurting

818
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,120
nobody we weren't arguing with nobody

819
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,490
nothing

820
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:05,449
it just peacefully came together had a

821
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:08,420
good laugh peacefully left and there was

822
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:10,549
nothing they could do about and just

823
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:13,279
that happening so many years in a row

824
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:15,589
push the conversation of Colorado so

825
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,960
much faster and we saw the same thing

826
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:20,480
Seattle had a big smoke out California

827
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,240
and a number of big smoke outs there's

828
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,980
something that I mean the five or the

829
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,259
six years down the road after the first

830
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,360
smoke out when the news anchor is still

831
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:32,119
making the same jokes but you're like

832
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:34,879
wait a second on st. Patty's Day st.

833
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:38,569
Patty's was Monday by Wednesday the DUI

834
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,790
reports are out [ __ ] 4:20 was months

835
00:33:38,569 --> 00:33:43,960
ago I never read a report say on a bunch

836
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:49,099
of traffic actions ever it's not a thing

837
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:52,039
that stuff starts to sink in little side

838
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:54,259
effects of just the visual start to sink

839
00:33:52,039 --> 00:33:55,700
in there was one year where the worst

840
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:57,859
thing that could have happened happened

841
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,789
happened in Denver and somebody brought

842
00:33:57,859 --> 00:34:04,459
a gun and fired off three rounds minor

843
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:07,549
injuries I think I don't think anybody

844
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:10,280
was severely injured a couple of people

845
00:34:07,549 --> 00:34:14,659
got hurt when people were running away

846
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,150
right but I remember the next day when

847
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:21,259
everyone was like wait a hundred

848
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:23,090
thousand people got really high and then

849
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:26,870
ran away really fast got in their cars

850
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:30,559
and sped out of here in no fender

851
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:33,469
benders no flipped over cars no run over

852
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,179
pedestrians nothing there's just a

853
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:37,849
hundred thousand people just evacuated

854
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:41,929
the area immediately without any sort of

855
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:44,989
major traffic yeah in watching the news

856
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:46,639
media try to wrestle with that blatantly

857
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:48,709
obvious fact that they were trying not

858
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,139
to specifically address was funny

859
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:53,179
I mean it was a tragic incident and I

860
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:55,339
hated to see it happen but at the same

861
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:57,510
time it was one of those real-world

862
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,829
tests that teaches us a lot

863
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,310
stuff we didn't know we needed to learn

864
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:03,509
in I mean in Colorado we learned a lot

865
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:05,130
of those lessons over the last five

866
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,690
years and the rest of the world stood up

867
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:08,220
and took notice between these

868
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:10,650
conversations go down this year in

869
00:35:08,219 --> 00:35:13,349
Virginia in New Jersey the debate about

870
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:15,389
whether the UN's gonna send peacekeepers

871
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:17,039
to shut down the weed store like I had

872
00:35:15,389 --> 00:35:20,460
to have that [ __ ] debate more than

873
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:23,639
once and like convincing people that the

874
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,340
UN wasn't good at you know impose major

875
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:29,789
sanctions against Colorado like it was

876
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:32,490
nuts yeah I'm almost conversations are

877
00:35:29,789 --> 00:35:34,619
Contin you can look it year after year

878
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:36,329
after year of teen youth debt and now

879
00:35:34,619 --> 00:35:39,420
it's all online you just need to know

880
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:43,349
how to ask Google you just ask nice and

881
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,150
it'll tell you he uses FAQ on up um the

882
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:47,819
one thing that has changed in a big way

883
00:35:45,150 --> 00:35:49,500
is the perception of harm innocent all

884
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,289
of the [ __ ] we were spoon feeding

885
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,570
them in the 90s is no longer being spoon

886
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:57,480
fed actual information is being spoon

887
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:59,150
fed their opinions on cannabis or more

888
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,460
in line with reality and that

889
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:04,980
statistically visual or seeable in the

890
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,750
graphs you can see that their attitudes

891
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,340
towards how dangerous it is as

892
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:11,480
drastically changed over the last five

893
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:13,860
or ten years but their use rates have it

894
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,929
like and people are starting to see

895
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,280
videos like the brave mykayla videos and

896
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:18,690
the video of the I don't know the

897
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,040
person's name and I would rather know

898
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,960
his name because I feel disrespectful

899
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:23,429
but there's a man on Facebook I see the

900
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:25,230
video all the time in marijuana groups

901
00:36:23,429 --> 00:36:26,669
cannabis groups excuse me they'll start

902
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:28,230
having a seizure and they scored a

903
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:29,820
little CBD oil on his mouth and within

904
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:32,039
seconds the dude stops having a major

905
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,960
seizure people are seeing videos like

906
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,400
that I think that's making if you show

907
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,110
videos like that to my mom she cries

908
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,519
back in the day she didn't believe it

909
00:36:37,110 --> 00:36:39,750
when I called cannabis medicine she's

910
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:41,550
like you guys are just using that as an

911
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:43,050
excuse to smoke weed I know when she

912
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:44,640
sees things like that [ __ ] she gets a

913
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:46,800
little tear in her eye she's like oh you

914
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,049
guys are right I remember Sam one night

915
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,120
it wasn't Thanksgiving dinner but it was

916
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,430
a similar family that was like 15 or 20

917
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,829
people there most of whom were older

918
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:58,049
adults that I respected in my life and I

919
00:36:55,829 --> 00:37:00,059
remember telling one of them that

920
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,760
cannabis was the most beneficial plant

921
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,529
known to man and this was a statement

922
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,540
largely based on the different products

923
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:08,430
we can make with hemp and a couple of

924
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:10,320
the the minor medical uses we've known

925
00:37:08,429 --> 00:37:11,339
about for a long time with THC like

926
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,160
lowering in her eye

927
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:17,010
sure helping with nausea especially for

928
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,839
chemotherapy patients and alike who

929
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:22,350
really have trouble swallowing [ __ ]

930
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:24,329
other medications that kind of thing and

931
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:27,630
we've known that hard science since the

932
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:29,099
late 70s and I remember most of the

933
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,039
people at the table laughing at me now

934
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,329
when you say things like that it's just

935
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:35,150
part of the press about the farm bill

936
00:37:33,329 --> 00:37:37,079
yeah

937
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,500
like people start telling you about

938
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,509
their CBB company yeah their CBD I mean

939
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:47,460
if you really think about it I mean

940
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:50,970
cotton oil and trees think about all the

941
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:53,849
stuff and all of the damage we're doing

942
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:56,399
to the environment the planet ourselves

943
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:59,219
each other over some of these things and

944
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:01,880
imagine if we could change all of that

945
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:06,119
with fields that are currently growing

946
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:09,539
nothing yeah fill them up with him yeah

947
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,769
I mean we can stop clear-cutting forests

948
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:12,659
Oh Mike we gotta start wrapping up this

949
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:15,420
podcast I apologize yeah we went it's

952
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:21,809
out just imagine what we're gonna see

953
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,740
over the next five or six years and this

954
00:38:21,809 --> 00:38:24,840
really happens we're gonna see this

955
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:26,549
market take off for sure absolutely

956
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,410
I want to recap on what this person has

957
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:30,060
to ask for what got us into this is

958
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:32,219
asked for ways that they can be active

959
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:33,420
without exposing themselves we got way

960
00:38:32,219 --> 00:38:36,599

00:39:16,469 --> 00:39:20,129
talking about and then add the word

980
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:22,800
government to the end of it and bring up

981
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:24,800
the cast of characters if it's the state

982
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,230

that goes to a staffer in their office

1001
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:11,789
usually and then they're assigned to

1002
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:13,380
send you the blanket reply for that

1003
00:40:11,789 --> 00:40:15,300
topic thank you for your interest in

1004
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:17,010
this topic we will be back with a reply

1005
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:19,560
but one of the important things that

1006
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:21,900
those people do is they rank them and so

1007
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:24,960
at a certain point this politician gets

1008
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:27,300
a little report that says hey you had 47

1009
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:28,980
people this week reach out about gun

1010
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:33,620
control all right okay that's cool

1011
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:36,179
cannabis 10 were pro 40 were against and

1012
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:38,250
they get those numbers and they get a

1013
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:39,839
gauge of what their constituents are

1014
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:43,289
willing to reach out about them about um

1015
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:46,079
if you live in the area that votes for

1016
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:47,550
this person mention that explicitly you

1017
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,759
don't have to be like i live at one two

1018
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:53,039
three four but hey i live in your

1019
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,830
district and i vote

1020
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,019
here's my issue that I care about that's

1021
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:59,610
a more effective message than just hey

1022
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:01,440
vote for this because I send those to

1023
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,170
people who I don't vote for all the time

1024
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,909
and a lot of other people do too the

1025
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,269
anti cannabis groups are getting better

1026
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:10,859
at the emailing fit i watch them try to

1027
00:41:09,269 --> 00:41:13,739
teach people how to do this and it's

1028
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:15,180
funny but our community is much better

1029
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,799
with technology i don't we're gonna have

1030
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:18,119
those issues but this super easy to do

1031
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,950
to reach out your representatives

1032
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:21,659
all right then once you've reached out

1033
00:41:19,949 --> 00:41:23,579
to all of them use that same email

1034
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:26,460
address to send some letters to the

1035
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:28,079
editor of your local newspapers not just

1036
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,570
the local go the other cities are

1037
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,179
surrounding you also before you submit

1038
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:35,820
read it aloud yeah make sure it makes

1039
00:41:33,179 --> 00:41:37,379
sense make sure you yeah mom please

1040
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,160

1041

edit

1042
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:43,348
also you can create a Facebook group or

1043
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:44,818
you can do a join other forums or you

1044
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:46,289
can create a podcast if you're that kind

1045
00:41:44,818 --> 00:41:48,268
of person that people may learn your

1046
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:49,829
voice eventually you may need to be

1047
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:51,568
little key about that you can also

1048
00:41:49,829 --> 00:41:54,210
contribute financially to activism

1049
00:41:51,568 --> 00:41:55,739
causes you can send $4.20 you can send

1050
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:57,778
seven dollars in 10 cents your favorite

1051
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:59,219

saying just me I'm saying myself the

1053
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:04,528
dude grows Shango loaves out there could

1054
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:06,419
use some support who else do we support

1055
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:08,369
tad husky at kiss organics he can help

1056
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,559
out so many people financially there's

1057
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:12,480
also normal you've got local cannabis or

1058
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,210
local cannabis activism that you can

1059
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,889
support financially um there's a lot of

1060
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:19,349
other national groups than normal like I

1061
00:42:16,889 --> 00:42:21,058
don't want to stress one above the other

1062
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:23,400
but like they're students for a sensible

1063
00:42:21,059 --> 00:42:25,079
drug policy there's the national there's

1064
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:28,798
normal there's the Marijuana Policy

1065
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,420
Project I mean those are just the ones

1066
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:32,429
that I'm randomly thinking at the end

1067
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,329
there's a bunch and there's gonna be

1068
00:42:32,429 --> 00:42:38,338
state specific groups no matter what's

1069
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:41,039
guaranteed so join those maybe create a

1070
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:43,199
newsletter or just be a part of the

1071
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:45,269
newsletter and add contribute to it

1072
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,710
reply say hey I think this get some

1073
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:47,788
conversations going with people open

1074
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,380
their minds share the truth if you're

1075
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:50,849
listening you're learning a lot of good

1076
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,130
stuff that you can share so go share a

1077
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:54,450
lot of that stuff and the final one that

1078
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,039
I've got on the list of Mike the most

1079
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:57,000
obvious that Mike likes to talk about

1080
00:42:56,039 --> 00:42:58,170
that I'm proud of myself for having

1081
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:01,048
written down without some sort of

1082
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:03,509
guidance is vote vote when it comes time

1083
00:43:01,048 --> 00:43:05,130
to vote on cannabis just show up and

1084
00:43:03,509 --> 00:43:06,329
vote like I said earlier they send a

1085
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:10,259
little paper to your house it's really

1086
00:43:06,329 --> 00:43:11,940
hard to miss it it's a really do they

1087
00:43:10,259 --> 00:43:13,289
because here it's like a different color

1088
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,568
than all the other mail and it's got a

1089
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:18,089
big flag on it that says ballot it

1090
00:43:15,568 --> 00:43:20,099
they've made it remarkably easy in

1091
00:43:18,088 --> 00:43:21,838
Colorado but there are so many places

1092
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:23,789
around the country that make it pretty

1093
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:25,409
hard like some places you have to go to

1094
00:43:23,789 --> 00:43:28,349
a physical location other places you

1095
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:29,730
have to register monster pants so it can

1096
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:31,500
be a little tricky but once you do it

1097
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:34,108
once you know how it goes and it's super

1098
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,630
easy to do again it's also insanely

1099
00:43:34,108 --> 00:43:38,788
important here's a trick this is kind of

1100
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:41,099
a magic trick if you were a cannabis

1101
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:41,670
consumer and you are listening you're

1102
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:43,859
gonna vote

1103
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:45,889
encourage your pothead friends to vote

1104
00:43:43,858 --> 00:43:47,969
also and then you're tricking you're not

1105
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:49,318
realistically going and advocating

1106
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:50,769
cannabis but you're actually getting a

1107
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:54,400
vote for our side and

1108
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:55,989
your pothead friends to vote and a piece

1109
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,550
for the people that still listen because

1110
00:43:55,989 --> 00:43:59,799
obviously you care about this topic you

1111
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,630
were to turn this off right now those

1112
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,300
personal conversations I was talking

1113
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:08,500
about aren't just with anti cannabis

1114
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:10,539
people also pro cannabis people there's

1115
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:13,900
a lot of misinformation and bad

1116
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:16,690
information in the cannabis world and

1117
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:20,619
when we disseminate that publicly it

1118
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:22,030
hurts our cause and so having the

1119
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:24,039
courage to sit down with your pro

1120
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,210
cannabis friends and be like bro when

1121
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:27,340
you're out there talking about pro

1122
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:31,750
cannabis stuff could you pretty please

1123
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:33,519
not talk about chemtrails stuff - that

1124
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:35,949
kind of stuff could you maybe not open

1125
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:39,340
your speech with your beliefs about it's

1126
00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:41,349
cancer curative properties and and maybe

1127
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:43,990
talk about some of the other benefits of

1128
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:47,730
legalization that you also believe in

1129
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:50,289
that we can support with hard data

1130
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:52,449
because it's making those arguments in a

1131
00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:55,750
way that can be quickly fact-check

1132
00:44:52,449 --> 00:44:57,639
that's the most effective and reducing

1133
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:00,000
our bad information that our community's

1134
00:44:57,639 --> 00:45:03,159
putting out is just as helpful is

1135
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,559
converting other people to our cause

1136
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,940
don't bro science people I think that's

1137
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:07,989
what Mike is saying alright Mike we've

1138
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:09,369
been going for a long time this is one

1139
