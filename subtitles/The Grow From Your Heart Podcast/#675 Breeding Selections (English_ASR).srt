about what strain i'm smoking on the

66
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,400
podcast

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,479
i need to mention what strain i'm

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,039
smoking because it feels like

69
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:32,639
i've got bricks on my head or

70
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,280
excuse me maybe like i've got some kind

71
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:38,559
of belt around my brain i feel slow

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,360
motion i took a big fat dab of some blue

73
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,039
fruit live rosin from green dot labs

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,319
nobody pays me to talk about it nobody

75
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,878
gives me the concentrate so i went to

76
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,639
the local dispensary and i bought it i

77
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:50,159
brought it home set up the equipment

78
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,518
thought i should take a dab before i

79
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:55,519
record and that stuff put me in slow

80
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
motion so if you catch me going a little

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
bit slow looking feeling a little bit

82
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,080
confused you're right it's from the blue

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,719
fruit and i am enjoying it so big shout

84
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,640
out to our friends at green dot

85
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:06,158
green.labs honestly they do not pay me

86
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:07,759
they don't sponsor the show i just

87
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,439
enjoyed the dab that i just took so much

88
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:11,039
that i thought you might notice and i

89
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,639
should mention how good it was all right

90

this it says what's up ross to jeff i

188
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,400
have some seeds from a source who has

189
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,478
some sort of wizard of oz

190
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,239
and they call it killer green bud and i

191
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,918
was looking at crossing that with some

192
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,720
of your genetics

193
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:37,279
which would you suggest cheers from

194
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960

for loving the podcast even better

197
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,839
compliment wanting to breed with my

198
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,680
genetics that is a very good question

199
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,198
so you've got some seeds

200
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,959
that i don't know what those seeds are

201
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,240
the wizard of oz i don't know what that

202
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:53,519
is i don't know where they came from i

203
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,879
could have done some research but

204
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:56,318
honestly that wouldn't help me out too

205
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,399
much with my advice i would give you the

206
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,120
same exact advice probably

207
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,598
um you've got seeds so

208
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,319
do you want to use a male from my plants

209
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:08,560
or a male from that pack of seeds like

210
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,160
have you decided which side is going to

211
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,280
be which like which side who you're

212
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
going to use the male from who you're

213
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,079
going to use the female from have you

214
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,879
done any commitment

215
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:20,159
or deciding or any uh dedication to um

216
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,399
which side is which have you thought

217
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,680
about that so you've got some seeds uh

218
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,439
who has some wizard of oz you're gonna

219
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,199
have to grow the wizard of oz then

220
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,360
you're gonna have to grow some of my

221
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,400
seeds and we'll talk about which ones uh

222
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,319
later on

223
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,000
uh grow that wizard of oz do you find a

224
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
good boy do you find a good female is

225
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,598
there something you like in there what

226
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,198
stands out about that plant that makes

227
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,360
you want to breed with it that's what i

228
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,879
want to know why what is your goal it

229
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,720
all boils down to where i'm headed with

230
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,478
this is what is your goal when you're

231
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,479
breeding cannabis plants one of your

232
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,318
main objectives one of your main things

233
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,918
to think about is what is the goal

234
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,759
what's your purpose here why are you

235
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:56,079
breeding these plants

236
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,080
i appreciate that you want to breed with

237
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,918
my stuff because you like something

238
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,878
about my brand makes you want to breed

239
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,719
with it i appreciate that but what makes

240
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,720
you want to breed with these particular

241
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,639
plants there's got to be a goal in mind

242
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,160
when you're breeding i could be i want

243
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,720
to make some hot fire cool that's a

244
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,120
great idea but what traits

245
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
make hot fire in your opinion what is a

246
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,639
good pie what's a good cake in your

247
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,639
opinion because you are being a chef now

248
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,800
you're the one mixing [ __ ] up what is

249
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,478
your goal what are you trying to bake if

250
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
you're trying to make pizza then we

251
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,478
don't need to order uh if we if you're

252
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,318
making pizza we need to order cheese and

253
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,839
pizza sauce if you're making cakes we

254
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,680
need to order totally different show we

255
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,278
don't need any cheese and pizza sauce in

256
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:38,399
our cake so it's all about your goal

257
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:40,799
what do you want so i would say grow

258
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,559
start off grow some of these uh what are

259
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,559
they called wizard of oz kill a green

260
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,559
blood seeds and see what you get do you

261
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,239
find a stellar male do you find a

262
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,359
stellar female is there a plant in there

263
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,839
that talks to you that just says i am a

264
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,879
standout breeding plant i see that as a

265
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,399
breeder

266
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,838
as a passionate cannabis grower or

267
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,039
somebody's that somebody that's been

268
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,560
around these plants and seen them

269
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,879
express themselves so many different

270
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:04,559
ways i see plants and i go that right

271
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,958
there is something you should breed with

272
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,719
and that intuition will kick in so learn

273
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,278
about mendel charts learn about alieal

274
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,278
charts learn all of that stuff then

275
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:15,679
build some intuition on which plants to

276
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,759
breed with then grow these seeds find a

277
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,359
male or female that gets your attention

278
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,958
keep them have a clone of that keep a

279
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,480
mother plant of that grow it several

280
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,879
times build a relationship with that

281
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,480
plant so you understand how it reacts in

282
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,879
response to different feedings different

283
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,000
conditions different stresses learn it

284
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,879
very well

285
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,278
then

286
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,759
think about what your goal is

287
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,399
what does that plant have that it would

288
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,080
mix well with what is that plant missing

289
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,480
that you want to maybe correct what

290
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,720
could you improve upon with that plant

291
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
what terps are going to mix well with

292
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,080
that plant

293
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
what structure will combine well with

294
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,040
that plant

295
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,440
think about things like that now what is

296
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,519
your goal is something i keep saying i

297
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,000
don't know what the flavors uh the

298
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,360
aromas the structure the potency i don't

299
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,958
know anything about the plant that

300
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,800
you're starting with that's why you've

301
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:05,039
got to grow it test it find the keeper

302
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,679
that you like then we'll breed with that

303
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,919
then what is your goal do you want to

304
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,278
make something really tall and skinny

305
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:14,399
that takes 77 to 85 days to flower or do

306
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:15,759
you want the opposite do you want

307
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,879
something short and squatty that

308
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:21,278
finishes in 55 to 63 days do you want

309
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,879
something that will rip your brain apart

310
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,078
the first time you smoke it you take two

311
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,838
rips off of it and it feels like your

312
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,759
head just exploded and beams of light

313
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,920
came out of it you're [ __ ] panicking

314
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:31,919
and paranoid or do you want to take two

315
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,919
fat rips and just melt into the couch

316
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:36,078
and be part of the couch it's all about

317
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,599
your goal so it's really hard for me to

318
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:38,879
tell you what to breed with because i

319
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,079
don't know your goal i don't know if

320
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,679
you're trying to make pizzas i don't

321
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:43,519
know if you're trying to make apple pie

322
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,719
so i'm not sure what ingredients to send

323
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,320
for you from the store uh do you want

324
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,639
something i can really kind of guide you

325
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
through is terps do you want strawberry

326
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,720
terps do you want orange chirps do you

327
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,000
want funky blueberry skittly kind of

328
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,639
terps what other chirp should i write

329
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,720
down do you just want pure gas and funky

330
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,519
stank i can steer you in directions with

331
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,959
that

332
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,039
of course i've got strains that are kind

333
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,278
of obviously labeled for that kind of

334
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,958
project if you want strawberries

335
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,439
strawberry starburst would be the way to

336
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,879
go if you want orangey orange terps sun

337
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,040
kiss would be the way to go if you can

338
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,360
get it orange gasm would be the way to

339
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,199
go now if you get orange gasm you're

340
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,959
locked into either using the orange gasm

341
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,640
as the female side of the cross because

342
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,119
it's a feminized seed or you've got to

343
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,360
find a good orange gasm reverse it use

344
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,039
that as your pollen donor so that's puts

345
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,399
you on a track for your breeding that

346
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,159
does kind of make some decisions there

347
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,200
for you when you use a feminized cross

348
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,838
on one side side rant it is totally fine

349
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,640
it's okay i do it all the time you can

350
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,399
breed to a feminized seed if you've got

351
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,000
a seed it was feminized

352
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,320
it works just like any other plant you

353
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,839
could breed to it you can mother plant

354
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,600
that bad [ __ ] it works just like the

355
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,680
other plants people have some weird

356
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,440
rumors myths misconceptions

357
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,799
it's whack it's not real it works just

358
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,519
like other plants the only difference

359
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:58,958
was it was female for sure all right so

360
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,039
if you're looking for certain flavors

361
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,479
certain terps i can help you with that

362
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,159
like i said there's orange there's

363
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,959
strawberry there's blueberry funkiness

364
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,879
i've got garlic stuff i've got like

365
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,239
skunky gassy dirty feet kind of [ __ ]

366
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,679
that i can recommend you breed with that

367
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,039
would be the double dose if you want the

368
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:17,599
garlicky stuff use the dark hollow

369
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,199
a lot of my stuff is very uh the names

370
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,879
kind of give you a good hint of what the

371
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,560
flavors are going to be like strawberry

372
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,320
there's blueberry butcher is going to

373
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,919
taste like blueberry so their lemon

374
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,360
jeffrey is going to taste like lemons

375
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:28,719
there's stuff like that lemon sunrise

376
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,919
tastes like lemons i give you pretty

377
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,759
strong hints with my terp profiles so

378
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:36,559
are you looking for

379
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,319
super high thc because a lot of my stuff

380
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,039
will give you super high thc but i'd

381
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,278
probably recommend using like an arise

382
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,240
or a sonic boom male to get that really

383
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:48,159
high thc or anything with the jack the

384
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,959
ripper crosses would contribute to super

385
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,958
high thc but along with that will come a

386
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,638
longer flowering time so those are

387
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,319
things you have to negotiate with when

388
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,399
it comes to breeding uh and then you

389
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,959
will find outliers in the phenotypes and

390
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,759
then find an outlier find one that came

391
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:05,679
from sativa dominant heavy genetics that

392
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,838
were bred together find one that flowers

393
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:09,439
in a short time and breed to that one

394
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,800
again and breed to that one and keep

395
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,760
finding short flowers and you get that

396
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,039
sativa dominant short flowering thing

397
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,439
which is kind of what i think they did

398
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:19,120
with golden goat anyway i'm on a ramble

399
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,079
there are you looking for more of a

400
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,240
sativa or indica outcome in your cross

401
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,000
if you want more sativa stuff

402
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,039
i would say go with like the jack the

403
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,958
ripper crosses or straight up a rise if

404
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,679
you want more indica stuff i would say

405
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:37,039
use a morning dew a dark hollow or maybe

406
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:39,120
a double dose as a female or maybe even

407
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,958
a male in one of your crosses it's

408
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,720
really all about your goal

409
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,198
i said earlier do you want a longer or

410
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,600
shorter flowering project do you want

411
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:50,240
them to finish in 55 63 or do you want

412
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,680
those 80 day flower plants uh if you

413
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,198
want to go longer

414
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,638
i would say use something to jack the

415
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,198
ripper stuff i've said that before that

416
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,278
jack the ripper stuff goes for a while

417
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,278
the morning dude the prana the sun kiss

418
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,958
those finish a little bit earlier if you

419
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,519
want some quicker finishing stuff that's

420
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,078
what i would recommend but overall

421
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,360
it's hard for me to recommend what to

422
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,198
breed to your wizard of oz because first

423
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,120
off i don't know what the wizard of oz

424
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,679
is i don't know what it looks like

425
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,198
smells like and even if i had a good

426
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,799
written description of it if it said

427
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,278
here that it smells like pine trees and

428
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,120
grows like this how do i know that

429
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,720
that's the phenotype you're going to get

430
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,639
maybe you selected a phenotype that

431
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,879
smells like bubble gum and gets real

432
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,639
tall and skinny and i don't know that so

433
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,159
it's hard to decide what to tell you to

434
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,320
cross it with and then you're going to

435
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,559
get different phenotypes from my crosses

436
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,160
as well some things will get if you

437
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,838
cross something that's real strawberry

438
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,278
and something that's real gassy some

439
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,720
phenotypes are going to lean real

440
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:47,039
strawberries some phenotypes are going

441
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,199
to lean real gas and guess what some be

442
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,399
strawberry gas perfect up the middle

443
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,159
you're going to get others that are

444
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,679
totally random [ __ ] you'll get bubble

445
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,198
gum and turpentine out of some of them

446
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:56,879
but that's just outliers because that's

447
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,799
how genetics in nature works there's

448
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:01,439
nothing stopping you from breeding with

449
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,759
multiple female plants at one time you

450
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,199
can get one dude and as long as that one

451
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,360
dude makes enough pollen you can

452
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,559
pollinate as many females that are in

453
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
the room

454
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,159
i allegedly have a greenhouse going

455
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,399
right now with king solomon sitting

456
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:16,639
right in the middle uh he's actually he

457
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,399
served his purpose he did his job he uh

458
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,399
he made a [ __ ] mess everybody's

459
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,559
pregnant uh how would tracy morgan do he

460
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,078
got everyone pregnant are they pregnant

461
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,078
i can't do a good tracy morgan on the

462
00:15:24,078 --> 00:15:28,078
spot i wasn't prepared but you know what

463
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:30,719
i'm saying he got everyone got pregnant

464
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,559
tonight uh shout out to tracy morgan he

465
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,920
got everybody pre not tracy morgan king

466
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:36,399
solomon got everybody pregnant in that

467
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,679
greenhouse uh and he got one two i think

468
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:42,000
he pollinated 12 other he pollinated 12

469
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,000
female plants so there are 12 outdoor

470
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,399
plants got pollinated by one plant when

471
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
i go indoors i usually do

472
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,159
one male per one or two lights so i've

473
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,320
got a light of female plants and one

474
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,639
male plant per light maybe sometimes two

475
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,879
depending on how big the overall plants

476
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,278
are how big the dude is but i'll put

477
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,439
several females to king solomon most of

478
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:05,759
the time or several females to jack the

479
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,959
ripper or several females to a reversed

480
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
golden goat that way you can make

481
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:11,679
multiple things and then that way you

482
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:14,159
run those multiple so you put let's for

483
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:16,000
example say we put your let's just take

484
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,759
the wizard of oz mail and we'll

485
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
pollinate strawberry starburst we'll

486
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,480
pollinate sun kiss and then we'll also

487
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,799
pollinate jack the ripper and we'll grow

488
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,639
seeds from all of those and we've grown

489
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,240
the strawberry starburst the sun kiss

490
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,560
and the jack the ripper times enough to

491
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,399
where we know what they do when you grow

492
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,159
them they know how they respond and

493
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,480
react to different environments feedings

494
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,000
conditions abuses stresses we know what

495
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
they're resistant to we know what

496
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
they're really susceptible to we know

497
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,000
how long they take to flower so we know

498
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,078
those plants very well right we've got a

499
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,278
relationship with those then we cross

500
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:50,159
them with

501
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:52,399
your male wizard of oz then you grow the

502
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,078
seeds that come from those plants and

503
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,639
then we get to see what the male is

504
00:16:54,078 --> 00:16:58,479
doing to each different cross so if we

505
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,039
see that normally the strawberry

506
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,720
starburst was tall and had skinny leaves

507
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:05,438
and long lanky buds and smells like

508
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,038
strawberries and the sun kisses kinda

509
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,798
it's not as tall but it's got that

510
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,038
rounder structure and the wide plant

511
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,639
structure and smells like oranges then

512
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:14,160
we grow out the progeny that came from

513
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,480
those crosses and we see that they both

514
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,400
have a spicy apple flavor we know that

515
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,558
your wizard of oz is contributing

516
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,160
a spicy apple terp to everything that's

517
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,399
kind of one of his traits what we know

518
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,400
he does that's how you test out a male

519
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,919
plant that's the only real way to test

520
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,320
out a boy is to pollinate a bunch of

521
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,320
things grow them and then find

522
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,000
commonalities amongst those different

523
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:36,639
crosses to find out what he's doing

524
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,558
that's how i know so well what my king

525
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,280
solomon plant does to other plants when

526
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,319
i cross it it's very predictable for me

527
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,038
um

528
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,960
8 out of 10 times by now i can say if we

529
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,359
hit that plant with king solomon it's

530
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,798
going to do this and i can predict it

531
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,479
i'll write it down on paper and i'll say

532
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:54,160
bro we're going to get this out of it

533
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,679
and then we'll do it whoever i'll

534
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,679
pollinate the plants i'll give seeds to

535
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,200
people and i'll say expect this watch

536
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,400
out for this and they'll message me back

537
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,558
they'll be like bro i thought you said

538
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,759
it's a tester i never you never grew it

539
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:05,599
how'd you know what it would was going

540
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,839
to do and if i know both the parents so

541
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,000
well that i know that strawberry

542
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,839
starburst grows tall she gets skinny

543
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,200
around week six she starts yellowing up

544
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,720
real bad you want to give her extra

545
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,480
nutrients but don't because you'll burn

546
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,319
her she just kind of yellows out that's

547
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,798
what she does and then i know that this

548
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,960
other plant over here uh around week

549
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,480
nine it really starts beefing up so that

550
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,919
i know that the offspring around week

551
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,440
seven are probably gonna get yellow and

552
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,280
beef up that's just the kind of math

553
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,120
that my brain understands how to do with

554
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:33,119
these plants they're my kids i know them

555
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,479
i know that that one is gonna be an

556
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,918
honoree [ __ ] one night and that one's

557
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,200
gonna be really a pain in the ass in the

558
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,880
mornings but saturday morning they're

559
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,400
gonna get along it's gonna be cool just

560
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,679
[ __ ] like that you know it that's how

561
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,640
the plants are telling them what the

562
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,919
plants they talk to me they tell me

563
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,440
all right i feel like i've been rambling

564
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,200
for a very long time about this one but

565
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,120
honestly breeding is all about your

566
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,640
purpose and your goal breed with intent

567
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,319
breed with purpose have a goal do what i

568
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,160
do challenge yourself

569
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,399
no matter which plants you use just get

570
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,240
a piece of paper and write down

571
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,160
i'm going to cross and i'm just being

572
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,839
hypothetical you can use any plants in

573
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,160
your garden that you choose to work with

574
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:13,038
and you've got my permission my blessing

575
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,558
um my honor to breed with my seeds all

576
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,558
of you guys out there gals out there

577
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,720
anybody uh that wants to play with my

578
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,319
seeds and do some pollen chucking please

579
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,759
do if you make a seed company out of it

580
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,399
give me some credit give me a shout out

581
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,879
say learn some [ __ ] from ross to jeff

582
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,720
but i encourage you to breed with my

583
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
stuff the main thing is that you've got

584
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,679
a goal all right i told you i took some

585
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,038
fat dabs but i finally remember what the

586
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,080
[ __ ] i was saying i just had to ramble

587
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,000
it out i may have cut some of the

588
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,839
rambling out uh that's the magic of

589
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,960
editing uh and i better say it before i

590
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:40,720
[ __ ] forget what i was saying again

591
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,759
here's a challenge when you're going to

592
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,200
do some breeding and you've got the

593
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:44,240
blessings to breed with my plants your

594
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,840
plants whatever plants you want to

595
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,519
choose nobody uh should say you can't

596
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,959
breed with their seeds once you buy them

597
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:50,720
they're yours that's my opinion do your

598
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,120
thing ah but

599
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,360
write down i'm going to breed my wizard

600
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,678
of oz to strawberry starburst i'm going

601
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,399
to breed wizard of oz to cindy 99 i'm

602
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,640
gonna breed wizard of oz to uh something

603
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,000
from colin and something from miss jill

604
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,280
just read it to a bunch of different

605
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,480
things but write down your expected

606
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:11,200
outcome i think that's called your

607
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,120
hypothesis write down uh your your

608
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,400
predictions what you think so like i'm

609
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,399
gonna put this wizard of oz to

610
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,440
strawberry starburst i'm hoping i get

611
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,120
high potency strawberry terps and then

612
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,558
think of what like may kind of not be

613
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,879
the super coolest trait everything's

614
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,399
going to have like a negative trait to

615
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,559
it like what's the downside to all these

616
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,798
bonus traits see where that is just see

617
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,720
what you can predict and then every time

618
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,319
you breed again keep writing down your

619
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,759
predictions and you'll start seeing what

620
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:37,918
you can do and what you can predict and

621
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:40,480
what you can rely on and what the plants

622
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,000
do repeatedly over and over when you

623
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,919
breed with them and then you'll learn

624
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,440
this dude is great to breed with this

625
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,960
girl plant is good to breed with then

626
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,240
you'll start playing with different male

627
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,200
plants and you'll start seeing what

628
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,200
different

629
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,120
boy and girl combinations do to each

630
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,880
other and you'll realize this male and

631
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,038
this female work real well together but

632
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,640
when i breed this male and this female

633
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:00,400
together it doesn't work worth a [ __ ]

634
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,400
for some reason you'll find combos that

635
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,759
are magic and some that are mediocre

636
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,038
and some that you wish you never made

637
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:06,798
because you end up throwing away big

638
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:07,839
baggies filled with seeds you feed them

639
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:08,879
to the birds you flush them down the

640
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,480
toilet

641
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,640
don't give those to your friends all

642
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,519
right i think i've rambled on for extra

643
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,880
time that i needed to on this one ah my

644

buddy what is your name in this one i

645

we are anywho anyhow anyway it goes like

680
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,960
this this is squirrel master uh you

681
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,400
should get that tattooed on your

682
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,640
forearms put your arms like this

683
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
together and then get this is squirrel

684
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,640
master tattooed down your forearms that

685
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,798
would be [ __ ] gnarly um big up

686
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,400
squirrel master it says i was wondering

687
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,960
about light leaks and interrupter

688
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,720
interruptions in the vegetative phase

689
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,038
will this affect a vegging plant to the

690
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,440
point where it causes herming or other

691
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:52,839
things when the plants are

692
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,000
flowering

693
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:59,119
um light interruptions during veg won't

694
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,519
be major and catastrophic if you do it

695
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:02,959
on purpose multiple times the plant may

696
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:03,918
start tripping out on you and may show

697
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,400
you some

698
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,559
frustration some hormonal problems but

699
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,679
you can basically manipulate that light

700
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,798
pretty well

701
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,240
a couple of times in veg uh maybe you

702
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,000
want to go from like maybe just want to

703
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,599
completely change the schedule yeah do

704
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,200
it one time they won't notice like what

705
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,279
the [ __ ] was that then they'll just keep

706
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,880
growing uh if you do it like today and

707
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,879
then again in three days and again in a

708
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,919
few days they may start getting weird

709
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,000
shaped leaves because they're they're

710
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,799
just not sure what to do they'll react

711
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,640
just like you bro

712
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,079
once or twice they'll be like what the

713
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,000
[ __ ] was that and they'll get right back

714
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,960
on track but if you do it a few times

715
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,400
they're going to want to talk to the

716
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,400
manager they're like what the [ __ ] is

717
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,000
going on why do you keep waking me up

718
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,480
why am i sleeping then why are the

719
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,839
lights back on and why is it sun shiny

720
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,679
at three in the morning what's happening

721
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,678
but if you do it a couple times

722
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,840
mess with them a little bit and veg they

723
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,919
will be okay try to get them back on a

724
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,918
good day night cycle a good rhythm

725
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,799
before you put them into flower so that

726
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,159
they know like oh i've been on 18-6 and

727
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:01,679
they kind of have an idea and then when

728
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,200
you switch to 12 12 they'll notice

729
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,880
they'll be like oh now it's actually 12

730
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,278
12. because if you have a chaotic

731
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,559
schedule chaos chaos then you go to 12

732
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:10,960
12 they're going to be confused it'll

733
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:13,519
take a little bit longer i would expect

734
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,200
for them to realize oh that's really 12

735
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,960
12. i really should go into bloom

736
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,120
so i would give them minimal

737
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,798
interruptions as close to flower as

738
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,839
possible but i don't think that it will

739
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:27,278
cause major problems major concerns now

740
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,278
in the flowering phase i would really

741
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,480
try to avoid light leaks at all costs i

742
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,798
don't want light leaks light

743
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,480
interruptions schedule changes i really

744
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:36,240
try to keep that locked in once i'm in

745
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,480
the flowering phase

746
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,240
that is where you will see issues you

747
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,079
possibly will lead to intersex

748
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,400
expressions of your plants you'll start

749
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:47,678
seeing possible reveg start seeing

750
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,159
possible twisty coily leaves maybe slow

751
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,840
uh the real word is [ __ ] growth

752
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,360
don't flag me for that one that's the

753
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,119
real word the pla the growth of the

754
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,199
plant will be [ __ ] because the light

755
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,558
schedule is interrupted i won't look

756
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,440
like it's blooming the way that it

757
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:01,359
should you'll think you're in a

758
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,120
flowering stage but since you're getting

759
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,558
a light leak the plant just won't go

760
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:05,918
into flower it's like no it's still

761
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,599
light there's a little bit of light so

762
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,600
i'm supposed to stay in the vegetative

763
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,278
stage so make sure you've got full

764
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,519
darkness and flower but in the

765
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:15,440
vegetative stage you will be okay as

766
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,639
long as you're not out there [ __ ]

767
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,480
with the breaker just making sure

768
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,320
they're off and on don't turn it into a

769
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,720
rave let's not have a party in the grow

770
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:25,359
room but a couple of interruptions and i

771
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,400
