51
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:06,560
couple of fat dabs before the show here

52
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,478

smorgasbord you if you will of great

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
concentrates amongst those dabs was a

55
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,120
mix a combo of the lemon jeffrey and the

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,959
machine that dab made my vision go weird

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
it made my head feel funny in all the

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
right ways so i'm over here struggling

59
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,760

61
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:25,120

i've got an email portion of this

94
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:33,039
podcast we have not done any of that

95
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,599
let's jump into it

96
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:38,479
this question is not 100 cannabis

97
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,000
related but i feel like i am qualified

98
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,919
to answer this question i feel like my

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,439
friend orville was uh felt that i was

100
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:44,639
qualified because orville asked me this

101
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,199
question big shout out to my buddy

102
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,119
orville the question says really simply

103
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,039
how do you start a podcast i would like

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,640
to know that's a great question since

105
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:56,560
i'm 754 podcasts in i've got quite a

106
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,399
nice follow ship here a listenership a

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,840
viewership if you will we've got a good

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,280
audience we've built a good community

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,959
out of this get a lot of good

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,759
interaction here so i do feel like i may

111
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:09,519
be qualified to talk about starting a

112
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:12,079
podcast starting a podcast can be

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,400
very difficult or it could be very easy

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,639
it depends on how you want to make it

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,798
the one thing that i hear people say

116
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,759
about their podcast is they're going to

117
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,478
start it when or once i get this ready

118
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,639
i'm going to start it my advice is just

119
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,879
start it it is never going to be the

120
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,040
perfect time the podcast is never going

121
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,120
to be perfect you're never going to have

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,199
the perfect time to start a podcast the

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,399
perfect time to start a podcast is right

124
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,400
now because if you put in my opinion

125
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,159
if you put too much production into it

126
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,918
too much thought into it make it too big

127
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,160
of a production it puts too much

128
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,079
pressure on you and it won't it'll never

129
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,759
meet your standards this podcast i've

130
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,279
done

131
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,120
750-something episodes none of them have

132
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,799
been perfect but they've all come out

133
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,560
they've all served their purpose they're

134
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,319
all viewable listenable enjoyable they

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,839
all get a lot of good reaction it's

136
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,240
never going to be the perfect time the

137
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:03,839
perfect time is now since it's not

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,680
perfect you'll capture the moment

139
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,439
whatever the podcast is about there

140
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,280
needs to be a moment that is captured

141
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,560
you guys know kind of what's going on in

142
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,758
my life you know what's going on in my

143
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,839
greenhouse you know what's happening in

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
my grow you know small details about my

145
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,439
life because i share them here on the

146
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,960
podcast and you can capture the moment

147
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,000
here with me that is what's important so

148
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:23,279
don't make it too perfect i've done

149
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,759
754 episodes i don't feel any of them

150
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,279
were perfect but all of them were

151
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,199
perfect so don't wait for the perfect

152
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:31,439
episode don't wait for the perfect time

153
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,840
capture the moment i talked about making

154
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,918
making it hard or making it easy

155
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,679
one of the first things about a podcast

156
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,839
i guess is you need an idea what is the

157
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,959
show about you've got to talk about

158
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,478
something it's got to be something

159
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,000
you're at least passionate about

160
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,918
something you're educated about or

161
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,918
curious about or something that people

162
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,079
will want to hear you talk about what or

163
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,680
what is your topic if you're asking this

164
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,399
question you've probably already got an

165
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,478
idea

166
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,839
go with it if you are thinking about it

167
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,279
that means that there needs to be that

168
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,719
podcast if you want to start it there

169
00:05:57,279 --> 00:06:02,000
are probably people out there that want

170
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,160
to listen to it so have an idea then

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you'll need equipment um it doesn't take

172
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,840
a lot to get your idea from your brain

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,959
to your mouth into a microphone and onto

174
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:14,079
the internet it just takes a microphone

175
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:16,000
some sort of a usb recording device and

176
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,159
possibly some editing software and a

177
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,079
computer but some of that isn't even

178
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
necessary you could you could record

179
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,599
directly into your iphone you could open

180
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,279
up a voice app into your iphone and talk

181
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,360
into that and say what you have to say

182
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,119
and then send that file directly to a

183
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,520
website and have it posted to the

184
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,759
internet as a podcast you could take a

185
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:35,120
moment and edit that file if you wanted

186
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,960
or you could just send it up raw that's

187
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,160
called live the drive if you just talk

188
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,599
and then don't even edit don't do

189
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,280
anything to shine it up send it right

190
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,120
out to the world that is live to drive

191
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,439
that is possible if you want to be more

192
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
critical this show is well edited i use

193
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,519
a camera i use a microphone i record

194
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,479
simultaneously i match the files

195
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:52,399
together

196
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,719
using final cut pro then i edit them i

197
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,799
put stuff in it i make it look fancy it

198
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,360
can be as difficult or as simple as you

199
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,038
want it to be you need a microphone the

200
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
better the microphone obviously the

201
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,839
better the quality of the sound i am

202
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,359
using a shure sm7b this is one of the

203
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,679
top microphones available for

204
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,240
broadcasting for podcasting this is a

205
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
really great mic also it is not the

206
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,800
cheapest mic on the planet there are

207
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,879
many more

208
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,038
uh much more affordable microphones

209
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,800
available that will work for you as a

210
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,639
podcaster like i said you can use your

211
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,319
iphone you can use a little handheld

212
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,360
voice recorder you can get a good

213
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:28,879
microphone then if you get a sm7b you

214
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,160
need another piece just to power the mic

215
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,000
i've got a cloud lifter over here that

216
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,840
provides power for the microphone

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,399
because it needs some sort of juice you

218
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,478
can get as technical as you want to get

219
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,159
this microphone does not plug into my

220
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,918
computer directly my computer is not

221
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,840
here i don't need the macbook or any

222
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:47,038
sort of mac devices at this time i'm

223
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:50,000
running into a zoom pod track p4 so i'm

224
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,878
doing the sm7b into a cloud lifter into

225
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,399
the zoom p4 i'm capturing the audio file

226
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,080
on the p4

227
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:57,839
that is all you need if you want to do

228
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,159
an audio podcast that would be more than

229
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,478
enough to do an audio podcast when i'm

230
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,919
done i would if i were just to do that

231
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,079
when i were done i would take the file

232
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,079
from the zoom dump it into a computer

233
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,240
and edit it from there and then post it

234
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,399
to the website the rss feed however that

235
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,160
works that's a whole nother topic but

236
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,679
what i'm doing i'm doing another step

237
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
don't let me confuse you don't let me

238
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,319
overrun you i'm just letting you know

239
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,039
kind of what i do and giving you options

240
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:23,360
i go sm7b to the cloud lifter to the

241
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,759
zoom device i get the sound dialed in in

242
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,759
the zoom device then i use a headphone

243
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,120
out so i've got headphone one comes to

244
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,080
me headphone two is the uh small jack

245
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,599
going directly out into the input of the

246
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,599
camera so i've got a camera in front of

247
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,278
me i'm using the sony a7 iii is what i

248
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,640
think that one's called i can't see the

249
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,479
label i'm looking at the front face of

250
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,240
the camera can't see it great camera

251
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,759
camera one is awesome camera two can eat

252
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,000
my ass that thing only works half the

253
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,720
time can't figure it out uh but i'm

254
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,039
running it the headphone directly into

255
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,480
the input the mic input of the camera so

256
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,039
i'm getting straight from the zoom

257
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,800
device onto the same file my file is

258
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:00,879
synced up my audio and video are synced

259
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,719
i don't unless i make a mistake i don't

260
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,958
have to go into final cut pro and sync

261
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,399
them manually although i am recording

262
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:10,479
here on the zoom p4 audio format just as

263
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,399
a backup plan if this audio file on the

264
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,560
camera does go wrong i've at least got

265
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,639
the audio recording uh if the video

266
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,919
fails i don't do a second camera right

267
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,120
now because camera two was really

268
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,719
pissing me off to tell you the truth and

269
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,560
it made the file much larger to load to

270
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,399
youtube and it took too long

271
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:25,919
but i do have a backup of the audio if

272
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,278
the audio fails i've got that i'm

273
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,679
recording it twice on two different

274
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:33,439
formats so um

275
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:36,799
i go microphone cloud lifter usb device

276
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,880
then to the camera you could do a

277
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:41,838
microphone that links

278
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:44,639
excuse me you could do a microphone that

279
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,320
directly links via usb to your computer

280
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,240
and save a couple of steps but then you

281
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
need the computer to record all the time

282
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,440
i catch myself being distracted by the

283
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,039
graph on the computer and all the data

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
that the computer gives me i want to

285
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:56,159
play with the computer i end up staring

286
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,800
into it so i've kind of eliminated the

287
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,278
computer from my recording mix if i were

288
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,120
only producing if i were the producer

289
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,399
paying attention to the show and sound

290
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,240
levels and there were multiple people

291
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,519
with headphones and mics i would have a

292
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,680
computer in front of me so where i could

293
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,200
monitor the mix and if somebody got too

294
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,559
far from the mic i could say hey bro can

295
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
you lean into that mic so we can hear

296
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,039
you but i'm producing recording i'm

297
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,800
doing it all i'm talking i'm hosting

298
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,679
doing it all so i can't have so many

299
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:23,679
distractions but um so you need an idea

300
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,679
let's recap you need an idea what is the

301
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,239
show about is it about boats and hoes it

302
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,239
is about is it about cars and coffee is

303
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,639
it about weed and whiskey is it about

304
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,079
growing dope is it about playing guitar

305
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,000
is it about sneakers is there a sneaker

306
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,759
podcast out there ah there are a lot of

307
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,120
great podcasts what's your show about so

308
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,278
you need an idea then you need a

309
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,278
creative name all the podcasts need a

310
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,958
real cool name then you need equipment

311
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,519
obviously you need a microphone your

312
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,599
iphone would work something to get your

313
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,639
voice into a digital format that's

314
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,959
either a usb device a computer um that's

315
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,199
the the basics of it i like again i go

316
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,199
from the mic to the cloud lifter to a

317
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,278
usb interface and that goes to the

318
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
camera most of the time that would go to

319
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,278
a computer and you'd record it onto the

320
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,039
computer or a drive on the usb device

321
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:10,159
then you can edit it in software from

322
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:12,480
there then it's got to go to an rss feed

323
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,838
which you can create that using uh there

324
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,920
are a lot of ways to do it i've built my

325
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,519
own website and put my rss feed in my

326
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:18,719
own website it's much easier that way

327
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,159
for me

328
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
because i've got the website for some

329
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,559
people you don't have a website you may

330
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,958
want to use an rss hosting service

331
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:30,000
libsyn is great libsyn is short for

332
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,518
liberated syndicate so it's just lib syn

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,039
there are a couple other out other

334
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,120
services out there that would work for

335
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,120
you nobody pays me i don't get any

336
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:39,039
advertising fees or any sponsorships i

337
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,720
know that libsyn is a good product all

338
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,319
right so you're going to need gear an

339
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,600
idea then you're going to need a an rss

340
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,640
feed something about the gear i keep

341
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,320
talking about equipment and kind of

342
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,759
getting i don't want to be too specific

343
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
about the gear that you should buy it's

344
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,120
kind of about your budget and what works

345
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,639
for you there are a couple things to

346
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,320
think about

347
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,560
i come from the music industry i used to

348
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,879
work at guitar center i saw plenty of

349
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,399
people buy guitars for their kids they

350
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,000
were never going to make their kids

351
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,000
excited about playing music because no

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,440
matter what you do to that guitar it's

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,839
going to sound like a [ __ ] box with

354
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,440
strings on it it's a piece of wood with

355
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,200
strings to make kids think they got a

356
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,360
guitar to do parents into giving guitar

357
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,120
center 100 bucks never going to work out

358
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,039
well for you the kid's going to hate it

359
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,159
if they would have spent 250 on a guitar

360
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:21,679
they could have got a guitar that sounds

361
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,278
[ __ ] good every time they play it

362
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,799
that kid would be playing guitar every

363
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,120
day and be excited about it so get

364
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:29,039
equipment that is not the cheapest get

365
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,679
something that inspires you to use it

366
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:33,759
something that makes you sound good also

367
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,599
get equipment that you can use there are

368
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,519
a lot of buttons a lot of knobs a lot of

369
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,560
toys when you get into podcasting i

370
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,120
don't know

371
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,799
your technical abilities or limitations

372
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,799
or experience i don't know anything

373
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,278
about you right now so i'm just politely

374
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,519
saying get the gear that works for your

375
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:51,519
ability because uh you can definitely

376
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,399
out gear yourself i did it when i moved

377
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,399
up from

378
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,919
the video format or the audio format to

379
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,919
the video format that was a learning

380
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,838
curve i out geared myself

381
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,120
my computer said oh you're going to put

382
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
videos into me you got to get a new

383
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
computer so i got a new computer and

384
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,480
then i realized oh this is really easy

385
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,560
to edit this i want to get a 4k camera i

386
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,079
got a 4k camera and the computer is like

387
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,078
nope got to upgrade one more time so i

388
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:13,679
had to upgrade again ah there was a huge

389
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,199
learning curve learning to sync two

390
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,479
videos together and get the audio and

391
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,720
everything right that was a learning

392
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,800
curve so get the gear

393
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
that is within your technical abilities

394
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:24,879
don't out gear yourself that is

395
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,359
something that i see musicians

396
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,720
podcasters men we like to just [ __ ]

397
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,079
out gear ourselves if we've made a

398
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
couple of bucks this month and we got

399
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,759
into a new hobby you can guarantee i'm

400
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,519
gonna buy something [ __ ] ridiculous

401
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:37,039
to go with my new hobby i don't just

402
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,679
want cupcakes i want cupcakes with

403
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:41,439
[ __ ] sprinkles if i'm doing cupcakes

404
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,399
all right so get an idea get good

405
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,320
equipment get an rss feed get equipment

406
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,919
that you can afford but is good

407
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
equipment that is not cheap equipment

408
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,000
that inspires you to work but is also

409
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,559
not too confusing for you

410
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,198
then the hardest part for some people is

411
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,119
just sit down and [ __ ] press record

412
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:00,719
if it's a solo podcast you've only got

413
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,198
to wait for you to get in the room i can

414
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,079
record uh to date full disclosure it is

415
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,919
6 40 p.m as i record right now the last

416
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,159
episode i recorded i think i completed

417
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,679
around three in the morning so i can

418
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,600
record whenever i want it's just me

419
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,000
chilling i've got a really weird

420
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,839
schedule with my life i fit in podcasts

421
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,078
when i feel i've got to be in the mood i

422
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,760
got to be in the zone uh if i'm tired if

423
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,120
i'm lazy the podcast won't be any good

424
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,639
so i wait till i'm

425
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
uppity i've had some food i've had some

426
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,240
smoke i've had some kombucha in my

427
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,278
bloodstream i'm going to feel good can

428
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,799
do a good podcast so um just do it if

429
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,320
you're solo sit down and do it if you've

430
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,319
got a way for other people that is one

431
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,040
of the hardest things about podcasting

432
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,600
is getting one two or three other people

433
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,120
to join you for the show unless there's

434
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,120
advertising money or some sort of

435
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,198
commitment on the line it's really hard

436
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,919
to get people there so the hardest part

437
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:51,599
is just go make an outline for episode

438
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,159
one make an outline for episode two make

439
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,040
an outline for episode three hit record

440
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:58,799
and bang out episode one maybe

441
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,120
if you really want to i wouldn't even do

442
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,319
it record episode zero

443
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,480
put on the cameras put on the

444
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,320
microphones and just talk for 30 minutes

445
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,560
with your friends see what it's like and

446
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,320
then take notes as you're doing it um

447
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,958
the guy on mic one talks too much the

448
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,959
guy on mic three is too quiet the girl

449
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:16,799
on mic 4 we can barely hear her because

450
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,559
we got to turn up her microphone the

451
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,479
camera wasn't picking up the guest in

452
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,078
chair number three just

453
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,159
write down the things you're noticing

454
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:25,919
for episode zero and then everybody

455
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,078
watch episode zero together and then you

456
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,639
have an idea what you do and do not want

457
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,399
to do i like episode one just do episode

458
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,560
one and put it out then you've got

459
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,799
documentation of where the show was in

460
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,559
the beginning this show is nothing like

461
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,639
what it was in episode one we have come

462
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,359
i have come so far that's a totally

463
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,680
different podcast uh my approach my

464
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,240
delivery my editing everything is way

465
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,319
different and i am slightly embarrassed

466
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,079
of episode one but also that's where we

467
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,839
were at that time it's a time capsule i

468
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,838
could easily take it off the internet

469
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,480
but why that's what i said that's what

470
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,800
we did that's how it was it is there so

471
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,278
just press record just go the hardest

472
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:05,120
part of starting a podcast is starting i

473
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,639
know so many people that have the idea

474
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,039
they've drawn the logo they've built the

475
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,799
rss feed they got the [ __ ] 600

476
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,240
microphone sitting on the table they've

477
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,599
got everything they've played around

478
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,399
they've done sound check but they've

479
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,199
never sat down and said hi i'm ross to

480
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,440
jeff this is my podcast this is what

481
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:22,719
it's going to be about join me there's

482
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,920
going to be a lot of growth and a lot of

483
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,000
progression through this time of

484
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,679
developing this podcast and i hope that

485
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,919
you're here from the beginning all the

486
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,679
way until the end whenever that may be

the first couple episodes are going to

491
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:41,360

498
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,838
developed along with this podcast

499
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,360
if i post a youtube video and somebody

500
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,600
doesn't like something i said in there

501
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,159
and they attack me i sit back and laugh

502
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,240
because all of my social media followers

503
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,558
all of my youtube supporters all of the

504
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,318
irie army all of the podcast listeners

505
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,318
they roast the person who tried to bash

506
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:11,759
me and i don't even have to say anything

507
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,599
that is the type of community that we

508
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,959
have built and all it took was

509
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,399
consecutive reliable episodes that are

510
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,839
real they're from my heart like i said a

511
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,000
moment ago i don't record a show that

512
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:24,000

527
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,639

528
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,720

529
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,880
along with your podcast do as much as

530
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,960
you can to interact with the people that

531
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,640

532
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,279

533
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,440

everywhere but it's up to the audience

536
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,079

i'm really spread thin lately and uh

552
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:40,960
it's it's not gonna ease up which is a

553
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,479
good thing when things are busy that

554
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
means business is successful when it

555
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,599
slows down i start freaking out so

556
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,760
um advertise your stuff um find ways to

557
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:52,240
advertise your podcast social media is

558
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:54,160
free it's the best uh find certain

559
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,919
niches what is your podcast about is it

560
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,960
underwater basket weaving is that

561
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,080
medieval

562
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,000
shield making is it [ __ ] tattoos and

563
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,759
tattoos are cool by themselves

564
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,200
an audio podcast about tattoos would be

565
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,119
awkward though anyway what is your

566
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,759
podcast about let's say your podcast is

567
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,599
about tattoos advertise in a tattoo

568
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:14,160
magazine if that's what you want to do

569
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,678
go where the tattoo people are then find

570
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,919
the fringe of where the tattoo people

571
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,840
are where also are they they're in pop

572
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,280
culture they're in the motorcycle world

573
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,279
they're in the fashion world they're in

574
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,678
the hair world that the barber shop you

575
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:27,440
could advertise your tattoo podcast

576
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,000
think about other ways to advertise and

577
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
get out of your bubble but also include

578
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,880
your bubble because you want your crowd

579
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,919
to be your crowd so get an idea get some

580
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,160
gear create an rss feed then press

581
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,520
[ __ ] record and start going

582
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,000
it's gonna feel weird i know i've said

583
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,079
that before i still hate editing my own

584
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,599

and listen to me for 30 minutes i've

586
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,480
already said all this [ __ ] once i don't

587
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,679

589
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,360
get used to hearing your own voice it'll

590
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,798
drive you crazy but just accept it other

591
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,240

595
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:10,158
internet and wait just let people

596
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,480
respond let them react then consistently

597
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,320
and reliably put out your episodes on a

598
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,480
schedule that is really important in my

599
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:18,399
opinion my people know that monday and

600
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,240
thursday there's a show if the show

601

isn't there i get messages they're

602
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,440
waiting they're hungry they're relying

603
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:24,879
on me you'll begin to manifest

604
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,159
relationships with your audience and

605
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,000
you'll start remembering people when

606
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,760
they start emailing you and messaging

607
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,558

gear get an rss feed press record say

609
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,639

610
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,480
it feel good if you want to post it up

611
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,360
to the internet and wait to see what the

612
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:43,679
world says then when the world bashes

613
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:45,839
you don't be surprised because the

614
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,919
internet is a big old hater think about

615
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:50,079
this when you go to a restaurant how

616
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,919

617
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:53,599

672
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,960
it'll come in it just kicks in one day

673
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,319
it's usually around episode 5 or episode

674
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,319
30. you'll start going oh what am i

675
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,079
doing why am i doing this push through

676
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,558
the imposter syndrome you're doing this

677
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:54,879
because you are the one to do this you

678
00:22:52,558 --> 00:22:56,639
chose to do this whatever you believe in

679
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,000
chose you to be the spokesperson for

680
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,240
this you guys know what i believe and i

681
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,400
call myself rasta jeff they call me ross

682
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,200
to jeff i believe the most i jaw has

683
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,640
called me and asks me politely to teach

684
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,080
you guys how to grow cannabis if i

685
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,919
didn't

686
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:10,960
use this gift that i've got i've got the

687
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,559
gift to

688
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,159
read a paper and get some instructions

689
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,399
and then go apply that in my grow room

690
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,000
and make the paper into useful data

691
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,679
because what it says on paper is often

692
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,440
good theory but in practice in the grow

693
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,640
room it doesn't [ __ ] work

694
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,480
the books are written by people who've

695
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,679
never grown the weed they've only talked

696
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
about it and read about it and been to

697
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,559
college they've never been in the grow

698
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,240
room i've been in there so i read the

699
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,798
book i went in the grow room and i'm

700
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,120
able to take my reading and my hands on

701
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,359
and i can spit it back out in a way that

702
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:39,119
most people can enjoy and absorb and

703
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:40,639
learn from it if i didn't do that if i

704
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:43,119
didn't put that gift back out to the

705
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,278
world i feel it would be disrespectful

706
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,359
to whatever you believe in you know what

707
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:48,798
i believe in i'm not judgmental on what

708
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,319
you believe in i agree with you we just

709
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:52,798
call it by a different name bro whatever

710
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,558

711

to be very long and i feel like i

720
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,080
