financially you can do so by going to

49
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,280
www.whitehouse.gov/champions

50
00:02:14,129 --> 00:02:18,210
to address a question about spray

51
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,030
applications to take care of powdery

52
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:23,490
mildew and pests let's jump into that I

53
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,319
was in an Instagram live feed today and

54
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:27,120
somebody kept asking questions about

55
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,949
what they can spray to take care of

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,710
powdery mildew then they asked what they

57
00:02:28,949 --> 00:02:34,349
can spray to take care of their bugs now

58
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,870
spraying is a good way to minimize a

59
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:39,269
pest population spraying is a good way

60
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:42,569
to minimize potential powdery mildew

61
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,900
problems but spraying products is not a

62
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:47,340
long-term solution to cure problems in a

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,530
grow environment so let's talk about

64
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,060
that for a little bit here the plants in

65
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,620
this person's garden are obviously

66
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,659
displaying but they are infected with

67
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,610
powdery mildew you can see it is visible

68
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:58,859
it is present now it's going to be

69
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,600
really easy to grab a product and spray

70
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:02,400
it all over those plants and wash that

71
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,409
powdery mildew off and act like we have

72
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,300
just solved the problem it's not visible

73
00:03:04,409 --> 00:03:08,129
it's out of sight it's out of mind we

74
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,590
think it may be cured the problem is

75
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:12,719
solved let's move forward it is not that

76
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,250
simple depending on the product you

77
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,259
applied depending on the environment

78
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,270
depending on the conditions that powdery

79
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:20,579
mildew has a very good potential of

80
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,590
coming back all you did was give that

81
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,360
plant a little bath you did not destroy

82
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:26,370
you did not kill that powdery mildew you

83
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,410
just rinsed it off you probably just

84
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:30,060
spread it out to tell you the truth so

85
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,069
your powdery mildew is going to come

86
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,780
back all we have done is a temporary fix

87
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,400
it looks like it's gone but it is going

88
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,199
to come back and it is going to be worse

89
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,819
then what are you going to do when it

90
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:40,560
comes back with a vengeance you had a

91
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:42,060
little powdery mildew you sprayed it

92
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,469
with a product that kind of knocked it

93
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,659
down for a little bit but then when it

94
00:03:43,469 --> 00:03:46,800
came back it was even stronger now what

95
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,419
are you going to do you're gonna spray

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,490
again so that it can come back even

97
00:03:48,419 --> 00:03:52,259
stronger and then as the plants get

98
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,480
older as the cycle progresses you're

99
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,219
going to get big fat juicy buds are you

100
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,319
going to spray those I don't want to

101
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:00,030
consume your buds they were sprayed with

102
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,250
any sort of product that is used to

103
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:04,169
treat powdery mildew once your plants

104
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:06,000
get big fat buds if you continue to

105
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,799
spray them you're going to destroy the

106
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,900
flavor you're going to destroy the aroma

107
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,490
they're gonna burn funky your buds are

108
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,709
gonna taste funny and a lot of

109
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,840
commercial grow environments I see

110
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,238
people attempt to use a sulphur burner

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,519
to minimize the risk of powdery mildew

112
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,039
that works to get rid of powdery mildew

113
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,709
but it also puts a terrible shitty

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,080
sulfur flavor in the finished product

115
00:04:25,709 --> 00:04:29,788
also if you turn that finish prod

116
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,370
into a concentrate it makes the

117
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:35,219
concentrate tastes like burnt fish it is

118
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,918
disgusting so do not use a sulfur burner

119
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:38,580
in your grow that is my advice that is

120
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,008
my opinion

121
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:43,288
many people will argue with that I do

122
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,939
not like it I do not approve you will be

123
00:04:43,288 --> 00:04:47,728
able to taste it and it will ruin your

124
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,589
concentrates so I highly advise against

125
00:04:47,728 --> 00:04:51,779
the sulfur burner now let's talk more

126
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:53,279
about spraying what are you gonna do are

127
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:55,799
you just gonna keep spraying forever

128
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,929
spraying will not last forever spring is

129
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,819
like a temporary band-aid for whatever

130
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,860
problem you have got if you've got a

131
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:03,360
giant gash on your arm you need some

132
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,979
stitches are you just gonna keep putting

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,598
little band-aids over it every day and

134
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:08,279
hope that [ __ ] closes are you just gonna

135
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:10,069
suck it up and go to the ER and get

136
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,089
seven stitches and get that [ __ ] fixed

137
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:14,189
sometimes you need to just bite the

138
00:05:12,089 --> 00:05:15,899
bullet and fix the grow room you need to

139
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:17,639
figure out the problem and you need to

140
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:20,310
correct the issue and quit spraying

141
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,228
every day spraying will get expensive if

142
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,120
you have a small garden it may not add

143
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:26,699
up as quickly if you are in a commercial

144
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,699
environment spraying a large room will

145
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:31,620
become very expensive very quickly first

146
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:33,478
you have to buy whatever product you

147
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,610
were going to apply if you have a large

148
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:38,068
room a large facility you're buying a

149
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,990
lot of product then you need an

150
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:41,550
applicator that is going to get

151
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,139
expensive depending on the size of your

152
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,639
grow the size of your environment you

153
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,650
need something that can effectively and

154
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,750
efficiently cover all of your plants

155
00:05:46,649 --> 00:05:51,629
with the pesticide product you choose to

156
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:54,028
use then once you've got the products

157
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:56,129
you need to pay somebody to apply that

158
00:05:54,028 --> 00:05:58,139
product to your grow they're using

159
00:05:56,129 --> 00:06:00,240
manpower that you're using time also

160
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:02,460
they're damaging the plants they're

161
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,079
decreasing the overall quality of your

162
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:06,810
finished product by applying that

163
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:09,120
pesticide also you are cutting that room

164
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,879
off for work for the rest of the day in

165
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,668
most cases a pesticide application will

166
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:16,710
have a re-entry interval in which you

167
00:06:14,668 --> 00:06:19,079
are not allowed to enter that room until

168
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:22,228
that time period has passed most

169
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:25,348
pesticides have a minimum of a four hour

170
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:27,449
re-entry interval in most cases that is

171
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:29,519
half of a work shift so that will

172
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,468
eliminate access to that room for the

173
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,089
rest of the staff for probably half the

174
00:06:31,468 --> 00:06:34,680
day so if there was more work to be done

175
00:06:33,089 --> 00:06:36,508
in there you're [ __ ] out of luck you

176
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,550
can't be foliate you can't do any of the

177
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,080
extra ketchup work you can't put up

178
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,788
trellising you can't do any popping and

179
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,359
twisting because that room is off-limits

180
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:45,509
now

181
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:47,490
it is shut down it is under a re-entry

182
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,800
interval and the door is marked do not

183
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,228
enter until this time so applying

184
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,389
pesticides will become costly and in the

185
00:06:52,228 --> 00:06:56,068
long run correcting the issue that is

186
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:58,139
causing the problem will be more

187
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,718
efficient than reapplying pesticides

188
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:02,550
every three days I didn't even think

189
00:07:00,718 --> 00:07:04,649
about the cost of training an employee

190
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,120
to spray that room that employee has to

191
00:07:04,649 --> 00:07:08,878
be trained they have to have Department

192
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,978
of Agriculture pesticide safety training

193
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:14,759
if they want to apply a pesticide they

194
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:16,949
have to have a OSHA and OSHA respirator

195
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,810
fit certification which means they have

196
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:20,310
to go to a doctor and they have to put

197
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:22,740
on the respirator that they intend to

198
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:24,269
use when they apply pesticides and they

199
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,069
have to show that they know how to put

200
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:27,508
on that respirator correctly they have

201
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:28,919
to show that it fits them correctly

202
00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:30,419
around their face and there are no air

203
00:07:28,918 --> 00:07:32,128
leaks and they have to show that they

204
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:34,019
can remove it correctly without getting

205
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:35,580
pesticides on their face and they also

206
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:36,870
have to show that they can clean it and

207
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:38,938
keep it up to date

208
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,918
that is an expensive class that is an

209
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:42,449
expensive doctor appointment so that is

210
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:44,519
another thing that you have to pay for

211
00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:46,740
when it comes to a pesticide applicator

212
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:49,500
also you have to pay for all of the

213
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,389
personal protective equipment every time

214
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,218
somebody applies a pesticide they need

215
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,710
to suit up in a commercial environment

216
00:07:53,218 --> 00:07:57,689
anybody that I am responsible for wears

217
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:59,878
a full tiebacks suit when they are

218
00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:01,769
applying a pesticide they are suited up

219
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,750
from head to toe they've got the hood up

220
00:08:01,769 --> 00:08:05,519
they've got the appropriate goggles some

221
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:07,019
of my dudes wear that big full face mask

222
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,609
respirator that covers your whole face

223
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:10,918
you look like the [ __ ] SWAT team I

224
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:13,259
like that one really well we were at

225
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:14,698
least six millimeter thick gloves

226
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:16,588
depending on the pesticides we are

227
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:17,848
applying most of the time it's a six

228
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:19,379
millimeter sometimes a little bit

229
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:20,610
thicker of a glove we've got the

230
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,800
appropriate gloves based on the

231
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,990
pesticides we're using we are suited up

232
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,509
all of that [ __ ] is very expensive

233
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,519
those Tyvek suits are one-time use you

234
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:31,468
go in the room you spray you get coated

235
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,939
and pesticide you got to take that suit

236
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:34,139
off and throw it away you basically do

237
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:36,240
your best to step out of it without

238
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,069
touching it too much those respirator

239
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,168
cartridges those are expensive to

240
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:42,390
replace the respirators are quite

241
00:08:40,168 --> 00:08:44,429
expensive to replace all of the gloves

242
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,809
we go through are extremely expensive

243
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,039
when you go through them and the volumes

244
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:49,259
that we do in a commercial grow

245
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,719
environment all of those little costs

246
00:08:49,259 --> 00:08:53,669
will add up and in the long run whatever

247
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:56,009
was causing your powdery mildew issue

248
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:59,039
would probably have been cheaper just

249
00:08:56,009 --> 00:09:00,779
to correct that in one big bite that is

250
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,209
a good way to segue into some of the

251
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,669
things that are probably causing the

252
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,800
powdery mildew in my opinion the most

253
00:09:05,669 --> 00:09:08,579
common cause of powdery mildew is an

254
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,339
incorrect

255
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:14,340
VPD that's right vapor pressure deficit

256
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,930
I've done a full Episode on VPD if you

257
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,910
were interested in learning a lot about

258
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:19,889
vapor pressure deficit I recommend

259
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:21,569
episode 314 of the growth from your

260
00:09:19,889 --> 00:09:24,360
heart podcast it is actually titled

261
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,150
vapor pressure deficit that episode will

262
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:29,879
teach you a lot but I think VPD is the

263
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,009
most common cause of powdery mildew and

264
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:33,840
that includes excessive heat and high

265
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:36,240
humidity another thing that I think

266
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:38,700
really contributes to powdery mildew is

267
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,409
temperature swings diurnal temperature

268
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,840
swing when your day and night

269
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:45,569
temperature change if your day is 80

270
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,040
degrees and your night is 60 degrees you

271
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,750
are giving yourself a really good

272
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:51,779
opportunity for powdery mildew

273
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,029
development try not to have more than a

274
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,519
five to seven degrees swing and your

275
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:58,709
diurnal temperatures 10 degrees max may

276
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:01,110
be 12 degrees I'd like to see you stay

277
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:04,050
within 5 to 7 degrees temperature swing

278
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:06,149
from day to night 10 degrees is cool 12

279
00:10:04,049 --> 00:10:07,500
degrees is pushing it 15 to 20

280
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:10,079
you're gonna start causing yourself

281
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,259
problems another thing that I think

282
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,060
often contributes to powdery mildew is

283
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:17,069
excessive water left in the grow room

284
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,839
sometimes I see small puddles in a

285
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,610
commercial environment just because [ __ ]

286
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,320
happens in the grow we're busy sometimes

287
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,300
we're cleaning things sometimes we're

288
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,340
watering things sometimes we just spill

289
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:27,899
some [ __ ] and there is water left in the

290
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,759
grow sometimes there's a bucket left

291
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,559
somewhere with water in it sometimes the

292
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,659
tables the flood to drain tables will

293
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:35,399
get clogged with debris at the drain and

294
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:37,049
you don't clean that out and then the

295
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,639
table will get a little layer of water

296
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:40,500
in there then you start seeing that

297
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,049
little green algae buildup on your table

298
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,750
that will also contribute to powdery

299
00:10:43,049 --> 00:10:48,479
mildew another thing I think contributes

300
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,980
to powdery mildew is improper airflow I

301
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,960
talked about in a previous episode

302
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,330
people squish their plants too close

303
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:56,610
together that will contribute to powdery

304
00:10:54,330 --> 00:11:00,240
mildew also you need some fans in the

305
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:02,730
room move some air around also another

306
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,220
critical thing you can't just move air

307
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,320
around we need air exchange you have to

308
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,360
get that old stagnant air out and put

309
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,050
some fresh air in the room you need a

310
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,209
dehumidifier

311
00:11:10,049 --> 00:11:14,250
fire you may need a humidifier and you

312
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,018
need air exchange some folks may be

313
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:18,149
working a sealed environment they are

314
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:19,679
advanced growers they understand how to

315
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:21,208
control the environment and keep things

316
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,799
safe if they're running a sealed

317
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:24,719
environment I'm pretty confident in

318
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,699
their skills they're running co2 to

319
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,500
augment the co2 to keep the co2 high in

320
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,269
there they don't need much advice on

321
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:33,089
keeping the powdery mildew under control

322
00:11:30,269 --> 00:11:35,730
hopefully at this point another thing I

323
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:37,200
see that people commonly overlooked when

324
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:40,289
they are starting to have powdery mildew

325
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,209
issues is defoliation if you've got

326
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:44,069
powdery mildew on a leaf why not pull

327
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:46,799
the damn leaf off take it off of there

328
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:48,959
that is less opportunity for a bug or a

329
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,208
piece of mildew to attach itself to your

330
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,219
plant less places to hang out less

331
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:55,649
things to hang out that is just good

332
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,750
logic in my opinion also you will reduce

333
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:59,549
the amount of water that those plants

334
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,589
release into the air because there are

335
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:03,149
not as many leaves basically there

336
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,550
aren't as many mouth breathers in there

337
00:12:03,149 --> 00:12:06,929
spitting out a bunch of hot air so d

338
00:12:05,549 --> 00:12:08,549
foliate and that will help you out

339
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:11,250
another thing that will help you

340
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:14,069
tremendously is to just basically clean

341
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:16,320
up the grow space I talk a lot about

342
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:18,660
cleaning up I find it really important

343
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,149
to clean up the gross space also clean

344
00:12:18,659 --> 00:12:23,219
your tools if you're going from one

345
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,078
plant to another plant or from one table

346
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,910
to another table why not just dip your

347
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:28,799
scissors and do some rubbing alcohol and

348
00:12:26,909 --> 00:12:31,409
dry them off with a paper towel and keep

349
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,969
moving sterilize your [ __ ] that way if

350
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:34,319
one plant infected with something you

351
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:36,778
don't move it right along through the

352
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,390
entire garden which is another great way

353
00:12:36,778 --> 00:12:40,500
to segue into this next bullet point I

354
00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:41,879
don't have any of this [ __ ] written down

355
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,958
you guys this is all flying out at the

356
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,909
top of my head just so that you know

357
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,699
that today the next thing I was going to

358
00:12:44,909 --> 00:12:49,559
talk about is infected clones another

359
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,509
way that I see people bring powdery

360
00:12:49,559 --> 00:12:53,819
mildew into a grow is by bringing a

361
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:56,519
clone from a friend or a dispensary or

362
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:59,399
wherever that had powdery mildew on that

363
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:02,159
clone already quite often clones travel

364
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:04,620
around our country allegedly clones may

365
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:07,500
happen to go across the country in a

366
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,509
sealed baggie and then also inside of a

367
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:10,740
box and they are moved from one point to

368
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:12,708
another and they are left in that

369
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,940
packaging for quite some time

370
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:16,469
often when those clones are opened up

371
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,020
they have developed powdery mildew

372
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:20,910
inside that packaging the person who

373
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,740
received that package is so excited to

374
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:23,669
get that new clone that they don't give

375
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,710
a [ __ ] about the

376
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,389
powdery mildew they forget to look they

377
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:28,800
pop that clone into a little bit of dirt

378
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,929
they put it right into the general

379
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,699
population of their grow room they put

380
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:34,919
it right next to the fan and then in

381
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:37,110
three or four days the entire room has

382
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,899
got a nice little sprinkle a powdery

383
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:42,300
mildew that is a very very common way

384
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:44,039
for folks to get PM you get a clone from

385
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:45,929
a friend you get a clone from a

386
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:47,699
dispensary maybe you get a clone from a

387
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:49,699
friend online or something like that and

388
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:52,379
it ends up in your grow and you have now

389
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:54,930
contaminated your entire grow that is a

390
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:56,639
big mistake if you ever get a new plant

391
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:58,019
from anybody I don't care if it's your

392
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,149
best friend I don't care if it's your

393
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:02,069
mama I don't care if it's your mentor if

394
00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:04,740
you get a new clone from anybody

395
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:07,200
quarantine that clone and make sure that

396
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,940
it is pests and pathogens for you

397
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:12,360
introduce that plant into your general

398
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:14,610
population as a responsible gardener you

399
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:16,919
cannot blame your friends your fellow

400
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,930
growers whoever gave you that clone for

401
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,479
giving you powdery mildew spider mites

402
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:24,000
thrips whatever comes with that plant is

403
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,680
not their fault it is your fault for not

404
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,289
being responsible and treating that

405
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:30,000
clone as if it had every bug and

406
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:31,860
pathogen on the planet when it was

407
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,899
brought to your grow it is your

408
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:36,180
responsibility to make sure that plant

409
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,949
is clean everybody thinks their garden

410
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:40,139
is clean everybody thinks their plants

411
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:42,240
are pests and pathogens free most of

412
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,189
those people are wrong what I found is

413
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,049
the people who boast the most about

414
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:48,240
having a clean and pests and pathogens

415
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:49,889
free garden are the ones with the most

416
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,070
problems they just haven't discovered

417
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,750
the problems yet so be very careful all

418
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:56,430
right so I have talked about how we get

419
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,980
powdery mildew I've talked about how

420
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,509
sprays are only temporarily effective

421
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,399
and how they will not solve the problem

422
00:15:00,509 --> 00:15:04,919
for a long term so let's talk about

423
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,990
things we can do to correct the room and

424
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,659
make sure we do not get powdery mildew

425
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:12,570
ever again first off let's start

426
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:14,959
treating any incoming plants with proper

427
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:17,490
pesticides and proper fungicide sprays

428
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,320
now yes I have been ranting that sprays

429
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:21,000
are not the solution to everything but

430
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,980
if you're bringing something in you want

431
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,539
to spray it you want to treat it so that

432
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:26,310
you don't introduce a problem to the

433
00:15:24,539 --> 00:15:27,899
rest of your grow you don't want

434
00:15:26,309 --> 00:15:29,849
somebody else's problems we can't

435
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:31,350
correct their room so let's correct the

436
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:33,000
plant that they brought us that's where

437
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,190
we have to start now let's make sure

438
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,289
that the room we are going to put that

439
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,000
new plant into is prop

440
00:15:37,289 --> 00:15:41,579
let's make sure we have got the proper

441
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,840
VPD I'm going to leave it up to you to

442
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,480
understand and study

443
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,180
VPD once again I did a podcast all about

444
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,789
it it is episode 314 check that out

445
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:53,759
get your VPD dialed in get your

446
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:56,250
temperature and humidity dialed in get

447
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:58,740
your air flow dialed in make sure you

448
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:00,929
don't have any microclimates in your

449
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,690
gross space what that means is is it 80

450
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:06,059
degrees over here is it 72 degrees over

451
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:08,490
here is it 68 degrees down here under

452
00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:11,519
this canopy you need enough airflow to

453
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,960
keep a homogeneous environment you want

454
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,659
it eighty degrees over here eighty

455
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,790
degrees over here 60% humidity over here

456
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:19,980
60% humidity over here you don't want

457
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:21,839
big swings and jumps throughout the room

458
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,350
so maybe another thing that you may need

459
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,840
is a proper grow room monitor something

460
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,610
that can actually monitor the VPD of

461
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,810
your room you need to pay attention to

462
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:32,639
those things if we don't know what's

463
00:16:30,809 --> 00:16:35,339
going on in there we don't know what is

464
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:37,009
causing problems so dial in the VPD

465
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,320
dial in the temperature and the humidity

466
00:16:37,009 --> 00:16:43,919
get your air flow up to speed clean up

467
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:46,200
the room remove any excess water that

468
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,419
does not need to be in the room maybe

469
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,280
you're over watering the plants perhaps

470
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:52,189
you were trying to saturate your medium

471
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:54,449
a little too heavily maybe you need to

472
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,720
saturate a little less and let the

473
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:59,640
medium dry and then water again instead

474
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,279
of one big fat watering through the day

475
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,740
may be due to medium waterings that way

476
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,779
you have less water in the air less

477
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,029
water in the room that will help you out

478
00:17:06,779 --> 00:17:11,160
another thing I highly suggest to help

479
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:14,129
you minimize the potential of powdery

480
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,769
mildew is to defoliate the less leaf in

481
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,709
the room the less potential for problems

482
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:21,690
I also suggest that you dial in your

483
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,459
diurnal temperature swings you don't

484
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,838
want drastic swings from your day and

485
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,240
night temperatures make sure things

486
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:29,970
aren't going crazy there also make sure

487
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,980
your humidity swings aren't crazy when

488
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:33,900
your lights go off so you've got the

489
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,640
lights on all day that is putting heat

490
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,650
in the air that is making the water rise

491
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,330
then the lights go off all that moisture

492
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:41,190
is in the air it doesn't know what to do

493
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:42,929
the humidity spikes it goes crazy in the

494
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,240
room for a few minutes if you've got the

495
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,860
proper monitoring gear you can see what

496
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,779
is happening if the lights on and lights

497
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:50,399
off in your room and in a lot of cases

498
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,589
that is where we start develop

499
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,670
being powdery mildew problems so make

500
00:17:52,589 --> 00:17:55,049
sure you're not getting temperature

501
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,360
swings make sure you're not getting

502
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:59,129
humidity spikes then another thing we

503
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,349
can think about is to make sure that

504
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:04,170
none of the air being drawn into the

505
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:05,730
room is extremely cool some growers like

506
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:07,470
to pull air from outside during the

507
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,599
winter because they think that helps

508
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,940
cool the room that is actually giving

509
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:13,439
you a huge potential for powdery mildew

510
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:15,360
you're bringing that cool air into the

511
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,549
warm grow room it is going to create

512
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:20,579
moisture and that will begin to create

513
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:22,409
perfect conditions for powdery mildew so

514
00:18:20,579 --> 00:18:24,029
if you take some time to correct your

515
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,680
vapor pressure deficit get your

516
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:27,569
temperature and your humidity dialed in

517
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:29,910
make sure that your air flow is proper

518
00:18:27,569 --> 00:18:32,549
clean up that grow room maybe add a few

519
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,740
fans maybe add an extraction fan so that

520
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:36,569
you can suck that humidity out maybe add

521
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,940
an intake fan so that you can suck some

522
00:18:36,569 --> 00:18:41,250
fresh air into the room maybe some small

523
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,289
adjustments will help you minimize the

524
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,460
risks of getting powdery mildew now

525
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,230
here's something that just came to my

526
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,269
mind when I was talking about moving air

527
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,309
around this is something funny that I

528
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:52,650
see in a lot of commercial environments

529
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:54,809
so you've got multiple flowering rooms

530
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:57,060
and multiple bedrooms in one big

531
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,009
building so a lot of times there's a

532
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:01,470
hallway in most facilities there's one

533
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:03,809
long hallway with flowering rooms all

534
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:05,430
along one side and flowering rooms all

535
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:07,950
along another side just separated by

536
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:09,150
walls and doors so basically like an

537
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,590
apartment building you got a long haul

538
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:11,850
when you got apartment a apartment B

539
00:19:10,589 --> 00:19:14,429
apartment C and then on the other side

540
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:16,559
you got D en F right except I do in my

541
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:19,019
letters in numbers just cuz I'm weird so

542
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,179
weird ugh a lot of facilities I see

543
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:23,700
their ducting the heat straight out of

544
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,980
room a into that hallway their ducting

545
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,720
that heat straight out of room B into

546
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,170
the hallway their ducting the heat from

547
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,120
room C into the hallway also their air

548
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,980
conditioner take intake is in the

549
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,989
hallway so you're just dumping hot air

550
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,130
into the hallway and then trying to suck

551
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:40,140
that right back up through the air

552
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,850
conditioner in take all that humid air

553
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:43,650
all that stagnant air is just going

554
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,899
right back into the grow you're fighting

555
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:47,490
yourself think about your ducting think

556
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,840
about efficiency that way are you

557
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,789
heating up a room where you're pulling

558
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,709
your air conditioning air through are

559
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:54,659
you humidifying a room that you're

560
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,250
trying to be humidify are you dumping

561
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,840
the hot air into a room where you're

562
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:59,400
fighting yourself just think about air

563
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,439
efficiency when it comes to designing

564
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,169
your HVAC system and where the heat and

565
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,999
humidity end up I can think of one clear

566
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,950
or there's a growth facility or they've

567
00:20:05,999 --> 00:20:09,690
got their heat duct shooting the heat

568
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,190
right are there extractions shooting the

569
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:12,929
heat right into the hallway but then

570
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,090
right across that hallway is an intake

571
00:20:12,929 --> 00:20:16,859
fan sucking what should be fresh cool

572
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:18,418
air into that flowering room it's

573
00:20:16,858 --> 00:20:20,249
actually sucking all of that heat

574
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,659
straight out of the other room into that

575
00:20:20,249 --> 00:20:23,639
room and it heats up that room

576
00:20:21,659 --> 00:20:24,929
perpetually and that room never gets

577
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:26,998
cooled down so that room has been

578
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:28,889
designated as a veg space because they

579
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:31,048
can't figure out how to cool it I told

580
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:32,699
them spend a few bucks redirect your air

581
00:20:31,048 --> 00:20:35,368
and that problem will be solved

582
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,499
unfortunately that is not how all owners

583
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:39,269
see things they would rather just make

584
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:40,470
the grow team struggle and make it hard

585
00:20:39,269 --> 00:20:41,489
on them and then yell at everybody

586
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,579
because they can't reach production

587
00:20:41,489 --> 00:20:46,590
goals unfortunately all too often that

588
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:49,319
is how a commercial grow environment

589
00:20:46,589 --> 00:20:51,689
will work but my point of this 20 minute

590
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:54,509
rant you guys is that sprays are not a

591
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:56,580
long-term solution sprays are temporary

592
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:58,499
quick fixes it will not solve the

593
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,849
problem you can't just keep spraying

594
00:20:58,499 --> 00:21:01,739
forever what are you gonna do are you

595
00:20:59,849 --> 00:21:03,538
gonna spray every three days you're

596
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:04,980
going to be buying personal protective

597
00:21:03,538 --> 00:21:06,778
equipment every week you're gonna be

598
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:09,599
buying more pesticide a more fungicide

599
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:11,339
every week solve the problem fix the air

600
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,288
conditioner fix all those air

601
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,418
conditioner gaps fix all the ducting

602
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:17,849
gaps to solve the [ __ ] and your

603
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:19,259
whole grow will be more enjoyable now

604
00:21:17,849 --> 00:21:21,178
let's shift gears and talk about the

605
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:24,509
same thing but we're gonna focus more on

606
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:27,179
pest this time most often pests come in

607
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:29,669
on clones or you bring them in the grow

608
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:32,038
yourself or they find the most minut

609
00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:34,139
crack in the walls and they sneak their

610
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:36,569
way in but I believe that most commonly

611
00:21:34,138 --> 00:21:38,819
they come in with a clone or they come

612
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:40,470
in on your clothes on your shoes or you

613
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:42,450
bring them in from your home grow or

614
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:43,889
from your commercial grow maybe you've

615
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,298
got a friend that grows at home or

616
00:21:43,888 --> 00:21:46,979
you've got multiple friends that grow at

617
00:21:45,298 --> 00:21:48,898
other places you guys all go hang out at

618
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:51,389
the same place you sit on the same couch

619
00:21:48,898 --> 00:21:53,069
his thrips crawl onto your shorts your

620
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:54,658
spider mites crawl into his shorts you

621
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:56,908
guys go home now you both have thrips

622
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,009
and spider mites I just think that since

623
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:01,200
everybody is growing cannabis we are all

624
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:03,230
just constantly trading bugs so we've

625
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,269
got to think about pest management

626
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:08,548
before you go into your grow change into

627
00:22:06,269 --> 00:22:10,019
your dedicated grow room clothes you

628
00:22:08,548 --> 00:22:11,398
should have grow room shoes you should

629
00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:12,899
have some grow room pants you should

630
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:14,769
have grow room shirts you should have a

631
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,239
separate grow room

632
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:18,160
you can't just wear your normal hat

633
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,140
that's not gonna work you want separate

634
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,640
clothes for your grow space so when you

635
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:23,800
come in and out of that grow you're

636
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,930
basically wearing your uniform this will

637
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:27,940
help you out in so many ways you're only

638
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:29,320
going to get pesticides on those clothes

639
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:31,240
because when you're in the grow if

640
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,679
you've applied a pesticide every time

641
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,450
you rub up against that plant and that

642
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,980
wall you're now getting pesticides on

643
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:38,559
your clothes so I have some dead it

644
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:40,569
designated clothes also have designated

645
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:42,069
shoes you don't want to be I'm a hippie

646
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,480
I'm out hiking on the trails I'm running

647
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:45,609
in the mountains I don't want to go take

648
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,620
my mountain shoes into my grow room or

649
00:22:45,609 --> 00:22:49,029
into a commercial grow and think about

650
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:50,649
whatever kind of bugs I may have picked

651
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:52,450
up out near Red Rocks or out of the

652
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:53,920
canyon trail and take that [ __ ] into a

653
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:55,210
commercial environment the next day I

654
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,250
walked in and there [ __ ] Athens

655
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,250
everywhere I would be so mad at myself

656
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:03,069
so get yourself some dedicated grow room

657
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:05,109
shoes some dedicated grow room clothes

658
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:07,000
all the way up to the Hat if you're in a

659
00:23:05,109 --> 00:23:08,709
commercial facility I almost recommend

660
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,029
changing if you've got a lab coat or if

661
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:11,980
you've got the opportunity to change

662
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,109
clothes between big rooms I would

663
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:16,450
definitely suggest that if you've got a

664
00:23:14,109 --> 00:23:18,789
room in a commercial facility that is

665
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:21,519
contaminated with bugs make that the

666
00:23:18,789 --> 00:23:23,230
last room you work on every day so that

667
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,819
you don't start in that room get

668
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,200
yourself coated in spider mites and then

669
00:23:24,819 --> 00:23:28,119
drag them through the rest of the growth

670
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,069
throughout the day start in the cleanest

671
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,139
room then work your way to the dirty

672
00:23:30,069 --> 00:23:33,549
room and then go home that way you don't

673
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:35,350
take those bugs through the rest of the

674
00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:37,119
grow that way you're probably going to

675
00:23:35,349 --> 00:23:37,539
take them home but as soon as you get

676
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:38,949
home

677
00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:40,839
drop those clothes in the dirty clothes

678
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,640
pile take a quick shower put on some

679
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:44,559
fresh clothes or put on your grow room

680
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,480
clothes then head to your grow room and

681
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,339
handle your [ __ ] but you need to switch

682
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,079
clothes before grow spaces

683
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:52,269
I also recommend switching clothes

684
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,279
between your indoor and outdoor grow

685
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:55,059
space if you've got the opportunity I

686
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,259
understand

687
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,609
switching clothes can be quite

688
00:23:56,259 --> 00:23:59,440
time-consuming if you need to do it

689
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,939
multiple times in a day maybe if you've

690
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,380
got a couple of lab coats or something

691
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:04,779
you can switch in and out of that would

692
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,970
be helpful but do anything you can to

693
00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:10,059
minimize the opportunity of bringing a

694
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:11,860
stowaway pests from grow to grow so I

695
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:13,149
think some of the most efficient ways to

696
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:15,429
prevent yourself from getting spider

697
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,170
mites is to treat any clones they come

698
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:18,940
into your grow act like that any plant

699
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,220
that comes into your grow has got all of

700
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,350
the bugs and all of the problems act

701
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,029
like that thing is a trap you've got to

702
00:24:23,349 --> 00:24:27,519
treat that plant for spider mites for

703
00:24:25,029 --> 00:24:28,420
thrips for aphids and for powdery mildew

704
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:29,920
before you even

705
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:33,070
think about bringing it into the grow

706
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:35,350
then also change clothes and keep

707
00:24:33,069 --> 00:24:36,909
yourself clean from grow to grow if you

708
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:38,859
go to the growth store if you go to some

709
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:40,360
grow meeting if you go to a grow class I

710
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:42,909
would definitely change clothes before

711
00:24:40,359 --> 00:24:44,469
you enter your grow environment and then

712
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:46,690
you also need to think about long-term

713
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,519
pest management we are not going to

714
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:50,860
apply pesticide sprays forever

715
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:52,869
we're gonna get big fat buds eventually

716
00:24:50,859 --> 00:24:54,429
any pesticide will die off it will not

717
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:55,989
be effective most of them have a very

718
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:57,789
short shelf life unless you're going

719
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,700
with something pretty extreme so you

720
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:03,009
will need to find a better solution I

721
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,350
highly suggest predator mites I like

722
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:08,109
predator bugs in the grow one of the

723
00:25:05,349 --> 00:25:11,169
most popular pest management instructors

724
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:13,329
has coined the phrase no bug can build a

725
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,279
resistance to being eaten which is a

726
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:17,740
great statement if we keep applying

727
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,569
pesticides to our pests they're going to

728
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,460
build a resistance to it if you keep

729
00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:23,139
spraying as a max on your spider mites

730
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,610
you are going to create a Naza max

731
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,350
resistant spider mite

732
00:25:24,609 --> 00:25:28,449
they will start drinking it and spitting

733
00:25:26,349 --> 00:25:31,149
it back in your face and laughing at you

734
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:32,920
you need to rotate your pesticides once

735
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:34,720
you get into flower you release those

736
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,940
predator mites and guess what

737
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,069
nothing has a resistance to being eaten

738
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,870
if you are a little tiny spider mite and

739
00:25:39,069 --> 00:25:43,329
a great big hungry predator mite comes

740
00:25:40,869 --> 00:25:45,969
by your food you're gonna die that's how

741
00:25:43,329 --> 00:25:48,849
it goes so I would suggest switching to

742
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,130
predator bugs early in Flour if not late

743
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:52,809
in veg and here's a little note that

744
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,400
I've been talking about just randomly

745
00:25:52,809 --> 00:25:56,409
when I'm teaching classes and talking

746
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,200
about pest management I think many

747
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:00,880
people are prioritizing their plants

748
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,100
backwards when it comes to pest

749
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,050
management many people focus on the

750
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:07,539
plants that have the big fat buds that

751
00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:09,519
are almost ready for harvest that are

752
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:11,109
really photogenic that are beautiful the

753
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,240
management is gonna come in and look at

754
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:16,419
many people focus on keeping those

755
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:18,849
plants pest free I recommend starting

756
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:20,830
the other direction I think that the

757
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:22,629
mother plants and the small clones are

758
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,889
the most important plants to keep pest

759
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,290
free because that is where everything

760
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:28,420
starts if you've got a grow that is

761
00:26:26,289 --> 00:26:30,190
contaminated I would start working on

762
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:32,110
the mother plants and the veg plants

763
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:34,420
first those plants that are in flower

764
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:36,039
their numbers are up their time is

765
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:38,350
counting down they're gonna be cut down

766
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:40,509
and removed from your facility in just a

767
00:26:38,349 --> 00:26:42,250
few weeks those mother plants they're

768
00:26:40,509 --> 00:26:44,169
there for a much longer time

769
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,538
you've got to deal with them much longer

770
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:48,820
we need to correct their problems get

771
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:50,230
them happy get them healthy because the

772
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:52,089
mother plants are the start of

773
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,409
everything the mother plants are where

774
00:26:52,089 --> 00:26:55,178
it all comes from you need a happy

775
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:57,009
healthy mother plant so that you can get

776
00:26:55,179 --> 00:26:58,600
a happy healthy clone so that you can

777
00:26:57,009 --> 00:27:00,128
have happy healthy veggie

778
00:26:58,599 --> 00:27:02,589
so that we can have happy healthy

779
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:05,288
flowering plants so that we can have big

780
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:06,699
fat juicy beautiful healthy buds so that

781
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:09,099
in turn we can have happy healthy

782
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,259
patients so you need happy healthy

783
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:13,028
mother plants to make that happen and to

784
00:27:11,259 --> 00:27:16,298
make all of that happen you need a happy

785
00:27:13,028 --> 00:27:18,069
healthy clean dialed-in grow environment

786
00:27:16,298 --> 00:27:19,839
ladies and gentlemen I think this was a

787
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:21,548
great podcast episode I had a lot of fun

plants I encourage you to post your

810
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,759
pictures at cannabis recently the

811
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:18,190
Android App Store has removed cannabis

812
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,860
from their applications store but

813
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:23,019
cannabis is in the process of adding an

814
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:25,209
android download link to their website

815
00:28:23,019 --> 00:28:27,370
so you will be able to directly download

816
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:29,288
the app from their website it will work

817
00:28:27,369 --> 00:28:31,178
just like it did before it's just not

818
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:32,859
available in the Android store they're

819
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:35,259
kind of being haters on the cannabis

820
00:28:32,859 --> 00:28:37,689
focused application so they shut us down

821
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:39,849
there don't worry the application will

822
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,759
