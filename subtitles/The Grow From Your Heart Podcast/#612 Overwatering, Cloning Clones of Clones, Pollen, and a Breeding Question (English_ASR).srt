20. i'm awful rambly in this episode

68
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,039
that may work out to your advantage

69
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,118
i wanted to talk about i walked into the

70
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,640
grow room uh just a couple of days ago

71
00:02:05,118 --> 00:02:07,840
it was super [ __ ] cold

72
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,159
and i looked at the ceiling and i

73
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,159
thought is there a leak upstairs because

74
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:13,439
there were water bubbles all over my

75
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,000
ceiling it looked like i had a little

76
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,318
bit of

77
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,080
water coming down the wall uh on the

78
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,560
poly uh the panda film that's on the

79
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
floor

80
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,080
there was a little bit of water in one

81
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,680
corner i got real paranoid really

82
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,599
quickly i thought what the [ __ ] happened

83
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,200
where's all this water coming from

84
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,719
i turned off anything that made a lot of

85
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:30,079
noise and i listened for water running

86
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:31,759
there's no water running

87
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,239
it dawned on me that it's [ __ ]

88
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,280
negative 17 degrees outside and it's

89
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,959
75 degrees in that grow space uh there

90
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,560
might be some condensation forming in

91
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,000
some places i was a little bit freaked

92
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,759
out i've never seen that happen

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,680
in my grow space before i thought i had

94
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,560
a leak or a flood or some major [ __ ]

95
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,480
problems

96
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,719
turns out it was condensation all that

97
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:53,518
warmth and the outside cold air meeting

98
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,039
ah that is a potential for powdery

99
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,959
mildew that's a potential for some

100
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,000
problem so i did increase my airflow i

101
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,840
did increase the

102
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,158
uh the amount of air going out of that

103
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,680
room i'm really doing what i can but in

104
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,039
these temperatures and these times right

105
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
now this is crazy this is one of the

106
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,359
coldest winters

107
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,239
i can remember as a grower so shout out

108
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,840
to all the folks that have been

109
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,640
struggling and cold winter grows for a

110
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,080
long time

111
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:15,518
uh this is a good reminder to get your

112
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
plants up off the ground i've talked

113
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,200
about that before if you're in a cold

114
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,799
environment get your plants up off the

115
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,639
ground they don't want to be

116
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,000
sitting on that cold floor with water in

117
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,878
there that's going to make them not eat

118
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,799
not feed

119
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,000
not grow but not perform they're going

120
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,519

part of the podcast is where i'm going

198
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,759
to answer grow questions these grow

199
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:38,159
questions came

200
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,919
from uh this one came from the grow help

201
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,240
tab on my website if you visit my

202
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,159
website iriegenetics.com

203
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,000
there's a spot where it says grow help

204
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,919
you can ask your grow questions

205
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,160
we ask a short list of preliminary

206
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,680
questions we ask you basic things like

207
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,439
what strain are you growing are you

208
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,720
growing indoors or outdoors what kind of

209
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,560
lights are you using

210
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,319
just a few things to give me some hints

211
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,759
at what can solve your problem

212
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,360
just it makes it easier for me it's like

213
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,879
going to the doctor they want to know

214
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,479
your blood pressure your heart rate your

215
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:06,399
temperature how much you weigh

216
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,000
a few basic questions before you even

217
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,399
see the doc just to give me a hint

218
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,240
this is like giving the doctor a few

219
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,359
couple of basic questions before we get

220
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,519
to see the patient

221
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,960
uh we're gonna jump right to that part

222
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,000
sorry i'm so rambly today you guys i

223
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,918

uh what did i dab it was bubblegum

225

tkd1000

226
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,680

227
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
some people ask what am i dabbing some

228
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240

229
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,080

to say their name

239
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,879

15. they're growing it indoors

242
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
under led lighting they're in the

243
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,800
vegetative stage of growth

244
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
they're about four weeks into veg

245
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,639
they're growing in cocoa

246
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,879
the last feed was at the time of this

247
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,598
email it was today february 10th

248
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:02,000
the ph of that feeding was 6.1 so far

249
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:03,439
we're doing

250
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
good i would have maybe gone up a little

251
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,240
higher on the ph but so far

252
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,080
so good uh p pm or ec of the last

253
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,120
feeding was 700 we're all in the right

254
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,680
ranges there

255
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,800
daytime temperature 68 to 70 you could

256
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,879
come up a little bit

257
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,160
but it's cold as [ __ ] i'm not mad at you

258
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,079
for being a little bit cold

259
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,599
uh it's cold as [ __ ] in my grove spaces

260
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,959
right now too can't do much about it but

261
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:24,478
plug in more lights

262
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,799
gonna run out of lights in space pretty

263
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:29,279
soon here nighttime temperatures 64 to

264
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,240
66 that is acceptable

265
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,478
relative humidity is sixty percent

266
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,199
nighttime 55 percent that's acceptable

267
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,000
within

268
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,199
acceptable range there uh where do we go

269
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,279
from here

270
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,520
uh the problem hey man i love your

271
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:45,279
content so this is my second grow first

272
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:48,079
grow had almost no issues

273
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,839
but on this one i'm having droopy fan

274
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,199
leave now droopy fan leaves can be a lot

275
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:53,038
of signs of a lot of different things

276
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,478
there is a picture included we'll i'll

277
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,240
add that here in just a moment

278
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:58,000
uh the droopy fan leaves are on the old

279
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
and new growth i'm growing

280
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
in the basement intense i know my temps

281
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,918
have been kind of cold

282
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
so that's an indicator right there but

283
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,000
i'm having trouble pinpointing this

284
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,280
issue i'm a legal caregiver so i'm

285
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,399
worried because my patients are

286
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:13,679
depending on me

287
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:16,638
to pump out the dank like i did last run

288
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,680
um it's your second grow and you're a

289
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
caregiver

290
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,680
you got a little bit of cart before the

291
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,360
horse syndrome there uh i would master

292
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,959
growing not master it but at least get

293
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,080
comfortable at it get really good at it

294
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,198
before you've got a lot of people

295
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,959
relying on you

296
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,319
i appreciate and respect what you're

297
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,158
doing but uh

298
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,879
get good at this before you get too many

299
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,559
people relying on you too much

300
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,639
that's none of my business i guess but

301
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,879
that's my advice as a as a caregiver

302
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,240
i've been a caregiver was a caregiver

303
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,360
since the beginning of the medical stuff

304
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,879
here in colorado

305
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
my advices get good before you get

306
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,799
people relying on you that way

307
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,399
you're never worried about your patients

308
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,159
anyway let me get back on track it says

309
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,480
my nutrients are house and garden

310
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,240
i'm also using recharge i'm definitely

311
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,759
not underwatering but i know i'm

312
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,680
watering less often

313
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:01,278
this run than last it's cold so they're

314
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,719
probably not drinking as much

315
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:04,480
i do have a picture here that's going to

316
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,360

317
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,080

318
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,839

332
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,240
see is that

333
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,000
if you look at the bottom in the little

334
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,080
catch tray the saucer in which the

335
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
pot is sitting there's quite a bit of

336
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,759
standing water in that pot

337
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,839
and the condition of that pot the outer

338
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,000
moisture here on the outside of the pot

339
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,600
the color of that runoff water inside of

340
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,600
that pot of the saucer

341
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,200
the condition of the saucer indicate to

342
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,639
me that this plant

343
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,759
sits in water too often so it's being

344
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,838
over watered

345
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,278
it's sitting in that over watering for

346
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,120
too long it's sitting in this water at

347
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,360
the bottom of the tray for too long

348
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,959
and it's cold basically you're putting

349
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,440
this plant's feet

350
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,639
maybe it's balls in cold water imagine

351
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,320
if i just sat you

352
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,799
let me fix my hat so you could see my

353
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,200
face here imagine if i just sat you

354
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,000
your feet your toes your balls in cold

355
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
water all day

356
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,720
long and just made you deal with it that

357
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,279
is kind of what you're doing to this

358
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,160
plant

359
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,958
so i think the main issue is that it is

360
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,879
simply over

361
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,719
watered the secondary issue that it's

362
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,078
sitting in that water for too long

363
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,320
your third issue which is just

364
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,000
compounding everything else is that that

365
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,240
cold water in which it is sitting

366
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,679
is cold you do have them up on those

367
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,278
little tiny risers

368
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,639
but that water is still getting cold

369
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:41,919
there's nothing to stop that water from

370
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,838
getting a little bit chilly

371
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,120
so they're unhappy with that water i'm

372
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,079
looking to see what else i can see by

373
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,679
your picture

374
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,519
i think if you got the temperature under

375
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,199
control in there and stopped over

376
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,839
watering i think that those plants would

377
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,480
be

378
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,560
less droopy in my opinion the main thing

379
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,920
causing this droop is over water

380
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,759
the second thing is they're sitting in

381
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,360
that stagnant water for too long

382
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,958
the third thing is they are probably a

383
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,200
little bit too cold that water's too

384
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:07,599
cold the plants are overall too cold

385
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,120
another reason which will lead to plants

386
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,560
doing a droop like this

387
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,720
however i don't think this is what's

388
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:14,799
happening here but this is a possibility

389
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,920
for other people with droopy leaves

390
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,759
sometimes

391
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,039
when your plants reach their daily light

392
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:20,879
integral they will

393
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,319
just take a break they'll just droop

394
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,958
their leaves down that means they've had

395
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
enough light daily light integral dli

396
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:28,399
like basically if you're at work and

397
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,919
you're done and you're tired and you

398
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,078
lean against the wall and you go

399
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,360
ah that's what the plants are doing

400
00:11:32,078 --> 00:11:34,799
they've been working all day

401
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,800
they don't have a wall to lean against

402
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,078
they just go [ __ ] i'm tired they just

403
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,039
put their leaves down and they take a

404
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:41,120
little bit of a break

405
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,319
they're telling you i've had my daily

406
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,839
light integral

407
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,600
unless you want to keep me on so that i

408
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
don't flower you could possibly reduce

409
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
the light you could reduce the amount of

410
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,679
lumens i'm getting

411
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,278
you could do changes based on what

412
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,278
you're seeing on those plants but

413
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:55,278
what i think is happening here honestly

414
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,120
is it's a basic over water which is

415
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,559
compounding into multiple issues

416
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,480
because of the environment let me read

417
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,838
my notes make sure i didn't miss

418
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,278
anything on the notes

419
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,279
you do have lots of standing water it's

420
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:07,600
probably cold get them up off the floor

421
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,838
you do have those little tiny risers

422
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,519
that may be sufficient i don't know i

423
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,600
don't know how cold that floor is you

424
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,120
said you're in the basement in a tent

425
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,360
that floor may be getting colder than

426
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,039
you're anticipating you may want to

427
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
double or triple triple those little

428
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,799
risers maybe get another pot flip the

429
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,879
pot upside down put it on there

430
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:26,000
that may help you out honestly i think

431
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,879
the main issue

432
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,839
is the over water and the cold water

433
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,360
sitting in there

434
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
all right big thanks to my friend who

435
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,240
did not include their name i do

436
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,838
appreciate the content

437
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,519
let me know how it goes when you dry

438
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,800
those plants out a little bit and one

439
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,480
recommendation i can make while i'm

440
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,958
thinking about it

441
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,800
you seem to be over watering your plants

442
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,119
i've done a podcast episode

443
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,559
called water tech one through five i

444
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,919
don't recall the episode number right

445
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,759
off the top of my head but

446
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,360
through the magic of technology i'll

447
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,759
drop that episode number right about

448
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,159
here

449
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,000
in the video that way you guys can watch

450
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,679
one through five water tech it's just an

451
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,200
audio podcast there's a video that goes

452
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:02,319
with it i think it's just my face or a

453
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,320
static screen

454
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
some sort of image it's an older show

455
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,920
but that will give you great advice

456
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,000
on how to water these plants without so

457
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,439
many issues uh and i would do something

458
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
about that standing water

459
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,959
you're getting 10 to 20 runoff but it's

460
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,639
just sitting in that tray

461
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,399
and that's not ideal i would maybe get a

462
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,240
shop vac and suck that out

463
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,919
or maybe i don't know you got to do

464
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,159
something about that standing water

465
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:25,919
shop vac is probably the ideal way if

466
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,919
you raise them up off of something

467
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,759
uh up off the ground onto something you

468
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,599
can put a container underneath there

469
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:32,958
and with that plastic saucer that you're

470
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,879
using you can kind of push the edge of

471
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,559
it like your finger with your finger

472
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:37,679
and make like a spout like on a pitcher

473
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:38,638
like a t pitcher you could just make

474
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:39,838
that little corner

475
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,360
and the water will pour right out of

476
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,040
there into a vessel that you could slide

477
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,600
underneath but i would get the water out

478
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,360
of there

479
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,959
that would help you out one through five

480
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,000
water tech once again that episode

481
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,919
number should be right about

482
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,198
here-ish that'll help you out all right

483
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,000
i'm going to move on

484
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,799
to the next question in today's episode

485
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,919
this one

486
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,479
comes from our friend z nice and easy

487
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,360
and it says sir i've heard a bucket of

488
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
bro science

489
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,440
stating that taking clones from clones

490
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,639
from clones and so on

491
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,399
degrades the quality is this true

492
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,000
thanks and keep it up so what this

493
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,278
person is asking is

494
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,399
if i have got a plant and i cut a clone

495
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,000
of that plant

496
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,440
and i grow that plant that plant is now

497
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,639
going to become this hand for those who

498
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,279
are watching the video i've got this

499
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,519
plant

500
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,320
i cut this part off i've got two plants

501
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,240
now right

502
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,160
eventually this one's going to go away

503
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,440
and i've only got plant number two now i

504
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,399
guess we're gonna call it which is just

505
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,040
a clone of

506
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,879
plant number one so eventually i'm gonna

507
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:36,240
cut clones off of plant number two

508
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,159
and i'm gonna put plant number two in

509
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,159
the flower room i'm gonna use the clones

510
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,679
which are now clone number three and i'm

511
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:43,519
gonna keep those around i'll keep one as

512
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,359
a mom plant eventually i'll throw

513
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,039
some of those in the flower room some

514
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,480
more along the line i'll have to cut

515
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,679
clones off of number three and make

516
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,039
clone number four

517
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,799
and clone number three will get too

518
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:55,679
tired i'll need to refresh it

519
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:56,399
so in the long run if you do it

520
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,559
correctly

521
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,519
if you follow standard operating

522
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,518
procedures

523
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,919
if your donor plants do not get any

524
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,000
stress or overwhelming stress or

525
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:06,399
overwhelming diseases or overwhelming

526
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,440
pest

527
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,759
pressure in most cases you will not see

528
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,680
any change in those genetics it will be

529
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,240
the same plant you will not degrade the

530
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,799
quality on those genetics in any way

531
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,120
it will still be the same thing if you

532
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,759
follow standard operating procedures

533
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,198
and you use healthy donor plants and you

534
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:26,720
take clones properly

535
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,799
you transplant them and you care for

536
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,040
them in a proper manner they will not

537
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:33,198
degrade in any way

538
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,319
i recently got rid of my flow mother

539
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,679
plant

540
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,440
no offense to flow i just had grown that

541
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:40,799
i bred it to everything it was time for

542
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,120
that to be retired

543
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,799
uh as a colorado cannabis grower with

544
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,240
the personal grow i'm very limited to

545
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,799
the amount of plants i'm allowed to play

546
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,399
with

547
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:54,078
i've been growing flow since 2007.

548
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:56,320
i think in 2019 or 2020

549
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,198
i finally decided to let it go so i had

550
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,240
that plant

551
00:15:57,198 --> 00:16:01,519
for over 10 years over 10 years and the

552
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
only way i could do that

553
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,919
was by cutting a clone of it every time

554
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,799
that bigger plant got tired got ugly got

555
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:08,719
out of shape

556
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:10,639
i just cut a clone of that get that

557
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
clone root it get that going

558
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,720
i probably went through 20 different

559
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,240
clone generations of that flow plant big

560
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,759
shout out to my friends at metamar for

561
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,320
getting me that clone

562
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,039
that came there's rumor that that came

563
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,079
from

564
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,639
ed rosenthal through tom sexton then to

565
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:25,838
me

566
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,519
i don't know if i should have said all

567
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,240
those names but that's the rumor so that

568
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,078
clone

569
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,159
that i went from dj short to ed

570
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,599
rosenthal to tom to myself

571
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,278
is the rumor where that clone went it

572
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,800
got spread all over colorado i wasn't

573
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,240
the only one with it but

574
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:43,039
it was a great cut i kept it from 2007

575
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,919
i bred everything to it uh i cloned it a

576
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:46,719
bunch of times

577
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,159
so i got it from that person i bred to

578
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,399
it i grew i just keep repeating the same

579
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:52,078
[ __ ] but i had it for 10 years finally i

580
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,240
got tired of it everything smelled like

581
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:57,198
flow in my life for a little while

582
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,480
i smoked it i consumed it i dabbed it

583
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:00,159
eventually you got to get rid of things

584
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,320
like i said a moment ago i'm a breeder

585
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,759
i'm in colorado i'm limited by plants i

586
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
wanted to make new things i wanted to

587
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,480
make

588
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,838
new creations unfortunately the flow

589
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,558
plant is one of the things that had to

590
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,798
go but

591
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,318
until then i kept that bad [ __ ] around

592
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,318
for over 10 years

593
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,438
by cutting a clone of it it moved with

594
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,678
me i moved to

595
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,279
two different houses with that plant i

596
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,640
had a plant

597
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,160
i had a crop of flow right i had a

598
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,799
mother plant and i had a crop of flow in

599
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,160
flower

600
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:25,918
and i thought should i gotta move when

601
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,439
this crop is over so i just cut a tray

602
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,120
of all of my mother plants

603
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,360
like ten of every mother plant in the

604
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,439
tray of clones put them in the car

605
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,279
moved set up the new grow space put

606
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,880
those new clones in their new home

607
00:17:35,279 --> 00:17:38,798
and that's how the new clones got moved

608
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,000
to the new spot so that flow has

609
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,599
survived two

610
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,279
moves of different houses it's been

611
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:45,599
moved all around the country

612
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,319
so no in the long run the short answer

613
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,319
ah is

614
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,678
no there will not be any change if

615
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,359
things are done properly i need to

616
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,000
repeat that the mother plant needs to be

617
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,319
happy

618
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,319
there needs to be no uh viral pressure

619
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,240
no pest pressure no stress

620
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,599
uh just needs to be a healthy plant that

621
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,038
hasn't been worked out

622
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,519
and then you need to take clones

623
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,160
properly transplant them properly

624
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:07,759
then you should have quality copies of

625
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,440
copies of copies

626
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:11,679
if you do it correctly it's not like

627
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,558
multiplicity where they keep coming out

628
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,000
a little dumber

629
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,759
it's not like the copy machine where

630
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,759
they keep getting a little bit diluted

631
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,839
if you do it correctly they should come

632
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,440
out just fine let me adjust the irie

633
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,240
army beanie here it keeps crawling into

634
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,759
my eyes

635
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
trying to keep my face visible and be

636
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:26,798
professional

637
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,558
all right let's keep going we do have a

638
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:29,519
couple more minutes here on this podcast

639
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:31,519
episode

640
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:34,079
this question also came from the grow

641
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,798
help tab this one came from they want us

642
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,879
to use the name

643
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,400
nb shout out to my new friend nb thank

644
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,480
you for the great question

645
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
it says they are growing granddaddy

646
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,640
perps and

647
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,240
why east farms horchata there's a string

648
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,919
called horchata that sounds good

649
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,839
i like horchata they're growing at

650
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,799
indoors under led lighting the plants

651
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:52,639
are in veg

652
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,839
they're in a soilless mix i like these

653
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,480
details so far

654
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:00,240
they're using floraflex bloom one bloom

655
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,558
two the ec is 1.7 the ph is 6.4

656
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,120
daytime temperature 75 degrees nighttime

657
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,918
temperature 65 degrees

658
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,558
uh where are we relative humidity 40 day

659
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,200
and night

660
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,879
here is the part that says the problem

661
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,240

664
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,960
you for the great content you are

665
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,079
contributing to the show right now and i

666
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,558
appreciate that

667
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,079
it says i was running a 4x2 flower tint

668
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,079
while simultaneously

669
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,359
running a veg tent so we got a flower

670
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:29,279
tent and a veg tent

671
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,119
i decided to save on electricity and

672
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,519
bring the veg plants into the flower

673
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:35,119
tent for a few hours a day

674
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,279
so you're moving plants from one room to

675
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:39,439
another to save on electricity

676
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,200
are you really saving electricity by

677
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,720
cramming all of your plants into one

678
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,480
space those plants may

679
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,480
want the space you may be better off

680
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,720
just leaving them in the other room

681
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,240
after we see the problem you ran into we

682
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,600
determined you may be better off just

683
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,319
leaving them in the other room overall

684
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,759
but

685
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,439
um i understand you want to bring them

686
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,679
in there and use that space but

687
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,120
hopefully your flower spaces full all

688
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,798
that light is being used and you want to

689
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:02,000
give those plants the veg plants as much

690
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:03,759
light as they can get i don't know your

691
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,798
situation that's just my assumption

692
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,798
i would leave them where they are so

693
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,359
they can get all that light

694
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,200
anyway it goes on it says i just noticed

695
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,918
that one of the flowering plants

696
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,919
seems to be a hermaphrodite oh the

697
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,400
dreaded intersex plant those are always

698
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,320
a

699
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,559
[ __ ] scare it says i realize the

700
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,158
power strip had a small light bulb in it

701
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,639
thanks to your light leak episode i

702
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,159
realized i assumed that was the cause

703
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,759
that could definitely be the cause any

704
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,320
sort of light leak may do it

705
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,759
says am i in danger of pollinating the

706
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,519
vegging plants

707
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,200
the veg plants are all in week four they

708
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,839
spend two to three hours in a

709
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,519
flower tim i realize this was a mistake

710
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,839
should i pop some new seeds or wait

711
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:42,879
three months for more disappointing

712
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:44,480
results all right

713
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,919
i've got a very simple answer to this

714
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,279
one

715
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
the simple answer to this one is you

716
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:50,960
have nothing to worry about uh the

717
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,400
flowering plants in your tent i hope

718
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,960
nobody saw me spin on the microphone

719
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,038
just now

720
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,640
if you did i apologize i'm human [ __ ]

721
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:58,558
happens not even gonna edit that

722
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
if you've got other plants which are in

723
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,079
flower in that tent

724
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,919
the flowering plants are at risk of

725
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,480
being pollinated and having seeds in

726
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,799
them

727
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,519
the other plants which are somewhere

728
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,200
between

729
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,879
21 and about 35 days in flower those do

730
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,880
risk being pollinated maybe a little

731
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,240
later you won't get too many seeds

732
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,559
the pistils are shriveling up they're

733
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,240
not super pollinatable right now but

734
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,079
if they're at peak pollination times and

735
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,400
that hermaphrodite popped up

736
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,599
you may see some pollination on the

737
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,919
other plants which are in

738
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:29,839
flower you did not ask about flowering

739
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,080
plants what you asked about is are your

740
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,199
vegetative plants going to get seeded

741
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:37,199
the simple answer is no not at all

742
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,798
those plants have not reached sexual

743
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:40,080
maturity they are not putting out their

744
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,679
sex organs yet

745
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,199
the parts which they need to receive

746
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,200
pollen to produce seeds

747
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,480
are not even existent on those plants

748
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,240
yet so uh

749
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,000
no you do not have anything to worry

750
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,919
about those vegetative plants

751
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,919
will not receive pollen they will not be

752
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,440
pollinated you've got a long way to go

753
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,480
before you have to worry about that the

754
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,240
thing you should do

755
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
is make sure you deal with that

756
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,359
hermaphroditic plant in some way are you

757
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,558
going to get rid of it are you going to

758
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,079
pluck the nanners out

759
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,558
you're going to isolate it what's going

760
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,158
to happen with that freak of nature

761
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,000
then once that crop is done and that

762
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,720
herm is out of there you need to

763
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,319
thoroughly

764
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,919
clean that room make sure there's no

765
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,798
pollen in there water will deactivate

766
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
your pollen

767
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:17,918
get in there and just spray everything

768
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,440
maybe cover up the lights maybe hand

769
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,640
wipe the lights or something but

770
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,480
we got to get in there and get a lot of

771
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,640
water in the room and deactivate all of

772
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,798
the pollen that may have been released

773
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,320
so the short answer to your question is

774
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,558
you have nothing to worry about

775
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,158
because vegetative plants don't have the

776
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,000
appropriate parts to receive

777
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:35,600
pollen so no they will not get

778
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,640
pollinated the parts of your plants that

779
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:37,918
receive pollen

780
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,520
when you put them into flour and they

781
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,960
start making the dandelion parts the

782
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,519
little pistols the hairs

783
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,038
the stigmas that is where the pollen

784
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,400
lands that's what will get your plants

785
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,720
pregnant and get them seeded

786
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,320
so at this time you don't have anything

787
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,720
to worry about big shout out to my new

788

794
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,640
out all right where are we going from

795
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,720
there i've got a couple more messages

796
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,679
let's find this is the one

797
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,600
that i want a rat here all right this

798
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,038
one says what's up rosted jeff

799
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,959
i've got a quick question that i think

800
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,640
may be valuable to the listeners and

801
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,720
definitely to me

802
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:21,038
i've heard you mention on a few episodes

803
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,880
that you use salt based nutrients to

804
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,558
grow yes i do i mostly use new

805
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,400
millennium bottle nutrients

806
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,599
a lot of times i also use veg bloom

807
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,440
powdered nutrients

808
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:31,038
in the personal grow i use one mix and a

809
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,880
commercial grow i use another mix but

810
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:35,119
those are the main bases

811
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,120
yes salt based nutrients i'm a bottled

812
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,399
grower not the organic guy

813
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:40,319
it works better in a commercial

814
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,400
environment in my opinion

815
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:43,359
for what i'm doing for my budget for my

816
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,400
space

817
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,319
and also for training grotex

818
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,159
it's just easier to have bottles that i

819
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,158
can say put this many milliliters of

820
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,400
this at this day and this many mils

821
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,360
so i do use the bottled nutrients it

822
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,679
goes on to say

823
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,719
i'm assuming you are breeding everything

824
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,278
with those same

825
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,120
salt-based nutrients that is accurate

826
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:04,798
says is there any scientific evidence

827
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,839
that shows when breeding with salt-based

828
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,759
nutrients

829
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:10,158
there are any discrepancies in a future

830
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:13,359
grower using those seeds in super soil

831
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,559
without salt-based nutrients

832
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:18,399
um i have my seeds tested

833
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,000
excuse me i have my seeds tested in all

834
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:23,759
types of environments

835
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,880
in living soil and soil and hydroponics

836
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,839
and rock wool

837
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,120
and cocoa i have them ran organically

838
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:30,720
non-organically

839
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,278
i have them grown with love and grown

840
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,278
with abuse and i don't see

841
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,599
any difference in the organic to

842
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,599
non-organic production when it comes to

843
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,439
how viable that seed is they all

844
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,359
germinate well they all grow well

845
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,038
i haven't seen any difference in that to

846
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,359
tell you the honest truth

847
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,119
um the thing you're talking about is

848
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,759
called epigenetics

849
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,038
and that's in let me take a quick drink

850
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,000
here my voice is crackling you guys

851
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,278
don't want to hear that we're just going

852
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,159
to take a drink and deal with it on the

853
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:57,519
show

854
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,840
it's better than hearing that nonsense

855
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:01,839
excuse me for one moment

856
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,960
all right i'm freshened up now

857
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
let me start by saying i have no

858
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,759
qualifications or

859
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,559
uh i don't i am just talking out of my

860
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,440
ass right now but this is what i think

861
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:27,119
uh for that to be a factor we have to

862
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,159
think about what did the breeder

863
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,759
of these seeds before me do whoever made

864
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,080
the mother plant and the father plant

865
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,599
that i used what did they do

866
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,439
and then whoever made the mother plant

867
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,439
and the father plant of that one

868
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,120
what type of soil or soilless mix or

869
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,679
media did they use

870
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:45,199
because evolutionary things like this

871
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,440
aren't going to happen over

872
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,960
one cycle in my opinion i started this

873
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,240
by saying i don't know what the [ __ ] i'm

874
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,798
talking about but

875
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,400
as i think about it evolution isn't

876
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:56,319
gonna happen just by me

877
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,080
maybe it is i paul and chuck i do

878
00:25:56,319 --> 00:25:58,720
breeding i'm changing things evolution

879
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,918
is happening

880
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,480
by me selecting things but i don't think

881
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,400
that i'm

882
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,000
imprinting the plant the seeds enough

883
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
with one cycle

884
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,440
in my breeding mix i don't think the

885
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,278
plant knows

886
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,960
it may know the plant knows i don't

887
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,599
think the seed knows

888
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,038
that i'm growing in salts and i don't

889
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:18,079
think it's going to make a difference

890
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,000
but

891
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,519
i could be completely wrong keep in mind

892
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,278
i said i started this by saying i don't

893
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,000
have the scientific

894
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:27,519
background the education on this topic i

895
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,640
know that it's epigenetics is what we're

896
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,879
talking about

897
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,278
but i think that it's going to take more

898
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,679
generations than just my one breeding

899
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:35,839
round

900
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,880
to really make a difference in that

901
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:38,558
topic

902
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,080
i wish i had more details and info on

903
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,918
that honestly i don't have that

904
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,240
education i haven't gone to school

905
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,759
i probably need some more deep science

906
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,880
than what i've got for that i kind of

907
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,558
i've got a lot of bro science people uh

908
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,120
people kind of diss me sometimes because

909
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,720
i obviously i'm not a college student i

910
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:55,918
don't do the college thing i'm not

911
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,000
educated from any

912
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,440
uh botanical school no horticultural

913
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,319
degree or anything like that what i've

914
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,240
got though

915
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,839
is a lot of experience i've been growing

916
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,359
since before i should admit it

917
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:06,720
i've been around a lot of plants i've

918
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:08,000
had a lot of crops i've grown in

919
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,400
commercial

920
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,519
private environments uh so i don't have

921
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,120
the schooling

922
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:14,319
to really talk about this sort of stuff

923
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,558
i could teach you about plants i could

924
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:18,558
spot a deficiency from across the room

925
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,158
i can tell you which branch needs to be

926
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,359
trellised a little bit more from

927
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,799
across a [ __ ] 75-foot grow space but

928
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,519
this is not really

929
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,119
um my area of expertise so i don't want

930
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:31,119
to talk too much out my ass

931
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,519
in my opinion though i think that this

932
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:34,079
would take more generations of breeding

933
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:37,119
so

934
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:39,278
if i bread a sub cool strain and

935
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,959
a let's pick somebody else that's a dna

936
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,038
genetic strain

937
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,319
subcool bread in super soil i don't know

938
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,960
what dna genetics

939
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,240
bred in so we got super soil on one side

940
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,679
we're just going to say

941
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,359
that i'm just making this up i don't

942
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,120
know what they did the dna genetics

943
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,240
bread and cocoa they're advanced guys

944
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,239
they're hip cats

945
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,000
they probably did breed in cocoa so now

946
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,558
we got one guy breeding in

947
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,480
super soil one guy breeding and cocoa we

948
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:04,639
got seeds that came from super soil

949
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,960
seeds that came from cocoa i grew those

950
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,038
i selected plants now i'm breeding those

951
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,000
in a soilless mix they've come from

952
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:11,359
three different

953
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,679
environments to tell you the truth

954
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:15,599
already plus like i said before what did

955
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,919
whoever sub cool got his seeds from or

956
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:20,398
whatever what were they bred from

957
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,640
so i don't think my one step is going to

958
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:25,359
do enough evolutionary uh

959
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,038
epigenetic evolutionary change to really

960
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:29,038
make any decision on if there will be a

961
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,798
difference on future grows in

962
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:32,319
different media that was a really long

963
00:28:30,798 --> 00:28:34,798
way to say that but

964
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,240
i had a lot to say and it's my podcast

965
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,359
all right there is more to this it says

966
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,000
is this genetic

967
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,439
drift let me think about that ah no i

968
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,480
don't think that is the definition of

969
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,240
genetic drift

970
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,880
i've defined genetic drift on another

971
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,319
episode and that is not what it is

972
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,919
it says i hope this makes sense and is

973
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,759
not a stupid question

974
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,320
no not a stupid question at all great

975
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,919
question i wish i had more information

976
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,720
for you i wish i could answer this more

977
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,038
thoroughly

978
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,480
i'm sure in the comment section on

979
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,319
youtube somebody

980
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,399
will chime in with some brilliant [ __ ]

981
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,079
about this anytime

982
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,359
i am a little bit lost or make a little

983
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:09,278
bit of a mistake there are a lot of

984
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,000
brilliant friends of mine that gently

985
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,759
and politely remind me and update me and

986
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,319
give me information they educate me

987
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:17,038
which is

988
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,678
i do not feel uh any shame in being

989
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:20,960
educated

990
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,240
updated enlightened excuse me they sure

991
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,519
they will share all kinds of great

992
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,640
information with us so check out the

993
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,720
youtube comments

994
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,679
and somebody will have more to say about

995
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,200
this i'm sure

996
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,798
