when you are buying seeds i highly

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,039

where you spend your money

126
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:46,158

144
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,679
vendors on my website i put them up

145
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,719
there because i've done a lot of

146
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,959
business with them

147
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,880

148
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,279

have not been added to the website yet

150
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:30,959

151
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,319
get them seeds they get going i make

152
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,319
sure they're cool

153
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,680
i do a little bit of recon maybe i order

154
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,439
seeds from them and they don't even know

155
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,079
it was me or maybe i have a friend order

156
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:39,519
seeds and

157
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,039
we just make sure the seeds come in a

158
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,159
timely manner that they're packaged

159
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
appropriately i

160
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,439
inspect them make sure they didn't [ __ ]

161
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,639

162
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,000
on that sort of stuff

163
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,519
once i'm sure that the companies are

164
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,040
legit they're doing a good job then we

165

a lot of people sometimes you do get

200
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,240
seeds sometimes you don't even get seeds

201
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,439
from some of these vendors

202
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,038

203
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,160
selling irish seeds and i've never

204

222
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,439
pretty soon

223
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
i've got to pass the info to the web guy

224
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:25,839
he's got to do it i've got to approve

225
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,360
them first of all

226
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:28,560
is the main thing here so be very

227
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,759
careful when you're buying seeds buy

228
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,839
from a reputable

229
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,199
vendor what some of them are doing they

230
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,879
just take your money and they say

231
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,360
thank you and the cool thing about a

232
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,959
website is i can print customer reviews

233
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,919
and make it look like part of my website

234
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:41,839
and i can say

235
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,198
like rasta jeff donated 10 million

236
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,239
dollars to our charity

237
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,680
he came here and [ __ ] healed the sick

238
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,038
he touched little kids and they walked

239
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,598
they were in wheelchairs for their whole

240
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,439
lives

241
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,360
there were [ __ ] people with aids in

242
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:54,639
cancer and he blew kisses at them and

243
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
they danced in the streets and they're

244
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,598
healed i could put that on my website i

245
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,800
could make a customer review that looks

246
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,918
like that happened

247
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,000
the internet is really easy to

248
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,598
manipulate so you go to a website

249
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,360
and you see a thousand good reviews

250
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,000
great shipping good product amazing

251
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,800
outcome

252
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,160
and you're sold you know what i mean but

253
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
then you buy the [ __ ] and the [ __ ]

254
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
either

255
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,879
doesn't show up or what does often

256
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,280
happen uh so that these people can keep

257
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:17,598
taking your money they do send you seeds

258
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:19,598
but

259
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:21,279
it is nothing like what you expected it

260
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,959
to be it is not my seeds it's not the

261
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,638
stuff i bred i never touched it

262
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:26,318
i don't know what it is they never did

263
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,840
any business with me they don't even

264
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,360
have my stuff but they're saying

265
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,439
these are i received so you buy a

266
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,639
package and it's just random seeds that

267
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,478
they got from

268
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,400
whoever wherever they could have bred

269
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,439
them in their backyard they could have

270
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:39,839
bought them from

271
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:41,120
a breeder in another country their

272
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:42,959
cousin could be doing it

273
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
but the point is that those are not the

274
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,560
genetics you paid for you got seeds

275
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,679
but you don't know the pedigree you

276
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
don't know the lineage you don't know

277
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
the heritage you're not going to get

278
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,120
when you saw the arise or strawberry

279
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:54,719
starburst on the website you went i want

280
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,560
that for a specific reason a lot of

281
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,120
people do a lot of research before they

282
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,360
pull to

283
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,439
pull the trigger on a pack of seeds uh

284
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
money's expensive seeds are expensive

285
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,199
and i try you guys i know i'm rambling

286
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,559
now but i try really hard to keep my

287
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,478
seeds affordable

288
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
i have to be competitive with the market

289
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,079
and stay at market rate but i'm a little

290
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,560
bit lower than most of the

291
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,000
the big dogs because uh grow from your

292
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,439
heart breed with love but i'm trying to

293
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,800
get the seeds out to the people that

294
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:20,319
don't have a lot of money you don't need

295
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,439
to be rich to be a grower i don't want

296
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,280
you to have a lot of money

297
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,478
to be able to get into this club i want

298
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,318
everybody growing so

299
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,318
i try to keep my seeds affordable i

300
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,439
often wonder if when you're scrolling

301
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,840
through when you see

302
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,440
uh like i'm not even gonna say the

303
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:35,278
breeder but some breeders have seeds

304
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,880
listed at like three and five and six

305
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:38,320
hundred dollars on websites and then you

306
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:40,320
scroll down and you see mine

307
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,839
they're about 80 bucks on most websites

308
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,760
80 90 depending on

309
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
what shipping is and all that good stuff

310
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,679
it's about 80 or 90 bucks for a 10 pack

311
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,120
of my seeds which i think is very

312
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,278
very affordable when you look around a

313
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,159
lot of them are 120 130

314
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,200
and then you see those 300 and 500 packs

315
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,519
i wonder

316
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,720
if that almost devalues my product do

317
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,080
people say well that's cheap [ __ ]

318
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,759
because it's cheap [ __ ]

319
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,360
but honestly it's because i don't need

320
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,278
to get rich and

321
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,360
uh trying to get the seeds out that was

322
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,799
the goal is to get good seeds in the

323
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,480
hands of good people

324
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,159
and good people aren't always rich

325
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,200
people but be careful you guys when

326
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,879
you're spending your money

327
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,320
be careful because i want you to get

328
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:17,600
what you think you're paying for you've

329
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,680
done all this research

330
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,278
you've [ __ ] watched seven episodes on

331
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:22,079
a rise you've heard me talk about a rise

332
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,679
for five years

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,680
get

367
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,360
any other breeder i don't even care who

368
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,479
you ask me if you can't find them and i

369

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,519
between other breeders i don't see any

373
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,278

408
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:30,159

409

nobody else at the fish show because

489
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,919
nobody else realized you had to go from

490
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,519
the airport to the island to the bus to

491
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:52,879
the [ __ ] little boat to this thing to

492
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,959

493
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,320
hovercraft to the [ __ ] walkway

494
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,838

495
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,120
the fisher and we got to call out songs

496
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,639

show you guys

518
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,959
this one came from this one came from

519
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,359
the irie genetics website

520
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,599
iriegenetics.com

521
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,278
on that website there is a grow help tab

522
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
if you click on the grow help tab

523
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,799
it takes you to the grow help section we

524
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,600
do ask you about

525
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,278
10 preliminary questions things like uh

526
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,800
what's your name what name should we use

527
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:55,519
on the podcast what strain are you

528
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,879
growing

529
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,278
basic questions we don't ask you

530
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,480
anything too invasive this helps me help

531
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:01,838
you if i have a little bit of

532
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,879
information i know what's going on in

533
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
your grow

534
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,159
this is just like checking your polls

535
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,199
checking your temperature making sure

536
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:08,799
that you're alive

537
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,799
this is a little bit of a little waiting

538
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,399
room a little check-in stuff here

539
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,479
but anyway this came from the website

540
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,839
the grow help tab you answer those quick

541
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,360
few questions then at the bottom there's

542
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,320
an opportunity to type in and tell me

543
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,199
what your problem

544
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,720
is and then i do my best to help you uh

545
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:23,519
so let's jump right into it this one

546
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,759
came

547
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,440
from it says name to use on the podcast

548
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,319
our dog what up our dog thank you for

549
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,079
the message

550
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,639
uh their strain they are growing is

551
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,399
magic melon they're growing it outdoors

552
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,399
they're growing under the sun the plants

553
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,399
are in veg they're in soil

554
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,078
uh we do ask about the feeding and stuff

555
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,360
but that doesn't matter for

556
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,359
this question i already know what's

557
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,039
going on here so we've got some plants

558
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,959
outdoor we're growing magic melon i've

559
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,919
never heard of magic melon that sounds

560
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,000
pretty nice

561
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:51,120
uh magic is always good in a strained

562
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,159
name get your [ __ ] high gets you

563
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,799
buzzed and melon

564
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,039
who doesn't like melon flavored products

565
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,078
i'm way off topic let's get back to it i

566
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,078
have one plant

567
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,838
that i put outside all right we got a

568
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,679
plant outside it started flowering

569
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,279
that makes sense i'm thinking it may

570
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,838
have been from not up potting it soon

571
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,439
enough but i don't know

572
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,240
plants get confused when we take them

573
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:14,720
from hid lighting on a schedule

574
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,079
uh that's [ __ ] solid solid schedule

575
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,839
and the same thing every day and then we

576
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,439
put them outside in nature

577
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,880
they got a little bit of a change

578
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,800
they're experiencing

579
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:24,159
far red and phytochrome experiences

580
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,359
they've never had before plants kind of

581
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,559
trip out when you put them outside if

582
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
it's not the right time if they aren't

583
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,159
timed

584
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,519
just right um and that's an outdoor

585
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:32,879
grower with a lot of experience who

586
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,000
could teach you more about that jesse is

587
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:35,360
the guy to talk to there

588
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,799
so you gotta time it right or they will

589
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,560
go into flower and then they will go

590
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,679
back into veg which is what i think is

591
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:41,518
going to happen here

592
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:42,879
it says i up potted to a three gallon

593
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,720
from a one gallon

594
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,720
i let her get settled in and i decided

595
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,600
to pollinate with some pollen i

596
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,519
collected

597
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,879
from a male so we've got a plant that's

598
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,120
outside um

599
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,399
it started to flower it got pollinated

600
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,919
with some pollen

601
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,078
uh that makes totally good sense so far

602
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:01,838
uh it says here we are about two weeks

603
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,120
later and she looks like she is

604
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,959
re-veging

605
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
uh yeah the season right now the plants

606
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,919
will re-veg

607
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,759
uh they'll start re-veging for you it'll

608
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,319
go kind of crazy it'll get bigger it'll

609
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,838
grow stronger and longer and then it's

610
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:15,918
gonna flower here i think

611
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,759
uh august right august i don't even

612
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,959
remember dude jesse taught me but i'm an

613
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:20,000
indoor guy so i don't pay too much

614
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,720
attention to this

615
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,679
anyway the question is will she make

616
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,318
seeds

617
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,559
uh the short answer is yeah uh all of

618
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:31,119
those pollination sites all of those

619
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,879
uh the pistols that were pollinated if

620
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,239
you have got a pollinated ovule and that

621
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,360
seed has begun

622
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,919
yes it will make seeds the plant has

623
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,240
shifted

624
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,240
all of its energy now to making seeds

625
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,798
it's not going to focus on making

626
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,679
thc it's going to focus on make or cbd

627
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,160
or whatever the

628
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,160
cannabinoid profile of that plant may be

629
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,720
it's going to shift gears now and work

630
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,919
on

631
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
making seeds it's going to make

632
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,919
different oils it's going to go into a

633
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:55,918
different

634
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,600
uh just a different goal of life now

635
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,440
that plant's whole goal before

636
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:00,719
pollination was to receive pollen i was

637
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
just like pollinate me please

638
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,839
please please and you did it and now

639
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,440
it's like i'm shifting gears

640
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,038
uh now i'm pregnant i'm protecting my

641
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,558
babies i'm making big healthy strong

642
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:09,359
babies my defenses are a little bit

643
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:11,200
different

644
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,918
it's shifting gears so yes it is going

645
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,480
to continue to make seeds

646
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,000
your plant will go back into veg and

647
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,679
then it will continue to make

648
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,919
seeds while it's vegging then it'll go

649
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,200
into flour and continue to make seeds

650
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,038
while it's flowering so you may get

651
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,319
some lower parts that are seeded and

652
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:29,599
then as the plant goes into veg and

653
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,038
grows more

654
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,558
it'll grow more new growth and then

655
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,160
it'll go into flower and you may have

656
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:35,759
new buds that aren't even seeded or you

657
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,120
may have crazy reef edge

658
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,319
i don't know how hard your plant is

659
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,079
going to re-veg i don't know the

660
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:41,839
genetics i don't know

661
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,678
this is going to be very plant plant

662
00:18:41,839 --> 00:18:45,359
specific very much so

663
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,120
um i want to talk about something else

664
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,319
this is what i do when i'm breeding

665
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,079
indoors

666
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,000
i talk about this a lot and people think

667
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,038
i'm crazy i've said it a few times on

668
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,558
the show and people

669
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,400
always send me messages they're like is

670
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,279
that really what you meant to say

671
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,880
to where i have to type the numbers 18 6

672
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,279
in the titles of the episode so that

673
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,559
people

674
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,399
really believe me that that's what i'm

675
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:06,399
talking about here's what i do when i'm

676
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,000
breeding seeds the seeds that

677
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,679
you guys are purchasing the seeds that

678
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,359
come from seeds herenow.com from

679
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,120
heritage seed bank from golden ticket

680
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,199
seeds from el fuego seeds

681
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,558
from shy town seeds i know i'm missing

682
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
somebody but i love you guys all

683
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,079
equally um those seeds that you are

684
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,319
purchasing

685
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:23,519
those are made with this method i

686
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,279
pollinate the plants

687
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,798
naturally normally like we normally do

688
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:28,319
it i get the male into flower i get the

689
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,400
females into flower

690
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:33,119
uh some females want to get pollinated

691
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,080
around day 25 somewhat pollen around day

692
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:35,918
32

693
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,519
i stagger the female plants in the room

694
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,320
i get the male pollinating to where he's

695
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,918
really

696
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:41,359
dumping a lot of pollen busting a big

697
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,360
load when it's the right time

698
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,399
drag the boy over the girls put him

699
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:44,959
right in the middle of the girls give

700
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,080
him a good

701
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,759
shake then i wait three to five days

702
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,519
then i give him another good shake at

703
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,000
this point i'm done with the male plant

704
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,519
so i will cut him down and honestly i

705
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,119
beat him against the [ __ ] ceiling so

706
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,639
that all that pollen rains down

707
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:00,879
all over the plant sometimes i'll smack

708
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
him against the fan uh it's really funny

709
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,520
when the fan is spinning and you smack a

710
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,038
male plant against the fan

711
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,038
pollen just goes [ __ ] everywhere it

712
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,240
is disgusting you taste it it gets in

713
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,000
your hair it gets in your dreads you

714
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,679
really got to clean that [ __ ] up

715
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,119
unless you're a savage breeder i

716
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,280
wouldn't really recommend doing that but

717
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,558
for a breeder that's the way to do it so

718
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,399
take the dude over there

719
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,079
smack him get that pollen everywhere the

720
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
girls are now they've been double

721
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,759
pollinated they've taken two loads of

722
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,759
pollen i'm sure that every pistol

723
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,359
in that [ __ ] room has received paul

724
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,440
and there is pollen everywhere i'm

725
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,558
tasting it it's in my teeth i got this

726
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,798
and this gritty tea

727
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,158
taste in my teeth the camera feels dusty

728
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,879
if i'm holding the camera

729
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,880
it is funky in there so we have achieved

730
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,799
successful pollination at this point

731
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,240
i'll wait three maybe five days

732
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,158
sometimes a little bit longer

733
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,440
i wanna watch the pistols curl up and i

734
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,039
wanna be sure that that

735
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,798
uh that those girls are pregnant i want

736
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,599
to make sure the pollination has taken

737
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:51,759
place once

738
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,599
i see the when you plants get pollinated

739
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,480
the pistols will start to wither up and

740
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,558
turn brown

741
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,159
that's why i always say pistols are

742
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,839
never a guide

743
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,440
or a determining factor to help you

744
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:02,720
determine ripeness the pistols can get

745
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,960
weathered up from getting touched

746
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,880
getting sprayed getting pollinated

747
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
getting too hot too cold too moist too

748
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,360
dry those will wither up so don't ever

749
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,880
let those

750
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,399
trick you into thinking the plants ready

751
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,000
because they've done something could

752
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,679
simply have a pollinated plant

753
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,279
a spider could have crawled across there

754
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,038
you could have touched it anything could

755
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:19,678
have [ __ ] that up too hot too cold too

756
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:21,919
dry

757
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,759
wind all kinds of stuff anyway after

758
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,200
pollination those pistols will wither

759
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,599
they'll start shrinking in

760
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,400
turning brown changing shape then within

761
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:29,918
a few days

762
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,600
you'll just start seeing something

763
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,200
different looking the buds don't look

764
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:34,480
like they normally do

765
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,919
normally where you've got a calyx

766
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,679
farming it looks a little bit harder

767
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,360
it's got like something going on

768
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,480
it's a seed in there that's what that is

769
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:45,439
the seed is forming once i see that seed

770
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
you might think i'm crazy but i switch

771
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:50,000
my lights back

772
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:52,480
to 18 hours on and six hours off that's

773
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,440
a 24 hour light cycle of 18 on

774
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:58,000
and six off why would i do that my goal

775
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,159
is no longer to produce a big fat

776
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,519
bud that's coated in trichomes and is

777
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,360
going to get all trimmed up and be

778
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,400
pretty and posted in a magazine

779
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,359
and then get smoked this bud is loaded

780
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,600
with seeds

781
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,279
i'm going to cut this plant down and

782
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,798
grind it up with gloves on

783
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,480
i'm just going to grind it up over a

784
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,119
bowl and it's going to drop seeds it's

785
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,519
just going to be

786
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,399
dust all of that plant material is going

787
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,960
into a compost pile or a bokashi bucket

788
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,320
that is not going to be used as smokable

789
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,200
consumable flour

790
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,839
in any way it is all being grown for

791
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,759
seed

792
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,079
so if you're growing for just seed at

793
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:35,839
this point flip that [ __ ] to 18

794
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:39,119
6. now we are getting more light energy

795
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:42,240
per day in my opinion i think

796
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,158
light is the number one most useful

797
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,079
nutrient whatever you want to call it

798
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,320
the source of life energy

799
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,839
for that plant light is what it wants

800
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:51,759
more than anything

801
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,678
so you give it more light that gives the

802
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,079
plant more energy that gives it more

803
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,038
time

804
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,240
per day to build healthy babies it's

805
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,480
getting more light it's

806
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,919
doing photosynthesis it's saying hey i

807
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
got all this light to work with it's

808
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:05,280
going to be a long day i can

809
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,798
work out all day i'm out here it's

810
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:08,158
lifting weights or it's in the garden or

811
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:08,960
whatever you do that keeps you healthy

812
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,280
it's doing that

813
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,880
all day long it's got six more hours to

814
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,480
do it than the plants that are only

815
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,679
getting 12 12.

816
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,558
what i find by leaving the lights on for

817
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,798
the extra six

818
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:25,759
hours my seeds are harder and thicker

819
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,720
and fatter and prettier and healthier

820
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,960
and

821
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,400
a more successful germination rate and

822
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,159
more vigorous plants

823
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,240
than the plants that i was leaving under

824
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,000
a 12-12 flowering cycle

825
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,839
something i have also noticed is these

826
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
plants these seeds

827
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:41,199
finish a little bit earlier sometimes

828
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,519
it'll take

829
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,038
10 weeks 11 weeks for a seed to get good

830
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:45,679
and hard when i'm doing it in this

831
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,558
method

832
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,679
they're done in eight weeks maybe nine

833
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,079
but it's quicker

834
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,759
it's 10 to 14 days quicker most of the

835
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,359
time sometimes a little bit longer

836
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,798
depending on the cultivar

837
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:58,479
some plants just want to take a long

838
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:59,440
time to make seeds some really just want

839
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
to take forever

840
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,798
some of them will spit out seeds in no

841
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,559
time it's really amazing and really

842
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:06,798
just watching different plants do this

843
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,319
when i breed to the platinum tangy

844
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,918
that's where the sun kiss comes from the

845
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,158
orange gasm comes from

846
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,600
uh that one wants pollen really early

847
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,120
and when she gets hit with that pollen

848
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,278
those seeds are done before everybody

849
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,959
else so i could take her down early

850
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:20,720
the strawberry starburst on the other

851
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,519
hand which is what makes the strawberry

852
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,798
fields

853
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,319
and other stuff that's going to be

854
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,200
released here in the future uh we'll

855
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,319
talk about that

856
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,519
soon uh that one she wants pollen closer

857
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:31,759
to day 30.

858
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,278
so the sun kiss or the platinum tangy

859
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,640
wants pollen like day 23

860
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:39,759
25. strawberry fields wants the pollen

861
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,679
around day 30. 27 day 32 in that range

862
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,599
is when it's best to pollinate her for

863
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
maximum pollination i can hit her early

864
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:45,519
but she's not going to make as many

865
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
seeds

866
00:24:45,519 --> 00:24:49,359
as she would if i waited and gave her

867
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,199
time to make more fuzz that little

868
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:52,879
the hairs the pistols the more of those

869
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,679
the more seeds i'm able to make so

870
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,000
give her a little bit longer but that by

871
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,759
then

872
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
that [ __ ] platinum tangy plant's

873
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,679
almost done the seeds are already

874
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,960
getting

875
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,960
formed in the plant i haven't even

876
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,640
pollinated the other plant yet

877
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,319
i have because i stagger the start times

878
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,880
honestly but that's that plant's going

879
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:08,319
to take

880
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,840
10 weeks for those seeds to get ready

881
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,879
the other one's going to take seven so

882
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:12,720
that's why

883
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,880
sometimes things are sold out that's why

884
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,278
things are staggered but that is mainly

885
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,559
why

886
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:20,400
i do the 18 6 because it makes my seeds

887
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,960
finish a little bit more quickly

888
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,759
i think they are stronger harder bigger

889
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,798
faster

890
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,000
i have more successful seeds

891
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,759
if you're a breeder and you've made a

892
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
whole room of seeds you'll notice that

893
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:32,240
you get

894
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,400
a portion of your seeds or those white

895
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,599
unusable seeds

896
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,360
excuse me some of your seeds are going

897
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,558
to make are going to be throw away seeds

898
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:39,918
you just got to toss them or keep them

899
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:40,960
for yourself and grow them don't share

900
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,240
them don't sell them

901
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,319
because people freak out when you give

902
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,038
them those ugly white seeds i get less

903
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:47,359
of those

904
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:48,400
when i do the 18 6 method i find that i

905
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,359
just have more

906
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,759
successful seeds in the batch also this

907
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:56,158
is not a sales pitch for canon leds

908
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:57,038
in my experience i'm getting better

909
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,320
seeds under

910
00:25:57,038 --> 00:26:01,440
leds i'm getting better seeds under leds

911
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,399
running them on 18

912
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,480
6. that is the magic [ __ ] formula in

913
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,000
my opinion for making seeds

914
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,839
that's what i've had the most success

915
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,798
with leds

916
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,480
on 18 6 after pollination so the

917
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:14,960
question here that got all this started

918
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,960
was

919
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,400
uh is this going to work yes this is

920
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,159
going to work for you you're going to

921
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,480
have seeds and your plants

922
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,679
uh will re-veg for a little bit and

923
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,000
they'll go back into flower and you'll

924
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,960
have

925
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,640
seeds if you're doing this indoors

926
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,319
though you can you're leaving them on 18

927
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,038
6 indefinitely they don't go back into

928
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,879
flower

929
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:35,200
what will begin to happen is you will

930
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,880
have a plant that is filled with seeds

931
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,480
and the top buds of the plant will start

932
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,679
making re-veg shoots

933
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,679
if you leave them long enough they'll

934
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,120
re-veg and make full-on clones out of

935
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,159
the top of these flowered plants that

936
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,599
have seeds

937
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,600
you've got the opportunity to go in

938
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,759
there and cut clones off of those plants

939
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:51,359
if you did not save your genetics now is

940
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,079
your time you've got these genetics

941
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,599
again you can rescue them right now

942
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,639
another thing i do that people think is

943
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:02,240
crazy i do this to plants that are not

944
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,919
seeded this is for my usable smokable

945
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,000
consumable product this is what i'm

946
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:09,120
doing with finished product

947
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,679
flowers that i intend to smoke myself or

948
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,918
with mic

949
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,600
or with patience or however it ends up

950
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,038
this is what i really do

951
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:18,798
the last 14 maybe 10 days depending on

952
00:27:17,038 --> 00:27:19,599
the strain and the room and the needs of

953
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:22,720
the room

954
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,079
i do put my lights back on 18 6 for my

955
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,759
flowering plants

956
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:28,000
i do this for the same reason that i do

957
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:29,759
the seeded plants i feel that light

958
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,839
is the number one source of light and

959
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:33,278
energy for our plants you got lights air

960
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,720
water and soil there's not a lot to

961
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:35,839
think about lights i think are number

962
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,319
one

963
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:41,038
so i put the lights back on 18 6 for the

964
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,519
last 10 days maybe the last 14 days

965
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,720
and i noticed the plants get bigger

966
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,119
fatter beefier

967
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,200
bulkier they just bulk up that extra

968
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,038
light energy gives them more energy to

969
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,880
grow to bulk up to beef up and that's

970
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,798
what we want right at the end

971
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,559
now people are gonna say you're putting

972
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,879
my flowering plants on eighteen

973
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,798
six from twelve twelve that's gonna [ __ ]

974
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,080
up my crop my plants are going to go

975
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,278
back into a vegetative

976
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,599
stage yes if you don't cut them down in

977
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,278
10 to 14 days they will go back into veg

978
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:11,599
but we're looking to harvest here

979
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,440
in 10 to 14 days anyway that's not gonna

980
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,959
happen that's you've got time for that

981
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,080
to happen you're gonna cut them down

982
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,840
before that

983
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,319
so you've got to do this with a plant

984
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,759
with a cultivar you are experienced and

985
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:24,639
growing something you know

986
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,079
this plant takes 64 days do it to a

987
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,480
plant that you know

988
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,278
then at day 50 flip that [ __ ] timer

989
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,599
back to 18

990
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,919
6 you may be able to cut that plant down

991
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,719
instead of 64 you may be cutting it down

992
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,480
at day 60. so when you start flushing

993
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,278
flip that timer back to 18

994
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,159
6 pay very close attention to your

995
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,000
trichomes

996
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,000
and pay attention to the tips of the

997
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,640
tops of the buds at the very top of the

998
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,440
plant

999
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:51,520
if the plant should decide to go back

1000
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,000
into veg it will happen at the very tip

1001
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,599
top of the very top bud on that plant

1002
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,359
and you'll see it it'll just look

1003
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,558
different it'll look like the bud and

1004
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,240
the bud and then there'll be just a

1005
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:03,119
little thing coming out of the top

1006
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,880
harvest now it's starting to re-veg it's

1007
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,398
not a big deal if it starts

1008
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:11,200
but take note it [ __ ] 12 days into

1009
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:12,319
18-6 it was time you just cut two days

1010
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,919
off your harvest time

1011
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:15,519
if you make note of that you can cut two

1012
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,480
more off next time before that little

1013
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,639
nub happens

1014
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,480
you just cut four days off of your cycle

1015
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,278
and the plants are going to be bigger

1016
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,759
fatter and beefier now here's another

1017
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:27,278
thing

1018
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,798
that this benefits if you were looking

1019
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,960
to re-veg your plants

1020
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,000
if you did not get a clone of this plant

1021
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,159
you can

1022
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,480
put it on 18-6 for the last two weeks of

1023
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,120
flower harvest most of the plant when

1024
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,038
you're done

1025
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,119
leave a couple nugs at the bottom and

1026
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,278
those are already re-veging they've been

1027
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,278
in 18-6 for two weeks now

1028
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,640
the hormones have already switched over

1029
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:47,599
you're two weeks ahead of yourself on

1030
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,200
your reveg

1031
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:50,879
you just gotta wait a little bit of time

1032
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,679
now now that you cut the rest of that

1033
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,200
plant off

1034
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,880
and all the energy is not moving around

1035
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,319
the hormones aren't like i'm in flour up

1036
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,320
here i'm in veg over here

1037
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,839
the plant's gonna say he took off all my

1038
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,359
flowers i've just got these little

1039
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,240
flowers here to deal with

1040
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,558
i got a big root zone and i'm on 18 6.

1041
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,399
he wants me to veg watch this kapow and

1042
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:08,879
it will veg really quickly that way on

1043
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:10,798
you

1044
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,240
so carefully pay attention to your

1045
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,038
plants you can put them on 18

1046
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,519
6 at the end of flower for 10 to 14 days

1047
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,240
and

1048
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,398
in my experience not my opinion in my

1049
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,720
experience they will get beefier

1050
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,398
fatter chunkier you'll have a fatter

1051
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,640
weight you'll have more bud and they'll

1052
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,359
probably be a little bit more dense

1053
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,080
so 18 6 is a good thing toward the end

1054
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:34,959
if you're making seeds 18 6 is good

1055
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,319
a little bit after pollination get a lot

1056
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,640
of messages about that

1057
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:40,079
i mean it it's real it helps you with a

1058
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,278
lot of things it also sets you up for

1059
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:42,558
that revenge so if you're trying to

1060
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,599
reveg

1061
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:47,440
you can pollinate a room and then get

1062
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:49,278
seeds out of it and then pull clones off

1063
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,360
of it and have a mother plant to grow

1064
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,038
again or you can grow your plants and

1065
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,398
harvest them and i said harvest i got

1066
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:55,679
one of those hard ages again

1067
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:57,759
you can harvest the plants and then you

1068
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,600
got clones coming up that you can re-veg

1069
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:01,119
make a mother plant out of don't be

1070
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:02,719
afraid to experiment you guys

1071
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:04,719
don't be afraid to experiment i do

1072
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,079
understand these plants are precious

1073
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,519
you're learning a lot you're growing a

1074
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,278
lot they may be paying the bills they're

1075
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,880
keeping you medically supplied

1076
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:12,960
but don't be afraid to try some

1077
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,320
experiments i do think that this 186

1078
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,880
idea that i switched to

1079
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,599
was a really good idea uh it's helping

1080

1081
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,119

we were chilling at maddie and spence's

and people kept asking me the same grow

1108
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,000
question and i said

1109
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:13,439
i should record this and when people ask

1110
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,519
me the same damn question i should just

1111
