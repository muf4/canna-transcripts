48
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:48,210
you to a new strain let's talk about one

49
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:51,239
of my newest creations let's talk about

50
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:52,798
orange gasm orange gasm is a cross of

51
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,569
platinum tangi from our friends at the

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,689
garden of Weeden pollinated by a

53
00:01:54,569 --> 00:01:59,459
reversed golden goat so I took a female

54
00:01:57,688 --> 00:02:02,398
golden goat plant I treated it with a

55
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:04,828
solution that solution caused that plant

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,450
to create pollen sacks those pollen

57
00:02:04,828 --> 00:02:09,000
sacks contained pollen which only

58
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,370
contain female chromosomes I applied

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,349
that female pollen on to the platinum

60
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,680
tangi plant and we have made or

61
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,539
Yasim feminized seeds my goal when I was

62
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,849
creating orange gasm was to create a

63
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:23,549
really orange and tangerine flavoured

64
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,210
feminized seed lion I really think I

65
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,219
nailed it

66
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,409
what I got was that sweet orange

67
00:02:26,219 --> 00:02:30,659
tangerine creamsicle sort of a flavor I

68
00:02:28,409 --> 00:02:32,789
brought that Platinum tangi flowering

69
00:02:30,659 --> 00:02:34,650
time and platinum tangi growth pattern

70
00:02:32,789 --> 00:02:36,810
and structure into the cross and then it

71
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,819
also added that golden goat potency a

72
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,189
little bit of sweetness and some of the

73
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,139
phenotypes even bring out a grapefruit

74
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:46,109
sort of flavor and aroma which comes

75
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:48,209
from the golden goat side of things so

76
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,430
my main goal was to create a feminized

77
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:52,710
seed they carried that delicious orange

78
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,780
Terp flavor it looks like in the process

79
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:56,640
I created a great structured plant that

80
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,860
has a great flavor and tremendous

81
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,719
potency so let's talk more about the

82
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,480
orange gasm let's start by talking about

83
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,460
the parents of orange gasm orange gasm

84
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:08,189
is a cross of the Platinum tangi and

85
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:11,430
golden go platinum tangi is of course a

86
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,930
tangi male named Julius Julius was

87
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,730
selected by our friends at the garden of

88
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,069
Weeden big shout out to Maddy and Spence

89
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:19,829
so they used Julius to pollinate a

90
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:21,989
Platinum cookies female so they had the

91
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,270
Platinum Girl Scout cookies pollinated

92
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,330
by Julius that made platinum tangi

93
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:29,460
platinum tangi has a delicious greasy

94
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:31,380
orange smell with a hint of that girl

95
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,700
scout cookies background there's

96
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,710
something funky there's something

97
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,899
slightly spicy there's something dirty

98
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:38,879
to it so it's like a greasy funky orange

99
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,620
with a hint of armpits maybe a little

100
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,810
bit of skunk going on I really

101
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,969
appreciate the platinum tangi it grows

102
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,259
beautifully it's got the greatest growth

103
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:47,819
structure that's one of my favorite

104
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:50,159
things about it the way that it grows as

105
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:52,079
a grower as a commercial grower platinum

106
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,969
tangi always did a great job in the

107
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,610
production rooms it always helped me get

108
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:59,129
bonuses and the flavors and aromas are

109
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,680
unbeatable it makes amazing concentrates

110
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,359
so then I paired that up with the golden

111
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,270
go let's talk about golden go for a

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,430
moment golden goat is a Hawaiian Romulan

113
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:10,500
mail that pollinated an island sweet

114
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,599
skunk female so we've got a lot of great

115
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,210
genetics in there I see that Island

116
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,310
sweet skunk come out a lot in the orange

117
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:20,220
gasm phenotypes that is what will bring

118
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,199
out that pink grapefruit sort of aroma

119
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,330
that comes from the island sweet skunk

120
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:26,159
golden goat was bred by a guy who's

121
00:04:24,329 --> 00:04:27,029
known as mr. dank and he is from Topeka

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,250
Kansas

123
00:04:27,029 --> 00:04:30,569
I've done a full Episode on golden goat

124
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:32,910
so if you would like to learn a lot

125
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,949
about golden goat I suggest checking out

126
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:36,750
episode 418 of the growth from your

127
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:39,689
heart podcast that entire episode is

128
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,060
heavily focused on golden goat golden

129
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:43,949
goat brings a really delightful tropical

130
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,569
smell it has some citrus to it it has

131
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,789
hints of pineapple to it it has a

132
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,980
beautiful growth structure golden goat

133
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:52,800
always puts out huge harvest and also I

134
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,569
love the potency of golden goat I have

135
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,120
seen golden don't reach impressive lab

136
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:58,649
test numbers but also sometimes I have

137
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,629
smoked a golden goat that didn't show

138
00:04:58,649 --> 00:05:02,729
impressive lab tests but it blew me away

139
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:04,500
when I smoked it so there's something

140
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:06,090
special about that golden goat I have

141
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,800
always been a big fan of golden goat

142
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:09,418
I've obviously fallen in love with it

143
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,210
because you see it in a lot of my

144
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:14,189
breeding so I used a female golden goat

145
00:05:12,209 --> 00:05:16,379
clone it was treated with the solution

146
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:18,930
which made it create pollen sacks which

147
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:20,819
only contained female pollen I applied

148
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:22,889
that female pollen to the platinum tangi

149
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:24,779
we have now got the orange gasm seeds

150
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,839
let's talk more specifically about the

151
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:29,728
orange Gaza as a consumer the first

152
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,199
thing you are going to notice about

153
00:05:29,728 --> 00:05:36,719
orange gasm is the insanely intense

154
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,550
pungent orange aroma it is orange II it

155
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,710
is tangerines there are hints of

156
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:43,020
grapefruit it almost smells like

157
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:45,870
somebody sprayed orange ozium in the

158
00:05:43,019 --> 00:05:48,029
room or directly into your face it's

159
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:49,918
like you were in a small compact car and

160
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,569
somebody has got that orange ozium and

161
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,728
they just won't keep spraying it it

162
00:05:51,569 --> 00:05:56,009
smells like you cleaned the entire world

163
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:59,310
with citrus cleaner it carries a

164
00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:01,560
tremendous orange smell it also kind of

165
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,660
smells like tang powder if you used to

166
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,329
make Tang back in the day it's got that

167
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:09,600
strong overpowering fake orange flavor

168
00:06:06,329 --> 00:06:11,849
in some phenotypes also some phenotypes

169
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,520
will have a really sweet smooth

170
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:17,550
creamsicle sort of aroma and flavor I

171
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:20,370
really like the array of tangerine and

172
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:22,740
sweet orange flavors that come from the

173
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,500
orange Gaza one of the best things about

174
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,720
orange gasm is the concentrates if you

175
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,370
were a concentrate maker of any type you

176
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,440
will find a beautiful phenotype of

177
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,810
orange gasm for your concentrate

178
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,848
production there's a phenotype it works

179
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,530
beautifully for ice water extraction

180
00:06:35,848 --> 00:06:39,689
there is a phenotype that works

181
00:06:37,529 --> 00:06:40,659
beautifully to be pressed and almost any

182
00:06:39,689 --> 00:06:43,899
of the phenotype

183
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,720
we'll make wonderful pho extraction all

184
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:49,120
of them are going to smell like

185
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,460
disgusting delicious potent pungent

186
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,590
sweet oranges I can't talk enough about

187
00:06:51,459 --> 00:06:55,269
the orange flavor that comes from orange

188
00:06:53,589 --> 00:06:57,759
gasm you guys I'm gonna say oranges in

189
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:59,319
this episode 3,000 times because that is

190
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,480
the only thing I can think of

191
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,769
when I smell these flowers so now we

192
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:04,600
know that it tastes and smells like

193
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:07,269
oranges I've said that enough let's talk

194
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,330
about growing orange gasm orange gasm is

195
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:13,419
very easy to grow it has a very nice

196
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,800
growth structure and shape one good

197
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:16,689
thing about the orange gasm in

198
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,270
comparison to most of the crosses i make

199
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:21,399
is it does not get ridiculously tall it

200
00:07:19,269 --> 00:07:23,649
will get tall but it will not be a

201
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:26,019
gigantic stretchy plant like most of my

202
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:27,969
other crosses so this one stays a little

203
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:30,099
bit shorter it takes on a very nice

204
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,080
Christmas tree type of a shape but then

205
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,090
it creates what I call a menorah it

206
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:35,979
makes a lot of even length branches you

207
00:07:34,089 --> 00:07:38,259
don't have one big tall top glory bud

208
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,629
you get a nice even canopy out of the

209
00:07:38,259 --> 00:07:42,159
orange gasm I really enjoy that it makes

210
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,110
it great for sea of green type of

211
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,790
growing it makes it great for large

212
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:48,100
commercial production and it is a

213
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,590
wonderful plant for outdoor growing so I

214
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:53,470
really love the structure and the shape

215
00:07:50,589 --> 00:07:56,649
it also it is really stout it makes

216
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:58,720
thick stalks and branches I like to do a

217
00:07:56,649 --> 00:08:00,549
lot of popping and twisting and super

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,680
cropping and this one really takes it

219
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:05,199
well because the branches start off very

220
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,910
thick and very stout if you're growing

221
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,289
in windy conditions or if you need to

222
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,669
put some plants at the end of a row

223
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:11,980
where a fan kind of beats them up a

224
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:13,599
little bit orange gasm may be a perfect

225
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,060
candidate for that type of environment

226
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,740
the stalks are so big the branches are

227
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,689
so stout that I don't worry about the

228
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,699
wind whipping the [ __ ] out of this plant

229
00:08:19,689 --> 00:08:23,168
and if it does whip the [ __ ] out of it

230
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:26,019
if it does get beat up a little bit

231
00:08:23,168 --> 00:08:28,689
orange gasm can take a lot of abuse she

232
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:30,729
is a very Hardy plant the platinum tangi

233
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:32,229
that I used is a very Hardy plant we

234
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,430
have beat the [ __ ] out of it in many

235
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,410
different ways in commercial

236
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,668
environments and it never shows me any

237
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:38,649
stress it's always just like hey I'm

238
00:08:36,668 --> 00:08:40,779
over here growing I'm doing exactly what

239
00:08:38,649 --> 00:08:43,059
she need me to do and then golden goat

240
00:08:40,779 --> 00:08:45,399
is the same it is very vigorous it has a

241
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:48,189
lot of energy so crossing these two

242
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:50,799
created a very energetic plant so it

243
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,360
grows quite quickly in veg and in flower

244
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:54,189
you'll see a lot of growth it'll get

245
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,110
very robust fat

246
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,700
stocks you may want to transplant more

247
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,340
early than you were used to if you were

248
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,350
growing the orange Gaza it does like I

249
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,450
said before it likes being popped and

250
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,700
twisted and it enjoys being topped

251
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:09,009
however you may not need to top it too

252
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,660
much because it does grow that menorah

253
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:12,100
type of a shape or it's got a bunch of

254
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:15,039
arms that all reach up to the same level

255
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:17,230
it may get one kind of one dominant bud

256
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,740
but it's not gonna get a big giant glory

257
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:19,930
Cola

258
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:21,519
in many phenotypes the golden goat

259
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:23,500
dominate phenotype will show you that

260
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,419
glory Cola but more of your platinum

261
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,250
tangi dominate phenotypes aren't going

262
00:09:25,419 --> 00:09:30,159
to have that giant stretch on the top

263
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:33,100
but that perfect growth structure makes

264
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:34,659
orange gasm really easy to trellis if

265
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,159
you're going to throw her in a large

266
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:37,899
commercial facility or if you're going

267
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,089
to put her in a tent she likes to be

268
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:41,769
worked into a net a lot of times people

269
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,879
like to really work the branches into

270
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:44,980
the net and spread them out

271
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,990
orange gasm doesn't need a lot of help

272
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:49,090
to spread it kind of spreads wide on its

273
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:51,190
own what you will need is a little bit

274
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:53,080
of support both of these parents are

275
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,510
heavy producers so the offspring are

276
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,280
obviously going to be large producing

277
00:09:55,509 --> 00:09:59,740
plants you're going to get big buds

278
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,269
throughout the entire grow room so be

279
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,860
ready have some supports have some

280
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:04,509
tomato cages have some sort of

281
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,000
trellising going on but these plants

282
00:10:04,509 --> 00:10:09,009
really do appreciate some trellising and

283
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,039
some scrubbing and some sort of supports

284
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:14,559
they also take very well to defoliating

285
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:16,959
the Platinum tangi dominant phenotypes

286
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,119
won't require heavy defoliation but the

287
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,840
golden goat phenotypes will take very

288
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,759
well to semi heavy defoliation that

289
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,730
brings us to another good point the

290
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:30,370
calyx to leaf ratio many phenotypes of

291
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:32,470
the orange gasm are not very leafy a lot

292
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:34,480
of them will have a very long PDL with a

293
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,269
very big fan leaf coming off of it and

294
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,060
not a lot of small leaves that is known

295
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:41,710
as a good calyx to leaf ratio that makes

296
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:43,689
it easy to trim it makes it easy to

297
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:45,850
defoliate and while the plant is growing

298
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,190
that gives less opportunity and

299
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,960
potential for pests and mildew there are

300
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:52,300
less places for bugs to hide and less

301
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:54,089
places for powdery mildew to cling on so

302
00:10:52,299 --> 00:10:57,069
it gives us less potential for problems

303
00:10:54,089 --> 00:10:59,830
that does make orange gasm a great

304
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:02,530
strain for beginners if you were a new

305
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:04,570
grower I highly recommend orange gasm

306
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:07,689
the Platinum tangi is really easy to

307
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,110
grow the golden goat is very easy to

308
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,750
grow

309
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:13,360
and the orange gasm is even simpler to

310
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:15,820
grow in my opinion orange gasm is only

311
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,259
available in female seeds so that saves

312
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,570
one more step you don't have to search

313
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:22,659
out the males making it even easier for

314
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:25,329
beginner growers orange gasm is also a

315
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:28,389
great strain for outdoor growers in some

316
00:11:25,328 --> 00:11:31,149
locations some phenotypes of orange gasm

317
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:34,269
will finish as early as 56 to 60 days

318
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,458
some phenotypes will take as long as 70

319
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:38,409
days if you've got one of those earlier

320
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,059
finishing phenotypes they do beautifully

321
00:11:38,409 --> 00:11:42,009
outside they don't have a lot of

322
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:44,708
problems because of that wonderful calyx

323
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:47,769
to leaf ratio and I've noticed that the

324
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:49,869
orange gasm does very well in high heat

325
00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:52,360
conditions so if you're growing in a hot

326
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:54,839
outdoor environment orange gasm will do

327
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,190
very well for you it tolerates high heat

328
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,430
another great thing about the orange

329
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:01,300
gasm as it takes errors very well if you

330
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,009
make a mistake

331
00:12:01,299 --> 00:12:05,229
orange gasm is not going to show you

332
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:06,669
immediately that it is completely pissed

333
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:09,129
off if you were growing some Sour Diesel

334
00:12:06,669 --> 00:12:11,110
type stuff if you're growing an OG Kush

335
00:12:09,129 --> 00:12:12,939
plant and you mess up with one feeding

336
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,379
you were going to pay for that in the

337
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,390
end your harvest will not be what you

338
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:18,370
expected the quality may not be what you

339
00:12:16,389 --> 00:12:21,309
expected when you were growing orange

340
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:24,310
gasm you have a lot of room for mistakes

341
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,509
she is a very forgiving plant now that

342
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:27,909
is a good way to segue into talking

343
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:30,970
about feeding orange gasm she is very

344
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:34,000
easy to feed and get dialed in she likes

345
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,278
a lot of nutrients she will go macro

346
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,698
nutrient deficient early in flower if

347
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:42,070
you don't boost up the NPK most of our

348
00:12:39,698 --> 00:12:44,500
cannabis plants do absorb 90% of their

349
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:47,079
nitrogen through their veg phase make

350
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,600
sure you do not let these plants get

351
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,458
nitrogen deficient you will not catch up

352
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,379
so the main thing to look for when you

353
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:55,899
were growing orange gasm is to watch for

354
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:58,480
nutrient deficiencies or nutrient burns

355
00:12:55,899 --> 00:13:01,028
and get that dialed in the thinner

356
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,709
leaved golden goat phenotypes are going

357
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:05,350
to show you that they are experiencing

358
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:06,729
nutrient burn before you see it pop up

359
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,250
and the larger leaved

360
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:11,230
platinum tangi dominant phenotypes so

361
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,490
pay attention to that skinny leaf and if

362
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,199
you see it starting to get its nails

363
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:16,419
done you can tell that you're probably

364
00:13:14,198 --> 00:13:18,429
giving it a little bit too much nutrient

365
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:20,049
if that skinny leaf phenotype is

366
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:21,609
starting to get a little bit pale it

367
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,139
probably needs more

368
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,300
nutrients pay attention to the skinny

369
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:27,370
leaved phenotypes they are going to give

370
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:29,649
you hints before the larger leaved

371
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,230
phenotypes I've mentioned it briefly

372
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:34,839
before but most phenotypes of orange

373
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:38,709
gasm are going to flower from somewhere

374
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:40,420
between 60 and 70 days some of them may

375
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:42,969
finish earlier some of them may finish

376
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:45,129
closer to the 56 day mark I would rather

377
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:48,399
not set that expectation I would rather

378
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:50,740
say 60 to 70 days to be honest with you

379
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,778
you may get some outliers that go 2 to 4

380
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,539
days longer each direction but you can

381
00:13:52,778 --> 00:13:58,000
generally rely on that 60 to 70 day time

382
00:13:55,539 --> 00:14:00,219
line it may be easier to tell early and

383
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,320
flower with the orange gasm which

384
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:04,660
phenotypes will go longer because of the

385
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,149
two parents I used the skinnier leaved

386
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:09,129
phenotypes are going to take closer to

387
00:14:07,149 --> 00:14:10,750
70 days that is a golden goat dominant

388
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:12,939
phenotype it is more sativa dominant

389
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:16,389
that will need to go a little bit longer

390
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:18,519
the wider platinum tangi dominant leaves

391
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:21,039
that phenotype will probably finish

392
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,659
closer to the 60-day mark so pay

393
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,849
attention to the leaf size the leaf

394
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:26,980
shape that will indicate to you how long

395
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:29,860
to go the first time you run these I

396
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:31,930
suggest going 70 full days and flower if

397
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,550
you've got the opportunity now that

398
00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,639
feels like a good way to segue into

399
00:14:33,549 --> 00:14:39,729
talking about expected phenotypes I have

400
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:42,448
seen several different phenotypes pop up

401
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,759
from the orange gasm most of them very

402
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:48,189
closely resemble the Platinum tangi and

403
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:50,528
the golden goat but I do feel like I

404
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:53,019
have seen some Island sweet skunk

405
00:14:50,528 --> 00:14:55,299
dominant phenotypes pop up in the mix

406
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:57,310
some of the common phenotypes you can

407
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,769
expect to see are the golden goat

408
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:01,838
dominant phenotype this one grows very

409
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:05,019
much like golden goat it has got very

410
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,120
long skinny and pointy leaves and it

411
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:09,879
makes very pine cone shaped top buds

412
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:12,159
it's got a very tropical kind of a

413
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,958
pineapple II and citrus sort of aroma to

414
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:15,909
it sometimes that one will bring out a

415
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:17,528
little bit of a grapefruit smell that

416
00:15:15,909 --> 00:15:19,719
does come from the island sweet skunk

417
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:21,639
which we'll talk about in a minute there

418
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:23,889
is another phenotype that obviously is

419
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,409
platinum tangi dominant that is the one

420
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:28,958
with big wide fat leaves

421
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:32,049
sometimes the platinum tangi dominant

422
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:34,328
phenotype will produce purple stems it

423
00:15:32,049 --> 00:15:35,219
does not make a lot of purple leaf and

424
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:37,139
purple by

425
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,149
but it will make purple stems that is a

426
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:41,879
great way to see the Platinum tangi

427
00:15:39,149 --> 00:15:44,189
dominant phenotype early in your growth

428
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,320
a really great phenotype that you are

429
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,450
going to find in packs of orange gasm is

430
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,090
a phenotype that I have named the mean

431
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:52,740
girl or the jagged girl a long time ago

432
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:53,129
I made another cross called heart of

433
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,930
gold

434
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:56,820
and it had a phenotype that I called the

435
00:15:54,929 --> 00:15:59,370
mean girl it was another golden go

436
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:01,500
across I see this same trait coming up

437
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:04,080
in the orange Gazza some of these

438
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:06,809
phenotypes produce a bud that just looks

439
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,520
mean the buds are really jagged the

440
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:10,589
leaves are really serrated it's got a

441
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,840
really tight structure to it and it just

442
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,519
looks like it would be really mean or it

443
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,290
looks like it could be weaponized I just

444
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,730
call it the mean girl phenotype it looks

445
00:16:16,289 --> 00:16:20,879
like it's probably got a switchblade

446
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:22,620
that phenotype grows a little bit more

447
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,500
like the golden goat but it carries that

448
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,500
delicious sweet platinum tangi aroma so

449
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,909
I really love the mean girl phenotype it

450
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,700
is a little bit airier

451
00:16:29,909 --> 00:16:34,469
the buds aren't as tight and compact and

452
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,540
dense as some of the platinum tangi

453
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,190
dominant phenotypes but if you've

454
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,719
listened to the podcast for a while I'm

455
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,570
sure you've heard me say that I think

456
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:44,790
Airy buds are going to be the future for

457
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:46,650
concentrate production I feel like you

458
00:16:44,789 --> 00:16:48,209
have more surface area for trichomes I

459
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:50,669
feel like it's a little bit easier to

460
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:53,310
extract something off of a fluffier area

461
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:55,289
bud than it is a tighter more dense bud

462
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:57,689
so I feel like this one is great for

463
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,669
concentrate production sometimes you

464
00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:02,340
will see that the mean girl phenotype

465
00:16:59,669 --> 00:17:04,109
creates what I call a taco leaf the leaf

466
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:06,000
will curl up kind of looks like a canoe

467
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:08,338
kind of looks like a taco shell it is

468
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,259
folds in half a lot of times people will

469
00:17:08,338 --> 00:17:12,809
think that that is a result of excessive

470
00:17:10,259 --> 00:17:14,338
heat sometimes that is the issue but

471
00:17:12,809 --> 00:17:16,289
that is just a common trait that you

472
00:17:14,338 --> 00:17:19,379
will see happen in the mean girl

473
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:22,230
phenotype of orange gasm that phenotype

474
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,329
is going to extract very well that

475
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,880
phenotype is going to have one of the

476
00:17:24,328 --> 00:17:29,669
most intense orange flavors and aromas

477
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,770
that I have ever bred so that is the

478
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:33,180
mean girl phenotype that is probably the

479
00:17:31,769 --> 00:17:35,549
one I would look for if you're making

480
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:37,560
concentrates if you are going for

481
00:17:35,549 --> 00:17:39,450
potency you may go for more of the

482
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:41,039
golden goat dominant leaning phenotypes

483
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,750
if you're going for that orange flavor

484
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,089
of course go for those wider leave

485
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:48,119
platinum tangi dominant phenotypes

486
00:17:45,089 --> 00:17:49,230
now there is one phenotype that I call

487
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:52,229
the outlier

488
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,808
she is ugly it is really tall it is

489
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,929
really thin it's a little bit wispy it's

490
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:59,548
kind of stretchy she produces fairly

491
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:02,040
well but not as well as the other

492
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:04,558
phenotypes but what she does do is she

493
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:07,440
is encrusted in trichomes there is no

494
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:09,599
room for more resin on those tiny buds

495
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,929
and when you dry it and cure it and

496
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:16,829
smoke it the flavor is like disgusting

497
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:18,900
sour tart grapefruit and it is so

498
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:20,939
pungent and weird then it made my mouth

499
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,179
pucker just thinking about it right now

500
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,460
if you were into pink grapefruit or pink

501
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:29,309
lemonade and grapefruit sort of aromas

502
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,470
that phenotype may be the one for you I

503
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:33,690
feel like that phenotype came from the

504
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,610
island sweet skunk parent from the

505
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:38,610
golden goat so we are seeing things way

506
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:40,709
down the line pop out in this cross when

507
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:42,389
this phenotype pops up if you've paid

508
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,789
attention you won't know it it is

509
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,200
immediately the tallest phenotype it is

510
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:47,789
the one with the branches that are

511
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,140
trying to all keep up with each other

512
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,720
and they are all stretching in

513
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,150
competition a lot of people may want to

514
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,039
call this phenotype immediately if you

515
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:58,830
were into grapefruits this is the one

516
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:01,109
for you it will produce okay but the

517
00:18:58,829 --> 00:19:03,750
potency and the flavors are going to be

518
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:05,668
off the charts so if you're growing just

519
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,859
for yourself and you're into that sweet

520
00:19:05,669 --> 00:19:09,960
grapefruit sort of a flavor I really

521
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:12,899
hope that you are the one defines this

522
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,759
semi rare ugly phenotype of the orange

523
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,769
gasm now let's talk about the one that

524
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:19,470
everybody is going to want I call it the

525
00:19:16,769 --> 00:19:22,200
50/50 as probably obvious why I call it

526
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:25,079
that it is 50% golden goat and it is 50%

527
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,600
platinum tangi and we got the best half

528
00:19:25,079 --> 00:19:30,119
of each one for this phenotype it

529
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,849
carries a tremendous sweet orange flavor

530
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:34,529
it has got that perfect the golden goat

531
00:19:32,849 --> 00:19:36,719
stretch but then it's also got that

532
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:38,730
platinum tangi menorah shape and then it

533
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,890
carries the potency of the golden goat

534
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,589
that phenotype tends to finish up right

535
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:45,540
around 63 days if you were growing this

536
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:46,980
strain in a commercial facility that is

537
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,259
the phenotype that you want that is

538
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,390
perfect it puts out great weight it puts

539
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:53,460
out great flavors and aromas and the bag

540
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,740
appeal on the finished dried and cured

541
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,990
buds is beautiful the buds are bright

542
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:00,029
green the pistils dry up and they stay

543
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,579
bright orange and it creates great bag

544
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:04,379
appeal so that 50/50 phenotype is per

545
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:06,389
if you were growing for commercial

546
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,270
production all right another thing I

547
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:11,280
should mention about the orange gasm is

548
00:20:08,269 --> 00:20:13,230
temperature many growers like to lower

549
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:16,139
the temperature of their flowering room

550
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:20,099
lay in flower to bring out the colors of

551
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:23,759
their flowers this is not necessary with

552
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:26,219
orange gasm I have not seen any benefits

553
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:28,619
to reducing the temperatures of the grow

554
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,500
room late in flower when growing orange

555
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:33,539
gasm orange gasm seems to prefer higher

556
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,549
temperatures and I have not seen any

557
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:37,950
advantage to reducing the temperature

558
00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:39,809
late in flower I have not seen any

559
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,180
improved color I haven't seen any

560
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:43,710
speed-up in flowering time I really

561
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,390
think that it is best just to leave the

562
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:47,880
room just like it is and continue

563
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,470
flowering until the end with orange gasm

564
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:51,360
don't make it cooler don't reduce the

565
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:53,279
lights don't do any tricks just keep it

566
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,500
just like it is it tends to like it

567
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:57,000
fairly warm so keep it warm all the way

568
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,829
through flower don't worry about

569
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,539
reducing the temps don't try to get it

570
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:02,879
cold late in the cycle that is not

571
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:04,859
necessary now that may be really

572
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,680
advantageous for people who are growing

573
00:21:04,859 --> 00:21:09,629
large facilities or running perpetual

574
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,009
cycles sometimes you might want to

575
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,990
reduce the temperature in your grow room

576
00:21:11,009 --> 00:21:15,000
so that you can get that one strain to

577
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:16,319
finish earlier sometimes reducing the

578
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,150
temperature late and flower will bring

579
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,099
out some great colors sometimes it makes

580
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,350
the plants dance up a little bit I have

581
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,929
noticed that that does not work for the

582
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:27,000
orange gasm she likes it warm all the

583
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,029
way through all right so I think that

584
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,740
covers all of the grow details of orange

585
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:34,440
gasm let's talk a little bit about

586
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,660
smoking orange gasm orange gasm is a

587
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,759
delight to smoke of course because those

588
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,250
tremendous orange and tangerine and

589
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,680
sweet candied orange flavors but what I

590
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:46,049
really like about it is the really good

591
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,970
mood and great vibe that I get from

592
00:21:46,049 --> 00:21:49,740
smoking orange gasm it doesn't

593
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:51,809
completely obliterate my brain to where

594
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:53,609
I can't think and can't focus but it

595
00:21:51,809 --> 00:21:55,529
does put me in a really good mood it

596
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:56,819
just puts a smile on your face if you're

597
00:21:55,529 --> 00:21:58,950
having a rough morning if you've had a

598
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:01,559
shitty day smoke a little orange gasm

599
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,350
you will be smiling I call it the Oh

600
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,639
face you'll smoke a little and you go oh

601
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:07,379
you just blow out your smoke your mouth

602
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,300
tastes like oranges and your stress goes

603
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,900
away your shoulders relax you feel

604
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:11,490
better

605
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,560
another thing that I have noticed is

606
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:16,470
that it works great for people with

607
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:18,259
anxiety if you are experiencing anxiety

608
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:21,058
or if you want to keep the anxiety away

609
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:22,679
smoking the orange gasm will chill you

610
00:22:21,058 --> 00:22:24,450
the [ __ ] out it let's see in a good mood

611
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:25,470
it makes you forget that you are anxious

612
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,120
it makes you forget that you were

613
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,710
worried about something and it just puts

614
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,729
a little pep in your step and puts you

615
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,769
in a good vibe

616
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,599
I really think orange gasm would make

617
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:35,038
great morning medicine if you're a

618
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,569
person who likes to medicate in the

619
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:37,980
morning but you still want to be able to

620
00:22:36,569 --> 00:22:39,599
function you don't want your brain to

621
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:41,220
get too blown away you don't want to get

622
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,779
too lazy but you want to put a little

623
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,058
pep in your step and lively if the vibe

624
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:47,428
that is where orange gasm fits in

625
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:49,048
