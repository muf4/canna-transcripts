and clear my throat excuse me for one

112
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,039
moment while the music plays

113
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,480
you deserve better than that from me i'm

114
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,239
gonna blame the uh the raspy throat on a

115
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,238
product here from green dot labs called

116
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,719
the rapture this is a live batter

117
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
from green dot labs um i'm gonna show it

118
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,239
to the camera here it may not focus real

119
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,799
well because the camera is far away

120
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,640
it is a beautiful golden batter anyway

121
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
my throat sounds raspy because i took a

122
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,318
big fat dab of rapture

123
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,239
live batter from green dot labs this is

124
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:48,958
a blend of head banger and han solo

125
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,719
burger

126
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,878
on the package it is described as the

127
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,400
flavor is described as sour diesel and

128
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,919
complex grapes

129
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,719
on the potency label it says 73.08

130
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,559
thc non-detectable amounts of cbd the

131
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,120
reason i'm talking about it is because

132
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
it got me lit and my voice is all funky

133
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
from it but

134
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,359
this concentrate is delicious um it

135
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,158
tastes like

136
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,720
grape bubble gum and gas and then it's

137
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:15,759
got

138
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,000
after notes of like real floral flowers

139
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,120
and that complex grape thing is a good

140
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,798
description it's

141
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,918
got that grape bubble gum you know when

142
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,679
you put grape gum in your mouth it's

143
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,039
like oh that's definitely grape gum

144
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,959
but then after you would if you gave it

145
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,759
a couple chews it would turn into fuel

146
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:31,439
and then berries and some sort of ah

147
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
like wildflowers or something

148
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,360
a little bit of lilacs but i'm not a fan

149
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,160
of lilacs but i like this flavor but it

150
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,759
reminds me

151
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,199
of the good part of lilacs let me get

152
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,479
off on a ramble here the reason i don't

153
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,800
like lilacs

154
00:04:40,478 --> 00:04:44,319
and lavender as well when i smell it i

155
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,478
can feel it in my nose maybe that's

156
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,079
another one of those synesthesia kind of

157
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:49,839
things i've got going on maybe it's just

158
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,758
straight up crazy

159
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,279
but anyway when i smell lilacs and

160
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,360
lavender i feel it in my nose

161
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,279
this has that aroma the wildflowers

162
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,960
lilacs lavenders honeysuckles

163
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,959
but it doesn't bother my nose i find it

164
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:02,638
to be pleasant obviously

165
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,560
got me highest giraffe [ __ ] nice and

166

um what that meat leads me to say is

201
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,800
let's get prepared

202
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,719
for the warmer growing season indoor

203
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,160
grow season is about to change

204
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,000
a lot of people have to get different

205
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,080
gear for the indoors as the

206
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,720
they do the outdoors i'm in colorado so

207
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,599
outdoors it got negative 17 degrees here

208
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,720
in the winter

209
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,840
in the summer it's going to get 104

210
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,360
106ish degrees here

211
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,519
not consistently but it will hit that

212
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,080
i've got to be prepared for those days

213
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,318
so i've got to adjust my grow i turn

214
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,839
blowers around i uninstall and reinstall

215
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,560
an air conditioner at certain times of

216
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,560
the year

217
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,759
i use one blower i use different gear at

218
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,560
different times of the year so what i'm

219
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,479
getting at is

220
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,319
it's time for you for us for the

221
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:32,959
community for the ganja growers growing

222
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,120
indoors

223
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,799
to start getting our equipment in line

224
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,720
because the time is coming soon

225
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
we're going to need an air conditioner

226
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,759
in the grow space

227
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,478
we're going to need a dehumidifier

228
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,560
possibly we may need more fans

229
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:48,478
we're going to need something to battle

230
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,439
that warm summer sun especially here in

231
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:51,680
colorado

232
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:52,719
maybe you're in arizona maybe you're in

233
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,639
some place you don't get a lot of

234
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,479
drastic swings but a lot of us are gonna

235
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,918
have to think about this right now so

236
00:06:56,478 --> 00:06:59,758
pull out the air conditioner do you have

237
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,959
a window unit let's make sure you've got

238
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,400
all the stuff to put that air

239
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:04,318
conditioner in the window

240
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,918
to [ __ ] seal it support it get it in

241
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,240
there safely and securely

242
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,000
also have you cleaned it let's clean

243
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,519
that thing out it may be moldy it may be

244
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,879
funky let's take it apart

245
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,560
if you know what you're doing not

246
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,000
everybody is reliable at pulling apart

247
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,280
an air conditioner but you can clean

248
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,279
the main part of it if you take off the

249
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,638
back cover front cover clean that bad

250
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:22,559
[ __ ] up get all the grime and

251
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,478
gunk out of there then let's think about

252
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,879
the dehumidifier

253
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,240
that thing gets dirty if you lift up i'm

254
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,000
not sure what type of dehumidifier

255
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,519
you've got if you lift up the tank and

256
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
uh underneath it there's a little thing

257
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,879
that it's probably really dirty

258
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,840
somewhere in that dehumidifier or your

259
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:38,478
humidifier

260
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,000
there is some nasty mold funky just

261
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:41,120
disgustingness building up that you

262
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,879
haven't discovered yet

263
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,800
take it apart clean the [ __ ] out of it

264
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,120
disinfect it and sanitize it

265
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,800
let's set ourselves up for success for

266
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,720
the upcoming grow season

267
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,639

270
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
don't overload your weapons they'll jam

271
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,120
but

272
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:01,120
let's get in there prepared and ready to

273
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,879

274
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,360
let's win that's how we win we prepare

275
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,520
now

276
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,038
set ourselves up for success so we got

277
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:08,959
the air conditioner cleaned up we've got

278
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,800
the dehumidifier cleaned up

279
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,719
also are you going to switch from hps

280
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
lights to leds that may be something i

281
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,919
do now

282
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:17,359
in the winter i may rely on those hps

283
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,198
lights to keep my grow room safe i

284
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,560
[ __ ] up and switched eight to leds in

285
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,800
the winter

286
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,079
my girl was mad at me i learned a lot i

287
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
learned a lot i [ __ ] up i made a

288
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,478
mistake

289
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,919
it was a bad idea now the plants look

290
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,359
great now that it's not [ __ ] ass

291
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,038
cheeks cold outside now that it's not

292
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,120
negative 17 degrees and i can keep the

293
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,799
room nice the plants look really good

294
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
but it was a bad idea to put the leds in

295
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,478
there in the winter i should have kept

296
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,240
the

297
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
uh the hps lights up for the winter put

298
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,918
the leds in the summer that is my new

299
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,680
routine that's what i will do

300
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,838
so what are you gonna have to switch get

301
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,519
it prepared i'm gonna get back on track

302
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,440
fans fans is where i was headed with

303
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,720
this clean the

304
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,800
fans are you gonna have to hang up a

305
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,360
bunch of fans if you need to put up new

306
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,519
fans

307
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
clean them take the the little shroud

308
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,080
thing off the piece to make sure your

309
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,120
dreadlocks don't get caught in there

310
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,720
take that off

311
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,159
uh clean that it's probably got a bunch

312
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,000
of grime and dust on it

313
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,519
clean the fan blade take the fan blades

314
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,958
off and scrub it with the brush and

315
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,278
clean both sides of it get

316
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,799
it clean just a little bit of dust and

317
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:13,679
debris stuck on that thing

318
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:15,120
will really uh lessen the efficiency of

319
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,079
that fan you're still paying for the

320
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,440
electricity

321
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,200
you are not getting the efficiency

322
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,200
you're wasting money right there your

323
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,399
grams per watt your grams per dollar are

324
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,000
going down

325
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,519
rapidly so let's clean the fan while

326
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,519
you've got the fan blades off

327
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,360
clean that back shroud and then also

328
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,159
take a rag or a paper towel and clean

329
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,600
the rest of it

330
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,278
you can see where all the muck and the

331
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
grime is don't be [ __ ] lazy don't

332

414
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,360
i went to the store today to get soil

415
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,200
you guys and i had to buy some random

416
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,039
off-brand soil because they didn't have

417
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,839
anything familiar today at the grow

418
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:06,078
store at two different locations

419
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,839
they did not have any brand that i've

420
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,278
ever heard of i bought some new [ __ ]

421
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,639
uh it's still in the car gotta wait for

422
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:11,838
the sun to go down and bring it in when

423
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,959
the neighbors aren't looking but you

424
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,480
know how it goes

425
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,719
i'll tell you how it goes once i try it

426
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,159

427
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,600
[ __ ] shit's unlimited supply it's

428
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,039
getting weird let me get back on track

429
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,720
i'm high as draft [ __ ] and we're

430
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:24,078
we're rambling outdoor season you guys

431
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,200
it's time to get prepared

432
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,799
um i see on social media i troll social

433
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,320
media quite a bit it's fun to do

434
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,838
i'm just hanging out or pooping or

435
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,040
whatever i'm scrolling on social media

436
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,160
seeing what's going on

437
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:39,278
and i see people looking for uh

438
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:40,719
two and three packs of feminized seeds

439
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,240
they're asking me what they're asking

440
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,519
for is a variety pack

441
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
they're like hey i see that you sell a

442
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,078
six pack of femme seeds but what i would

443
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,839
like is

444
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,120
two of this strain two of this strain

445
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,920
and two of this strain

446
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,120
and i don't do that it would be a very

447
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:55,519
uh it'd be a very

448
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
novel and wise financial investment but

449
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,560
there's a couple of reasons why i don't

450
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,838
do that let me explain the first one as

451
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:02,319
a business person

452
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,240
as a seed seller uh somebody who works

453
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,160
with seed vendors let me tell you why

454
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
honestly if i sell you two seeds and one

455
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,759
of them doesn't germinate you've got a

456
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,399
50 50 germination rate and i look like

457
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,879
[ __ ]

458
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,720
that's a bad that's just not setting

459
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,360
myself up for success as a business

460
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,120
person

461
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,879
you may have a bad experience i could

462
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
have a bad reputation

463
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:22,159
that's just not a wise move we need

464
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,159
better numbers in the package to give

465
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,439
better options some growers are just

466
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:27,039
killing seeds out there they're new they

467
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
don't know what they're doing

468
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:30,078
so i don't want you to kill one or two

469
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,359
seeds and only buy two

470
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:33,439
and then you're [ __ ] out of luck and you

471
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,000
blame me or i just that doesn't sound

472
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,000
wise

473
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,278
so then if you kill one you got a 50 50

474
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,958
germination rate and i still look like

475
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:39,838
an [ __ ] so now let me talk about the

476
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,078
real reason

477
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,440
uh for consumers and the consumer end

478
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:45,039
why i don't like to sell

479
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,120
two of this and two of this and two of

480
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,198
this um

481
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,879
not all two seeds are going to be

482
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:52,319
exactly the same there's going to be

483
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,958
variation

484
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,639
and the variation will be minimal in a

485
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,799
pack of feminized seeds but it does

486
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,480
exist and it's not deniable

487
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:04,879
so i recommend getting six of one strain

488
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,839
and growing all six of them and finding

489
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,360
the keeper

490
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:11,279
that is the best for your garden um

491
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,199
it's like if you only had if there's

492
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,720
only one girl in town to choose from

493
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,319
you're gonna date her and have a family

494
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,839
and be satisfied but if there are six

495
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,680
women in town

496
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,680
one of them may be the one that you

497
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:23,039
really wanted to fall in love with

498
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:24,799
and you wouldn't even notice the other

499
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,399
one if there's only one that may be a

500
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,919
horrible analogy to put it that way and

501
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,278
i went horrible i'm gonna try to accent

502
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,278
that in the video too

503
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,720
but if you've got more to select from

504
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,799
you can find something

505
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,720
that is better for you for your grow

506
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,078
environment for your grow space

507
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,000
for your medical needs for your

508
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,759
recreational needs maybe your financial

509
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,759
needs however you're doing it

510
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:46,319
if you've got more to search from of one

511
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,480
kind you may find something better

512
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
so it's cool that you want two of this

513
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,680
two of this two of this

514
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:55,278
but um grow six seeds of one kind find

515
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,039
the winner out of that

516
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:58,720
then buy another six pack of something

517
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,799
else and grow the six of those

518
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,320
and find the winner out of that find a

519
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,759
get something with strawberry flavors

520
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,040
and find the strawberry you're looking

521
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,799
for then get one with

522
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,120
orange flavors and find the orange

523
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,479
you're looking for and just focus on one

524
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,039
at a time would be

525
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,240
as a professional grower that's i don't

526
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:15,679
think i've ever said that but i'm a

527
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,799
professional grower as a very

528
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:18,638
experienced grower

529
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,240
that's what i would recommend find that

530
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,680
one six-pack grow those

531
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,959
and i understand you want variety you

532
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:24,799
need to get it going but don't be in

533
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,799
such a rush take your time

534
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:28,399
ah take your time and find that one

535
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,240
keeper find that beautiful

536
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,679
[ __ ] star out of the pack and then do

537
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,198
it again and that way you know what

538
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,638
you're looking for you know that

539
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,159
because we're always as a seed breeder

540
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,039
as somebody who likes to grow from seed

541
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:38,639
we're always thinking

542
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,159
it's like a pack of baseball cards does

543
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,360
that pack of baseball cards have that

544
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,559
mickey mantle in there

545
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
and you never know if you find that

546
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,559
mickey mantle rookie card until you plan

547
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,320
it grow it flower it out so

548
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:50,000
uh finish the six pack and start a new

549
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,079
one that's why i don't sell

550
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,078
two of this two of this two of this so

551
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,919
get a six pack maybe a five pack of reg

552
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,479
seeds maybe a ten pack of reg seeds

553
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,599
and actually do a fino hunt there will

554
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,839
be variation

555
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,759
uh you get to do your selection and that

556
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,959
way you can see the phenotypical

557
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,560
variation and know

558
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:08,159
what you're actually looking for it

559
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:09,039
makes it just it's more fun you get to

560
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,799
dial it in

561
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,159
you get to have what you want it's like

562
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,519
what if i just said hey your dinner's

563
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,360
coming you're like what do i get

564
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,039
i don't know whatever shows up and or if

565
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,919
i was like hey you get to choose from

566
00:16:17,039 --> 00:16:21,599
italian food mexican food chinese food

567
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,000
thai food indian food you get to take a

568
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,278
pic

569
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,958
you're going to be much happier with

570
00:16:23,278 --> 00:16:27,039
those kind of options instead of just

571
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:28,879
whatever rosta jeff sent you because

572
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,159
i'm [ __ ] mostly vegan and a lot of

573
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,198
people are already are going [ __ ] i

574
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:33,679
don't want to eat his meal

575
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,039
so anyway give yourself options where am

576
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,559
i going from here

577
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:39,679
also we shouldn't be running untested

578
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,879
stuff outdoors

579
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,958
anyway people are buying feminized seeds

580
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,559
so that they can put two of this outside

581
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,599
two of this outside and two of this

582
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:49,198
outside

583
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,040
in hopes for a successful harvest

584
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,319
outdoors that is cool i like that you're

585
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,719
going to grow some wheat outside you're

586
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:58,079
going to grow some femme seeds outdoors

587
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,000
but um you should audition these plants

588
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,000
before you put them outdoors in big pots

589
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,078
and hope for your summer crop

590
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,919
on a big old plant when you don't even

591
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:06,639
really know what you've got you could

592
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,480
have

593
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,160
maybe it's not the phenotype you want if

594
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,759
you're growing from regular seed maybe

595
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,400
it's a male i've done a full episode

596
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:14,000
about

597
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,360
not sexing your plants before you put

598
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,160
them outside and then growing a three

599
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,558
foot tall

600
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:20,079
or three foot wide six foot tall male

601
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:21,279
plant that you gotta cut down as soon as

602
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:22,720
you realize it's a boy

603
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:24,639
hopefully you realize it's a boy before

604
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,000
you pollinated everybody's crop within

605
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,000
[ __ ] five miles

606
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,240
so you shouldn't be running untested

607
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,119
stuff outdoors in my opinion

608
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,640
the stuff should be tested indoors

609
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,479
verified a female

610
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
verified for the traits you're looking

611
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,839
for verified it's not problematic

612
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,759
then run it outside and if you insist on

613
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,240
running a seed outdoors that has not

614
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:49,279
been tested tried true and verified

615
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,519
run a feminized seed from a reputable

616
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:53,599
and reliable breeder i'm not trying to

617
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,519
say just buy seeds from ire genetics but

618
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,279
that's what i would recommend and prefer

619
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,720
that is my brand of course i'm gonna

620
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,519
boost my brand but

621
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,319
get feminized seeds from a reliable

622
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:03,759
breeder

623
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,319
there are a lot of places to do it i

624
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,319
recommend seeds herenow.com of course

625
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,240
but if you're going to grow outdoors

626
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,678
please use that femme seed but i totally

627
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
think you should be auditioning these

628
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,559
plants

629
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,519
before you put them outside they should

630
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:17,119
at least be sex

631
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,279
tested you should at least know you got

632
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,038
a good phenotype before you even think

633
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:23,038
about putting it outside we're skipping

634
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:24,160
the selection steps and i get it a lot

635
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:25,759
of people want to throw something

636
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,160
outside and make some weed

637
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:29,839
but not only are you potentially wasted

638
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,200
potentially there comes that weird

639
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:32,399
version of that word again if you listen

640
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,840
to a lot of episodes you've heard me say

641
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,440
potentially

642
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,439
i don't know where it came from i know

643
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,160
the word is potentially anyway

644
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,240
uh you're not only potentially messing

645
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
up your own garden by planting

646
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,240
possibly males but you can mess up all

647
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,798
of the gardens for several miles around

648
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,880
you

649
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:50,319
downwind there could be another garden

650
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,840
that pollen hits that

651
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,678
travels over there to that guy's plants

652
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,558
to my plants my plants outside are now

653
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,080
pollinated

654
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:57,519
what if a bird the bees you guys know

655
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,839
about the birds and the bees landing on

656
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:01,119
plants and pollinating right

657
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:02,798
stop that [ __ ] don't make that [ __ ]

658
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,159
happen prevent that so audition your

659
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:05,759
plants before you put them outside i did

660
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,798
say i was going to focus

661
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,319

665
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,400

666
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,480
of this podcast this part of the show is

667
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,559

big up to my buddy kurt z trying to give

669
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,918
some sneaky patreon shout outs in there

670
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,720
so i can get more patreon shout outs off

671
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:28,799
the list

672
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,640

689
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,919
highest giraffe [ __ ] let's stay focused

690
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,678
and answer these questions shout out to

691
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,080
my buddy kurt z

692
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,038
this question came from patreon and it

693
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,079
comes from

694
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:06,798
dz from detroit and this question goes

695
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:08,558
a lot like this it says yo ross to jeff

696
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,599
i'm running 18 and six

697
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,839
and my off hours are midnight to 6 a.m

698
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:16,000
so what he means is the lights are on uh

699
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:19,759
18 on and six hours off

700
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,960
ah they are off from midnight to 6 a.m

701
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:22,798
which is reasonable

702
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,240
ah that's most people sleeping hours

703
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:25,918
that makes a lot of sense

704
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
and now it says i want to change it so

705
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,720
my off hours are now 3 p.m

706
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,320
to 9 00 p.m so some people have changes

707
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,400
in plans changes in life

708
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,079
now it's time to change the light

709
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,120
schedule it says how do i go about doing

710
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:39,359
this the plants

711
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,479
are three to four inches tall can i just

712
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,038
make the switch

713
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,798
and everything be all right now since

714
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,000
these plants are little tiny itty-bitty

715
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,480
baby plants and they're just in the

716
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,679
vegetative stage they're not in flower

717
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,960
they're not root bound because they're

718
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,679
little they're not stressed out because

719
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:55,919
they're little i'm going to assume

720
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,038
at this point i would say just go ahead

721
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,400
and switch the lights they're not going

722
00:20:57,038 --> 00:20:59,359
to harm these plants at this stage of

723
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
their life

724
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,479
you're not going to cause them any

725
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,839
problems at this stage

726
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,759
they're three to four inches tall

727
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,279
they're brand new once they get older

728
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:07,599
you may want to be more gentle about

729
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:09,119
this

730
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,038
and flower you would definitely do it

731
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,319
differently um

732
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:13,839
let's talk about how i would do this in

733
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,319
flower i've done a full episode about

734
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,678
this

735
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,599
somebody asked a similar question but

736
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,080
let me just recap

737
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,199
in flower the plants need at least that

738
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,279
12 hour on an

739
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,480
uninterrupted dark cycle so if you

740
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,798
choose to change

741
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,480
the timer in flower what you would have

742
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,440
to do is unplug the timer

743
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:33,120
let the 12 night cycle run through then

744
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,240
at the new time that you want those

745
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:35,599
lights to come on

746
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,519
that's when you would plug it on but

747
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,959
after the full 12 hour

748
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,639
went through so then you'd have to wait

749
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,000
like another if you wanted to come on

750
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,759
six hours difference you'd have to wait

751
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,319
that next six hours or however many

752
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,839
hours

753
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:48,240
then just plug it on but as long as you

754
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,240
gave it the full 12 hour sleep

755
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,839
then go back on you'd be okay but make

756
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,919
sure it gets 12 hours

757
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,000
sometimes you got to go like 24 hours to

758
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,600
get it back on cycle 36 hours

759
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,079
until you catch the next time which you

760
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,959
want to actually start your new 12-12

761
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:04,798
but it's better to give it long extended

762
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,960
dark than it is to interrupt

763
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:08,038
the dark is what i'm trying to say uh we

764
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,240
don't like being

765
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:11,599
uninterrupted in our sleep but we're

766
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,359
okay to take a nap right

767
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,279
sometimes you take too many dabs maybe

768
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:16,719
it's 4 20 you dabbed all day

769
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:18,000
trying to do some videos and you end up

770
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,038
just sleeping on the couch that's

771
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,720
acceptable but

772
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,839
don't wake me up i'm gonna be mad about

773
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,759
that if you wake me up in the middle of

774
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,038
the night so naps are cool

775
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,798
but waking me up in the middle of the

776
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:28,558
night is not cool in flower that's a

777
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:30,480
great way to remember that so

778
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:32,319
um yes you could just go for it my

779
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,120
answer was in veg you can play with the

780
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,200
schedule

781
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:36,319
so just go for it that is the short

782
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,000
version of that answer i should have

783
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:39,759
just stuck with that here on the show

784
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,960
but i hope i answered your question my

785
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,400
friend if anybody else out there is

786
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,519
thinking about changing the light cycle

787
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,919
while you're in veg

788
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:46,558
and veg you're completely safe in flower

789
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,320
however

790
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,319
you do have to wait that full 12 hour

791
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:53,200
sleep cycle then get it

792
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:54,158
back on the rhythm all right this next

793
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,679
question

794
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,520
comes from richo relaxo and it said you

795
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,880
can say my name my name is

796
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:03,839
richo relaxo my question is i'm going

797
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,080
from the veg

798
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,599
to flower transition so he's in a

799
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,000
vegetative stage he's looking to switch

800
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,918
the lights

801
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,159
to flower is it recommended to induce

802
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,759
uh introduce veg from a 24 hour light

803
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,000
schedule which i'm currently on

804
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,640
to a semi-veg dark schedule before i

805
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,558
switch to a full-on flower schedule

806
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,159
and my short answer to our friend was i

807
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:24,960
would just switch those [ __ ] to

808
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,960
flower

809
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,200
so your plants have never seen dark

810
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
they've been on 24 hours of light

811
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,558
since their birth basically since

812
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:34,079
they've been cut as a clone

813
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:35,839
they've never seen dark they don't know

814
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,599
what dark is

815
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:39,519
it's not going to take a lot of darkness

816
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,199
for them to go oh yeah and they're going

817
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,480
to trigger into flowers super quickly

818
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,600
these plants are going to transition

819
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,839
into flower

820
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,519
really quickly sometimes it takes 12 14

821
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,278
days to see the plant switch

822
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:50,960
i bet you these are ready and they're

823
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,319
gonna start switching in like 10 days

824
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,159
you'll start seeing female

825
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:55,759
or at least uh if they're female plants

826
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,320
they'll start seeing pre-flower male or

827
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:58,400
female

828
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,079
whatever sex they are quite quickly

829
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,519
because they've never gotten any dark

830
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,798
and they're eager for it

831
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:07,359
so yeah i would just switch them from 24

832
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,798
um right over to that 12 12 and you will

833
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:11,359
see them transition

834
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,119
quite quickly some people do that 24

835
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:14,798
hour dark period if you want to do that

836
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:16,079
which might be your follow-up question

837
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,400
if you hear this

838
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,199
that's acceptable as well go from 24

839
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,440
hours on

840
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,480
give it a 24 hour dark period then hit

841
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,200
that 12 12.

842
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,880
they will go shebang kapow into flower

843
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,400
super quickly because of that

844
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,840
especially if they're big if they're

845
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,278
starting to show pre-flower now if

846
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:32,480
they're at all root bound they're going

847
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,839
to go into flower

848
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,200
super fast because of that yes um

849
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,038
you didn't ask this but i'm just going

850
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,519
to interject this here because i feel

851
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,319
like it's

852
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:45,119
uh it's what people rely on me for you

853
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,278
are on a 24 hour and zero

854
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:48,879
sleep schedule they're on for 24 hours

855
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,640
your plants are not sleeping

856
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,039
i highly recommend a little bit of a

857
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,278
sleep schedule every living thing

858
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,158
wants a little bit of a sleep schedule i

859
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:58,240
would give it just

860
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440
four hours if you really don't want to

861
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,960
you don't have to and if

862
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,400
if those plants are in there with clones

863
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,200
or something else i get it but i would

864
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,120
recommend

865
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,558
four to five hours of sleep everything

866
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,158
will do better with sleep a lot of the

867
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:09,839
microbial processes

868
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,200
a lot of the root zone processes will

869
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,359
happen in the dark time

870
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,880
you'll see better shaped better growth

871
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,240
healthier happier plants

872
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,760
if you just give them a little time to

873
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,359
take a nap everything in nature is

874
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,599
better with a little bit of sleep

875
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,199
then my back up to that question is all

876
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:24,798
of your equipment would benefit from a

877
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,798
couple of hours of rest

878
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,798
imagine not running that light for four

879
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,000
or five hours a day every day however

880
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,440
many lights you're running

881
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,119
you could save some electricity when

882
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,240
that light's not running you don't need

883
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,000
the ac when the

884
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,759
light's not running you might need might

885
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,038
not need that other fan when the light's

886
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:39,919
not running you might not need that

887
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:41,359
exhaust

888
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,278
you might be able to turn off a whole

889
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:45,759
bunch of [ __ ] for like four hours

890
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:47,599
and save a whole bunch of money so just

891
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:49,359
an idea just a recommendation

892
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:51,759
just a thing that i would do if it were

893
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:53,839
my grow all of my commercial grows get

894
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:54,720
four or five hours of sleep time in the

895
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:56,879
bedroom

896
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,919
even in the mother area a lot of times

897
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,360
the moms and the

898
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,278
veg plants are in the same room that's

899
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,798
why i keep them on the 20 and four

900
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,558
so that none of those moms will try to

901
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:05,599
flower on me early try to keep those

902
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:06,879
genetics around

903
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,038
they get tricky if you give them too

904
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,640
much sleep time but four hours is enough

905
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:12,319
let's them takes them like two hours to

906
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,400
fall asleep anyway in an indoor

907
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,079
environment without the far red so

908
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,600
give them some sleepy time i think your

909
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,278
equipment will benefit from it

910
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,359
i think your plants will enjoy it the

911
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,798
root zone will enjoy it uh your wallet

912
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:25,199
will probably enjoy it

913
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:26,240
but with that being said it's your girl

914
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,480
my friend you do

915
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,640
