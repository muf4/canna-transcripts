you all right so on the 5th of July I'm

64
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:22,120
going to brag a little bit I got to see

65
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,000
who else who would you guess right you

66
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,000
know me I got to see Mr Doug Benson at

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,598
Comedy Works in Denver Doug was in town

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,280
he did another stand-up comedy show and

69
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:33,159
I got to tell you he really redeemed

70
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,280
himself from the last show that I saw if

71
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:37,878
you listen to this podcast regularly you

72
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,039
know that I kind of bashed Doug Benson's

73
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:42,000
last performance at Comedy Works uh and

74
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:43,959
I also kind of bashed his

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,439
album uh he did a much better

76
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,360
performance this time he had a little

77
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,439
bit of a cough which may have worked to

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,760
our advantage Doug wasn't smoking as

79
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,800
heavily because he was a little bit

80
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,919
under the weather and I think it led to

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,000
him having a better

82
00:02:54,919 --> 00:03:00,479
performance um Doug did make a comment

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,959
uh actually Doug walked out on stage and

84
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,518
the first thing Doug said was hey you

85
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,920
know it's a Doug Benson show because

86
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,120
rosted Jeff is here and of course I was

87
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,479
sitting right in the front row I've got

88
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,439
those two VIP seats always so that was

89
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,000
kind of neat but then he uh started

90
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:16,120
talking a little bit and he pulled out a

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
handful of notes and he said well I got

92
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,920
my jokes ha on my pocket and he looked

93
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,759
me straight in the face and he said Ross

94
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:24,359
de Jeff knows what I'm talking about uh

95
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:26,598
if you guys listen to this podcast I

96
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,280
called Doug out on his pocket full of

97
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:32,759
disheveled notes on another episode I am

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,080
wondering if Doug listens to the podcast

99
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:36,239
I'm not sure but Doug if you're

100
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920

101
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,280
great time I hope you're getting over

102
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:41,719
that cough and I've been watching your

103
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
Periscope videos and they're great uh

104
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:46,239

105
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,840

111
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:02,039
lot of fun he's a cannabis connoisseur

112
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,280
like myself so we have a lot of things

113
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,039
to talk about and we may uh hint at a

114
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,519
future collaboration between the two of

115
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,959
us we'll talk too much about it but

116
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,599
there may be some stuff being talked

117
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,039
about he does live in California I live

118
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,479
in Colorado there are a lot of things to

119
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:17,358
deal with there but we are going to try

120
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:20,039
and do some [ __ ]

121
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,758
together um I got to say Ando crushed

122
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:25,600
Ando uh did probably uh 20 minutes maybe

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,479
30 it seemed like he uh he went on for a

124
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,039
long time but he definitely tore it up

125
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:30,399
had to be 15 or 20 minutes cuz I'm sure

126
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:33,000
he didn't do more than more than that

127
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,679
being an opening act but he was on fire

128
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,360
he made me laugh my ass off uh Doug

129
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,800
Benson was equally hilarious but I've

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,720
seen Doug so many times that when he

131
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,199
starts uh into a Vibe I know which jokes

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,400
are coming out of this clump of uh like

133
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,919
this part of the show is going to be

134
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,959
this clump of jokes and then the vibe

135
00:04:48,918 --> 00:04:51,439
will change because he's very

136
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:53,478
interactive with the crowd he does a lot

137
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,519
of crowd work but I know all of Doug's

138
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:58,279
jokes so it's a little predictable for

139
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,120
me I go for the fun uh I go for the

140
00:04:58,279 --> 00:05:01,918
smoke session before and after of course

141
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,639
cuz that's always a good time so enough

142
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,439
bragging about my weekend at Comedy

143

00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,399
Ana California the manager of that

169
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:01,560
dispensary was in a wheelchair and she

170
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:03,359
was blind and she has an amputated leg

171

coverage and uh recently it was

173

electric wheelchair was kind of falling

175
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,120
apart and it was held together mainly by

176
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,119
duct

177
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,639

179
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:22,759

gangsters and the Cannabis industry is

189

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,960
the screen I've got to decide which one

204
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:15,359
I want to read first um they're both

205

206
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,759
here this one I was just browsing

207
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,080
through news sites and I came across

208
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,840
this and I thought that the world would

209
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:25,240
like to hear about this the headline

210
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:29,318
says do medical marijuana users have

211
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,960
right to bear arms no says the ATF and

212
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:32,800
then it says there are no exceptions in

213
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,560
federal law for marijuana purportedly

214
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,240
used for medicinal purposes ATF official

215
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,598
says this article is by Matt volt and

216
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,038
it's from the Associated Press and it

217
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:45,399
goes like this it's from Helen

218
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:46,918
Montana it says firearms dealers and

219
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:48,478
states that allow medical marijuana

220
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,959
can't sell guns or ammunition to

221
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:53,519
registered users of the drug a policy

222
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,279
that marijuana and gun rights groups say

223
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,000
deny second amendment rights to

224
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,598
individuals who are following state law

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,478
federal law already makes it illegal for

226
00:07:59,598 --> 00:08:04,120
someone to possess a gun if he or she is

227
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:07,199
an unlawful user of or addicted to

228
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,158
marijuana or other Controlled Substances

229
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,120
a September 21st letter from the Bureau

230
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:13,560
of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and

231
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,639
explosives issued in response to

232
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,199
numerous inquiries from gun dealers

233
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:20,478
clarifies that medical marijuana

234
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,080
patients are included in that definition

235
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:24,560
there are no exceptions in federal law

236
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,000
for marijuana purported purportedly used

237
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,000
for medicinal purposes even if such use

238
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,879
is sanctioned by state law said the

239
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,440
letter by Arthur Herbert the atf's

240
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,399
assistant director for enforcement

241
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,880
programs and services federal firearms

242
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,320
lies or ffls can't sell a gun to someone

243
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,679
who answers yes when a requested forms

244
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,120
asked whether the buyer is a controlled

245
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,239
substance

246
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,799
user so that's kind of a tricky that's

247
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,039
that's [ __ ] right there all right

248
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,958
I'm going to keep reading on uh

249
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,719
reasonable cause to believe this week's

250
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,439
letter also says that licensed dealers

251
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
can't sell a gun or ammunition if they

252
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,600
have reasonable cause to believe the

253
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,319
buyer is using a control substance that

254
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,480
includes if the buyer presents a medical

255
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,640
marijuana card as identification or if

256
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,600
the buyer talks about drug use having a

257
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:11,240
medical marijuana card or a recent drug

258
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:14,079
conviction ATF spokesman uh Drew Wade

259
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,799
said Wednesday but there are no new

260
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,958
obligations for gun dealers outlined in

261
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,599
the letter Wade said we received lots of

262
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,039
queries from the industry from various

263
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,399
states of how to deal with the state

264
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,838
legislation and federal law he said is

265
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,278
our responsibility to provide guidance

266
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,160
uh advice and guidance the clash between

267
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:32,039
state and federal laws has led to

268
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,958
lawsuits and criminal cases in some of

269
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:36,480
the 16 states that have legalized

270
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,919
medical marijuana use officials in two

271
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,920
Oregon counties have said they'll appeal

272
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,559
the US Supreme Court after state judges

273
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:43,559
said sheriffs couldn't deny concealed

274
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:45,838
handgun licenses for medical marijuana

275
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:47,479
patients the Oregon court of appeals and

276
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,959
the Oregon Supreme Court said the state

277
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,600
law authorizes concealed handgun permits

278
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:54,278
in separate from the federal law that

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,159
Outlaws gun possession by drug users and

280
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:58,958
the state gun law doesn't address

281
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,120
medical marijuana L raid use sorry I'm

282
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:03,278
reading ahead of myself here uh the

283
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,159
Montana raids Federal authorities also

284
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:07,679
raided dozens of medical marijuana

285
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:09,799
operations across Montana this spring

286
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,799
chilling a once booming pot industry and

287
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,120
leading to sweeping changes in Montana

288
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:15,639
laws the department of justed followed

289
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,200
up with a warning letter to political

290
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:19,199
leaders in many states that Federal

291
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,399
prosecutors will pursue marijuana

292
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Distributors but not individual patients

293
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:25,839
who are following state law the letter

294
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,799
the ATF sent to gun dealers last week

295
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,320
was first reported by Lee newspapers of

296
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:32,838
Montana Pro marij an and gun group said

297
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,278
the policy clarification amounts to

298
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:35,839
resending the gun rights for the

299
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,600
thousands of people licensed to use

300
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,639
medical marijuana laws and it appears to

301
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,240
contradict the 2009 Department of

302
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,959
Justice memo that said Obama

303
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,639
administration would not pursue

304
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:48,838
prosecution of individual medical

305
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,639
marijuana users who obey state laws

306
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,240
beside that the government is putting in

307
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,839
additional burden on gun dealers to

308
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,680
police their customers he said Montana

309
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:59,680
uh said Montana Shooting Sports

310
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:01,319
Association Gary Marbut uh their

311
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,679
business is to be merchants not to be

312
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,440
cops unfortunately the federal licensing

313
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,559
scheme complicates that Marbut said uh

314
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:12,079
it sounds as if the ATF is expecting

315
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,319
them to drift further into that cop role

316
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:14,799
yeah could you imagine that you guys now

317
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,399
that if you're a gun sell seller you

318
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:17,759
don't have to just follow that paper you

319
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,120
actually have to like talk to everybody

320
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,078
and try to act like you're the cops also

321
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,078
and then there are going to be a bunch

322
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:25,120
of Vigilantes they're going to see

323
00:11:23,078 --> 00:11:28,120
somebody like I bet if I went into a gun

324
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,799
store they would deny me a sale even if

325
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,799
I never figured out this question filled

326
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:33,078
out this question there they'd say

327
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:36,919
you're a pothead you cannot buy a gun

328
00:11:33,078 --> 00:11:39,439
and that is now up to uh vaguely up to

329
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,319
the store owner or the salesperson which

330
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,959
is kind of ridiculous I'll keep reading

331
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:46,519
the article here uh protecting America

332
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,879
from criminals waade said both the 2009

333
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:49,320
memo and last week's letter were

334
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:50,480
approved by the justice department and

335
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,120
he does not believe there is a

336
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,278
contradiction in the two messages he

337
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:58,159
also uh he also that the dealers are in

338
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,240
good position to help prevent firearms

339
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,439
from getting into the wrong hands uh

340
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,079
they must have omitted a word I'm going

341
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,440
to say he also said that the dealers are

342
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:05,799
in a good position to help prevent

343
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,240
firearms from getting into the wrong

344
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:10,759
hands that makes more sense the ffls

345
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
aren't cops uh they are at the front

346
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:14,120
line of protecting America from

347
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,120
criminals or people who are prohibited

348
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,519
prohibited from possessing firearms Wade

349
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,399
said a Salesman at once licensed fire

350
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:22,759
Firearms dealer Montana Outdoor Sports

351
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,958
and Helena said he doesn't expect much

352
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,838
to change as a result of the letter

353
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,719
because it's largely up to the buyer to

354
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,000
reveal whether he or she is a medical

355
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,120
marijuana a user who's going to say yes

356
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,078
to that ask Damon Peters a sales

357
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,360
associate for the store and a license

358
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:39,159
hunting guide a lot of you a lot of

359
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,240
users of medical marijuana aren't really

360
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:43,120
Shooting Sports enthusiasts anyway I

361
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:45,278
think we may see a sail or two lost but

362
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,759
I don't see anything dramatic that's

363
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,919
going to affect us he

364
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,559
said so there's a lot of talk about guns

365
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:57,120
going on in our country later lately and

366
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:58,399
uh I uh I support guns I mean if they

367
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
took away all the guns the only people

368
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,759
that would have guns would be the bad

369
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
guys right that's kind of the way that

370
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,838
works right if the guns were illegal the

371
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,879
like the criminals aren't going to care

372
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
that the guns are illegal they're not

373
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,360
going to be like oh here's my guns it's

374
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,360
just going to that's [ __ ] of a

375
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,919
theory I think so now what's happening

376
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:17,159
is if you are a medical marijuana

377
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,958
patient you are not allowed to purchase

378
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:22,600
a firearm what kind of [ __ ] is that just

379
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:25,679
because so here here's another side of

380
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,159
this I I can be a vicadin patient I can

381
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:32,958
be a valume patient I can be maybe some

382
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,519
sort of uh anti-depressant user uh

383
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,799
patient whatever you call the person

384
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,360
that's taking

385
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:40,278
that and then I'm able to buy a gun I

386
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,519
can take my vicin in my riddlin my

387
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:43,799
volume my

388
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,440
ambian and what else could I take

389
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,519
possibly to go with this my cell brex

390
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,720
and my vicodan and then a boner pill

391
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,078
because everybody's got to have a boner

392
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,560
pill right uh I could take all of those

393
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:54,919
and then I could go buy a gun but I

394
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,039
can't use my medical cannabis to ease my

395
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:00,360
pain a little bit or help my

396
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:03,078
appetite and then purchase a fire arm to

397
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:04,959
either protect my home or hunt for food

398
00:14:03,078 --> 00:14:07,239
or just have it because I'm a good old

399
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,958
American and I should have a damn gun

400
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,000
this is kind of a ridiculous law I

401
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,479
thought that everybody should be made

402
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,278
aware of this I don't know what we can

403
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
do about it but I I thought it was very

404
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:18,639
interesting how

405
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:20,198
who they are kind of right though about

406
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,919
the people that smoke medical cannabis

407
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:23,359
not wanting to be hunters and Shooters

408
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,759
but this is Colorado and you'd be

409
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,079
surprised the diversity of people here

410
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,759
I've got friends who have dreadlocks who

411
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,399
snowboard on the one weekend and who

412
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,039
will go elk hunting the next weekend uh

413
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,000
they may be wrong with their assumptions

414
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:38,399
on who is hunting and who is using

415
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,759
cannabis that may be [ __ ] there's so

416
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,559
much in this article that we could [ __ ]

417
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,639
about but instead let's move on to a

418
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,039
little bit more of a positive note this

419
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,240
article comes from the Washington Post

420
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:52,278
and it is written by a guy named Radley

421
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,198
Balco and the headline is since

422
00:14:52,278 --> 00:14:56,600
marijuana legalization Highway

423
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:59,599
fatalities in Colorado are at a near

424
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:02,199
historic low yes let me read this

425
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,000
article for you it says since Colorado

426
00:15:02,198 --> 00:15:06,559
voters legalized pot in 2012 prohibition

427
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,240
supporters have warned that recreational

428
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:12,039
marijuana will lead to a scou of drugged

429
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:13,560
drivers on the state's roads they often

430
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:15,599
point out that when the state legalized

431
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:17,958
medical marijuana in 2001 there is a

432
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,040
surge in drivers found to have smoked

433
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:22,278
pot they also point to study showing

434
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,039
that in other states uh showing that in

435
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,320
other states that have legalized pot for

436
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,719
medicinal purposes we've seen an seen an

437
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,319
increase in the number of drivers

438
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,759
testing positive for the drug who were

439
00:15:29,318 --> 00:15:33,958
involved in fatal car accidents the

440
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,560
anti-pot group Sam recently pointed out

441
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,479
that even before the first legal pot

442
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,278
store opened in Washington state the

443
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,319
number of drivers in that state testing

444
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:44,198
positive for pot jumped by a third the

445
00:15:42,318 --> 00:15:46,399
problem with these criticisms is that we

446
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:48,198
can test only for the presid presence of

447
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,318
marijuana metabolites not for

448
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:52,000
inebriation metabolites can linger in

449
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:54,599
the body for days after the drugs

450
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,919
effects wear off sometimes even for

451
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,440
weeks um I'm a very heavy I'm going to

452
00:15:56,919 --> 00:16:01,240
chime in myself here I'm a very heavy

453
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,360
cannabis user and a long time ago uh

454
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,959
this had to be um nearly 10 years ago I

455
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:07,519
was trying to get a good job that would

456
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:10,679
have paid very well and had some great

457
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,839
benefits and so I quit smoking cannabis

458
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,958
and I was all I had to do is pass one

459
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:16,399
drug test all this place did was one

460
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,559
pre-hire screening and then I would have

461
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,360
been home free I could have worked there

462
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:21,559
forever never had to P test again unless

463
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,560
I hurt myself in which case I would have

464
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:28,479
just walked away um so I went uh 30 days

465
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,559
and I took a voluntary P test that you

466
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,199
can buy at the store and I was still

467
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,919
dirty I went 45 days and took a p test

468
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:37,679
and I was still dirty I went 60 days and

469
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,360
I took a p test and I was still dirty

470
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,479
but I already had my interview scheduled

471
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:44,360
so 63 days in I went and took a p test

472
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,399
and the doctor called me back and told

473
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:50,639
me that I still had more than 1,400

474
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:53,759
nanog per uh whatever their measurement

475
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,240
was I had more than their limit of THC

476
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,278
in my urine after 63 days and he asked

477
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,879
me if I was taking prescription Marinol

478
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,278
or what I was doing and I told him that

479
00:16:59,879 --> 00:17:04,160
I hadn't smoked in 9 weeks and he was a

480
00:17:02,278 --> 00:17:06,078
little bit blown away so they're saying

481
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:09,558
that metabolites can linger in the body

482
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:12,078
for days sometimes even weeks um I am a

483
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:14,480
prime example I went nine weeks and

484
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,438
there was still cannabis in my system uh

485
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,599
let me tell you that on day 64 I took a

486
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:20,798
fat bong hit and I don't think I've ever

487
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,879
been that [ __ ] high in my life all

488
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,759
right I'm going to continue on with the

489
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,520
article here it says because we all

490
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,838
metabolize drugs differently and at

491
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:28,558
different times and under different

492
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,440
conditions all that positive test tells

493
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:32,720
us is that the driver has smoked pot at

494
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:33,919
some point in the past few days or weeks

495
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,319
it makes sense that loosening

496
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,000
restrictions on pot would result in

497
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:38,599
higher and a higher percentage of

498
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,440
drivers involved in fatal traffic

499
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,279
accidents having smoked the drug at some

500
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:44,798
point over the past few days or weeks

501
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,639
you'd also expect to find that a higher

502
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,440
percentage of church Growers Good

503
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
Samaritans and soup kitchen volunteers

504
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:52,519
would have pot in their system it'd

505
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,440
expect a similar result among any large

506
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:56,240
sampling of people this doesn't

507
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,279
necessarily mean that marijuana caused

508
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,558
or was even a contributing factor to

509
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:02,678
accidents traffic violations or

510
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,639
fatalities this isn't an argument that

511
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,360
pot wasn't a factor in at least some of

512
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,640
those accidents either but that's

513
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:10,519
precisely the point a post- accident

514
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,559
test for marijuana metabolites doesn't

515
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,519
tell us much about whether uh pot

516
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,918
contributed to the accident since the

517
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:18,918
new Colorado law took effect in January

518
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,799
the drug driver Panic has only

519
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,240
intensified I've already written about

520
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,839
one dubious example in which the

521
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,480
Colorado Highway Patrol and some local

522
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:29,319
and had some local and National media uh

523
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,960
perpetuated a story that driver was high

524
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:32,439
on pot when he slammed into a couple of

525
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,480
police cars parked on an interstate

526
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,840
exent ramp while the driver did have

527
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,880
some pot in his system his blood alcohol

528
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:41,038
level was off the charts and was far

529
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,120
more likely the cause of the accident

530
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,960
and that's something that we've seen a

531
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:45,558
few times here that people will be on

532
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,640
other drugs they'll be drunk and they'll

533
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:48,038
get in an accident and they'll have a

534
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,200
little bit of cannabis in their system

535
00:18:48,038 --> 00:18:52,000
and they blame that [ __ ] on the Cannabis

536
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,240
like they Overlook the fact that this

537
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,119
guy was on four hits of acid that he was

538
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,038
tweaking his brains out that he had

539
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:59,558
mushrooms in his brain but he smoked a

540
00:18:58,038 --> 00:19:00,720
little bit of weeds so that had to have

541
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:02,879
been what sent him over the edge and

542
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,839
made him crash his car all right we're

543
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,960
going to go a little bit more here where

544
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:11,519
the hell was I all right um in my uh in

545
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,319
my colleague Mark Fischer's recent

546
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,319
dispatch from Colorado law enforcement

547
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,678
officials there and in bordering states

548
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:19,240
warned that they're seeing more drug

549
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,080
drivers Congress recently held hearings

550
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,880
on the matter complete with dire

551
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:24,918
predictions such as we are going to have

552
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:27,120
a lot more people Stone on the highway

553
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,440
and there will be consequences from rep

554
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,199
John uh Micah of Florida uh some have

555
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,640
called for a zero tolerance policy if

556
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,400
you're driving with any trace of pot in

557
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,159
your system you're guilty of a DWI that

558
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,000
would effectively ban anyone who smokes

559
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:41,760
pot from driving up to a couple of weeks

560
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,159
after the last joint including people

561
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,599
who legitimately use the drug for

562
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,120
medical reasons guys that means that I

563
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:51,240
would never be able to drive again is

564
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,000
basically what that [ __ ] says it says

565
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,319
that any medical cannabis user in

566
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,880
Colorado would not be able to drive and

567
00:19:56,319 --> 00:19:59,879
I guess now you can't drive or have a

568
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,000
gun if is the two articles that I've

569
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,520
read today this is getting a little

570
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,720
crazy police state much with a question

571
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,679
mark all right I'm going to read more of

572
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,798
the article here we go it seems to me

573
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:10,640
that the best way to gauge the effect uh

574
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,839
gauge the effect legalization has had on

575
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,480
the roadways is to look at what happened

576
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:15,519
uh on the road since legalization took

577
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,798
effect here's a month-by-month

578
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,400
comparison of Highway fatalities in

579
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:21,639
Colorado through the first seven months

580
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,880
of this year and last year for more

581
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:25,799
thorough comparison I've also included

582
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:28,679
the highest fatality figures for each

583
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:31,079
month since 2002 the lowest for each

584
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:33,360
month since 2002 and the average for

585
00:20:31,079 --> 00:20:34,759
each month since 2002 and there is a

586
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:36,959
graph here you guys I know graphs don't

587
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:39,480
do you any good on the podcast but we're

588
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,679
going to look at this the high since

589
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,400
2002 they are showing all right so there

590
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,919
are one two three four five lines on

591
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,919
this graph right and basically it is

592
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,880
showing you that [ __ ] has gone down just

593
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,919
take my word for it so it says as you

594
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,960
can see roadway fatalities this year are

595
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,480
down from last year and down from the

596
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,558
13-year average of the 7 months so far

597
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:04,360
this year 5 months saw a lower fatality

598
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:06,639
figure than the last uh two months saw a

599
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:08,719
slightly higher figure this year and in

600
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,919
one month the two figures were equal if

601
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,000
we add up the total fatalities from

602
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:17,320
January through July it looks like this

603
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:19,159
and we're going to see um it's a Downs

604
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:21,000
sloping graph you guys just take my word

605
00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,640
for that it is a Downs sloping it starts

606
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,558
high and it goes low and then I'll read

607
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,240
the rest of the article it says here the

608
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,599
high bar and he says pardon the pun uh

609
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,400
the high bar is what you get when you

610
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:33,359
add the worst January since 2002 to the

611
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,880
worst February to the worst March and so

612
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:39,798
on the low bar is the sum total of the

613
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,400
safest January February Etc since 2002

614
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:44,679
what's notable here is that the totals

615
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,919
so far in 20 2014 are closer to the

616
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,679
safest composite year since 2002 than to

617
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,880
the average year since 2002 I should

618
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,679
also add here that these are total

619
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,000
fatalities if I were to calculate these

620
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,600
figures as a rate say miles driven per

621
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,798
fatality the drop would be Starker both

622
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:04,759
for this year and since Colorado

623
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,158
legalized medical marijuana in 2001

624
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:07,679
while the number of miles Americans

625
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,760
Drive annually has leveled off

626
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,038
nationally since the mid 2000s the

627
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:14,038
number of total miles traveled continues

628
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:16,400
to go up in Colorado if I were to

629
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:19,519
measure by rate then the state would be

630
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:21,640
at lows unseen in decades so we're

631
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,400
driving even more is what he's saying

632
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,799
and we are crashing even less uh the

633
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
figures are similar in states that have

634
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:29,480
legalized medical marijuana while some

635
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,278
Studies have shown that the number of

636
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,319
drivers involved in fatal collisions who

637
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,519
test positive for marijuana had steadily

638
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,319
steadily increased as pot has become

639
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,158
more available other Studies have shown

640
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:41,240
that overall traffic fatalities in those

641
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,278
states have dropped again because the

642
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,679
pot tests only measure for recent pot

643
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:48,038
use not inebriation there's nothing

644
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,360
inconsistent about those

645
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:52,119
results of course the continuing drop in

646
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:54,479
roadway fatalities in Colorado and

647
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:56,158
elsewhere is due to a variety of factors

648
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,000
such as Better Built cars and trucks

649
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,520
improved safety features and better Road

650
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,919
engineering ing these features in and of

651
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:03,879
themselves only indicate that the roads

652
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,159
are getting safer they don't suggest

653
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,919
that pot had anything to do with it

654
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,360
we're only 7 months in maybe these

655
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,000
figures will change finally it's also

656
00:23:10,359 --> 00:23:15,798
possible that if it weren't for a legal

657
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,679
pot the 2014 figures would be even lower

658
00:23:15,798 --> 00:23:19,759
there's no real way to know that we can

659
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,759
only look at the data available but you

660
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,278
can bet that if fatalities were up this

661
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,480
year prohibition supporters would be

662
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:27,480
blaming it on legal marijuana

663
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,519
interestingly though Road fatalities

664
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:32,000
have generally been falling in Colorado

665
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:35,079
for a long time 2013 actually saw a

666
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,679
slight decrease from 2012 so fatalities

667
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,678
are down the year after legalization

668
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,519
after having gone up the year before so

669
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:44,720
that being said some reachers have gone

670
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,519
some researchers have gone so far as to

671
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,120
suggest that better access to pot is

672
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,798
making the road safer at least

673
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:53,158
marginally the theory is that people are

674
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:55,558
sustaining are substituting pot for

675
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,000
alcohol and pot causes less driver

676
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:00,158
impairment than booze I need to see more

677
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
studies before I'd be ready to endorse

678
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,760
that theory for example there's also

679
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,599
some research contradicting the theory

680
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:10,200
that drinkers are ready to substitute

681
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:12,759
pot for alcohol you know that uh I quit

682
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,960
drinking completely when I got my

683
00:24:12,759 --> 00:24:16,359
medical marijuana card I said to myself

684
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,319
I'm able to go to the store and buy

685
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:20,359
cannabis now I could buy all the herb I

686
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,960
want like because before you'd have to

687
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,319
wait for your dude to have some or you'd

688
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,840
have to grow your own or you'd have to

689
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,960
wait for your crop to be ready or you'd

690
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:29,678
hope one of your Bros had a joint but

691
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,079
when I got my medical marijuana card and

692
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,519
I could just smoke down and then go to

693
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:34,119
the store and buy some more and then

694
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:36,398
smoke down and when I ran out just go to

695
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:39,519
the store tomorrow I didn't even need to

696
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:41,398
drink anymore uh I I've quit drinking I

697
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,639
haven't had alcohol in so many years and

698
00:24:41,398 --> 00:24:44,839
now I smoke all the Cannabis I want

699
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,120
there's no need to drink when I can

700
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:49,798
smoke or all right I'll continue with

701
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,639
the article it says but the data are far

702
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:53,038
more supportive of that than the claims

703
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,880
that stone drivers are menacing

704
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,599
Colorado's roadways and then he says

705
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,919
clarification I wrote that we can test

706
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:59,558
only for the presence of marijuana

707
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,799
metabol it's not for inebriation that

708
00:24:59,558 --> 00:25:03,639
isn't quite accurate uh he does go on to

709
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:05,158
say this is true of roadside tests but a

710
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,880
blood test taken at a hospital can

711
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:09,200
measure for THC the psychoactive

712
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,520
ingredient in marijuana oh we said

713
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,960
ingredient we got to change that to

714
00:25:10,519 --> 00:25:13,158
compound I'm crossing it out on the

715
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,360
keyboard screen or on the computer

716
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,480
screen or writing compound uh that being

717
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:19,959
said even here there are problems

718
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,558
regular users can still have Remnant THC

719
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:23,720
in their blood well after the effects of

720
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,000
worn off regular users can also have

721
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:28,159
levels above the legal limit and still

722
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,839
drive perfectly well he's talking about

723
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,640
me

724
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:33,199
uh in Colorado a THC level of 5 nanog or

725
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,320
more brings a presumptive charge of

726
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,159
driving Under the Influence however

727
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:38,678
reference references to marijuana

728
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:40,520
related accidents and Studies by

729
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:42,360
prohibitionists and law enforcement

730
00:25:40,519 --> 00:25:43,759
could refer to any measure or trace of

731
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,439
the drug so when officials and

732
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,640
legalization opponents talk about

733
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,880
increases in these figures it still

734
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:52,679
isn't clear what any of this means for

735
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:54,399
road safety CU I need to take a quick

736
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,240
drink excuse me for one minute and then

737
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,239
we will talk about this

738
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:06,278
all right my throat is back in Action I

739
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:09,319
was getting dry there so since we have

740
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:12,278
legalized cannabis the traffic has been

741
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:13,879
safer um when you get drunk you drive

742
00:26:12,278 --> 00:26:15,519
recklessly you don't give a [ __ ] you

743
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,080
want to go really really fast you're not

744
00:26:15,519 --> 00:26:18,679
paying attention you're blacked out and

745
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:20,038
you're just [ __ ] driving and getting

746
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:21,278
there you don't care what Lane you're in

747
00:26:20,038 --> 00:26:23,359
you don't care what direction you're

748
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:26,119
going probably don't even know where the

749
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:30,038
hell you're trying to go but when you're

750
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:31,398
high you're just calm you look twice and

751
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:33,398
you go a little bit under the speed

752
00:26:31,398 --> 00:26:35,678
limit because I don't want to go too

753
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:37,278
fast I'm high man you just want to

754
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,759
cruise you want to put the music at a

755
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,119
comfortable level and you want to watch

756
00:26:38,759 --> 00:26:42,440
everything come at you at a decent pace

757
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,959
like I never get too crazy when I'm

758
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,519
driving High uh I will admit that when I

759
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,519
was a Youngster I would drive a little

760
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:51,639
bit drunk and uh that was some scary

761
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,440
[ __ ] I have never been scared of myself

762
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,919
driving high but I have scared the [ __ ]

763
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,080
out of myself driving too drunk it'll

764
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,038
never happen again cuz I don't drink

765
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:00,119
alcohol so I can talk about it freely

766
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,359
all right you guys let's see how far

767

769
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,839
