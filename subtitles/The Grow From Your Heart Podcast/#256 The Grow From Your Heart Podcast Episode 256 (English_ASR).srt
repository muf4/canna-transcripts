98
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,030

107
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:50,189
go back to trying I've been overwhelmed

108
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:52,319
with stuff for some reason the throwback

109
00:03:50,189 --> 00:03:53,939
Thursday episode didn't appear as it

110
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,889
should have today this morning I had to

111
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:58,229
go manually repost that at 4:20 p.m.

112
00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:00,659
today I'm not sure what's going on with

113
00:03:58,229 --> 00:04:03,090
snitcher I do apologize I will get it

114
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:05,069

115
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,229
soon as I can get them to reply I'm on

116
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:08,400
it you guys I'm trying but it's kind of

117
00:04:07,229 --> 00:04:09,810
a stitcher thing I don't know what else

118
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,819
to do I think it's their service because

119
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:13,890
it works everywhere else it works on my

120
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:15,449
website which isn't anything fancy it

121
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:17,969
shows up in iTunes which is the main

122
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:20,250
podcast server it shows up in pod bean

123
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,170
it shows up in pod bay shows up and all

124
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,850
the other podcast services so I feel

125
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,259
like it's got to be a stitcher issue so

126
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,270
I apologize if you are a stitcher

127
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:29,879
listener I can tell that I'm missing

128
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:32,759
listens because my ranking is slipping

129
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:34,439
I'm usually at like a thousand or better

130
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,060
I'm usually somewhere between 600 and a

131
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,180
thousand and the rankings I'm not

132
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,829
anywhere near that right now so I got to

133
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:42,629
fix that I got to get Fichter stitcher

134
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:43,919
fixed I got to get everybody the

135
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:45,860
information and knowledge they need

136
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,530
people rely on me I apologize

137
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,879
one thing I can do to get it going while

138
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:52,529
stitcher is messing up is I can make

139
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,569
more YouTube videos so I've posted

140
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:56,099
several YouTube videos I don't forget

141
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:57,990
that like the first hundred and three

142
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,850
maybe one hundred and five youtube

143
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,560
videos are up on the grill from your

144
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,700
heart podcast youtube channel so if

145
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,780
you're not subscribed to the YouTube

146
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,949
channel go check that out

147
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,819
the first 19 or 20 videos are on the old

148
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:11,039
Agriculture Channel but there's a

149
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,290
playlist on the grill from your heart a

150
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,610
podcast channel the first 19 or 20 are

151
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,650
right there on that playlist click on

152
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,900
the playlist it'll get you there listen

153
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:21,448
to the first 19 or 20 then all the way

154
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:22,918
up to like 103 105 are

155
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:24,658
all right there on the girl from your

156
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:26,218
heart podcast YouTube channel I will

157
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:28,168
keep updating it until I get caught up

158
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:29,788
to current it takes a little bit of time

159
00:05:28,168 --> 00:05:32,038
but I just did some upgrades to my

160
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:34,019
computer I honestly did some downgrades

161
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:35,399
I just deleted a whole bunch of [ __ ] now

162
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:36,180
the computer goes way faster it's gonna

163
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:38,098
work a lot better

164
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,778
so maybe now I can do more video editing

165
00:05:38,098 --> 00:05:40,740
a little more quickly we'll get more

166
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:42,689
videos up for you guys

167
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,400
that's what I can do when stuff fails I

168
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,620
can find new ways to try to compensate

169
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,138
but check out the YouTube channel I

170
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,370
would appreciate that

171
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:51,718
alright guys let's talk about cannabis

172
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,038
I've been rambling on for like five or

173
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:55,408
six minutes and I haven't spoken much

174
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:57,478
about cannabis I try to keep you guys

175
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:59,218
updated on my most recent breeding

176
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:01,498
projects and I haven't spoken much about

177
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:04,288
it on a couple of episodes but I have

178
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:06,870
got I've got an arise male in a room

179
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:08,878
with several females my goal right now

180
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:10,228
is to make a few new crosses because

181
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:11,669
I've been inspired and I've got a few

182
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,899
new clones that I want to pollinate and

183
00:06:11,668 --> 00:06:14,998
make a few new things we've got some

184
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:16,499
great ideas and I'm also going to

185
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:17,879
replenish some seeds that I've got

186
00:06:16,499 --> 00:06:20,789
available commercially that are getting

187
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,110
low in stock so I've got some familiar

188
00:06:20,788 --> 00:06:24,329
plants and some new plants in the

189
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,009
breeding room some of the familiar old

190
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:27,990
stuff is like ah there's a grateful dog

191
00:06:26,009 --> 00:06:29,490
in there so that I can make more of the

192
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:31,379
morning dew there's a piranha in there

193
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:33,210
so that or I flow in there so that I can

194
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,399
make more prana there are a couple of a

195
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,978
rise females in there so that I can make

196
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:39,149
more arise seeds there's a hell's OG in

197
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:41,399
there so that I can make more of the

198
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,990
Hellfire OG but the new stuff that's in

199
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:45,509
there is what has got me excited and

200
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,459
probably you also I put a kosher cush

201
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:50,069
female in there that will be pollinated

202
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:52,079
by the arize I'm not even gonna try to

203
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,639
name that until I grow it out if you've

204
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:55,740
got name recommendations let me know

205
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,019
some Jewish names would be cool cuz I

206
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,028
call my male plant King Solomon and this

207
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:02,008
is the kosher cush there's gonna be some

208
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:04,110
Jewish attachment to the name maybe some

209
00:07:02,009 --> 00:07:06,149
Torah relations to the name let me know

210
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,740
what you think also there's strawberry

211
00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:09,718
fields in there

212
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:11,218
there's also a Zack Hayes in there if

213
00:07:09,718 --> 00:07:13,918
you guys know anything about Zack Hayes

214
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:16,228
that's a Strawberry Cough plant bred to

215
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,908
the killer Hayes those were two of my

216
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,158
friend Zack Hayes is his real name was

217
00:07:17,908 --> 00:07:21,990
Zack Hayes you guys mmm

218
00:07:20,158 --> 00:07:23,610
the Zack Hayes was bred for my friend

219
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,889
Zack Hayes who actually passed away of

220
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:27,389
cystic fibrosis it was a great young man

221
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,158
he was a great dude he was a cannabis

222
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:31,079
patient he was a cannabis advocate and

223
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:33,300
he was just a great dude all around so

224
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:35,098
the Zack Hayes was bred for him our

225
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,460
friends at organic ax got me a clone of

226
00:07:35,098 --> 00:07:38,219
that

227
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,959
I know I am putting pollen from my arise

228
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,610
on that and I will return a bunch of the

229
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,888
seeds to our friends of Arg antica and

230
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,020
we will see what happens with that in

231
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,910
the future but it needs a cool name so

232
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,008
if you've got a cool name for a sack to

233
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,050
arise let me know now that you know the

234
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:53,759
story there's also space [ __ ] number

235
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,680
three I bread space [ __ ] number three I

236
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,879
don't think many people I gave out a few

237
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,918
clones of that a while back I don't

238
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,079
think anybody's got it alive still space

239
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:04,769
[ __ ] number three is of course Space

240
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:07,370
Queen kind of a really pungent like a

241
00:08:04,769 --> 00:08:09,990
rotten mango fruity kind of smelling

242
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,639
phenotype and I pollinated that with my

243
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,930
grateful dog and I made space [ __ ]

244
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:15,030
number three it was of course number

245
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,889
three because it was just the third seed

246
00:08:15,029 --> 00:08:18,929
that I planted in the wine I labeled the

247
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:20,430
cups one two three I think I went up to

248
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:21,720
number eight and that was number three

249
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:23,220
number three and four were the keepers

250
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,039
three is the one that stuck around for

251
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,900
the long time also there is ecto cooler

252
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,759
in there I cannot recall the cross on

253
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,779
ecto cooler right now it's got some DK

254
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,168
in there it's got some other cool stuff

255
00:08:30,779 --> 00:08:36,000
ecto cooler was bred by Tierra Rojo I

256
00:08:34,168 --> 00:08:38,519
expect some great [ __ ] to come from the

257
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,740
arize - ecto cooler so that should be a

258
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,569
fun cross to come up with the name for

259
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,219
if you can think of any names for ecto

260
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,170
cooler to arise I'd love to hear your

261
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,810
suggestions send your suggestions to me

262
00:08:46,169 --> 00:08:50,458
on Twitter I had G fyh podcast or email

263
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:52,799
them to me it's grow from your heart at

264
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:54,149
hotmail.com I'd like to know what you

265
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,250
think I should name those strains but

266
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:58,110
anyway all of those girls are in the

267
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,269
flowering room and the mail is dumping

268
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,490
pollen and it is just about pollen time

269
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:04,169
so probably when I'm done recording here

270
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:05,430
I'm gonna wrap up the dreadlocks and

271
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:07,078
something real nice I'm gonna put on

272
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,159
different clothes and I'm gonna go in

273
00:09:07,078 --> 00:09:09,539
there and I'm gonna smack that male

274
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:10,889
around and make sure he gets pollen I'll

275
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:12,389
turn off all the fans turn off all the

276
00:09:10,889 --> 00:09:14,189
blowers so that I have a little bit of

277
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,509
control over where the pollen goes I'm

278
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,740
gonna go smack that male so where he

279
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,088
shoots his dust everywhere

280
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,470
give him a good shake and then I'm gonna

281
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:21,240
take a butt off of them and just rub

282
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,250
that one bud of male flowers all over a

283
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,959
couple of females I'm gonna make a whole

284
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,250
bunch of seed that the pollination is

285
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:27,869
happening you guys that's what that's

286
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,500
what I'm getting at it is pollination

287
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:33,120
time I'm excited we're just shy of 30

288
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,759
days into flower with these plants that

289
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,440
means at about 30 35 days ish these

290
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:39,120
seeds will be ready that means I'll get

291
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,040
to take them out once the plants try up

292
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,240
I'll get to see what I have created

293
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:44,549
that's always the funnest part of

294
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,549
breeding is seeing what you have created

295
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:48,729
so that's a great way to segue into the

296
00:09:47,549 --> 00:09:51,159
topic of this show

297
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,690
guys I like to talk about breeding a lot

298
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:54,610
and I'm known for a lot of my breeding

299
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:57,160
projects and my breeding work and when

300
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,930
people approach the subject of breeding

301
00:09:57,159 --> 00:10:00,610
they seem to be overwhelmed they seem to

302
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:02,888
think that breeding is some sorceries

303
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,389
some magicians work you guys breeding is

304
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:06,129
the most natural thing that cannabis

305
00:10:04,389 --> 00:10:08,769
plants can do that's what they want to

306
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:11,350
do growing cannabis plants without seeds

307
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:14,110
is actually the trick if you were able

308
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:15,550
to produce cannabis that does not have

309
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,519
seeds in it and that is quality and

310
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:20,649
smokeable you yourself are able to make

311
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,600
seeds for yourself if you're looking to

312
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:24,458
make a small batch of seeds I'm gonna

313
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,199
give you some advice on an idea that

314
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:27,849
I've got I have not perfected this we

315
00:10:26,198 --> 00:10:30,278
are gonna work on this idea together I

316
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:31,810
am certain this would work for a small

317
00:10:30,278 --> 00:10:34,240
garden we're gonna talk about what I

318
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:35,619
have called single pot breeding and I

319
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,299
feel like this could be a book but I'm

320
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,799
gonna give it to everybody right now for

321
00:10:37,299 --> 00:10:40,958
free because I love you guys and I think

322
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:44,379
it's a wonderful idea so here's a great

323
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:46,719
way in one pot in one small space with

324
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:48,338
one light for you to create enough seeds

325
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,110
for yourself to play with and maybe

326
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:51,610
share a few with your friends and that

327
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,560
way you don't have to buy more seeds and

328
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:56,318
you can start your own breeding projects

329
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:58,149
and see that it's not wizardry that it's

330
00:10:56,318 --> 00:11:00,370
something that you can do if you've

331
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,839
grown a crop to fruition if you've made

332
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,639
a plant live that whole nine or ten

333
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,370
weeks through a flowering cycle you are

334
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,930
able to breed seeds if you've got a

335
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,169
strong enough light you are able to

336
00:11:07,929 --> 00:11:12,849
breed seeds it's not that hard so I am

337
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,019
gonna press pause I'm gonna clear my

338
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,278
throat real quick I'm gonna take a

339
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:16,778
couple of drinks I'll probably take

340
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,399
another dab and get my throat all choked

341
00:11:16,778 --> 00:11:20,110
up again but I'm gonna press pause for a

342
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,669
second I'm gonna take a quick break and

343
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:23,379
through the power of editing I'll be

344
00:11:21,669 --> 00:11:25,179
back before you can blink and then we

345
00:11:23,379 --> 00:11:27,519
will talk about single pot breeding and

346
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:30,219
how you can make enough seeds with one

347
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,789
pot with one light in one very small

348
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,230
grow space stay tuned of you guys all

349
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:36,759
right podcast world I just noticed

350
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,440
something funny while I was recording

351
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,240
our friend Jesse sent me a message and

352
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,149
he pointed out that there is a vendor

353
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,879
who sells cannabis seeds online and he

354
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:48,190
claims to have a bunch of IRA genetics

355
00:11:45,879 --> 00:11:49,568
seeds that are honestly sold out and if

356
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,829
he's got them they're rare [ __ ]

357
00:11:49,568 --> 00:11:51,969
collector's items and you might want to

358
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:53,948
get on there but I know that they're not

359
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,839
what he claims they are because those

360
00:11:53,948 --> 00:11:57,549
are simply not available he's way too

361
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,439
late to have those those probably don't

362
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:01,328
even exist anymore anywhere this guy

363
00:11:59,438 --> 00:12:02,379
claims he's got heart of gold seeds this

364
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:04,449
guy claims he's got

365
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:05,980
grateful dog seeds he also claims he's

366
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:07,750
got tons of seeds from all kinds of

367
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:09,460
other vendors and breeders but it

368
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,899
doesn't seem like it's even realistic I

369
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,879
know he doesn't have my stuff he never

370
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:15,309
bought anything from me I know most of

371
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:18,220
where my stuff goes so what I'm saying

372
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:21,519
is that Greybeard seeds the ultimate

373
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:23,879
seed bank at Greybeard seeds com is not

374
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,929
an official distributor vendor

375
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,309
representative of Irene genetics

376
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,139
products in any way shape or form

377
00:12:27,309 --> 00:12:31,989
they've got a picture of Jerry Garcia up

378
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:33,490
is their picture as their icon Jerry's

379
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,730
not part of their seed company don't

380
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:39,519
fall for this um I can't recommend that

381
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,289
you troll them and email them and/or

382
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,970
contact them and let them know that they

383
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:45,730
suck I couldn't say to do anything like

384
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:47,019
that because I'm a podcaster and this

385
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:49,149
goes out and I don't want to get myself

386
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:50,889
in any trouble so make sure that you

387
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:52,480
don't contact them make sure that you

388
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:54,009
don't harass them make sure that you

389
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,259
don't let them know that they're a fraud

390
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:58,120
just let them be ignore them and let

391
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:59,379
them continue as usual all right my

392
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,240
friends that support me and love me

393
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,439
please don't do me any favors by

394
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,789
reaching out to these people and

395
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,860
disrupting their business for being

396
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:07,299
completely fake because if I asked you

397
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:09,279
guys to do something like that it could

398
00:13:07,299 --> 00:13:10,839
backfire and get me in trouble so please

399
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,850
don't do anything like that on my behalf

400
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,460
because I clearly did not ask you to do

401
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:18,490
so thank you guys I love you for all of

402
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,230
your help and support all right now my

403
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,909
main whole point of pressing pause was

404
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:23,830
to take a DAB but then I saw that Jesse

405
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:25,059
message me so now I'm gonna press pause

406
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:26,530
again now that I told you guys about

407
00:13:25,059 --> 00:13:28,089
what Jesse messaged me and I'm gonna go

408
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:29,199
back in message Jesse that he needs to

409
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:30,460
come on the podcast and then I'm

410
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,640
actually gonna take the dad's that I

411
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:38,080
press pause to take so once again please

412
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:40,779
hold all right you guys I am back I am

413
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,370
well medicated I am hydrated I was kind

414
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:43,899
of poking around that website a little

415
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,669
bit there's not really a lot of ways to

416
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,350
contact them through looking at the app

417
00:13:45,669 --> 00:13:50,039
on my phone or at their website on my

418
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,180
phone but maybe you'll you'll find more

419
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,039
anyway I was talking about single pot

420
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:55,149
breeding for those of you that don't

421
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,679
have a lot of space that you're

422
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:59,019
interested in making a few seeds for

423
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,059
yourself why not breathe in just one pot

424
00:13:59,019 --> 00:14:03,009
if you're not into the one pot idea we

425
00:14:01,059 --> 00:14:04,659
can also call it one light breeding and

426
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:07,000
we'll just say every time I say one pot

427
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:08,860
you just say three or four three gallon

428
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,200
pots however many you can fit under your

429
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,360
light now let's talk about light for a

430
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,660
second I don't like to breed under

431
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,570
anything I certainly wouldn't go small

432
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:19,919
than a 400 you could but it you're not

433
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,390
gonna make a lot of seeds they're not

434
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:23,250
gonna be a lot of viable seeds they're

435
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:24,840
gonna take longer if you've got a 600

436
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,840
watt light that's just about right a

437
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:30,090
thousand watt your golden thousand is

438
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,009
amazing six is good 400 will be

439
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,330
sufficient anything less I think you're

440
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:35,669
gonna make a lot of white seeds you're

441
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:37,230
not gonna get enough seeds just to make

442
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:38,669
it worth your time and effort it just

443
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,440
won't be any good for you I would stick

444
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:42,269
with the 400 or bigger the 600 is

445
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,640
probably your best bet if you're just

446
00:14:42,269 --> 00:14:46,470
trying to breed for personal seeds no

447
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,240
I'm talking small spaces you guys a lot

448
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:50,220
of people out there growing in like a

449
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,840
five by five hydro Hut or maybe a small

450
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,970
closet or something that's why I say

451
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,830
single light that's why I got the idea

452
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:58,350
of a single pot what's to stop you from

453
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:01,230
getting one semi large pot like maybe a

454
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:03,090
seven gallon and putting three pot three

455
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,950
plants in that seven gallon pot three

456
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:06,930
small clones that are you know once you

457
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:08,850
put them in the dirt you've got six

458
00:15:06,929 --> 00:15:10,169
maybe ten inches sticking out and you've

459
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:12,480
edge them up a little bit and then you

460
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:14,519
get them all about 12 inches tall maybe

461
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,080
8 inches 18 inches tall or so and then

462
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,730
you use like a tomato cage or three

463
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,050
sticks to spread them out or they're not

464
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,730
all growing straight up the center of

465
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:21,959
the pot you want to spread them out try

466
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,240
to give a little bit of space in there

467
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,420
maybe top them veg amount until they're

468
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,279
like 18 24 inches tall and then one of

469
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:31,829
those is your male one of the plants in

470
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,209
that 3 the trio of plants there is your

471
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:34,710
boy and the other two are your females

472
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:36,450
maybe you've got an indica and a sativa

473
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,980
in there it may be better if you don't

474
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,970
do a full indica and a full sativa

475
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,680
because your flowering times will be

476
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,750
wonky you'd want them a little closer

477
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:44,159
together but it will work it certainly

478
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:46,320
will work and you'll make enough seeds

479
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:47,759
for yourself if that's your goal but put

480
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,620
two strains that are similar in there or

481
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,539
two females of the same type and then

482
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:53,549
one male in there and flower that out

483
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,740
and that one pot and now you can make

484
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:58,559
enough seeds for yourself with one space

485
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:00,419
one light one pot now the reason this

486
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,619
would be helpful I've got a couple of

487
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,199
great reasons why this would be helpful

488
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,940
for you one reason maybe if something

489
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,770
goes wrong it looks like you've only got

490
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,720
one plant instead of having three plants

491
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:11,490
you're only gonna get in trouble for one

492
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,840
shouldn't something happen I don't know

493
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:14,220
how well that'll work for you but you've

494
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,410
only got one pot so you can only have

495
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,670
one plant right all right another reason

496
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:19,769
why this would be helpful is because now

497
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:21,089
you've only got a water one pot yeah

498
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,139
you've got three plants in there but

499
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,970
you've only got to mix up enough

500
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,769
nutrients in enough water to water that

501
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,029
one pot and if you're somebody that

502
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:28,990
works a lot if you're somebody they

503
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,028
can't be home constantly a

504
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,889
in gallon pot is gonna stay wet for like

505
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:35,439
3 maybe 4 days depending on your

506
00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:37,179
environment in your small gross space so

507
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,480
that'll buy you time you've only got one

508
00:16:37,179 --> 00:16:41,859
pot to water and it reduces numbers and

509
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,269
it saves you floor space cuz you don't

510
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,159
have so many pots in the floor you've

511
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,500
only got one pot and keep in mind that

512
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,059
eventually once you're done pollinating

513
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:50,320
you're gonna cut down that male plant

514
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:52,329
and it's gonna give you a little bit

515
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,550
more space in that pot so it will be

516
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:56,050
less crowded so you can probably fit

517
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:58,028
three or four plants in a seven gallon

518
00:16:56,049 --> 00:17:01,149
pot you can flower it all in the same

519
00:16:58,028 --> 00:17:02,830
pot under 1 400 watt light use very

520
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:05,980
little space and then you can make your

521
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,328
own personal seeds alright now let's

522
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:09,009
talk about the same thing but let's

523
00:17:07,328 --> 00:17:11,019
change up the plan of attack in the

524
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:12,818
method just a little bit let's say

525
00:17:11,019 --> 00:17:14,588
you've got maybe I like saying a 5x5

526
00:17:12,818 --> 00:17:16,149
hydro huh those are very available and

527
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:17,558
it doesn't have to be a hydro huh just

528
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,410
whatever grow hut you can get get a

529
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:22,149
quality one or a small 5x5 space that's

530
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:25,569
kind of what I like for a one light

531
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:27,400
setup so let's let's talk like 5x5 hydro

532
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:29,799
Hut with maybe like a 400 watt light in

533
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,480
there maybe a 600 watt light you've got

534
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,808
a duct on top to get the heat in the

535
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:37,960
stale air out what I would do in a 5x5

536
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:39,099
Hut I would run a carbon filter I would

537
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,750
hang it from the top I would run the

538
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:42,519
ducting from the filter through the

539
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,558
light then I would run I would have a

540
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,029
vented light or a ducted light then I

541
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,099
would run the ducting up right out of

542
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:50,500
the top and I would set the blower right

543
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:52,928
on top it's on the outside of the Hut

544
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:54,700
just resting on the roof now and it's

545
00:17:52,929 --> 00:17:56,769
sucking it's got ducting attached to it

546
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,630
and it's sucking the air through the

547
00:17:56,769 --> 00:18:00,250
carbon filter over the light and out of

548
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,740
the top of the hut that way you're

549
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:05,890
extracting air that has been filtered

550
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,480
and doesn't stink out of the hut and he

551
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:09,340
will pull fresh air in through the vents

552
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,870
in the bottom of the hut while you're

553
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:12,339
pulling that old stale air out and

554
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:14,139
you'll also be cooling the light at the

555
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:16,720
same time so that one blower is serving

556
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:20,740
multiple purposes so carbon filter

557
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,179
ducting light ducting blower resting on

558
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,799
the top outside and then you're just

559
00:18:22,179 --> 00:18:25,480
blowing that heat out now all you have

560
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,009
to do is get that heat out of whatever

561
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,460
room you're in that heat has to go

562
00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:30,670
somewhere

563
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:32,319
but anyway so you got a 500 or a 5x5 Hut

564
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,970
or like a four or a six hundred watt

565
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,220
light in there if you don't want to do a

566
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:37,720
single pot here is another method that I

567
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,940
have discovered works very well you

568
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,490
could do this for breeding or I like to

569
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,410
do this personally for running new seeds

570
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:46,210
I make new seeds I've got a lot of them

571
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,070
and I want to grow them but I don't have

572
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,170
a whole bunch of space so I need to grow

573
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:52,599
some small plants but I'll do in that

574
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:55,660
situation is I will use very small pots

575
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:58,449
I really like to use 4 or 6 inch net

576
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,000
pots if you go to Amazon you can find a

577
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:02,679
5 or 6 inch net pots used for

578
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,900
hydroponics they're fairly cheap you can

579
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,700
get a pack of 24 for not much money at

580
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:09,040
all you can probably get free shipping a

581
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:10,690
pack of 24 if you use the method I'm

582
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,789
talking about you'll have enough for two

583
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:14,799
runs and they are reusable so it's very

584
00:19:12,789 --> 00:19:17,049
affordable know what I like to do I like

585
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,629
to get the six inch net pots and I like

586
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:22,839
to fill them with a very aerated coco

587
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:24,670
like 50% cocoa fifty percent perlite I

588
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:26,799
fill it almost all the way to the top

589
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,170
and I'll put my clones right inside

590
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,909
there or my seedling I will sprout it

591
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:32,080
and get it all germinate it and I'll get

592
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:35,470
it growing and then I'll put it into the

593
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:37,720
cocoa and then I take em I get

594
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:40,058
Tupperware or Rubbermaid dishes from

595
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,700
Walmart or Target and they're only like

596
00:19:40,058 --> 00:19:44,558
six maybe five maybe eight inches tall

597
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,390
it the most and they're just made for

598
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,920
like storing clothes underneath the bed

599
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,450
or something some of them have wheels on

600
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,220
them but I like to get them they're

601
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,529
about three feet long and then they're

602
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:56,589
probably eighteen inches wide and I like

603
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:58,480
to put five of the six inch net pots per

604
00:19:56,589 --> 00:20:00,759
Rubbermaid container so I do a row a

605
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,440
three and a row a two and they fit like

606
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,819
three and then two they don't they don't

607
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,558
fit side-by-side they're not parallel

608
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:07,960
those staggered I'm sure you know what I

609
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:10,539
mean right so I got five per tub and I

610
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,519
do two tubs under one light so now I've

611
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:15,129
got ten of those in the six-inch net

612
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:17,109
pots and when I put them into the Coco

613
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,910
the first time I'll water from the top I

614
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:20,949
will water those plants with a lot of

615
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,870
mammoth microbes plus life from veg

616
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,450
bloom a little bit of veg bloom base

617
00:20:22,869 --> 00:20:27,909
maybe a little liquid karma maybe

618
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,590
cal-mag if it needs it and then a little

619
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,150
bit of carbohydrates depending on what

620
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:33,308
brand of carbohydrates I'm working with

621
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,890
at the time but I'll add some carbs in

622
00:20:33,308 --> 00:20:37,058
there to get it going but you want to

623
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,950
focus on the root development at that

624
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:40,839
time anyway I will water it from the top

625
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:42,308
at that time I'll put the clone into the

626
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:44,619
cocoa and water it from the top just

627
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:46,119
like normal get the cocoa saturated it's

628
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:48,339
been transplanted at school then I set

629
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:51,219
them into the Rubbermaid dish and slide

630
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:52,928
them under the one light now that's the

631
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:55,329
last time those plants get watered from

632
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:55,800
the top now I mix up a three gallon or a

633
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:58,259
five

634
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,149
gallon jug of water every Monday and

635
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:01,920
shake the [ __ ] out of it and divide it

636
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,810
in half and pour two and a half gallons

637
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,460
of water I tried to save some you guys

638
00:21:03,809 --> 00:21:07,500
if I do the five gallon container I only

639
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,910
try to do about one and a half to two

640
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,130
gallons of water per Rubbermaid

641
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:13,170
container and I fill it up and it's

642
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,240
honestly I've got long fingers it's

643
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:16,620
probably a little more than up to the

644
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,569
second knuckle that's got to be an inch

645
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:20,399
and a half maybe two inches deep where

646
00:21:18,569 --> 00:21:22,169
the water just sitting in there and it

647
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,759
works because those net pots have so

648
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:25,170
much space up top that they're still

649
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,539
getting air and they're not drowning

650
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,820
ah that water only sits in there that

651
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:31,889
deep for like an hour before all the

652
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:33,809
cocoa absorbs it it just wicks it right

653
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,310
up and then you've got like one knuckle

654
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:37,769
deep worth of water and that sits there

655
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:40,139
for a couple of days when the plants

656
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:41,430
just absorb all of that and they drink

657
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,560
it all up from the roots as the roots

658
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:45,090
get dry as the cocoa gets dry it wicks

659
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:47,789
it right up and keeps it going in there

660
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:49,829
and then I let that go honestly I can

661
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:51,210
water it on Monday or Sunday night and

662
00:21:49,829 --> 00:21:53,369
then I can work throughout most of the

663
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,140
week and I don't have to add water until

664
00:21:53,369 --> 00:21:56,729
maybe Thursday or Friday actually

665
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:58,830
today's Thursday and I put just a little

666
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:01,470
bit of fresh water on top to top it off

667
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:03,629
I watered it Monday it got dry up dried

668
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,670
up by Wednesday today is Thursday I just

669
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:06,810
added some fresh water on there so that

670
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,150
I'm not adding I didn't even add

671
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:12,299
nutrients today I just add in fresh

672
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:14,190
water that'll probably rock until like

673
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:16,169
Saturday or Sunday and then Saturday

674
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:17,370
I'll take the plants out I'll set them

675
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:18,750
on the floor and I'll take those

676
00:22:17,369 --> 00:22:19,859
Tupperware dishes and clean them out

677
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,960
real good I'll just hose them out

678
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:23,969
outside in the backyard then I'll bring

679
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,220
them back in and then I'll remix more

680
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:27,720
water and then I'll pour that three

681
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,309
gallons and divide the three gallons up

682
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,230
by the two tubs and set them in there

683
00:22:29,309 --> 00:22:34,500
and let it rock just like that under the

684
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:35,970
light and sometimes I'll do a small

685
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,190
breeding project like that if I'm making

686
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:40,110
new stuff that's often how I do it if

687
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,850
I'm running new seeds that's often how I

688
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:43,649
do it then I can do ten small plants

689
00:22:41,849 --> 00:22:44,879
under one light sometimes you can do

690
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,710
even more if you want to do another

691
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,630
Tupperware dish and then you just veg

692
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,279
them for a very short time just until

693
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,690
they're you know like maybe eight inches

694
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:53,730
tall and then you flour them you don't

695
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:55,259
veg for very long and then that way you

696
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,789
can see what you've got if you're just

697
00:22:55,259 --> 00:22:59,099
running a 400 watt light that's enough

698
00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:00,329
space for that many plants you can see

699
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:02,609
what you've got you can see what you

700
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:04,889
made if you're running new seeds or you

701
00:23:02,609 --> 00:23:06,750
can make plenty of new stuff I recommend

702
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,300
if you're gonna do it that way do a mail

703
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:10,829
separately put the mail in a sauce

704
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:12,389
and set him to the side because he's

705
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:14,009
gonna get eliminated once he pollinates

706
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:16,350
anyway so don't waste your space in that

707
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:17,900
Rubbermaid dish for the mail I just put

708
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:19,980
the mail in there and water the saucer

709
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,960
so that you could take out the saucer

710
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,039
eliminate him once everybody gets grown

711
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,710
real well and once everybody's

712
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:28,230
pollinated so that's a great way to run

713
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:30,059
a semi large number of plants in a small

714
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:32,039
space you could also do the same thing

715
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:33,750
with beer cups if you didn't want to

716
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:35,970
spend the money on the 6-inch net pots

717
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:37,529
you can fit more beer cups in the same

718
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,150
amount of space and you can use the

719
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:40,710
Tupperware container as your reservoir

720
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:44,460
as your base like I like to do is my

721
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,809
hydro table but that's if you're running

722
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:48,029
that many plants you have to worry about

723
00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,440
the rules and the laws so be careful you

724
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:51,240
can fit a lot more beer cups under that

725
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,440
light and you can get them real close

726
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,819
together and grow them up till they're

727
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,990
about three or four inches tall and then

728
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:55,529
flower them you can see what you've

729
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,120
created

730
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:58,829
if you want to pollinate those at that

731
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,419
height you certainly can do that and you

732
00:23:58,829 --> 00:24:03,509
can make a bunch of seeds from a really

733
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:05,340
short crop that's a way to do it but my

734
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,779
idea started with a single pot to stay

735
00:24:05,339 --> 00:24:08,429
legal and get away from all the large

736
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:10,559
numbers but if you want to go with large

737
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,789
numbers just use beer cups make sure you

738
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,859
poke holes in the bottom so you get

739
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:15,629
plenty of drainage I like to use a drill

740
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:16,889
and I stack like five or six cups

741
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,630
together and go straight through the

742
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:19,950
bottom three or four times and then I

743
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:22,680
actually like to go through the side

744
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,210
right about I don't know maybe half an

745
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,009
inch up just go right through the side

746
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,360
of the cup four times so you have plenty

747
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:29,190
of drainage if you're gonna be filling

748
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,899
the reservoir and you're using the cups

749
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:32,880
you can't go as deep because you will

750
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,350
start to get root rot there's not as

751
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,330
much drainage happening not as much

752
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:38,879
oxygen you have to be careful it would

753
00:24:36,329 --> 00:24:40,710
be a good idea to put an airstone to get

754
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,720
one of those aquarium air stones with

755
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:44,819
the two that come off and drop one air

756
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,799
stone in each reservoir of water to keep

757
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:48,929
the oxygen level in there high but if

758
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,789
you're using well aerated coco with the

759
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,500
net pots you should be fine if you're

760
00:24:50,789 --> 00:24:55,440
using beer cups you certainly need

761
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:59,059
oxygen flowing in that water or it won't

762
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,710
get funky treat it kind of like hydro

763
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:03,809
measure your PPM's and stuff don't don't

764
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,519
overdo it and then I just let it flower

765
00:25:03,809 --> 00:25:07,289
if you're doing brand-new seeds I like

766
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,119
to let new seeds go nine to ten weeks if

767
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,210
you're pollinating to make new seeds let

768
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,739
that go you'll probably have pollination

769
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,240
start happening if you're not touching

770
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,549
anything the pollen will start dropping

771
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:20,309
around day 14 go in there and smack the

772
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:22,418
plant one time around day 25 you really

773
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:24,519
have heavy pollination by then

774
00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:25,960
wait until about day 65 to cut that

775
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,388
stuff down let it dry and you've just

776
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,879
made a tester bachelor seeds with one

777
00:25:28,388 --> 00:25:32,678
light possibly one pot possibly a

778
00:25:30,878 --> 00:25:35,709
Tupperware dish this depends on what

779
00:25:32,679 --> 00:25:37,600
method you chose Oh something I should

780
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,639
mention it just dawned on me if you're

781
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,439
gonna do the the Tupperware method with

782
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,849
the water in there it is cold as [ __ ]

783
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,590
right now that you guys it's Colorado

784
00:25:42,849 --> 00:25:47,048
where I am it's wintertime it's getting

785
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:48,970
cold even in the house the floor is cold

786
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:51,190
get that Tupperware container up off the

787
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,538
floor I just put something underneath it

788
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:54,278
or it's not touching the floor between

789
00:25:52,538 --> 00:25:56,019
get it a little bit warmer that water in

790
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:58,329
there will get cold that will cause you

791
00:25:56,019 --> 00:26:00,700
problems right now if you're in Cali and

792
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,808
it's not cold don't worry about it but

793
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,100
if you're somewhere like I am right now

794
00:26:01,808 --> 00:26:05,980
starting to get super chilly

795
00:26:03,099 --> 00:26:06,819
don't let that water get real cold you

796
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:08,558
guys it may sound like I'm

797
00:26:06,819 --> 00:26:09,908
oversimplifying things but if you're

798
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,259
trying to do stuff for yourself in your

799
00:26:09,909 --> 00:26:13,149
house and you don't have a lot of

800
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:14,710
resources it shouldn't be as

801
00:26:13,148 --> 00:26:15,008
intimidating as a lot of people think it

802
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:17,200
is

803
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:19,628
you can breed just like I said under one

804
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,129
light in very very minimal conditions

805
00:26:19,628 --> 00:26:21,878
and you can have great success don't

806
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,888
scare yourself

807
00:26:21,878 --> 00:26:26,678
don't overcomplicate it don't overthink

808
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:28,148
things keep it simple stoner I think a

809
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:30,340
lot of people make mistakes in the grow

810
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:32,888
by overthinking they cause problems by

811
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:34,089
overthinking when people come to me for

812
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:35,888
advice on the internet and they're like

813
00:26:34,089 --> 00:26:37,028
man this is going wrong I don't know

814
00:26:35,888 --> 00:26:37,449
what to do I don't know what to do what

815
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:39,909
should I do

816
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,590
it's all dude smoke a joint go for a

817
00:26:39,909 --> 00:26:43,299
walk and then come back and look at your

818
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:44,618
plants and the answer will come to you

819
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:46,329
you won't be so freaked out you won't be

820
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:48,668
so panicky you won't be overthinking it

821
00:26:46,329 --> 00:26:50,079
you're just driving yourself crazy so

822
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:51,840
what we do with most of life honestly I

823
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,829
think try to overanalyze things

824
00:26:51,839 --> 00:26:56,019
overthink it look too deep into things

825
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:57,939
you start [ __ ] up just see what you

826
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:59,440
see and accept it alright don't

827
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:01,480
overthink the grow it's not that hard

828
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,808
you guys its nature these plants grow

829
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,788
like I've said it several times the cush

830
00:27:04,808 --> 00:27:08,648
grows on a mountain on a cush Mountain a

831
00:27:06,788 --> 00:27:10,179
goat peed on it it got a bunch of wind

832
00:27:08,648 --> 00:27:12,008
they got a bunch of rocks thrown at it

833
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:13,989
it was not a happy plant and it survived

834
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:16,839
that's where it happened it's where it's

835
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:18,399
all from Durban poison is from Africa we

836
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:19,658
have a Durban poison plant that won't

837
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:21,699
grow in the garden we couldn't figure

838
00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:24,149
out what to do with it we quit giving it

839
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:26,710
water guess what it grows there from

840
00:27:24,148 --> 00:27:28,898
random places with random conditions

841
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:31,179
they didn't come from place they'd none

842
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:33,638
of these plants were they didn't happen

843
00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:35,470
naturally in a grow room in a sterile

844
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:36,009
facility they were on a mountain they

845
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:37,180
were in a John

846
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:39,190
they were in a forest they were in

847
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,620
shitty climates getting pissed on by

848
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,970
goats getting chewed out by bats random

849
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,009
terrible things were happening to these

850
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,660
plants and they survived so don't be

851
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:49,329
scared to take it and treat it like a

852
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:51,370
plant it's not a puppy it's not a dog

853
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:53,829
it's not an iPad they can take some

854
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:55,329

856
00:27:55,329 --> 00:27:59,289

857
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,390

863
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:13,359
mildew before I've had bud rot I have

864
00:28:10,869 --> 00:28:15,099
[ __ ] up trays of clones one time when

865
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,689
I was a new grower I got too stoned and

866
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:18,099
fell asleep and left the grow room door

867
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:19,539
open all night and seeded the entire

868
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:21,669
[ __ ] crop and heard the whole thing

869
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:23,529
so guess what you guys I make mistakes

870

don't be afraid to try new stuff don't

871

be afraid to make some mistakes and

872

don't be afraid to not treat this plant

873
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:30,879
like it's a princess it's a weed they

874

in a single pot if you're gonna breed in

879

several small pots if you're gonna breed

915
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,649
way to do it grow from your heart at

916
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,210
hotmail.com you guys don't forget that I

917
00:29:51,648 --> 00:29:55,219
put out throwback Thursday episodes

918
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:56,870
every Thursday the reason I do that is

919
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:59,179
because iTunes and stitcher only hold

920
00:29:56,869 --> 00:30:01,609
100 episodes in their feed and I've got

921
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:03,230
256 episodes out now that means there

922
00:30:01,609 --> 00:30:05,509
are episodes people cannot find in the

923
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,730
feed I am putting old episodes together

924
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:09,288
in blocks of like maybe three maybe five

925
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:11,058
episodes it's usually about three hours

926
00:30:09,288 --> 00:30:12,470
worth of content I mash them all

927
00:30:11,058 --> 00:30:14,359
together and then I release them on a

928
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:16,429
Thursday that way you can go back and

929
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:18,408
listen to that old stuff the trick now

930
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:20,480
is that a lot of that old stuff is being

931
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:23,120
reposted and it's pushing the older old

932
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,500
stuff out so my solution to that like I

933
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,658
mentioned earlier is to put it up on

934
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,339
YouTube you can find the show on YouTube

935
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:30,380

hundred and five episodes are available

937
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:34,130
