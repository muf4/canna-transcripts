the plants look mostly happy i'm seeing

67
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,599
a lot of robust growth in most areas of

68

69
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,039

shout out because i do

85
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:28,719
love the lights the plants look great in

86
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,120
most areas

87
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:32,959
let me do a disclaimer i did [ __ ] up

88
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,439
there is an error in one part of my grow

89
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:35,360
area

90
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,560
i messed up i let the plants get a

91
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,239
little bit too tall

92
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,759
they got a little bit too close to that

93
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,200
led light guess what

94
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,878
they're starting to yellow up just a

95
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,639
little bit but it is a learning

96
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:45,439
experience i knew exactly what was

97
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,759
causing it

98
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,439
the plants just looked yellow and i was

99
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,719
like what is going on and then i thought

100
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,079
about it and i looked around and i said

101
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,080
they're just too close to the new light

102
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,719
that is the only variable in the room

103
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,200
so when we are learning to work with new

104
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,560
lights

105
00:02:57,199 --> 00:03:00,079
we may want to keep them a little bit

106
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,000
higher that's something that i messed up

107
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,159
there is a learning curve

108
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,598
what i've done to uh fix that is just

109
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:08,719
turn down the lights they are 315 or 325

110
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,878
watts when you start

111
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,318
i simply cranked them down to 240 the

112
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,759
plants are recovering they're greening

113
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:15,839
back up they're looking good

114
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:17,679
i topped them just to get that main top

115
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,519
out of the way turn the lights down

116
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
hit them with a little foliar foliar

117
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,519
feet of base nutrients i put a little

118
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
uh push in there as well the plants are

119
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,280
back on track everybody looks happy but

120
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,439
there was a little bit of a learning

121
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,080
curve ah there are a few things to talk

122
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,680
about there

123
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
i love the led lights but if you're

124
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,719
going to use them make sure they are the

125
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,158
appropriate distance away

126
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,919
from your plants that's something we

127
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:40,878
should talk about also uh

128
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,318
don't be afraid to uh learn you guys i

129
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,000
made a mistake and my plants are kind of

130
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,119
yellowed out and i had to recover from

131
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,799
that but guess what

132
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,480
i learned that lesson i only have to

133
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,680
learn that once we're past

134
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:54,238
that where do we go from here um i have

135
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,799
seen a lot of people on social media

136
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,480
having a heartbreak over discovering

137
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,640
that their gigantic plants

138
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,759
are now males they put these big ass

139
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,518
plants into males and they are

140
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,239
heartbroken i keep seeing this on social

141
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,120
media

142
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,680
i talked about this in outdoor season uh

143
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,120
it was

144
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,480
kind of looked over and i realized that

145
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,599
people don't really go back and listen

146
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:13,759
to old episodes

147
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,039
so that one is gone people are not

148
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,680
listening to that anymore

149
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:18,798
so let's kind of talk about sexing our

150
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,560
cannabis plants

151
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,839
that way when you're growing these big

152
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
giant plants

153
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,119
you don't discover later on after

154
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,160
spending time

155
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,680
money energy nutrients uh whatever

156
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,560
you're putting into it you don't waste

157
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,800
all this time

158
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,040
money energy nutrients space space is

159
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,759
expensive on growing a male plant

160
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,319
a responsible farmer uh tests for sex

161
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,800
before

162
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,240
investing all of this time space energy

163
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,520
and money into a plant that we're going

164
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,439
to have to chop down

165
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,879
and throw away if you're a new grower

166
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,240
that can be really heartbreaking a lot

167
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,879
of times you just spent all of your

168
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,960
money

169
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,478
on new seeds on new equipment and now

170
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:53,758
you find out that that plant is a male

171
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,519
and you've grown it way too big there

172
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,080
are ways to prevent that

173
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,120
let's talk about how to quickly and uh

174
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,879
responsibly

175
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,959
find out if we are growing male or

176
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,159
female plants before we get them into

177
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,079
the grow space

178
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,280
uh if you spend a month vegging that

179
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,959
you've watered it

180
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,638
if you water it three times a week you

181
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,758
probably watered 12 times you put

182
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,000
nutrients in there

183
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,680
you spent time phd the water you've got

184
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,038
a light running for a month maybe two

185
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,879
months at this point

186
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:21,038
that's going to cost you money that soil

187
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:23,199
cost you money just having that space

188
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,199
wasted technically is costing you money

189
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,919
if that gross base is not producing

190
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,360
it is an expense at that time so if we

191
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:30,959
could find out if our plants are males

192
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,639
or females much more quickly

193
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,319
that would be beneficial one thing i

194
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,199
want to touch on that i did not write on

195
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,079
my notes here

196
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,759
is the quickest way to sex them is a sex

197
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,079
test we have science now

198
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
you can easily order these little cards

199
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:46,478
from a testing lab

200
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,759
you can rub a leaf onto the testing card

201
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,680
all you need is some of the juice from

202
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,840
the plant to transfer onto the card

203
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,800
you fold the card back up you mark that

204
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:58,079
plant plant number 9653

205
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,840
you mark the card 9653 and you mail that

206
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,439
card into the testing lab

207
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:03,198
they will tell you if that plant is a

208
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,279
male or a female that is

209
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,360
the quickest most efficient way to

210
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,000
identify male and female plants in your

211
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
grow

212
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,639
of course if the plant is male and

213
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,000
you're not looking to breed then you can

214
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,519
get rid of it at that point

215
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,759
you've only got female plants to work

216
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,279
with you've bought yourself more space

217
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,720
you're not going to waste time watering

218
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,079
that male plant that you didn't need

219
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,280
you're not going to up pot that thing

220
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:22,560
into a bigger plant

221
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,119
because this should happen when they're

222
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,079
in tiny pots either people say that cups

223
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,840
are for beer but

224
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,839
i know a lot of people i'm guilty of it

225
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,519
myself i grow in beer cups

226
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,519
i think beer cups are a great place for

227
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:36,159
little clones little starter plants

228
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,680
also in a commercial facility i use four

229
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
and six inch net pots

230
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,120
so little plants get them real tiny then

231
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,560
do the sex test on the card just rub

232
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,319
pull off a leaf rub it on there

233
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,600
send it in they will let you know in

234
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
just a couple of weeks

235
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,720
depending on how busy the lab is how far

236
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,598
away the lab is they'll let you know

237
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,759
very quickly

238
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,120
if you've got male or female plants that

239
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,038
is the quickest way

240
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,560
to determine if you've got male or

241
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,360
female plants it does cost you a little

242
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,519
bit of money

243
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,720
however if you've only got small space

244
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:04,240
and you're trying to go quickly maybe

245
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,000
that little bit of money is worth it

246
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,918
some people like to spend that money on

247
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,038
those things people allocate their money

248
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,399
for different ways if you've got the

249
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,199
funds go for it now

250
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,120
if you've only got one room and you were

251
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,800
trying to find the sex of your plant

252
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
how can you do that without disrupting

253
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,720
your grow too much

254
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,560
um one room one light here's what i

255
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,479
would do i would sprout some seeds

256
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,399
i would grow them they would be in they

257
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,240
would really be very tiny they would be

258
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,679
in beer cups they'd be in six inch net

259
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,519
pots i've said that before

260
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,120
no bigger than a one gallon pot at this

261
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,279
time i don't want to waste a lot of

262
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,319
space first of all i don't want to waste

263
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,758
a lot of

264
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,520
soil i don't want to waste a lot of

265
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,800
nutrients i don't want to waste a lot of

266
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,159
water i don't want to waste a lot of

267
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,160
light and electricity

268
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,759
i don't need to be wasteful here so i'm

269
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,280
going to pot a

270
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,960
like a 10 pack we'll just say we'll do a

271
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,439
10 pack of seeds i'm allowed to have 12

272
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:51,120
plants

273
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:52,478
so a 10 pack keeps me safe i'm going to

274
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,720
pop 10 seeds right

275
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,598
i'm going to veg them out until they are

276
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,919
6 or 8

277
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:58,800
ish inches tall then at that point i'm

278
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,359
going to put them

279
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,720
into 12 12 lighting i'm going to put

280
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,319
them into flour

281
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,919
right so i'm gonna let them grow for

282
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,598
maybe a week maybe two weeks then i'm

283
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:11,439
going to put them into flour

284
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:13,279
in about 7 10 maybe 14 days

285
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,360
these plants will definitely have shown

286
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,359
me if they are males or females

287
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,120
now at that point like i said earlier if

288
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,319
i'm not breeding i'm going to chop down

289
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,280
all the male plants i'm going to get

290
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,960
those out of the room

291
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,559
i'm going to take those little tiny six

292
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,239
inch net pots and i'm going to throw

293
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,598
that dirt away or recycle that dirt

294
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,840
whatever i choose to do

295
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,519
now i've only wasted a couple of six

296
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:32,639
inch net pots worth of space i've only

297
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:34,478
wasted two

298
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,479
maybe three or four or five weeks worth

299
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
of growth of light watering

300
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,240
air space air time real estate in the

301
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,158
grow i haven't wasted a whole bunch of

302
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
time and we didn't need two rooms

303
00:08:42,158 --> 00:08:46,159
to determine the sex of these plants so

304
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,759
we're going to grow them until they are

305
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:49,199
big enough that we think they can

306
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:50,958
uh that's ready to flip them just two

307
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,040
weeks is good enough get them six

308
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,559
eight ten inches tall then flip them put

309
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,559
them on 12 12.

310
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,239
then once they've showed you their sex

311
00:08:56,559 --> 00:09:01,599
we are going to put them back

312
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,560
on an 18-6 light cycle 18 on six hours

313
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
off or

314
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:07,278
if you really want to you can put them

315
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,360
on a 24-hour on and zero off light cycle

316
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,120
and they will go back into a vegetative

317
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,680
stage if you don't let them flower too

318
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,519
long

319
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,359
if you're good at identifying the sex as

320
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,360
soon as you see that sex

321
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,720
that sex part that male part that female

322
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,120
part that is when

323
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,959
you put them back into the vegetative

324
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,039
stage so that is a really quick way

325
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:27,119
to determine sex of your plants if

326
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,838
you've only got one room

327
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,240
if you have got two separate areas here

328
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,640
is

329
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,639
the most ideal way or another really

330
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,519
ideal way this is the way that i myself

331
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:37,519
personally

332
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,278
sex my plants in a commercial

333
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,799
environment i may pay for the lab

334
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,759
testing to have those sent in just

335
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:44,000
because

336
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,600
that saves us a lot of time the week

337
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,480
that it takes us to send and get that

338
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
test back

339
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,440
is well worth the two weeks that it

340
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,639
takes us to find out if they're males or

341
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
females in flower

342
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,559
so we'll just do the little the rub test

343
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:57,440
send them in that is very quick but

344
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,359
here's how i do it in my personal grow

345
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,120
if you've got a clone and a flower or

346
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,000
possibly two or three separate areas

347
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,078
available

348
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,039
this is how i would do it i would grow

349
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:06,958
the plants

350
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:08,559
i would get them into that six inch net

351
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,078
pot then as soon as they're big enough

352
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:11,599
maybe a one gallon pot

353
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,919
as soon as they are big enough to get

354
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,360
one maybe three clones i don't know how

355
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,559
good at cloning you are if you're a

356
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,240
really good cloner

357
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,159
take three clones if you're not good at

358
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,519
it one clone should be good and or if

359
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:22,879
you're really good at it i'm not sure

360
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,560
what i said i'm talking i don't have

361
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:25,679
much notes here so this is all freestyle

362
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,399
keep that in mind

363
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,559
um if you are super good at cloning take

364
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,159
one clone if you're not super good at it

365
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,159
take three that way you've got a backup

366
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,759
plan i like to take the top

367
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,600
when that plant starts to grow the main

368
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,879
top will shoot out that is your first

369
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,959
clone to take right there

370
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,559
so get a clone of that plant let it grow

371
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,000
a little bit more and get the two very

372
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,439
bottom branches as soon as

373
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,879
not the little shitty branches on the

374
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,720
bottom but the two main branches that

375
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,639
are big enough to take a clone off of

376
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,079
clone those off of there now you got

377
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,000
three clones in the cloner

378
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,439
now you've also got the original donor

379
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,559
plant we're going to call that the donor

380
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,399
plant at this time

381
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,759
these are all the same genetics it's all

382
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,039
the same thing you've got the mother

383
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,120
plant the donor plant

384
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,480
and three clones now you've got an

385
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,759
option you can

386
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:10,399
put the clone dome under a 12 12 light

387
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:10,958
and those plants will show you sex in 7

388
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,519
10

389
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,359
12 maybe 14 days at the very latest

390
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,839
you've got little tiny clones in a clone

391
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
dome

392
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,279
they're going to start showing you sex

393
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,839
now you can say you got to label your

394
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,919
clones

395
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,000
you got plant a plant b plant c you got

396
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,078
to label your clones a b and c

397
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,440
now if clone a shows you that it's

398
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,278
female plant a

399
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,880
is a female if clone b shows you that

400
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:31,439
it's a male you got to get rid of that

401
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:32,879
clone

402
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
and unless you're breeding plan on

403
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,439
chucking some pollen making some seeds

404
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,039
get rid of plant number b also so that

405
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,760
is a quick way you can put that tray of

406
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:42,000
clones

407
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,958
directly under 1212 lighting and it will

408
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,600
let you know

409
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,679
what is a male and female in there or

410
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
another option you can let those clones

411
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,039
root

412
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,879
let them develop roots pot them into

413
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:54,719
some medium if you want to go right into

414
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:55,679
beer cups or your six inch net pots or

415
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,600
four inch

416
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:59,838
square pots or one gallon pots however

417
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
you want to do it pot those bad dogs by

418
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,120
this time your other plants are getting

419
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,079
bigger you've still got that donor plant

420
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,919
the mother plant

421
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,679
hanging out in the veg room you've still

422
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:09,599
got that bad [ __ ] it may need to be up

423
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,078
potted do a three or five gallon pot by

424
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,519
now

425
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,879
it's getting bushy it's giving you a

426
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,320
couple of clones you may need to clean

427
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:15,919
up the bottom of it by now

428
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,320
so you've got these bigger plants and

429
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,879
you've got clones you can let the clones

430
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,480
root

431
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,958
and then you've got two options at this

432
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,800
point you can put those clones into dirt

433
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:27,039
and put them under 12 12 and have a

434
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:27,919
small crop you can let them veg a little

435
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,879
longer put them

436
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,078
under 1212 and have a small crop or if

437
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:32,799
you're sure they're all going to live

438
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,799
you've got

439
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:36,479
one of plant a one of plant b one of

440
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:37,919
plants c one of all of your plants if

441
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,639
you did a ten pack of seeds you got all

442
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:40,479
10 of them

443
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,159
you got a clone of all 10 in the cloner

444
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,639
you got all 10 of these big plants over

445
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:44,639
here

446
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,639
that's when you can decide to move those

447
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,480
bigger plants into the flower room

448
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,560
and keep those clones back as your

449
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,680
mother plants or your genetic preserve

450
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,638
if that's what you want to call it

451
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,479
that's your

452
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,839
your new nursery those will become your

453
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,639
new mother plants

454
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,240
some people really like to have that

455
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
plant that came from seed

456
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,240
as their keeper mother plant they want

457
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,480
that original plant that's sprouted from

458
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,320
the seed as their keeper other people

459
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,560
don't mind keeping a clone of it

460
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,360
as the keeper i don't see a problem

461
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,799
either way

462
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,039
the way that i do it i'll tell you how i

463
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,759
do it i cut the top i put that top in

464
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,759
the cloner

465
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,200
as soon as i see roots on that bad [ __ ]

466
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,240
i move the other plants into the

467
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,360
flowering room

468
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,440
they're going to flower it's going to

469
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,240
take them about 12 to 14 days to kick

470
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
into flower

471
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,839
it'll take about the same amount of time

472
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,838
for my clones over here to make roots

473
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,760
so by the time they're in flower they're

474
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,680
kicking out flowers they're pre-flowers

475
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:35,600
these plants are ready to go into their

476
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,519
beer cups or six inch net pots

477
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,120
now i've got a copy of everything that i

478
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,399
just moved into the flower room i've got

479
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,078
a fresh copy of it

480
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,078
now i know what the males and females

481
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:46,239
are because in a few days

482
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,359
these big plants in about 12 14 days

483
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,959
these big plants are going to show me

484
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,560
what are males and females

485
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,599
i'll chop down those bigger plants

486
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:53,198
they're not as big as some people

487
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,800
that'll let them go by now but now

488
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,240
i'll chop down those big plants crowd

489
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,919
all the others together and then i'll

490
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,759
get rid of those cups but that is the

491
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:01,360
way i do it i put the bigger ones into

492
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,600
the flower room because they're already

493
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,560
bigger they're already ready already why

494
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,040
am i going to wait

495
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,278
i don't insist on having that rooted

496
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,759
seed plant as the mother i use a clone

497
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:13,198
i use that clone will go into the mother

498
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,439
room it'll get bigger

499
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,278
i'll cut clones from it and then guess

500
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,959
what it goes into the flower room just

501
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,639
generation after generation

502
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,719
of cutting clones into the flower room

503
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,440
so sexting the way that i do it let me

504
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,639
recap

505
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,079
i pop my seeds i grow them as soon as

506
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,879
they're big enough to get a clone

507
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,799
i get a clone i put that pot that plant

508
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,480
now goes into a three gallon pot

509
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,319
i've probably got 10 of them now i move

510
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,800
all 10 of those into the flower room

511
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
i have my thing my cloner filled with 10

512
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:41,039
clones

513
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,480
these start to flower these start to

514
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,480
root i will know

515
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,399
in about 10 to 14 days if these are

516
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,159
males or females i'll pull the males and

517
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,839
i'll pull the corresponding clones

518
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,919
now these are in flower and i've got

519
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,480
more plants that are working as mother

520
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:56,479
slash veg plants to keep my cycles going

521
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
i'm already in flower with one batch and

522
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,000
i've already set up for veg

523
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:01,838
and mother plants for the next batch

524
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,039
that is the way that i do sexting let me

525
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,800
check my notes

526
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,120
i went really quickly and i didn't look

527
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,240
at the notes very much

528
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,679
run the clone run the big plant deciding

529
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
so deciding which one you want to run

530
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,278
and what to keep is your strategy but i

531
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,199
just told you which one i do

532
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,879
i put the big one into flour because

533
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,679
it's already ready already we've been

534
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:21,039
vegging it

535
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,319
uh hopefully you've been taking care of

536
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:23,519
it for the whole time that the other

537
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,760
clones have been rooting

538
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,198
so that's the way that the if you are

539
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,879
waiting for those clones to root that's

540
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,479
what i want to touch on if you're not

541
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,399
really good at cloning if you're not

542
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,199
super successful with your clones

543
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,039
maybe wait until these clones make roots

544
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,399
before you move these other plants into

545
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,240
the flower room

546
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,000
if you do it too early you can take

547
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,600
clones from plants that are early in the

548
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,039
flower but i don't recommend it it makes

549
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,360
some things go wonky

550
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,278
but uh just wait just hold off don't

551
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,759
move these into flour until these have

552
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:51,759
roots

553
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,399
is a good part of the strategy but that

554
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,000
big plant is already vegged out so

555
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,720
generally i will move that into the

556
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,039
flowering room a lot of people do prefer

557
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,720
like i said to keep that original seeded

558
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,759
plant as the mother plant

559
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,440
however i don't find it necessary

560
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
as long as your clone cutting technique

561
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,440
and clone care is good you'll still have

562
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,279
those solid genetics forever

563
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,880
you'll be able to move that original

564
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,360
seed in there you got your clones

565
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,958
put that clone into a pot a pot that cut

566
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,560
clones from that

567
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,399
repeat that cycle that's how you get a

568
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,919
nice perpetual grow going

569
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,159
all right taking a look at the notes i

570
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,599
think i covered everything

571
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,919
yes all right we covered all of that

572
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,519
that is how i sex my plants early

573
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,278
the reason for doing this like i said

574
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,919
earlier so you don't end up with a plant

575
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:35,838
that you have

576
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,439
scrogged out and done a bunch of work to

577
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,199
it for weeks and weeks and weeks and

578
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,959
then you find out that you've got a male

579
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,958
if you've got a scrog you've got a scrog

580
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,479
net all filled up when you cut out that

581
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,319
one plant out of that net you've got a

582
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,600
whole bunch of empty wasted space

583
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,079
you could have just found out if you had

584
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,680
males or females maybe it does slow you

585
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,679
down a little bit maybe it is an extra

586
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,039
step but these extra steps are what set

587
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,799
us up for success

588
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,639
we have to do these extra steps keep in

589
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,359
mind i say this a lot when i talk about

590
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,919
pheno hunting and sexing

591
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,078
this isn't the last run with these

592
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,199
genetics this is the very first run we

593
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,438
are learning here

594
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,120
also hopefully this is not your last

595
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,720
crop you're just learning here we're

596
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,639
going to get to run these plants

597
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,838
again and again and again and the more

598
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
you run them the more you're going to

599
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,639
get more comfortable with them

600
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,160
what do you do what are you what's your

601
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,559
job where do you go what do you do all

602
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,558
day

603
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:24,318
what's your hobby what's something that

604
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,838
to some people what is something you do

605
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:26,318
that would probably scare the [ __ ] out

606
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,879
of them

607
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,000
i've grown cannabis for let's not even

608
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,760
talk about how many years i've been

609
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,759
doing that some of them may be illegal

610
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,839
i've also been playing the drums since i

611
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,038
was a teenager i'm about to turn 42

612
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,279
years old i think

613
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,319
i got drums for my 14th birthday you do

614
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:41,918
the math there

615
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,839
something i could be really comfortable

616
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,919
at if we were at a club

617
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:46,879
and a rock and roll band said hey our

618
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,160
drummer just

619
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,360
cannot play i'm not even going to kill

620
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,558
the drummer in my mind i said our

621
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,319
drummer

622
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:53,918
see my mouth won't even let me say it in

623
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:54,720
my mind i was going to say our drummer

624
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,000
just died

625
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,519
and then they're like we need a drummer

626
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,038
that could play i just put my hands up

627
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,240
and go you got sticks bro is there

628
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:02,400
sticks in a drum set

629
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,319
i can fill in for that a lot of people

630
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,759
would just completely [ __ ] their pants

631
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,279
they're not comfortable walking up on

632
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:08,400
stage and going i'll do this what songs

633
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:09,918
are we going to play kind of hum the

634
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,759
song at me and we'll play it

635
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,038
like i have no problem doing that that's

636
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,240
that's cool that's something i'm fine

637
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:15,759
with but a lot of people

638
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,359
i say go get up on that stage and play

639
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,038
the drums they just start [ __ ] they

640
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:19,759
start sweating they get shaky they get

641
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,919
nervous

642
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,079
that is where i shine so you will be

643
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,240
that way in the grow room over time

644
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,079
grow a few crops read a lot about your

645
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,919
plants kill a few plants you're gonna

646
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:31,199
have to [ __ ] up a few plants to learn

647
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,640
how do you know their limits how do you

648
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,240
know what they can and cannot take if

649
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,280
you don't push a few of them to their

650
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,640
limits so

651
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,160
uh get in there and do it and then

652
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,840
you'll get as comfortable as i am in the

653
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,440
grow the reason i'm so comfortable

654
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,599
is because i've been doing it every

655
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,160
single day for longer than i should

656
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,079
admit

657
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,600
i talked about earlier on a podcast with

658
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,079
mike on the previous episode

659
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,678
we had a dispensary in 2008 i was

660
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,599
growing on a commercial level

661
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,919
in 2007 and 2008. that's how many plants

662
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,279
crops run cycles that's how long i've

663
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,038
been doing this so that's why i'm so

664
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,119
comfortable and you'll get there too

665
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:05,440
just get in the grow learn read pay

666
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:07,599
attention take notes be passionate

667
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,960
be mindful and have purpose anything

668
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,798
you're doing in that garden

669
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,160
have purpose for what you're doing don't

670
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:13,918
do it because

671
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,759
don't do it because rasta jeff said so

672
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,200
don't do it because somebody else on the

673
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,798
internet said so don't do it because

674
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,160
your brother's uncle's cousin did it and

675
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,359
got good results

676
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,120
be mindful be thoughtful have a strategy

677
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,719
know why and what you're doing and think

678
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,439
about whatever you do today in the

679
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
garden

680
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,558
isn't going to you'll see it today if

681
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
you get in there and do some silly [ __ ]

682
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:33,599
you may see it today but really you're

683
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,720
not going to see results

684
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:39,279
think about the results in 3 5 7 10

685
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,319
14 21 30 days from now think about what

686
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,079
it's going to do

687
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,159
to the top and bottom of the plant how

688
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,319
will it affect the overall

689
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,840
performance of the entire crop not just

690
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,119
this one plant is it good for the whole

691
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,959
[ __ ] grow room

692
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,279
pay attention to things like that have a

693
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,480
lot of forethought have some strategery

694
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,160
when you're in there playing around in

695
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,519
the grow yeah when you top the plants

696
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,038
you're going to see that today

697
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,558
if you drop a light on it and crush a

698
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,480
plant you'll see that today

699
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,879
full your feed you may not notice that

700
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,079
until the lights come on tomorrow or the

701
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,159
next light cycle

702
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,599
if you over fed some weird nutrient if

703
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:11,520
you didn't ph properly

704
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,038
that's slowly going to progress over

705
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,400
time that's why we take a lot of notes

706
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:16,798
and pay a lot of attention

707
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,159
but think about all of the [ __ ] you do

708
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:20,079
to your plants today

709
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,000
you may not notice any outcome for two

710
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,000
to three days so if you're going to do

711
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
several things to the plants maybe space

712
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
those out by a few days

713
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,798
so that you know what is working and

714
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,520
what is not working have some sort of

715
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,839
control

716
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,359
have some standard operating procedures

717
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,480
some sort of strategy here

718
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:35,759
that's what i'm talking about all right

719
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,120
i've got one more thing i want to talk

720
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,599
about before we start wrapping up this

721
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,879
podcast i did get quite chatty today

722
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,439
where are we going to go oh this

723
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:47,039
question is can i keep a femme

724
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,320
seed as a mother plant um yes the quick

725
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,400
answer to that is

726
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,158
yes i see that on the internet a lot

727
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,480
people are talking about feminized seeds

728
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,960
being

729
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,279
inferior to regular seeds people talk

730
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,798
about they are prone to hermaphroditism

731
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,639
that you can't keep them as a mother

732
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,158
plant my question is

733
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:06,960
why couldn't you keep a feminized seed

734
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,080
as a mother plant it grows just like a

735
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,720
regular seed

736
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:11,918
other than that plant not containing

737
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,480
that seed never hit

738
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,159
that seed that female plant never got

739
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,679
any male pollen there no male

740
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,480
chromosomes other than that male

741
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,038
chromosome

742
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,519
there's no difference uh than any other

743
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,000
seed

744
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,119
any other plant it's a female plant it's

745
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,400
a cannabis plant

746
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:31,599
a lot of my uh great crosses are made

747
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,679
from feminized seeds so you can

748
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,519
keep a mother plant of a femme seed and

749
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,280
the next question is can you breed with

750
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,599
the feminized mother plant

751
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,720
absolutely you can let's talk about

752
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,959
morning dew

753
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,360
morning dew the grateful dog was a

754
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,759
feminized seed i made a feminized plant

755
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:50,479
it was the grateful dog that grateful

756
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,558
dog gets pollinated by an arise male

757
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,519
the seeds that come from that are

758
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,200
morning dew

759
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:59,440
regular seeds that grateful dog plant

760
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,200
is kept as a mother plant i've got to

761
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,798
keep it perpetually if i want to cross

762
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,279
to it i've got a few things that i cross

763
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,440
to it

764
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,279
so it's got to stick around so i do keep

765
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,880
a mother it is a feminized seed

766
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:10,480
and i keep a mother of it constantly

767
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,440
that is one that is always in the garden

768
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,759
it's been there

769
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,960
uh since the uh we're not even going to

770
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,038
say how long that's been around

771
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,120
probably 2008-ish i think that's been in

772
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,640
the garden 2008 2009

773
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,158
that one's been around for quite a while

774
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,480
that exact version of it

775
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,400
um so yes you can keep a feminized seed

776
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,000
as a mother planet is no different than

777
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,038
all of your other plants

778
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,599
the only difference is it was a

779
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,000
feminized seed once it grows it is the

780
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,558
same

781
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,720
exact thing if it was done correctly

782
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,240
it's it works just like any other plant

783
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,720
the next part of that question was can i

784
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:46,240
breed to that feminized mother plant

785
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,200
yes absolutely um morning dew comes from

786
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,919
a feminized

787
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,159
female plant uh lemon sunrise comes

788
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,000
lemon jeffrey is feminized seeds right

789
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,159
lemon jeff is only available in femme

790
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,679
seeds because the golden goat is only

791
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,200
clone only so there's no male so i've

792
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,919
got to reverse it to make the lemon

793
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
jeffree

794
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,038
so lemon jeffree is only available in

795
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,038
femme seeds

796
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:06,960
you guys have noticed that i make lemon

797
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,839
sunrise regular seeds

798
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,600
that is the arise to the lemon jeffree

799
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,759
so that is a breeding project

800
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,959
of a feminized plant that is pollinated

801
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,759
by a regular male

802
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,558
and it just makes regular male female

803
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:21,440
seeds so

804
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:22,319
to wrap that up you absolutely can keep

805
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,038
a female

806
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:27,599
a feminized plant as a mother and you

807
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:30,558
can absolutely breed and outbreed

808
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,319
two feminized plants all right you guys

809
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,519
i think that was about 30 minutes i want

810
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:33,918
