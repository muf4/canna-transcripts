an outdoors role expert he's been on the

00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:11,409
show several times if people listen he

72
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,719
knows a lot about outdoor growing I know

73
00:03:11,409 --> 00:03:16,569
a lot about indoor growing so we had

74
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,849
some outdoor questions Jesse wants to

75
00:03:16,569 --> 00:03:21,939
talk a little bit about the differences

76
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:24,639
in small like basement cultivation

77
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:26,919
compared to large commercial grow so

78
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:29,409
we'll get into that also but let's talk

79
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:31,299
about an email I got I got an email from

80
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,349
a listener I don't have the email on my

81
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,880
phone right now I just set the phone

82
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:35,949
aside today a shout out to the guy that

83
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:38,500
sent me an email he asked when he's

84
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:41,679
growing outdoors how big of a hole does

85
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,360
he want a big to put his plant uh I told

86
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,950
him through an email I told him to

87
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,510
listen to show and I'd have Jesse on for

88
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:49,209
more info but I told him basically make

89
00:03:46,509 --> 00:03:50,560
the hole big as you can what else can

90
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,819
you tell us about that Jesse

91
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,900
I personally over the years I've noticed

92
00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,340
a fence somewhat limited especially when

93
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,120
it's in the ground by the size of its

94
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,310
container

95
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,430
and even emailing the grounds each

96
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:11,430
container but your hole has a premix oil

97
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,620
in it the shoulders of the plants aren't

98
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:14,909
going to go too far past the edge of

99
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,370
that hole

100
00:04:14,908 --> 00:04:20,370
I started off with two by two bowls and

101
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:24,780
worked up to three by three bowls and I

102
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:26,459
do 4x4 goes probably keep going some day

103
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:29,038
five by five when you're doing these

104
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,469
four by four old isn't a four by four

105
00:04:29,038 --> 00:04:34,439
square right yes four feet wide four

106
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:38,100
feet long just how deep are you going 18

107
00:04:34,439 --> 00:04:39,689
inches it used to go deeper I've learned

108
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,479
a little bit more about music since - a

109
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:44,279
cannabis am I right in thinking that

110
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,829
cannabis wants to reach outward instead

111
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:48,179
of downward for the most part okay

112
00:04:46,829 --> 00:04:50,219
I mean it does like to go down

113
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,639
especially for going to get the

114
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,120
temperature oh yeah go go go go hard

115
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,819
extraordinary

116
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,379
[Music]

117
00:04:55,819 --> 00:05:01,939
but for the most part clumps you know

118
00:04:59,379 --> 00:05:06,529
we're gonna reach a lenders to the sides

119
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:09,350
and stick a note on that' free by screen

120
00:05:06,529 --> 00:05:11,000
by 18 inch three foot by three foot

121
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,090
holes that's 18 inches deep

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,500
is $99 of dirt that is a lot of hand

123
00:05:14,089 --> 00:05:20,179
dirt see how many cubic feet that is

124
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,259
well we'd have to do the math on the

125
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:28,629
size of the hole that you just said

126
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:31,430
right is one of those Fox farm bags is

127
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:38,949
1.75 cubic feet how many of those bags

128
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:40,930
you think you could take a cube okay

129
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:48,729
this is how gorillas think in math you

130
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:51,040
guys alright that's that's a lot of root

131
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,840
space yeah how big are these plants that

132
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:56,050
in your example how big are your plants

133
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:58,029
at the end of the season four or five

134
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,460
foot around I mean all the way around

135
00:05:58,029 --> 00:06:04,959
you know not just through one spot yeah

136
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:10,029
so you can't hug your plants you can't

137
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:11,799
go around yeah oh hell no okay they do I

138
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:13,089
kind of limit my plants they can only

139
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,480
get about six foot tall

140
00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:19,569
if that if I was able to let them get

141
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,960
bigger they'd probably end up eight nine

142
00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:22,659
foot tall

143
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:25,930
okay so you limited my privacy yes

144
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,939
that's a [ __ ] yes you do such a great

145
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,590
outdoor grill any you as a [ __ ]

146
00:06:27,939 --> 00:06:31,569
um I used to fight it real hard to keep

147
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:34,389
them down I have learned a new trick

148
00:06:31,569 --> 00:06:36,189
just plant later plant later huh yeah is

149
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:38,050
that the new trick yeah super high-tech

150
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:40,000
yeah yeah you don't have to bend him as

151
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:45,250
much at the top as much just take them

152
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,019
out later she's lazy tech so uh when

153
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:48,459
what are we are we in the flowering

154
00:06:47,019 --> 00:06:51,729
phase officially yet or do we still have

155
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:53,889
a few days to go I feel like we've still

156
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,660
got a week or so to go okay so in about

157
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:57,459
a week here in Colorado and we were

158
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,200
doing research before the show from

159
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,649
coast to coast there's only about a

160
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,909
half-hour in sunlight photoperiod in

161
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,279
natural photo period right now we're

162
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:10,030
talking about it jesse was doing the

163
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:12,219
research in in difference between what I

164
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,709
was finding it was like New York the Sun

165
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,080
was coming up at 5:30 9:00 in the

166
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:20,649
morning and in Los Angeles it was coming

167
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:23,219
up at like 608 or some [ __ ] so that's

168
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:23,219
odd

169
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:33,069
but yeah so but of photoperiod you know

170
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:36,040
it's it's gonna start really shrinking

171
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,209
from here on out and you know the first

172
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,340
you're gonna get your indica varieties

173
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:41,620
into flower and then you're more sativa

174
00:07:39,339 --> 00:07:43,719
varieties will follow along behind yeah

175
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:46,149
your flow and blueberry those are really

176
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,040
gonna start taking off right flow so

177
00:07:46,149 --> 00:07:49,629
yeah when in Colorado the gross blow

178
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,420

192
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:19,860
dabs for a brief second I was dunking my

193
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:23,699
dabber into ninety percent THC this is

194
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,189
91% THC it's distillate from our friends

195
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,199
at Evo lab and then I take the 90%

196
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:31,589
distillate that's on my dabber and i

197
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,049

Ellis hash and I rolled out a little

218
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:20,519
piece into a taco shell and I put some

219
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,440
what did I have it was a cactus cooler a

220
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,939
live resin on top of that I smeared that

221
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,040
on like taco sauce and then I took a

222

piece of Durbin hoisin Durbin poison

223
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,559

224
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:31,290
snake and put that in the middle like

225

the dabber into the ninety percent THC

227
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:38,279
distillate and had bad on the dabber and

228
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:40,350
then I picked up the taco with the

229
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:43,110
dabber and dunked of that into the ghost

230

train Hayes Terps

231
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:55,710
I was blast-off I was yeah my I put a

232
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:57,420
little th was making funny faces and

233
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:02,550
funny noises I was really high for a

234
00:09:57,419 --> 00:10:04,110
little while my first turf dab buy arms

235
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:07,109
and legs went

236
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:08,820
very pleasantly numb late almost

237
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:11,310
immediately yeah there's something about

238
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,430
smoking just raw Terps yeah that's I

239
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:17,159
immediately I was like damn there's this

240
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:19,500
is medicine there for someone someone

241
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,110
here for me it's great recreation but

242
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,120
someone somewhere that's that's

243
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,470
something I I like to take just the

244
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,360
normal shatter I've got I've got this

245
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,680
Durbin poison mob-boss shatter and I

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,570
just take little chunks of that and dunk

247
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:34,769
that into the OG Kush babs and it makes

248
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:37,079
it taste so amazing right it's been a

249
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:38,820
while when this is gone I don't know if

250
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:40,289
I'm gonna be able to properly get high

251
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:42,060
anymore because I've been smoking this

252
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:44,578
distillate and these Terps so heavily

253
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,838
bit my tolerance game is up to itself

254
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:47,429
when I go smoke with other people

255
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,450
they're just like dude what the [ __ ] is

256
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:50,389
wrong with you and I'm like don't you

257
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:55,050
want more dabs and there in the corner

258
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:58,528
come on let's party um one more quick

259
00:10:55,049 --> 00:11:00,509
question on that come on pink the Terps

260
00:10:58,528 --> 00:11:02,759
I mean I think I already know the answer

261
00:11:00,509 --> 00:11:06,028
to this but I'll just ask dude do the

262
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:07,620
Terps complete if you dip it in just

263
00:11:06,028 --> 00:11:10,078
like a normal shatter do the Terps

264
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,810
complete something there or make it more

265
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:14,699
powerful in opinion it pushes it yeah it

266
00:11:12,809 --> 00:11:16,289
pushes the high a little bit higher it

267
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:19,500
certainly pushes the high up

268
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:22,078
I think the my theory it's probably not

269
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,328
such a theory but the terpenoids

270
00:11:22,078 --> 00:11:27,838
work along with the cannabinoids just

271
00:11:24,328 --> 00:11:29,729
like the the entourage effect absolutely

272
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,740
absolutely

273
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:35,159
the terpenoids that we're using guys

274
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:37,799
that looks just like it looks like pee

275
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:40,169
it's just a little yeah drops a gold in

276
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:42,528
a vial it's got the consistency of like

277
00:11:40,169 --> 00:11:45,120
a really high-grade

278
00:11:42,528 --> 00:11:46,620
like a machine oil or something okay

279
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,509
yeah yeah it's gonna say really runny

280
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,730
olive oil a little little runny er than

281
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:51,958
olive oil maybe and you just dunk the

282
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,579
dab right into it is what i've been

283
00:11:51,958 --> 00:11:55,948
doing i've been putting a dab on the

284
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:57,439
dabber and just dunk it and i did i

285
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:59,189
don't get too hard one time i just

286
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,839
dunked it in then gave it a little

287
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,829
swizzle and when it hit the veil I heard

288
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:08,100
that the Terps could like sizzled and I

289
00:12:04,828 --> 00:12:09,719
had turf face like my mouth just tasted

290
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,519
like ghost train Hayes forever

291
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,829
it was almost unpleasant it was like I

292
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,250
Oh deed my face on turps but then I was

293

a Rockette hi

294
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:20,019
that's something else and it kind of you

295
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:22,929
can almost wash away the flavor with

296
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:24,429
with too like it's so overwhelming you

297
00:12:22,929 --> 00:12:26,439
don't even get it you just burn yeah you

298
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,059
do maximum overload your mouth and it's

299
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,550
like I can't taste anything cuz you just

300
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:32,049
ruin my palate yeah it's like we need

301
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,539
something too spicy for the next hour

302
00:12:32,049 --> 00:12:35,740

much root space with a bunch of rock and

328
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:36,850
perlite so figure out your makes an

329
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:39,250
outdoor soil doesn't need to be as

330
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:44,649
area's indoor soil especially in the

331
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:47,679
ground so you can do yourself a great

332
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:49,688
disservice by putting too much perlite

333
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,849
in there it's just it's gonna increase

334
00:13:49,688 --> 00:13:53,649
the frequency of half of the water okay

335
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:56,019
so let's see that's why you're the

336
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:57,909
outdoor pro and I'm the indoor all right

movie bro I also love picking on you

355
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:37,909
look you're doing well so Fred sent us a

356
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:40,309
message while back he was making seeded

357
00:14:37,909 --> 00:14:41,929
plants he had pollen he put pollen on

358
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:44,088
female plants those plants have now been

359
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:46,208
pollinated they're forming seeds he put

360
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:48,470
them outdoors

361
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:50,299
he had many questions about putting

362
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,879
putting them outdoors about acclimating

363
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:56,149
them to the outdoor area and how to get

364
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:57,980
this timer right once I message Jessi

365
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:00,078
about this Jessi had a great idea

366
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,120
Jessi said that once you once those

367
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,399
plants are pollinated if you go put them

368
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,709
outside and the light cycles a little

369
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,028
bit off they're not going to her because

370
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:11,539
they're already pollinated they've

371
00:15:08,028 --> 00:15:13,039
pretty much passed there I guess if they

372
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:14,719
were humans now they would be in

373
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:16,309
menopause if they were females and now

374
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,350
they can't there pass to that cycle

375
00:15:16,309 --> 00:15:19,578
their whole sexual reproductive thing is

376
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:22,070
done they've already decided they're

377
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:25,909
making seeds they they have a manifest

378
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,990
destiny to complete yes and if the girls

379
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,000
pregnant you can't already get her

380
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:31,009
pregnant you can't really like so that

381
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,049
that's those plants that we told Fred to

382
00:15:31,009 --> 00:15:34,789
put outside should be 100% legit he also

383
00:15:33,049 --> 00:15:37,208

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,170
outdoors they're not gonna hermaphrodite

414
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:52,610
on him I do not believe so he's gonna

415
00:16:51,169 --> 00:16:54,740
have viable seeds if he waits long

416
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:55,940
enough yep yep I think he was he

417
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,009
actually pulled some of those seeds I

418
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,620
think I think he's got some of those a

419
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:02,330
lot of them were white but plenty of

420
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,799
them were viable and tiger stripes so

421
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:05,840
it's good work bro do you know what the

422
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:07,579
cross was I count I really don't

423
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,169
remember I don't remember honestly I

424
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,559
read so many emails and read so many

425
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,910
crosses that a lot of that share a lot

426
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,200
of the crosses in the green and healthy

427
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,700
wellness garden I can't remember what

428
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,590
they are off the top of my head I'm the

429
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,910
same way yeah I learned a few you know

430
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,319
what I mean as I go I'm like that one's

431
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,990
this one I remember that now and I just

432
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,299
absorbed those slowly alright so he's

433
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,430
got a splint outdoors they've got seeds

434
00:17:26,299 --> 00:17:31,430
in him and since then his [ __ ] got

435
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,779
attacked by spider mites and he asked is

436
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:34,370
I don't have his email in front of me

437
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,809
but basically he said none of this plant

438
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:37,789
material is going to be consumed or

439
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:41,240
smoked by people since it's all just

440
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:47,269
seeded how nuclear can I go to spray the

441
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:49,640
[ __ ] out of it for these spider mites my

442
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:53,329
opinion would be as nuclear as he is

443
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:55,970
comfortable that's what I told him I

444
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:57,439
told him keep in mind his health while

445
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:58,700
he's applying pesticides and keep in

446
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,080
mind the health of the rest of his

447
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:01,610
garden cuz I know he's got other

448
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,149
cannabis plants out there and the

449
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:06,949
insects in that garden absolutely the

450
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:07,700
diversity of that area yeah be be aware

451
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,819
of that

452
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,049
bees oh don't kill the bees that's super

453
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:13,339
important if the bees zone away

454
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,200
everything goes away we don't have food

455
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:16,970
if we don't have bees I saw my dad's

456
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,529
neighbor spray and roundup in his yard

457
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:21,110

sorry

462
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,729

463
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,259
and vinegar there you go go organic yeah

465
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:36,819
insect its you don't want around yeah

466

spoons of Epsom salt per gallon can I

468
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:43,899
ask you about how to get rid of [ __ ]

469
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:46,839
grasshoppers right now in a ganja garden

470
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:48,969
outdoors yeah that is a very popular

471
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:53,230

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,409
and none of them knowing the way they

477
00:19:06,369 --> 00:19:11,500
work and how grasshoppers work I felt

478
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:13,629
really weren't necessary I didn't I

479
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,038

480
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:18,548
grasshoppers with it or you may

481

more problems in the beginning stages

504
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:20,048

the chick is gonna use it a shade and it

508
00:20:25,148 --> 00:20:29,199
really isn't gonna notice it too much it

509
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:31,960
might pick it the understory a little

510
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:39,580
bit okay I clean it up for it yeah it

511

yeah shout-out to the Terps at one other

522
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,058
comment on grasshoppers I'm hippie

523
00:21:14,788 --> 00:21:19,440
dippie when it comes to growing outdoors

524
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:22,109
as soon as I hear about a grasshopper

525
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,230
problem I feel like something's out of

526
00:21:22,109 --> 00:21:26,939
balance so instead of killing the

527
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:29,249
grasshopper you might want to look at

528
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,259
the bigger picture and it's always

529
00:21:29,249 --> 00:21:33,929
seeing something's missing there since

530
00:21:31,259 --> 00:21:36,149
you're doing something wrong so I'm

531
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:38,249
gonna say that's like 75% of the time

532
00:21:36,148 --> 00:21:40,349
that is okay sure it really I feel like

533
00:21:38,249 --> 00:21:41,909
this applies to smaller girls like those

534
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,668
guys out on Thailand Road where they've

535
00:21:41,909 --> 00:21:47,249
got four acres planted in the ground I

536
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:49,230
mean that's a completely different

537
00:21:47,249 --> 00:21:51,509
scenario they're gonna have those issues

538
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:53,278
regardless that is a lot of damn

539
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:55,980

552
00:22:23,069 --> 00:22:27,269
technical term for these restaurants

553
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,220
fast casual I think more fast casual

554
00:22:27,269 --> 00:22:30,839
restaurants because that's what the grow

555
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,308
industry and people like us that's what

556
00:22:30,839 --> 00:22:37,138
we crave we don't want the Taco Bell the

557

though you know Qdoba and Chipotle

565
00:22:51,569 --> 00:22:53,839

567
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,778
pretty much the options the beans at

about if you know the spell are good or

575
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:18,859
if you can tell good beans based on

576
00:23:14,599 --> 00:23:21,798
smell alone my favorite earthy smell to

577
00:23:18,859 --> 00:23:23,569
them and not too salty you all right but

578
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:25,609

583
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:39,740
Tokyo Joe's we could go for that kind of

584

those are the best all right let's put

601
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,200
this trainwreck back on I'm on some

602
00:24:16,278 --> 00:24:20,119
rails here let's talk about cannabis

603
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:24,169
growing this is not the Colorado podcast

604
00:24:20,119 --> 00:24:25,519
we did not bring 44 sandwiches Sam who

605
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:27,740
couldn't break 44 he's not allowed to go

606
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:31,308
anywhere yep this is the exclusion zone

607
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:33,740
when is that done who knows who knows

608
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:35,690
poor dude we missed you bro can't wait

609
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:37,220
ain't come on play again so Jessie

610
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:38,690
wanted to talk about something that I

611
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,159
find to be really important that people

612
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:42,320
don't realize people want to jump into

613
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,820
the cannabis industry people move from

614
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,129
all over the country to Colorado to

615
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:47,658
Washington to California to Oregon to

616
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:49,460
Michigan to all these places that where

617
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:51,860
cannabis growing is legal and they show

618
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,329
up here and they've either grown in

619
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,379
their basement in an illegal state for a

620
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:56,298
couple of years and had two or three

621
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,770
lights or they set up a small grow here

622
00:24:56,298 --> 00:25:00,109
in their garage or their basement they

623
00:24:57,769 --> 00:25:02,480
run four or six lights and then they

624
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:04,129
think I'm gonna open a big-ass grow and

625
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,960
they're either gonna do it legally or

626
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:07,700
illegally they're gonna get permits or

627
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,929
not or maybe they're just gonna do

628
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,370
in an illegal place they've been grown

629
00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:12,169
in their basement for a while they're

630
00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:13,638
out there in the sticks in Nebraska and

631
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:15,019
I [ __ ] we're gonna buy that old meat

632
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,879
plant we're gonna hang us up a hundred

633
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:19,278
bucks and maybe they do it you know what

634
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,559
I mean so the mistake that a lot of

635
00:25:19,278 --> 00:25:23,630
these people [ __ ] up is they don't

636
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,509
realize it going from the basement to a

637
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:28,039
large grow facility it's not just taking

638
00:25:26,509 --> 00:25:29,808
this much air conditioning and

639
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:31,519
multiplying at times however more many

640
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:34,190
lights you're gonna work it doesn't work

641
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,929
that way you run into a whole new [ __ ]

642
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:38,230
stew of problems when you start going to

643
00:25:35,929 --> 00:25:40,399
big scale growing the humidity is

644
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:41,630
ridiculously hard to control in a large

645
00:25:40,398 --> 00:25:45,109
room retardedly

646
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:47,330
yeah ridiculously you can you can say

647
00:25:45,109 --> 00:25:53,509
that word oh yeah it bugs me a little

648
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:55,069
bit everyone's evolving yeah it's hard

649
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:56,869
as [ __ ] to remove a lot of humidity in a

650
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:58,819
very large room it's also hard to

651
00:25:56,869 --> 00:26:01,339
regulate the temperature and the airflow

652
00:25:58,819 --> 00:26:04,548
and the co2 so there's a lot of tricks

653
00:26:01,339 --> 00:26:06,288
to it what's the biggest mistake you see

654
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:08,329
people make when they go from what a

655
00:26:06,288 --> 00:26:11,179
dude goes and just builds his first big

656
00:26:08,329 --> 00:26:12,379
when new people get their OPC license

657
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:12,950
and they can build a grow where do they

658
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,490
[ __ ] up

659
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,899
air conditioning always air-conditioner

660
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,298
humidity never even gets considered cuz

661
00:26:17,898 --> 00:26:22,069
yeah they think this is the desert I

662
00:26:20,298 --> 00:26:23,359
mean it is the desert but they think

663
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:25,369
it's not gonna be an issue because it's

664
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,990
so dry here right that's a bunch of BS

665
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:28,969
you're gonna go pumping water into those

666
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,888
plants every single day and they

667
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:32,659
transpire and there are a thousand watt

668
00:26:30,888 --> 00:26:34,699
lights a bunch of them right above those

669
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:36,528
plants and the water wants to come out

670
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:38,028
and go up toward those lights and then

671
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:40,429
it hangs out up by the ceiling and then

672
00:26:38,028 --> 00:26:42,109
it falls back down and then it hangs out

673
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:43,820
and it gets between two leaves and it

674
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:46,009
festers for a couple of days and then

675
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:48,950
you know what it does it turns into

676
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:51,829
[ __ ] powdery mildew yep so the spores

677
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:53,690
are there flower yep it's just waiting

678
00:26:51,829 --> 00:26:55,849
for you to give it a prime tradition

679
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:59,690
yeah that whole grow room is the perfect

680
00:26:55,849 --> 00:27:02,028
condition for bugs and [ __ ] fungus is

681
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:03,798
and problems so you've air conditioning

682
00:27:02,028 --> 00:27:05,450
in the humidity are always definitely

683
00:27:03,798 --> 00:27:08,658
the first thing that I think of yeah

684
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,880
it's a big-girl room is a it's a living

685
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:13,460
organism that is full of lots of other

686
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,370
smaller lady living organisms

687
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:18,829
it was me explaining it to a buddy this

688
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:21,919
way earlier today and it itself has

689
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:24,730
special care that needs done to it right

690
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,680
not just the plants inside of it it's

691
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:29,870
there's a lot to it

692
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:32,240
we've got 85 lights in the flower room

693
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:36,289
at green and healthy damn and we run if

694
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,410
D it's 50 tons we've got a 30 in the

695
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:41,089
middle and two tens on opposite sides 50

696
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:42,769
tons of air conditioning to cool that

697
00:27:41,089 --> 00:27:44,809
you get three years see that's smart

698
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:48,769
three air conditioners right yeah one

699
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:50,809
goes down in kind if the 30 goes down he

700
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:52,309
gets warm I bet it does but luckily

701
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:55,279
we're running kavita's with the Gavita

702
00:27:52,309 --> 00:27:56,779
master controller see gets above 86 in

703
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:01,399
here I want you to dim the lights until

704
00:27:56,779 --> 00:28:03,440
it gets back yeah that Gavita master

705
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,550
controller is awesome nice we have to

706
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,470
run two of them because we have so many

707
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,789
lights yeah but I mean they're so easy

708
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:09,799
to program that it doesn't even matter

709
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:13,339
there are 50 lights each part that I

710
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:15,500
think they'd only do 40 they have to do

711
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:20,299
50 because we're running 85 lights yeah

712
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:22,789
so yeah the nanos do 199 each nice

713
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:25,279
that's but see what it sucks about that

714
00:28:22,789 --> 00:28:26,829
is you still might have to buy multiple

715
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,809
units if they're in different rooms

716
00:28:26,829 --> 00:28:33,409
break them into zones right right yeah

717
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:37,009
luckily our room is 185 light big giant

718
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:39,140
open room with like six rows right now

719
00:28:37,009 --> 00:28:42,019
big shot it's my friends at veg bloom if

720
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,790
you are growing on a small scale a

721
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,889
medium scale or a large scale and you

722
00:28:43,789 --> 00:28:48,490
want nutrients to push your garden and

723
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:51,320
you want to see what you can really do

724
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:53,029
[ __ ] veg bloom is something I would

725
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:56,990
recommend it's affordable it's easy to

726
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:58,970
use and so far I'm six seven weeks in

727
00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:00,259
and this is the best girl I've done at

728
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,100
the green and healthy wellness garden

729
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:06,619
and there's a run right next to it

730
00:29:03,099 --> 00:29:09,019
that was not veg bloom and I've already

731
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:11,419
I've already passed the size of those

732
00:29:09,019 --> 00:29:12,829
buds they're being harvested at week

733
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,300
nine and these other buds or a week

734
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:16,189
seven and they're already bigger than

735
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,839
the week nine buds so I support

736
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:22,620
vegetable you're gonna do three like

737
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:24,359
this one that would be awesome yeah

738
00:29:22,619 --> 00:29:26,369
the only place he could go from your

739
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:27,859
last performance right yeah last time we

740
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:29,759
crushed it we did pretty damn well

741
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:31,769
shut up to the boys at Green &amp; Healthy

742
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,210
Wellness and the whole turf jungle for

743
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:36,569
helping me I appreciate it

744
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:37,860
you can shout out to the new guy so not

745
00:29:36,569 --> 00:29:39,928
enough air conditioning and then nobody

746
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,329
considers getting rid of the humidity no

747
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:44,038
there needs to be an exit for all of the

748
00:29:42,329 --> 00:29:45,599
moisture that comes into the room you

749
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:47,400
might be filling the room with co2 cool

750
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:48,899
but where is all of that old stagnant

751
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,880
air going that's in there you need to

752
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,080
get rid of that [ __ ] you don't want to

753
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,140
be in there if you walk into the grow

754
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,369
room and it feels funky to you it feels

755
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,890
funky to the plants you should be able

756
00:29:56,369 --> 00:30:00,479
to close your eyes and breathe and not

757
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:02,700
notice that you've walked into aggro

758
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,880
yeah it should just feel like normal

759
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:10,590
like this living room right here it's a

760
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:14,880
little funky but it was like 90

761
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:17,278
something degrees today man um things

762
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,260
I've noticed uh humid like we were

763
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,140
talking earlier foliar spraying you know

764
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:25,500
how even just watering brewing a damn

765
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:28,309
tea you know brewing 200 gallons of tea

766
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,778
can spike the humidity in oh yeah it's

767
00:30:28,308 --> 00:30:31,859
200 gallons into you too close to the

768
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:34,440
whites and it just starts evaporating

769
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:35,819
you hooked up the tea's little bat all

770
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,548
that moisture in the room carries heat

771
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:40,349
heats up the room as well you go through

772
00:30:38,548 --> 00:30:41,548
the hot and cold cycles naturally

773
00:30:40,349 --> 00:30:44,069
through the day at the building getting

774
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:47,009
heated up and I mean most of these grows

775
00:30:44,069 --> 00:30:50,069
are in fairly thin shield commercial

776
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:53,129
warehouses that aren't insulated as well

777
00:30:50,069 --> 00:30:56,099
as it could be and you know so you get

778
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,720
the heating and cooling effect from you

779
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,119
know just the natural outside

780
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,460
temperature we had to build a concrete

781
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:04,019
wall on the outside we defer it as I

782
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,179
think the the construction term we had

783
00:31:04,019 --> 00:31:08,398
the furrow wall out six inches with

784
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:10,019
concrete to kind of insulate ourselves a

785
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,668
little bit well I'm glad to hear that

786
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:13,859
you're not the only heard that I'm not

787
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:18,288
the only person that might have to do

788
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:21,449
this are the east wall of our facility

789
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:25,679
right about or no the west wall I got

790
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:28,048
the west wall of the facility the way it

791
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,419
all sits as the Sun starts going down it

792
00:31:28,048 --> 00:31:33,869
just makes it yeah and the wall goes you

793
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:35,910
know from being in the 70s all the way

794
00:31:33,869 --> 00:31:37,500
up into it's radiating heat

795
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:39,570
I can feel you can see those waves

796
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,430
coming off and you go outside yeah ours

797
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:44,250
was the exact opposite when the winter

798
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:46,590
came it got so cold on that wall that we

799
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:51,859
could see moisture on the inside okay

800
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:51,859
yeah yeah do that

801
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:56,370
then you'll get a PM issue because

802
00:31:55,019 --> 00:31:58,019
you're introducing moisture right there

803
00:31:56,369 --> 00:32:01,829
that temperature fluctuation near that

804
00:31:58,019 --> 00:32:03,900
wall everything the hard way oh yeah no

805
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:06,659
I wouldn't have it any other you should

806
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,790
have seen the guys that did the concrete

807
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:10,350
over the front of the building there

808
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:12,690
were three dudes that didn't speak much

809
00:32:10,349 --> 00:32:14,819
English and they showed up in a truck

810
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:17,850
with a truck a wheelbarrow a whole bunch

811
00:32:14,819 --> 00:32:19,950
of cement and some janky scaffolding oh

812
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:21,389
yeah two dudes carry the scaffolding to

813
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:22,740
where they needed to be and they just

814
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:26,400
pointed and grunted a couple times right

815
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,200
here yeah they set up the first level

816
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,820
and then one dude climbed that and they

817
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,380
threw parts to him while he was standing

818
00:32:29,819 --> 00:32:33,569
on the scaffolding and he stuck him in

819
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,610
place and then climbed up that and hung

820
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:38,579
and grabbed other [ __ ] and built like a

821
00:32:35,609 --> 00:32:40,049
four-story by himself climbed up and

822
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:43,500
down and like a spider monkey scared the

823
00:32:40,049 --> 00:32:45,269
[ __ ] out of me so they start the cement

824
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,710
from the top and let it run down kinda

825
00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:49,259
and he's up on the top of the

826
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:50,579
scaffolding and heels oh no and the guy

827
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:51,900
on the bottoms mixing cement in a

828
00:32:50,579 --> 00:32:53,879
wheelbarrow with those little trowel

829
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:56,220
things in his hand and he puts a pile on

830
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,620
the thing and he doesn't throw the tool

831
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:00,180
but he throws the concrete just Chuck's

832
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:02,309
it up into the air between the

833
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:06,390
scaffolding and the dude up top puts his

834
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:09,899
trial down doesn't even look like

835
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:11,490
Daniels left right and then heals dose

836
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,170
and the guy throws two of them up and he

837
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,549
puts both of his little tools down and

838
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:15,000
catches both of them and smears it on

839
00:33:14,549 --> 00:33:16,440
the wall

840
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,750
and he's running left and right and

841
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,009
shilling uno dos as he gets to the

842
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,809
middle and the guy throws how many he

843
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:24,089
needs and he just [ __ ] smear there

844
00:33:21,809 --> 00:33:25,799
and as it's coming down he goes to the

845
00:33:24,089 --> 00:33:27,809
top and pushes it down and then jumps to

846
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:28,919
the next level and repeats and then they

847
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:30,539
got her all done and went back and

848
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:32,910
smooth it out it took these three dudes

849
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:34,859
seriously two hours to do the entire

850
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:37,200
front of this [ __ ] building amazing

851
00:33:34,859 --> 00:33:41,399
yeah I would hire those guys for [ __ ]

852
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,809
anything that's our so [ __ ] you Trump

853
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,000
yeah

854
00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:46,349
a hard-working [ __ ] I mean do

855
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,740
you know my background I worked in the

856
00:33:46,349 --> 00:33:51,788
construction industry for

857
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:53,079
over a decade and there's a reason why

858
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:54,700
there's not that many white guys

859
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:57,339
employed in the construction industry

860
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:59,860
anymore yeah so yeah yeah take that

861
00:33:57,339 --> 00:34:01,689
Trump yeah [ __ ] you Trump I have no

862
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:03,009
problem with hiring some illegals come

863
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,450
to you some construction work they do

864
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:06,038
this [ __ ] that white people think

865
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:07,569
they're too good to do that's the truth

866
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:08,679
[ __ ] yeah you couldn't pay me enough to

867
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:09,878
do some of the [ __ ] that some of those

868
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,500
guys would do just to make enough money

869
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:12,819
to send home to their family yeah and

870
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,889
that's why I have no problem with that

871
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,080
do you asphalt and black tar Roofing I

872
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:20,710
do draw the line there without a doubt

873
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:24,608
yeah I'm [ __ ] white is this paper you

874
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:26,889
don't want me on a roof no honestly any

875
00:34:24,608 --> 00:34:29,348
kind of roofing I draw the line at to be

876
00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:31,599
honest yes all right so you gotta get

877
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:32,889
air conditioning and humidity you got to

878
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,050
have an exit you got to have a vent

879
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:36,159
drying stale air out of the building and

880
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:37,659
getting it out of the ceiling

881
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,210
that's something super important when

882
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:42,730
you're going from a basement grow to a

883
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:51,070
larger commercial grow do you guys have

884
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:53,050
to run we should be but we're loud we're

885
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:55,720
allowed one more complaint before we get

886
00:34:53,050 --> 00:35:00,099
in trouble I understand that economics

887
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:06,759
the fine is cheaper than the filters

888
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:08,530
that we need we we had to hear it well

889
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,910
oh that was they immediately that was

890
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:12,849
like one of their big concerns those

891
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:14,829
carbon filters and we've got six of

892
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:16,180
those big [ __ ] all over ours we've

893
00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:17,108
even got the inline ones on our

894
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:19,719
air-cooled lights

895
00:35:17,108 --> 00:35:21,848
we're disgustingly lucky because across

896
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:24,429
the street from us is homeward bound dog

897
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:27,490
crematorium nice and so every day around

898
00:35:24,429 --> 00:35:31,569
noon you smell garlic bread and then you

899
00:35:27,489 --> 00:35:34,088
realize animals across the street a dead

900
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:35,920
animal being cremated so I told the new

901
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:37,269
guy we got a new guy and I smelled it

902
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,070
the other day and I was like I can't

903
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:40,239
even let him do that I walked into the

904
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,619
other room where he was it go hey bro

905
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,939
you smell like garlic bread Neos yeah

906
00:35:41,619 --> 00:35:44,740
who's cooking I go that's the dog

907
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,190
crematorium next door don't enjoy it too

908
00:35:44,739 --> 00:35:46,899
much

909
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:49,900
that's Rover and he just looked at me

910
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,789
like that's fee said that's fluffy

911
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,250
there's roast in that [ __ ] dude

912
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:55,809
and it's funny cuz the first few days I

913
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,639
worked there I smelled something and

914
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:59,049
there were two girls that used to work

915
00:35:57,639 --> 00:36:00,639
there that are no longer affiliated with

916
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:02,200
us but they used to work there they'd be

917
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,119
like everyday at like noon or two

918
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:05,439
o'clock I smelled garlic bread and they

919
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,599
were standing in the groom room just

920
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,690
sucking it in one day like where is it

921
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,429
it smells so good I realized what it was

922
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:18,400
a few days later I was like those girls

923
00:36:12,429 --> 00:36:19,989
were loving man sorry this podcast just

924
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,220
got really more of it that's awkward

925
00:36:19,989 --> 00:36:26,319
right the reason I brought it up is just

926
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:29,259
carbon filter systems in a home grow

927
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,500
versus a commercial grower drastically

928
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,640
different hugely different yeah yeah

929
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:36,219
that's why I said what we need is way

930
00:36:33,639 --> 00:36:40,900
expensive like HEPA filter great [ __ ]

931
00:36:36,219 --> 00:36:43,539
and uh UV lighting possibly we've got a

932
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:45,490
small UV light that I use on small

933
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:47,019
plantings I run it over I just walked

934
00:36:45,489 --> 00:36:49,089
through the grow room and just hover

935
00:36:47,019 --> 00:36:50,829
that light about four to six inches over

936
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,990
every little plant and it keeps them

937
00:36:50,829 --> 00:36:55,500
nice and bug free cuz the bugs want

938
00:36:52,989 --> 00:36:59,259
nothing to do with that and the PM uh

939
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,550
there is not any yeah yeah so that thing

940
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:02,860
is helpful I was using that on another

941
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,840
guy's garden they had bad PM and I think

942
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:08,730
it took eight days to just deteriorate

943
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:11,410
all the PM you know an old guy that has

944
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:12,760
[ __ ] filtration and refuses to blow

945
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:15,099
the air out of his house cuz he's afraid

946
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:16,360
he keeps getting PM so they keep

947
00:37:15,099 --> 00:37:18,400
learning new tricks on how to get rid of

948
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,110
it for him yeah keeps us on our toes

949
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,000
alright so filtration is something they

950
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:25,030
choose super definitely need if that

951
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,230
stale funky air out you're gonna need UV

952
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:28,440
lighting you're gonna need a HIPAA

953
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,490
filtration your air conditioners have

954
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,530
exchanges and they're gonna pull the air

955
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:34,119
from the grow room and that's gonna blow

956
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,769
back into your grow but also a large

957
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:37,119
portion of that is going to escape into

958
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:39,880
the outside atmosphere so you're gonna

959
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,429
be stinking it up that way also see the

960
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,010
carbon scrubbers inside the grow it's

961
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:48,460
pretty [ __ ] hard to keep this it's so

962
00:37:45,010 --> 00:37:50,860
hard and be they came to us and they're

963
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:52,179
like hey uh we can smell cannabis and

964
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:54,340
we're like yeah we would try to keep the

965
00:37:52,179 --> 00:37:55,480
smell down how do you know it's us they

966
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,800
said well we've been to all the other

967
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:00,849
grows and you guys seem to know more

968
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,560
what you're doing the meed in the city

969
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:04,389
loves us there because we're

970
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,889
we don't hide from them there are some

971
00:38:04,389 --> 00:38:07,239
dispensary owners that don't get along

1017
00:39:32,130 --> 00:39:38,769
yeah I was dealing with one yesterday I

1018
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:40,570
was about ready to strangle the guy I

1019
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:42,400
just had to walk out of the office like

1020
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,289
yeah you're [ __ ] idiot sorry yeah

1021
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,639
sometimes sometimes some contractors are

1022
00:39:44,289 --> 00:39:47,860
a pain in the ass to deal with so that's

1023
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:49,359
something to look forward to and you're

1027
00:39:53,829 --> 00:39:57,489

crews from Denver to come down and build

1029
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:01,929

guy named Rasta Jeff told me about you

1043

1047
00:40:34,869 --> 00:40:43,059
not it's that's what I'm headed with

1048
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:44,289
this if using coins on the floor you

1049
00:40:43,059 --> 00:40:48,099
wouldn't care if I picked up two pennies

1050
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:50,079
no break a buck I get it that's that's

1051
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:51,940
breaking that's breaking the big one but

1052
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,210
if you got the soft the soft hundred

1053
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:56,588
pennies and you take two of them find

1054
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:58,659
yourself a good contractor is the point

1055
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:59,769
of all this yes yeah cuz contractors can

1056
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:01,989
[ __ ] up your whole day I worked in

1057
00:40:59,769 --> 00:41:04,630
another facility that the blueprint was

1058
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:06,068
drawn by one guy the HVAC system was

1059
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:07,059
designed by another in the electrical

1060
00:41:06,068 --> 00:41:08,980
which we're gonna talk about in a minute

1061
00:41:07,059 --> 00:41:10,930
was designed by another guy and they

1062
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:14,710
were all it was like we took a Ferrari

1063
00:41:10,929 --> 00:41:17,529
engine maybe a porsche turbo kit and

1064
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:19,030
then maybe like a Lamborghini body and

1065
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,650
then the suspension system for a

1066
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:22,750
Corvette and they're like you got all

1067
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:26,200
these dope-ass parts make it go fast

1068
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:28,000
Ricky Bobby we're like yeah but the air

1069
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:30,308
conditioning doesn't work when you turn

1070
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,210
on all the lights there's not enough

1071
00:41:30,309 --> 00:41:37,390
power to do good contractors good

1072
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:39,699
engineers [ __ ] engineer that's very

1073
00:41:37,389 --> 00:41:42,699
key as an engineer that understands yeah

1074
00:41:39,699 --> 00:41:44,649
because you're not always going to find

1075
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:46,808
a contractor that understands indoor

1076
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:48,369
cultivation they don't actually made

1077
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:51,130
ideas come rarely we'll find a

1078
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:53,260
contractor that understands it but you

1079
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,450
can find engineers that know what

1080
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:58,059
they're doing and engineers are smart

1081
00:41:55,449 --> 00:42:00,789
people you can explain [ __ ] to him so

1082
00:41:58,059 --> 00:42:02,380
yeah that's that was real key in the

1083
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:03,789
uncle bun company development we had a

1084
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,349
really good engineer let's talk about

1085
00:42:03,789 --> 00:42:06,849
that in a minute also I'll let you give

1086
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:10,660
them a nice plug I'm gonna write it down

1087
00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:12,670
so that I remember I was able to relay

1088
00:42:10,659 --> 00:42:15,039
concerns I had to to him and I'm like

1089
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,720
you know we got to make sure this

1090
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:17,949
doesn't happen like electricity I was

1091
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,230
like we just have to have plenty

1092
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:22,449
electricity plenty three-phase power all

1093
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:25,869
day long yeah well not quite but we got

1094
00:42:22,449 --> 00:42:27,068
two meters so okay how many amps are you

1095
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:30,759
allowed to pull

1096
00:42:27,068 --> 00:42:32,978
we're 400 on both that's on each box yes

1097
00:42:30,759 --> 00:42:37,929
so you get 800 total apps nowhere near

1098
00:42:32,978 --> 00:42:40,149
drawing water amperage you get to flip

1099
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:42,728
the [ __ ] on switch we've got to the

1100
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,229
inside ever done it yeah I feel

1101
00:42:42,728 --> 00:42:47,129
ridiculous when at content when the

1102
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:50,679
contacts touch yeah all that power you

1103
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:52,778
can do like if you if you're not strong

1104
00:42:50,679 --> 00:42:54,998
enough to push it all right through you

1105
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:58,048
don't want to do it like because that's

1106
00:42:54,998 --> 00:43:02,708
about our that's a lot of feeling to

1107
00:42:58,048 --> 00:43:04,478
shorten something there yeah yeah and

1108
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:20,440
some smaller folks might not be able to

1109
00:43:04,478 --> 00:43:21,788
push that this is not the Colorado they

1110
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,278
don't get any love what are we talking

1111

like yeah just go [ __ ] every little

1159
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,269
random thing that's fallen out of a

1160
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:12,130
plant all the pearlite that's on a table

1161
00:45:10,269 --> 00:45:13,929
or any whatever if there's a pair of

1162
00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,660
scissors lying around go clean all that

1163
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:18,279
[ __ ] measurers yeah yeah exactly start

1164
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:19,960
from the top in the flower room go all

1165
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,160
the way down if there's old trellis for

1166
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,349
old pots in there from something that's

1167
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:25,750
been harvested that's got to go sweep

1168
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:27,819
every goddamn corner get out the shop

1169
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:29,980
vac suck up underneath all the weird

1170
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:32,410
random little nooks and crannies that we

1171
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:34,240
got in there anything that's not gonna

1172
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:36,099
be used doesn't need to be in the flower

1173
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,979
room I don't think like scissors and

1174
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:41,440
boxes of material that [ __ ] should go in

1175
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,809
the storage room store that yeah or put

1176
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,579
it right outside the flower is fortunate

1177
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:50,139
enough to have a storage room yeah put

1178
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:52,420
the broom and dustpan and trash can

1179
00:45:50,139 --> 00:45:54,400
outside the flower room yes put that

1180
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,530
[ __ ] outside just don't have that in the

1181
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,630
flowering room or the bedroom simple

1182
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,430
little tasks that you don't even think

1183
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,670
about doing in a small group can

1184
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:06,429
literally take days in a big defoliating

1185
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:08,650
oh my god shaving legs shaving legs and

1186
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:10,779
defoliants taking I know you guys are

1187
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:13,090
all netting but yeah I'm doing a big

1188
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,010
Seeger on so that wasn't really a right

1189
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:17,650
an option I just double and triple layer

1190
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:27,520
trellising I get it crazy on it

1191
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:29,440
I can't wait I've got a guy that a

1192
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,840
former employee that would be fully at

1193
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,860
the entire room for an entire shift and

1194
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:38,050
he would do 10 5-gallon buckets full of

1195
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:39,910
leaves and he would push him down like

1196
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:41,500
you just chopped leaves all day and then

1197
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:43,000
go back and scoop up the leaves out of

1198
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,710
the trays into five-gallon buckets and

1199
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,019
he'd probably fill 10 5 gallon buckets

1200
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:48,820
he'd fill one of those big like 30

1201
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:50,119
gallon trash cans halfway full it just

1202
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:52,460
leaves just never

1203
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:53,630
the first run of defoliating things you

1204
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,550
don't have to do in the basement we have

1205
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:59,960
to weigh all that and we have to track

1206
00:46:55,550 --> 00:47:01,810
it that's yeah document what all that

1207
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:07,929
[ __ ] weighed yeah

1208
00:47:01,809 --> 00:47:10,159
manicured wait leave off so we've got a

1209
00:47:07,929 --> 00:47:12,199
you know you're supposed to like mix it

1210
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,670
with soil or vinegar oil or something

1211
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:14,960
like that before you can throw it away

1212
00:47:13,670 --> 00:47:16,490
okay yeah let's sound let's catch the

1213
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,240
listeners up though and a commercial

1214
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:22,399
grow when you if you have see maybe a

1215
00:47:20,239 --> 00:47:24,109
but isn't desirable or they're the

1216
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,730
bottom part of the plan you throw that

1217
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:27,170
[ __ ] away when that's in the trashcan

1218
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:29,389
you have to cut it up into little tiny

1219
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:32,780
pieces and then you have to mix it like

1220
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:35,929
Jesse said with soil or a kitty litter

1221
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:38,510
is what they recommend it for gravel or

1222
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:39,829
vinegar or something else that you can

1223
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:41,990
put in there cooking oil yeah anything

1224
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:44,210
to make it unusable and unrecognizable

1225
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:46,699
so you sound like you got a good idea

1226
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:48,349
yeah we've got three worm firms there

1227
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:50,569
you go [ __ ] yeah feed it to the worms

1228
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:53,089
yeah and they're loving it too I'm sure

1229
00:47:50,570 --> 00:47:55,700
they love their canna meal and the best

1230
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:58,519
we use a [ __ ] ton of worm castings too

1231
00:47:55,699 --> 00:48:03,259
so it helps cut down cost there there

1232
00:47:58,519 --> 00:48:03,860
you go pre cycling yeah that's a good

1233
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,350
way to do it

1234
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:09,800
yeah that's when we get our greenhouse

1235
00:48:06,349 --> 00:48:11,900
built we've got a whole wall in the

1236
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,330
greenhouse it's gonna be a shelf system

1237
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:17,030
full of bins and every worm [ __ ]

1238
00:48:14,329 --> 00:48:19,159
into it into a funnel yeah just a warm

1239
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:21,350
[ __ ] funnel just tunnel it down Dan

1240
00:48:19,159 --> 00:48:22,819
that's pretty rad we've uh we grind it

1241
00:48:21,349 --> 00:48:25,909
up pretty small we chop it on I chopped

1242
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:28,309
up with uh like the the shears just go

1243
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:30,019
ham on it with the shears and then uh we

1244
00:48:28,309 --> 00:48:31,639
make lasagna basically we take the old

1245
00:48:30,019 --> 00:48:34,309
pot that the plants been harvested from

1246
00:48:31,639 --> 00:48:35,690
and shake that soil into the trashcan we

1247
00:48:34,309 --> 00:48:36,590
let them dry they've all sat around and

1248
00:48:35,690 --> 00:48:38,240
dried for couple days

1249
00:48:36,590 --> 00:48:39,950
don't pull that soil into the trash can

1250
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:42,079
throw a bunch of the waste into there

1251
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:44,419
dump a couple more pots more soil couple

1252
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,309
more far more a waste yeah just keep it

1253
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,050
like that so that's a way to get rid of

1254
00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:51,199
all of our old soil at the same time and

1255
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,490
Canobie you have a use for it wasting

1256
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,569
all that good dirt because I know it's

1257
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:59,809
recyclable I totally know and we use so

1258
00:48:56,570 --> 00:49:01,220
much cocoa we buy 14 big bags of cocoa

1259
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,880

1260
00:49:01,219 --> 00:49:04,469

them because they didn't need water for

1304
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:46,070
anything there's if you get one of those

1305

1307
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,380
here yeah a few one of those warehouses

1308
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,430
out there you you might not have water

1309
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:54,809
you're gonna have to be getting trucks

1310
00:50:53,429 --> 00:50:56,339
of water you have to pay to get water

1311
00:50:54,809 --> 00:51:00,779
out there something people aren't aware

1312
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:03,630
of if you get a large grow on private

1313
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:06,630
land out say in Pueblo County somewhere

1314
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:08,340
you have to get water rights cannot you

1315
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:09,930
just because you have land doesn't mean

1316
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,910
you're granted water rights even if

1317
00:51:09,929 --> 00:51:13,679
there's a well there you have to

1318
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:17,129
purchase water - off

1319
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:19,828
what you're taking out exactly yep if

1320
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:21,930
there are enough grows around that area

1321
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:24,030
that that jurisdiction deems the water

1322
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:26,098
is compromised by you coming they can

1323
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:28,769
decline your water wings you can't have

1324
00:51:26,099 --> 00:51:30,930
any water saluted yeah and this I mean

1325
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:32,280
even to the point that they don't care

1326
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:35,279
that you're going to town to buy it and

1327

moments I have those moments where I

1398
00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:10,980
wonder if yes you know I just blame it

1399
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:15,929
on that anyway yep that's that's from

1400
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:23,159
the time I left for no reason in my

1401
00:54:15,929 --> 00:54:24,389
jackets all right let's try to get back

1402
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:26,489
on track I don't even over the foot we

1403
00:54:24,389 --> 00:54:29,670
were talk about concussions and building

1404
00:54:26,489 --> 00:54:32,189
grows large large facilities yeah have a

1405
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:35,099
first-aid kit oh yeah talk about needing

1406
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:38,970
water oh we have water tanks water

1407
00:54:35,099 --> 00:54:40,769
filtration your average on the shelf go

1408
00:54:38,969 --> 00:54:43,739
store water filter can't handle them and

1409
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:46,530
honor them no you need a lot of water I

1410
00:54:43,739 --> 00:54:47,159
use a thousand gallons of water every 48

1411
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,410
hours

1412
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:54,539
grow and that's a hundred and five

1413
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:56,940
lights total I'm doing a 155 to 165

1414
00:54:54,539 --> 00:54:58,920
right now okay actually we're still not

1415
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:01,800
even at full capacity yeah yeah I'm in

1416
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,599
full flower or 5 feet tall with big

1417
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,400
[ __ ] donkey dick buds on them and

1418
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:09,480
either way that's still a lot more than

1419
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:11,340
your basement grew oh so much more yeah

1420
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:13,380
if you're using I figure you use about

1421
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:17,910
indoors you probably use five gallons of

1422
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:21,369
water per light every 48 to 72 hours ish

1423
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:22,210
yeah that's the way I used to so if you

1424
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:23,739
guys are trying to figure out how much

1425
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:26,289
water you should be using in your indoor

1426
00:55:23,739 --> 00:55:27,699
every 1,000 watt or 600 watt light six

1427
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,469
hundred a thousand watt light you should

1428
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:31,149
be running about five gallons every 24

1429
00:55:29,469 --> 00:55:32,409
to 48 hours if your temperatures and

1430
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:33,789
your humidity and everything are dialed

1431
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:35,710
in and your plants are at their optimum

1432
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:39,150
growth your plants are growing a little

1433
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,150
slow you're probably over watering them

1434
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,750
yeah that's usually the first sign of

1435
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:47,860
over watering some plants outdoors it's

1436
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:53,739
gonna be average I'd say five gallons a

1437
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:55,180
plant per plant per day per day is it

1438
00:55:53,739 --> 00:55:56,709
okay to just turn on the hose and just

1439
00:55:55,179 --> 00:56:03,329
let the hose just [ __ ] flood those

1440
00:55:56,710 --> 00:56:06,010
outdoor plants yes for the most part I

1441
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:07,269
try to concentrate it more just around

1442
00:56:06,010 --> 00:56:10,150
the plant because I feel like it's

1443
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:12,849
wasting you know okay yeah yeah okay

1444
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:15,610
yeah no you could totally do like a

1445
00:56:12,849 --> 00:56:17,980
field flood irrigation actually know of

1446
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:21,070
a also a place here in Pueblo County

1447
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:24,309
that floods their field just like they

1448
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:26,200
do with cantaloupe or watermelon or Wow

1449
00:56:24,309 --> 00:56:28,059
yeah yeah just flow the whole field out

1450
00:56:26,199 --> 00:56:29,500
like a soak and I let it dry and reflet

1451
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:32,049
it they're just doing a flood and drain

1452
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:34,119
outdoor basically that's yeah okay yeah

1453
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:36,700
I think they do it like two or three

1454
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:39,130
times I need to go explore and visit

1455
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:40,359
more of these outdoor cannabis in here

1456
00:56:39,130 --> 00:56:41,740
because I want to see how you guys are

1457
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,000
doing a lot of this [ __ ] I want to learn

1458
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:45,129
from the tech don't want to see what I

1459
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,630
can implement into my indoor tech I can

1460
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:48,849
show you a couple cool ins yeah I'd love

1461
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:51,670
to see a bunch of big stuff um the

1462
00:56:48,849 --> 00:56:54,339
something pretty I think is pretty cool

1463
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:57,159
the overwhelming majority of these

1464
00:56:54,340 --> 00:57:00,450
places are know to raise bed

1465
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:03,579
Oh neat yeah so no till you guys they

1466
00:57:00,449 --> 00:57:06,250
they make an amended soil with a lot of

1467
00:57:03,579 --> 00:57:07,900
special amendments and then very

1468
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,010
specific amendments that I'm ignorant to

1469
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:14,460
honestly I don't know what goes into

1470
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:14,460
that a lot of life okay

1471
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:22,809
live worms live worms okay so it's

1472
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:24,970
living soil you guys yeah and the plants

1473
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:26,170
are harvested and do you pull out the

1474
00:57:24,969 --> 00:57:27,869
big root ball or you just leave that in

1475
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:30,900
there

1476
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:32,099
the stim around it okay try it do you

1477
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:33,690
actually want to leave as much of the

1478
00:57:32,099 --> 00:57:35,460
root ball in there as you can kind of

1479
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:37,889
worms are gonna eat it right into

1480
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,820
nutrients for the plant again wife so

1481
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,769
I'm going in circles

1482
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:45,420
you pull the plan out and you put a new

1483
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:47,070
one in and you send her off again they

1484
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:49,349
use a lot of cover crops stuff like that

1485
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:51,930
oh okay so you're stacking stuff into

1486
00:57:49,349 --> 00:57:53,759
the pot and then the worms will eat all

1487
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:55,769
of that mostly that stuff will decompose

1488
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,300
and become plant yeah and then so you're

1489
00:57:55,769 --> 00:57:59,639
gonna start losing a little bit of depth

1490
00:57:57,300 --> 00:58:01,500
every time right that's the depth of the

1491
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:03,779
soil is gonna move down you just refill

1492
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:06,210
it with your fresh that's how you got no

1493
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:08,550
toes you that's awesome go back in top

1494
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:10,110
dress in all your recharged amendments

1495
00:58:08,550 --> 00:58:11,310
that's pretty awesome I never thought of

1496
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:13,050
that of a crow it's uh

1497
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:15,389
[Music]

1498
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:17,130
it's extremely economical that's why

1499
00:58:15,389 --> 00:58:18,900
most of these places are running it hell

1500
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:21,480
are such a large scale that it's just

1501
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,880
the plants taste good cuz either being

1502
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:26,309
an intro er who uses mainly bottled

1503
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:28,829
nutrients for most of my growing to

1504
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:31,230
flush my plants yeah are they always

1505
00:58:28,829 --> 00:58:34,920
those guys I don't need to flush cuz

1506
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:36,269
I've been crushing the whole time since

1507
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:37,769
they're not feeding a whole bunch of

1508
00:58:36,269 --> 00:58:39,509
bottled nutrients a bunch of she lated

1509
00:58:37,769 --> 00:58:41,009
salts they're plants aren't backed up

1510
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:44,100
with stuff the plants are probably more

1511
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:46,950
able to I don't you can't even remember

1512
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:48,360
the word right now it's simile all of

1513
00:58:46,949 --> 00:58:49,679
the nutrients that are going through

1514
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:50,880
they can use it a little bit better it

1515
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:52,710
kind of something goes down they get rid

1516
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,750
of it a little more okay i debuff a star

1517
00:58:52,710 --> 00:58:57,300
they get to pick and choose yeah it's an

1518
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:58,769
enforcement yeah I was crazy the plants

1519
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,410
actually finish themselves off they

1520
00:58:58,769 --> 00:59:02,039
start fading just like you they would if

1521
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:05,809
they're flooded

1522
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:09,269
I mean flushed they know my seasons done

1523
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:12,210
yeah all right do you see a difference

1524
00:59:09,269 --> 00:59:13,769
in specific strains does strain a versus

1525
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:15,929
strain B do they finish differently in

1526
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:18,059
the no-till outdoor I haven't done

1527
00:59:15,929 --> 00:59:19,529
enough of it to say that yeah let's just

1528
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:21,360
curious if that was nutrients running

1529
00:59:19,530 --> 00:59:23,820
out or if that was actually the plant

1530
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:29,160
realizing hey done I'm flushing myself I

1531
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:31,170
I know in my experience the way I grow

1532
00:59:29,159 --> 00:59:33,299
in the grounds kind of no-till pretty

1533
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:35,639
much yeah I know Girl Scout cookies and

1534
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,769
flow will finish themselves off what Pat

1535
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:39,750
doubt they'll the forum cut Girl Scout

1536
00:59:37,769 --> 00:59:41,869
cookies flow will finish herself off you

1537
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,869
guys

1538
00:59:43,568 --> 00:59:46,940
all right we've been going for about an

1539
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,920
hour let's uh let's start wrapping it up

1540
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:51,108
because I'm actually expecting dinner to

1541
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,730
show up in the next one I just started

1542
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:54,980
thinking about that about 15 minutes ago

1543
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:58,630
I saw you messing with your phone is

1544
00:59:54,980 --> 00:59:58,630
like he's doing his dinner

1545
01:00:00,068 --> 01:00:03,108
15:30

1546
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:06,739
I actually got a girl foliar spray some

1547
01:00:03,108 --> 01:00:09,018
plans what are you gonna spray essential

1548
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:10,788
oils okay so pesticide pest management

1549
01:00:09,018 --> 01:00:15,679
and a great pest management with

1550
01:00:10,789 --> 01:00:19,700
essential oils we are to 13 days in the

1551
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:21,798
flower just about the end of that just

1552
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:24,889
bring it right now and the lights just

1553
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:27,768
shut off so I'm gonna go hit him with it

1554
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:29,629
a few more times and that great white

1555
01:00:27,768 --> 01:00:31,129
yeah you know you are the forehead

1556
01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,480
greenlighter do you have a room light no

1557
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:35,240
I got the forehead one thing I don't

1558
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,710
like the full room once okay inevitably

1559
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:41,659
that light switch always gets left on

1560
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:46,759
right yeah just run in that green light

1561
01:00:41,659 --> 01:00:48,739
for nothing all day it's looking where

1562
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:49,849
I'm looking yeah it's actually focused

1563
01:00:48,739 --> 01:00:58,879
where I am instead of just then you

1564
01:00:49,849 --> 01:01:01,160
don't get shadows all right we've talked

1565
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,390
a lot about building getting your large

1566
01:01:01,159 --> 01:01:03,649
commercial grow going you have any

1567
01:01:02,389 --> 01:01:04,818
things that you want to add before we

1568
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:06,680
start wrapping this up so that I don't

1569
01:01:04,818 --> 01:01:10,608
cut off any of your useful data for our

1570
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:12,379
listeners find a person that can be

1571
01:01:10,608 --> 01:01:15,018
vouched for by many people throughout

1572
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:18,500
the community to work with your engineer

1573
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:22,278
to help design your building and pay him

1574
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:24,889
what he is worth like you know if it'll

1575
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:27,650
be a guy like me or Jeff and even if

1576
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:31,190
he's not gonna grow for you pay him what

1577
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:34,068
it's worth and your end product will

1578
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:37,548
drastically improve and work better by

1579
01:01:34,068 --> 01:01:38,989
doing that in my first week and green

1580
01:01:37,548 --> 01:01:43,268
and healthy wellness I made minor

1581
01:01:38,989 --> 01:01:46,189
improvements that improved the financial

1582
01:01:43,268 --> 01:01:47,538
it just made sense it fixed their books

1583
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:48,829
a little bit just by [ __ ] doing a

1584
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:50,660
couple of adjustments like making the

1585
01:01:48,829 --> 01:01:52,940
garden more or profitable just by

1586
01:01:50,659 --> 01:01:54,318
eliminating this and adding this it just

1587
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,999
took me a week to me

1588
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:57,380
a whole bunch of small improvements just

1589
01:01:55,998 --> 01:01:59,778
because the person who set it up and was

1590
01:01:57,380 --> 01:02:03,680
running it was not an experienced grower

1591
01:01:59,778 --> 01:02:04,880
was not I don't want to I don't want to

1592
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:06,798
bash this person but they weren't a

1593
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:08,358
forward thinker they were they didn't

1594
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:09,588
they didn't look far enough into the

1595
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:10,998
future they didn't have foresight to

1596
01:02:09,588 --> 01:02:12,228
realize that if I don't put glue here

1597
01:02:10,998 --> 01:02:15,889
that shit's gonna come apart eventually

1598
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:17,419
got you like yeah yeah so I fixed a lot

1599
01:02:15,889 --> 01:02:19,068
of just small details they didn't have

1600
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:20,298
any heaters in the O's winter when I

1601
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:22,190
started there were no heaters and the

1602
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:23,989
reservoirs they're feeding the plants 54

1603
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:25,548
degree water and they couldn't get the

1604
01:02:23,989 --> 01:02:27,798
pH of the [ __ ] water to come up

1605
01:02:25,548 --> 01:02:29,509
they're just pouring in pH they couldn't

1606
01:02:27,798 --> 01:02:31,068
get it to go down it was porn in like a

1607
01:02:29,509 --> 01:02:37,489
half a gallon a pH down and like it

1608
01:02:31,068 --> 01:02:38,630
won't move and I was like oh my god I go

1609
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:40,548
where does the water come from he goes

1610
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:41,838
of the hose I was like oh so municipal

1611
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,608
water it's coming from the [ __ ] line

1612
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:45,978
it's underground and it's 30 degrees

1613
01:02:43,608 --> 01:02:48,108
outside so I stuck a thermometer in

1614
01:02:45,978 --> 01:02:49,608
there and that water was 54 degrees well

1615
01:02:48,108 --> 01:02:51,078
that's why the pH won't move and that's

1616
01:02:49,608 --> 01:02:52,518
why the plants have the cloth they all

1617
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:57,380
had the [ __ ] downward claw but the

1618
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:59,598
plants were purple like everything so I

1619
01:02:57,380 --> 01:03:00,769
put aquarium heaters in there so let's

1620
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,329
go to the fish store get the biggest

1621
01:03:00,768 --> 01:03:04,338
aquarium heaters they have put two in

1622
01:03:02,329 --> 01:03:07,749
each one sent him at 74 degrees and let

1623
01:03:04,338 --> 01:03:09,588
him run to get the glass ones are

1624
01:03:07,748 --> 01:03:14,179
beautifully then I learned that they

1625
01:03:09,588 --> 01:03:16,849
sell big ourselves there for heating

1626
01:03:14,179 --> 01:03:18,649
animal like horses yeah its stock tank

1627
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:20,088
heaters those would have been more

1628
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:22,039
economical but I didn't think of that

1629
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:24,259
because I'm not a farm boy I just never

1630
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:26,119
thought of that for sure I ordered in a

1631
01:03:24,259 --> 01:03:28,338
couple at the store last winter nice

1632
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:31,640
we've been selling the glass once I

1633
01:03:28,338 --> 01:03:35,268
found the stainless steel ones and they

1634
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:36,889
sold up very quickly yeah that glass

1635
01:03:35,268 --> 01:03:40,848
ones gonna break in there on accidents

1636
01:03:36,889 --> 01:03:43,159
yeah 50 gallons of water

1637
01:03:40,849 --> 01:03:45,680
you know someday it will but yeah that's

1638
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:47,420
a failsafe though so you're not gonna

1639
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:53,509
get shot right yeah they're not in there

1640
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:54,680
right now so yeah you guys a lot of the

1641
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:56,150
[ __ ] you're gonna go spend money on it

1642
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:57,498
the hydro store go check out the

1643
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:00,798
aquarium store before you do that

1644
01:03:57,498 --> 01:04:02,598
because it's cheaper or even crazier to

1645
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:04,159
be totally honest oh yeah you don't

1646

yeah that's her baby nice she does a

1671
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:09,320
good job I understand Springs they

1672
01:05:07,608 --> 01:05:10,969
finally if I were there I'd shot there

1673
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:13,940
but I'm right up the street from the

1674
01:05:10,969 --> 01:05:15,078
store in Springs that as if I needed 14

1675
01:05:13,940 --> 01:05:23,809
bags of soil I don't know that you have

1676
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:25,310
it yeah no I understand that's something

1677
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:27,799
we should mention commercial ordering

1678
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:29,328
yeah good luck the first time you want

1679
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:31,068
to figure out how much [ __ ] soil you

1680
01:05:29,329 --> 01:05:32,630
need to fill all those pots cuz it's

1681
01:05:31,068 --> 01:05:34,730
that's a math challenge you heard Jesse

1682
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:36,079
and I see here how much soil we needed

1683
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:39,679
you're gonna have to go back to the

1684
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:41,060
store a couple times don't expect all

1685
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:44,239
stores you're gonna be able to get

1686
01:05:41,059 --> 01:05:45,828
commercial quantities of things when you

1687
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:47,179
need them you need to think ahead about

1688
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:50,119
stuff yeah you might have to start

1689
01:05:47,179 --> 01:05:52,129
letting we let the store near us know

1690
01:05:50,119 --> 01:05:53,599
that this is these are products that we

1691
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:55,700
use on the regular if you keep these

1692
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:57,260
stock we'll buy them if we come here and

1693
01:05:55,699 --> 01:05:59,118
you don't have it we will drive directly

1694
01:05:57,260 --> 01:06:01,520
to another store and get it cuz we don't

1695
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,380
[ __ ] yeah and so it took him a couple

1696
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:04,639
of rhythms you know it took them a

1697
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,838
couple hey you don't have it like it's

1698
01:06:04,639 --> 01:06:07,129
come in Wednesday the trucks come

1699
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,068
Wednesday I don't care

1700
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:11,690
and so we kind of a job we we compromise

1701
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:13,400
with that we can't [ __ ] with the day the

1702
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:15,349
trucks run like that's some [ __ ] we

01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:17,450
can't ask for it I will get it on your

1704
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:18,800

there's two main truckers that they

1709
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:34,130

1710
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,900
to seventy percent of the gross horse or

1711

Jesse said he said to hire somebody that

1740
01:07:43,820 --> 01:07:47,000
knows what the [ __ ] they're talking

1741
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:48,889
about when it comes to working with your

1742
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,510
engineer to build the grow something

1743
01:07:48,889 --> 01:07:52,279
super important that just sounds

1744
01:07:50,510 --> 01:07:54,320
egotistical coming from myself and Jesse

1745
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:57,800
but also hire a master grower that is a

1746
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:59,390
master grower yeah interview people look

1747
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:03,110
at pictures of plants they've grown I

1748
01:07:59,389 --> 01:08:04,909
brought people to my home grow yeah to

1749
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:06,829
show them that I can grow on a

1750
01:08:04,909 --> 01:08:08,659
commercial scale as I here is what I can

1751
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:09,949
do if you put me in a big grow I can do

1752
01:08:08,659 --> 01:08:11,359
it and they trusted me and they gave me

1753
01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:12,949
the opportunity by seeing the

1754
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,850
cleanliness and the organization of my

1755
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:18,920
home grow yeah so if you can go look at

1756
01:08:16,850 --> 01:08:20,270
their grow before you hire a master

1757
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:21,380
grower do it and if you're the business

1758
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:23,030
guy and you think you're gonna grow it

skills I've got faith in your mind but

1762
01:08:26,088 --> 01:08:29,239
cannabis is something that takes a lot

1763
01:08:27,619 --> 01:08:31,279
of practice to learn it's like playing

1764
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:33,409
an instrument you might have natural

1765
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,389
skill but you're not gonna be Bon Jovi

1766

ten cycles under your belt before you

1771
01:08:40,899 --> 01:08:47,109

1772
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:48,520
from this clone all the way to drying

1773
01:08:47,109 --> 01:08:51,069
and curing all the way to move in the

people that don't know much about the

1815
01:10:24,579 --> 01:10:29,829
industry or don't live in Colorado is

1816
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:31,300
not common at all to find owners that

1817
01:10:29,829 --> 01:10:33,309
are actually involved in the grill

1818
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:35,230
that's I think being Jeff we're both

1819
01:10:33,310 --> 01:10:37,300
fortunate to work unfortunately it's

1820
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:38,769
equally as common to find rich dudes

1821
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,329
that own Porsche dealerships and want to

1822
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:41,590
double their [ __ ] money by opening a

1823
01:10:40,329 --> 01:10:42,789
dispensary and being a [ __ ] to

1824
01:10:41,590 --> 01:10:44,470

01:11:38,619 --> 01:11:42,909
growers are weird people we've been

1852
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:44,380
taught to hide this for so many years

1853
01:11:42,909 --> 01:11:46,510
the guys that are good at it did it like

1854
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:48,940
when we were hiding it and we were kind

1855
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:50,260
of sketchy about it so sometimes some of

1856
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:53,319
our background history on the

1857
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:55,119
application is a little vague sometimes

1858
01:11:53,319 --> 01:11:57,250
we've got a big furry ass beard they're

1859
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:58,869
gonna have squirrels iDEN sometimes you

1860
01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:00,850
got dreadlocks down to your ass they can

1861
01:11:58,869 --> 01:12:03,430
have the whole damn zoo hidin in it they

1862
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:09,250
don't we don't like sharing secrets we

1863
01:12:03,430 --> 01:12:11,530
don't like to share too many secrets by

1864
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:13,329
dispensary owners by street people by

1865
01:12:11,529 --> 01:12:14,529
friends by family things have gone wrong

1866
01:12:13,329 --> 01:12:16,210
so we're a little we're a little

1867
01:12:14,529 --> 01:12:20,710
protective of ourselves and our

1868
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:24,100
knowledge it's one thing I had my pasta

1869
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:25,210
ate the other day growers are some of

1870
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:27,220
the only people in the industry that

1871
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:28,930
don't actually need a job right they

1872
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:31,300
could go make their own money doing

1873
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:33,430
their I hate to say this but I actually

1874
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:35,440
very much meet my job I need more money

1875
01:12:33,430 --> 01:12:37,990
being a black market grower I than I

1876
01:12:35,439 --> 01:12:39,099
ever have in the legal industry but I

1877
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:41,380
don't have to look over my shoulder

1878
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:43,450
anymore I don't have to when I hear

1879
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:44,980
ruffling outside the front door too

1880
01:12:43,449 --> 01:12:46,659
early I don't think the door is about to

1881
01:12:44,979 --> 01:12:48,309
get kicked the [ __ ] because I spent

1882
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:50,349
20 years of my life just wondering is

1883
01:12:48,310 --> 01:12:52,450
today the day they kick this [ __ ] in

1884
01:12:50,350 --> 01:12:55,539
you can get a loan for a car you can get

1885
01:12:52,449 --> 01:12:56,349
a loan for it's hard work but I've got a

1886
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:57,729
can get done

1887
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,900
brand new car in the driveway that I

1888
01:12:57,729 --> 01:12:59,678
couldn't have done when I was a street

1889
01:12:58,899 --> 01:13:01,420
hustler because

1890
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:03,609
I've got paychecks and pay stubs and I

1891
01:13:01,420 --> 01:13:04,929
pay taxes and yeah I pay child support

1892
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:06,578
because I've got a child that lives with

1893
01:13:04,929 --> 01:13:07,630
their mom and just because we don't live

1894
01:13:06,578 --> 01:13:08,590
in the same place I'm required to

1895
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:10,779
[ __ ] pay child support

1896
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:11,800
it's cool with me today just driving it

1897
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:14,050
over there I have to go through a system

1898
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:16,059
which documents it being paid they were

1899
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:17,409
always on my ass about my income you're

1900
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:18,639
paying child support but we want to know

1901
01:13:17,408 --> 01:13:19,839
where your money comes from I was like

1902
01:13:18,639 --> 01:13:21,788
why does it matter if the bill was paid

1903
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:23,288
yeah I just kept telling him like my mom

1904
01:13:21,788 --> 01:13:25,359
pays it or my grandpa died he left me

1905
01:13:23,288 --> 01:13:27,340
money his [ __ ] tone that kind of [ __ ]

1906
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:29,618
but now I'm like hey look I work at this

1907
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:31,119
place and like okay thank you yeah so

1908
01:13:29,618 --> 01:13:32,859
having a job not looking over my

1909
01:13:31,118 --> 01:13:36,578
shoulder is well worth the difference

1910
01:13:32,859 --> 01:13:38,139
it's the stress reduction although

1911
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:40,630
there's other stress that comes from it

1912
01:13:38,139 --> 01:13:45,069
right the different kind of stress just

1913
01:13:40,630 --> 01:13:47,288
but now I can be I I am more proud of my

1914
01:13:45,069 --> 01:13:49,389
grow now than I was when I was a black

1915
01:13:47,288 --> 01:13:50,618
market for sure like it was kind of cool

01:18:30,738 --> 01:18:36,289
it's going through the proving process

2040
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:37,969
no [ __ ] and we lose ass you know a the

2041
01:18:36,289 --> 01:18:40,488
people that owe my company are from

2042
01:18:37,969 --> 01:18:42,590
George in Texas be highest [ __ ] yes

2043
01:18:40,488 --> 01:18:45,859
barbecue sauces good oh dude it's so

2044
01:18:42,590 --> 01:18:47,630
good it's it's really good how many how

2045
01:18:45,859 --> 01:18:49,639
many milligrams of THC per serving

2046
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:52,579
um that's part of the thing we're

2047
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:55,820
figuring out right now the bottle scope

2048
01:18:52,579 --> 01:18:56,809
it's gotta be limited at 100 a smaller

2049
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:59,389
bottle okay

2050
01:18:56,810 --> 01:19:01,850
but it's brittle be like two servings so

2051
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:02,989
50 milligrams two serving all right so

2052
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:04,340
gonna make some red you could just

2053
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:06,079
squirt the whole bottle across some ribs

2054
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,730
and as the heat when you're cooking the

2055
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:08,960
ribs gonna [ __ ] up my medicine that's

2056
01:19:07,729 --> 01:19:12,379
one of the things we've got to figure

2057
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,539
out all right so yeah there's I had no

2058
01:19:12,380 --> 01:19:16,520
idea vegetarian you guys hypothetically

2059
01:19:14,539 --> 01:19:18,350
talking about BBQ ribs over here I had

2060
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:21,500
no idea the proofing process the state

2061
01:19:18,350 --> 01:19:22,130
requires for a new new style and it's

2062
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,880
rigorous

2063
01:19:22,130 --> 01:19:27,529
they were doing popcorn balls - oh I had

2064
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:30,010
some popcorn balls that were coated and

2065
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:30,009
clear Oh

2066
01:19:30,498 --> 01:19:35,389
that's part of the a lot of our demand

2067
01:19:34,248 --> 01:19:37,069
we've been getting for clay right now

2068
01:19:35,389 --> 01:19:39,229
it's coming from edibles manufacturers

2069
01:19:37,069 --> 01:19:40,849
nice is they don't want any smell or any

2070
01:19:39,229 --> 01:19:42,559
right it makes it so much easier and

2071
01:19:40,849 --> 01:19:44,748
it's more viscous it's easier to work

2072
01:19:42,559 --> 01:19:46,400
with it's not chunky like pho it's a

2073
01:19:44,748 --> 01:19:51,618
higher percentage so it's easier to work

2074
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:54,799
with I shot it to my friends at TNT

2075
01:19:51,618 --> 01:19:57,679
extractions they gave me a 1000

2076
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,840
milligram chokolate bar it was kind of

2077
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,279
like biting into taste they told me if

2078
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:03,710
there's a gram and a half of shatter

2079
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:05,359
melted into that chocolate bar it tasted

2080
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:07,279
like they just took a gram and a half of

2081
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:09,170
shatter and to a chocolate bar and just

2082
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:11,090
dropped the shatter directly into the

2083
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:13,010
chocolate bar because when I bit into it

2084
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:23,779
it was chocolate chocolate chocolate

2085
