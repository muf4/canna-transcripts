you also uh on the last episode I said

17
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,320
that I was going to make videos of this

18
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,078
podcast uh making a video is a big pain

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,119
in the ass and it really detracts from

20
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,920
the quality of the show in my opinion I

21
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:58,718
was too distracted by toys and equipment

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,879
I wasn't able to uh make a good podcast

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,359
so I've decided to not make videos of

24
00:01:00,878 --> 00:01:05,640
the show what I will do is keep making

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680
cheesy ass YouTube videos with iMovie

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,200
and just put up videos that are mostly

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,240
still shots there'll be some video in

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,000
there but it'll mostly be stills of

29
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:14,679
stuff that is involved in the podcast

30
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,920
I'll take pictures of rigs pictures of

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,600
plants pictures of the guests people

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,640
pictures of myself it'll be stuff like

33
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:22,199
that because doing a video really wasn't

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,840
very fun I'm going to fade out this

me to wear this as a pendant is what I

56

think's happening MH and this rig is

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
certainly designed to be worn as a

58
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,120
pendant uh this thing I think Adam said

59

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,400

this everything you've heard is why I

476
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
the actual owner of the Alaska Cannabis

477
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,479
Club will be dedicating all of my energy

478
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,198

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,759
which begins with legalizing marijuana

484
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:40,559
controversy um she in my opinion the

485
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:43,599
attention should have been on um her

486
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:46,559
advocacy her support and her uh fight to

487
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,000
legalize and support cannabis instead

488
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,758
she chose one wrong word on the air on

489
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,559
TV and distracted it from all of what

490
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,159
she was trying to do she said the word

491
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:58,479
that cost me a dollar on the air on TV

492
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,000
so that Adam pointed it out that that TV

493
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,639
station is going to face a fine

494
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,440
absolutely the FCC is going to do

495
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,240
something even if it was early morning

496
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,679
and there was very small numbers yeah

497
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,160
there still yeah it could that looked

498
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,959
like a normal FCC goes from like 2500 to

499
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,319
like you know 250,000 she probably end

500
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:18,318
up paying the fine can they find her um

501
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,078
they they may able to but still that was

502
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,918
rude and her choice of words distracted

503
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:25,959
from her whole fight it made her kind of

504
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:27,600
look bad she could have quit on air and

505
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:30,080
probably sent a better message but it

506
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,879
wouldn't have been her

507
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,599
it wouldn't have been heard so broadly

508
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,480
it it would not have been heard by the

509
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:38,159
non since everybody has seen this on

510
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,798
every if the day it happened I opened up

511
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,519
my Facebook and it was all anybody had

512
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:44,918
posted all day so apparently she she got

513
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,519
herself popular the way she was trying

514
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:47,720
to do but I me she could have done a

515
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,599
little bit better of a job but then

516
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:53,038
there's also the you know I'm not saying

517
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,839
that the marijuana business is going to

518
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,440
fail but maybe she hits a snafu and it

519
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,038
kind of crumbles from underneath her

520
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,400
maybe she trusts the wrong part or

521
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:04,359
there's some kind of illegal there's all

522
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,038
kinds of things that could happen and

523
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:08,038
from here on out she's never getting a

524
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:09,599
reporting job again oh no you know

525
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:11,879
you're never getting on any kind of

526
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:14,000
capable access let alone you know making

527
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,559
a comedy show you know maybe that she

528
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,240
can come on our podcast whenever she'd

529
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:19,038
like well there you go there's the open

530
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,839
invitation yeah all right I'll keep

531
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,440
going with the article uh in the YouTube

532
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:24,199
clip green explained why she believes

533
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,679
the fight for marijuana legalization in

534
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,840
her home state is so

535
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,720
important there Comes A Time in each and

536
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:31,639
every one of our lives where we must

537
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,600
choose to continue to spectate or stand

538
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,600
up for what's right she said why are

539
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,759
Americans arrested every 30 seconds

540
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,558
alaskans every 4.3 hours why should an

541
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:42,480
aspiring someone lose their ability to

542
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,399
earn a higher education to become

543
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,038
someone they were not meant to be and

544
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,120
why should you lose the ability to get

545
00:18:46,038 --> 00:18:51,679
public assistance in times of struggle

546
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:52,959
and need she continued advocating for

547
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,320
freedom and fairness should be

548
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,319
everybody's Duty I'm making it my life

549
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,639
work to uphold what America stands for

550
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:03,119
truly life liberty and the pursuit of

551
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,240
happiness ideals now need to be

552
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:08,000
defended I I kind of agree with her

553
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:10,200
there I I agree with her but as I've

554
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,119
been told numerous times throughout my

555
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,600
life it's not what you do it's how you

556
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:18,519
do it

557
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,199
and as hearing it over and over again is

558
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:21,879
you shouldn't have said f you shouldn't

559
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:24,319
have said [ __ ] you shouldn't have said

560
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,799
this you know I hear it constantly but

561
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:27,119
if that's the type of person of who you

562
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,639
are and you're able to stand up to that

563
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:32,279
scrutiny I'm I'm I'll back that you know

564
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,880
I'm not the type of person to bite my

565
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,960
tongue especially if you crossed me and

566
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,559
I felt like I haven't done anything

567
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:43,440
wrong um so if they were going to fire

568
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:44,960
her [ __ ] that company you know uh 100%

569
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,519
they weren't going to fire her until she

570
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,319
said that she owned that canas club and

571
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,240
she was legit anyway she's got a backup

572
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,079
job so she could have just said and I

573
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,440
since that's probably my last report so

574
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:57,639
it was nice seeing you guys have a good

575
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,960
night you know instead of [ __ ] it I Quit

576
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,200
yeah for sure it would blown if you had

577
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,558
the OPP yeah it wouldn't have blown up

578
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,038
and if you had the opportunity to go on

579
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,720
the news in front of camera would you

580
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:07,200
rather say and tonight I respectfully

581
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,240

584
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:19,320
know but you being my friend would kind

585
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,080
of stand back and say yeah don't be you

586
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:23,759
yeah yeah all right so the last line of

587
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,558
the article says alaskans are set to

588
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,359
vote on ballot measure 2 which would

589
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:29,480
legalize possession of small amounts of

590
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,798
marijuana for recreational use in

591
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:34,000
November Colorado and Washington have

592
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,839
implemented similar legislation in the

593
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,159
last year what the [ __ ] have they been

594
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,240
doing up there they made it against the

595
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,880
law to like drink in separate counties

596
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,200
that was ballot initiative one I'm

597
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,600
guessing and ballot initiative two is to

598
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,720
maybe legalized marijuana dude did you

599
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:50,839
hear the ratio a minute ago when it was

600
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,880
like every 30 seconds an American is

601
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:58,079
rested in in in in for pot in every 4.3

602
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,799
minutes in 4.3 hours in Alaska D what a

603
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:04,399
big [ __ ] ratio what are they doing up

604
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:06,079
there Arrested moose like hey get out

605

606
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,519
that's moose knuckles

607
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,960
well yeah well hopefully they legalize

608
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,639
possession of small amounts of marijuana

609
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,960
for recreational use in November that

610
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,960
would be freaking awesome uh they would

611
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:24,038
give us a lot less to watch on Alaskan

612

it's usually afterwards you know it's

630
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,278
usually at this point in time where

631
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:05,158

632

know you got to fail to learn how many

647
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,038
if you try stuff and you do it perfectly

648
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,600
you're like I'm [ __ ] good at that I

649
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:42,158
owe a dollar for that one but if you do

650
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:43,879
something and you fail you're like boy

651
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,120
I'm humbled I really failed I got to

652
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:47,360
learn how to do this right yeah you

653
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,359
don't learn anything the first time you

654
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:54,079
get stuff right I agree so where' that

655
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,719
article go where is it here it is uh

656
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,918
Adam actually brought this article to my

657
00:22:55,720 --> 00:23:00,839
attention it's written by Jeremy P Meyer

658
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:04,600
uh we found this on the denverpost.com

659
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:08,278
it says Colorado schools out Millions

660
00:23:04,599 --> 00:23:11,798
due to marijuana excise tax

661
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:13,519
loophole well it's not they're not out

662
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:14,879
this this sounds like they had millions

663
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,158
in their pockets and somebody reached in

664
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,240
and took it out that's not the way this

665
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,200
went that's the way I read it yeah I

666
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,558
read this article it's a little

667
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,360
misleading but they have to do that with

668
00:23:21,558 --> 00:23:25,000
headlines to get you to read it the

669
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:27,240
schools did get kind of punked a little

670
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,519
bit but it wasn't a loophole it was a

671
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,359
business move and it wasn't aimed it

672
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:32,759
nobody was like let's screw the schools

673
00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,119
nobody did that it was just what

674
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:35,599
business people were doing because it's

675
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:38,599
how business was being done at the time

676
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:40,038
how the law was wrote yeah yeah the yeah

677
00:23:38,599 --> 00:23:41,839
so it says a loophole built into

678
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:43,879
Colorado's marijuana system has allowed

679
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,359
thousands of pounds of pot to go untaxed

680
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,679
and has cost the state millions of

681
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,719
dollars that should have gone to school

682
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:51,720
construction Fund in 2012 Colorado

683
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:54,079
voters overwhelmingly approved amendment

684
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,000
64 which among other things promised

685
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:58,918
that the first $40 million in excise tax

686
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,159
revenue would be dedicated every year

687
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,360
for the state school construction fund

688
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,039
but this year only about $10 million is

689
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,678
expected to be raised thanks to a rule

690
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,119
that allows marijuana retailers to avoid

691
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,840
paying the tax in a one-time transfer of

692
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:14,678
wholesale

693
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:16,519
pot sure sorry I had to clear my my face

694
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:18,640
there surely Revenue will increase over

695
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:20,200
time as the industry continues to mature

696
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,080
and fewer license holders are able to

697
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,880
use the onetime tax-free transfer so

698
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:26,000
what they're able to do I haven't read

699
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,399
far enough into the article here but

700
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,159
what they're able to do shops that have

701
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:32,079
medical marijuana are able to move it

702
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,679
from their medical marijuana side to

703
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,319
their recreational marijuana side to

704
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,038
make it available for everybody instead

705
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:40,839
of just medical patients but there must

706
00:24:38,038 --> 00:24:43,119
be a tax paid when that happens because

707
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:45,959
the taxes are different uh on the

708
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:47,918
medical side and the rec side and uh

709
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,600
Colorado tried to protect the medical

710
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,159
side a little bit by doing this but in

711
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:54,558
my opinion it has failed so uh I'll

712
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:57,159
continue into the article whether the

713
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,119
excise tax revenue will uh ever reach 40

714
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,840
million is anyone's guess my suspicion

715
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,158
is the amount will never be attained as

716
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:07,359
and was a pie in the sky figure meant to

717
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:09,520
attract voters if that sounds familiar

718
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,359
you may be remembering the 2008 campaign

719
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,359
for Amendment 50 that promised 182

720
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:17,038
million over 5 years to community

721
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:19,119
colleges from the expansion of gaming

722
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,278
however only 25.3 million has been

723
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,319
generated through the fiscal year 2012

724
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:24,398
to

725
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:25,678
2013 half the people are spending their

726
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:28,678
money on

727
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,120
pot the marijuana X Tax reeven revenues

728
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,880
would certainly grow if the loophole uh

729
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,759
that was created by Regulators to launch

730
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,159
the industry was closed there are still

731
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:40,079
275 license holders who could take

732
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,520
advantage of it according to One

733
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,000
Source the loophole was created to make

734
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:47,038
sure enough pot would be in the retail

735
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,319
Marketplace when doors opened on January

736
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:50,519
1st

737
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:53,480
2014 Regulators allowed medical

738
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,918
marijuana lenses converting to retail a

739
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,960
one-time tax-free

740
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,480
transfer that transfer was a big

741
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,120
difference between Colorado and

742
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,000
Washington the other state that

743
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:04,000
legalized retail

744
00:26:04,278 --> 00:26:07,919
marijuana and why the sorry I had to

745
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,278
reread that s because it looked weird to

746
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,600
me something didn't sound right but okay

747
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:13,679
that transfer was a big difference

748
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,158
between Colorado was the big difference

749
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,440
is what it should say between Colorado

750
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:18,520
and Washington the other state that

751
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,200
legalized retail marijuana okay and why

752
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:22,440
the Centennial state was out the door

753
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,679
first Washington had to grow its retail

754
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:30,840
crop from seed Colorado officials say

755
00:26:26,679 --> 00:26:34,759
9,711 lb of medical pot was transferred

756
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:37,398
tax-free to re retail stores

757
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,839
4,724 lb of medical marijuana was moved

758
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:42,319
to retail marijuana products and

759
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,918
manufacturers and

760
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,879
8,576 lbs of medical pot was transferred

761
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,240
to retail marijuana cultivation

762
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,600
facilities that last trench will be

763
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,839
subject to the tax once it is

764
00:26:52,599 --> 00:26:57,719
transferred or sold to another marijuana

765
00:26:55,839 --> 00:26:59,398
establishment yeah there will be taxes

766
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:02,679
made on this just not that original

767
00:26:59,398 --> 00:27:04,519
transfer tax so it says it is estimated

768
00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,000
the untaxed pot would have provided $3

769
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:08,000
million for the state school

770
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,000
construction fund or twice what the fund

771
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,720
received in the fiscal year Kathy

772

board that provides grants for schools

777

construction and renovation knew the

778
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,119
numbers were going to be low after

779
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,519
seeing February's receipts the first

780
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,519
month we were thinking we're going to be

781
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:30,759
rolling in cash she said then the second

782
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,158
month it was wait a minute we're only

783
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,480
getting fractions of what we thought

784
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,360
were we were going to get in this this

785
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,558
was not the voter intent she said I

786
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:41,558
don't think anyone who voted for

787
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:42,960
amendment 64 thought this would happen

788
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:45,079
she

789
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,640
said they thought the money would go to

790
00:27:45,079 --> 00:27:49,678
school kids this is coming at the

791

boilers marijuana taxes are providing

810
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,799
less than 1% of the program's funds or

811
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,679
$3.1 million it would have made a big

812
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,679
difference she said whether there is a

813
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,559
tax credit on the other side there is

814
00:28:38,679 --> 00:28:41,480
somebody to whom the tax credit should

815
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,599
have

816
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:47,038
gone okay proposition doua which was

817
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:50,678
approved by voters in 2013 mandates a

818
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,359
15% excise tax on imposed imposed on

819
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:54,919
unprocessed retail

820
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,719
marijuana but amendment 64 says no

821
00:28:54,919 --> 00:28:58,759
excise taxes can be charged on pot

822
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,120
cultivated as medical marijuana

823
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:03,119
a transfer logically of medically grown

824
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,398
pot couldn't be taxed which is the basis

825
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,719
for the loophole The Simple Solution

826
00:29:05,398 --> 00:29:09,359
then is to discontinu transfers the

827
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,159
state doesn't need them anyway the

828
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:12,639
retail pot industry is up and running

829
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,440
now and doesn't need the influx of

830
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,278
medical pot to prop up retail stores

831
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,919
plus transfers disadvantaged retail

832
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:22,759
Growers who have to pay the tax when

833
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,840
medical Growers don't for that onetime

834
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:27,679
swap it was never our intent to

835
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,918
manipulate the market said rep danan Pon

836
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,159
it's correct uh it's a correction that

837
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,038
needs to be made he said also a draft

838
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,039
Bill already had been written that would

839
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:39,679
stop the transfer after January 1st 2016

840
00:29:38,038 --> 00:29:41,679
but the loophole should be closed sooner

841
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:43,679
to match the voter's intent and make

842
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,480
good on a promise that the revenue

843
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,919
should be going to

844
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,558
schools I I agree yeah the revenue

845
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:53,240
should go to the schools

846
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:55,200
but where's the other money going like

847
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:58,319
if

848
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,679
if why did it get exempt from the school

849
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,759
tools if

850
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:05,519
if I understand 40 million 40 million

851
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:09,558
sounds like a lot just that money they

852
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:11,798
said not make 40 million in like the

853
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:15,558
first 48

854
00:30:11,798 --> 00:30:18,079
Hours um maybe in total sales maybe but

855
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:19,918
what they're saying is uh this tax that

856
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:21,759
they had this tax set up this tax was

857
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,278
supposed to go here and the money didn't

858
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,240
happen because these guys found a way to

859
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,679
not make the money we we had that you

860
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,159
read that article not that long ago

861
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,480
where it was 1.9 tax $1 1.9 million of

862
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:35,320
taxable money from this County alone

863
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:37,440
right well that was that's set up to go

864
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:38,720
to different places that this fund this

865
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,278
one is the one that didn't happen

866
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,120
because they said this money right here

867
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:44,440
specifically that's just [ __ ] why

868
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:47,000
they who who was the one was like yeah

869
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:48,640
cut the kids out you know like in the

870
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,440
council was like I got a good idea well

871
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,840
that's what I'm saying they didn't

872
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,640
that's it wasn't even aimed to do that

873
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:54,720
it's just kind of this rule was set up

874
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,200
to help them have enough herb for when

875
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,798
the shops opened but that was also they

876
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,558
said when this money is made it's going

877
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,558
to the schools but that just didn't get

878
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:04,480
made nobody was really like [ __ ] that

879
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,759
fund [ __ ] those kids that's

880
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,599
$2 uh nobody was really like that it's

881
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:10,759
just that's just how it worked out that

882
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:13,240
they found a way around that like if I

883
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:16,240
told you it would be nice if they were

884
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:20,440
like all right this we we got we were

885
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,319
expecting you know maybe $100 million

886
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,759
for the first year and they just said

887
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,278
you know what we'll have the best

888
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:29,440
schools anywhere you know like here just

889
00:31:26,278 --> 00:31:33,638
take this next cheers us you know we'll

890
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:38,200
we'll divy it up but there why not you

891
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:40,359
know drop that common cor [ __ ] and get

892
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:43,399
on with your [ __ ] lives tell the rest

893
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:45,398
of the country that you we the high ones

894
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:48,079
yeah yeah

895
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:50,119
um we're not going to do

896
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:51,599
that I kind of agree that they should

897
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,719
change the rule by

898
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,959
2016 uh they're right if the shops are

899
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,919
doing it right they don't need to move

900
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,960
herb

901
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,240
around and if you're growing Medical

902
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:02,159
herbit needs to be there for the

903
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,679
patients mhm yeah so they didn't really

904
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,440
purposely screw the kids out that's just

905
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,720
how like if I told you if you uh drive

906
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,720
around the block every day on your work

907
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,759
you don't have to pay the $3 toll fee

908
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,319
but that $3 to toll fee goes to the SK

909
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:15,440
to the school kids you still drive her

910
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:17,278
on the Block you wouldn't give a [ __ ]

911
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,278
about that $3 and that's kind of what

912
00:32:17,278 --> 00:32:19,839
they did they just drove her on the

913
00:32:18,278 --> 00:32:21,240
Block they didn't really they didn't go

914
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:23,158
take the three bucks and stab somebody

915
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,319
for it they just skipped paying it they

916
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:29,320
figured out speaking of this whole

917
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:31,558
taking medical and taking it recre

918
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:33,759
um I went out to the shop the other day

919
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:34,599
I won't say which one but it was for

920
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,278
their

921
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:41,240
special there was nothing on the medical

922
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:43,480
side zero and they're like well you can

923
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,359
choose from the recreational there was

924
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,919
literally four

925
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:51,240
kinds and it was all sativa heavy 70%

926
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,360
you know who knows what they're talking

927
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,120
about I'm pretty sure I know what shop

928
00:32:52,359 --> 00:32:57,638
you went to and they've recently opened

929
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:58,839
up another location north of here and I

930
00:32:57,638 --> 00:33:00,638
have a a friend who stopped there just

931
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:02,319
the other day and they were hopping and

932
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:04,119
the place was full and had all kinds of

933
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:05,398
great [ __ ] so what they've done is

934
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:07,839
they've taken all their product from

935
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:11,239
their PUO West location no it's full

936
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:13,199
like well oh maybe they their their

937
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,558
marijuana yes but uh they they had a

938
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,360
whole shelf of shatter whole bunch of

939
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:20,720
new extracts and things like that and

940
00:33:18,359 --> 00:33:22,319
all kinds of other stuff except for bud

941
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,120
and it was their special day and I was

942
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:27,439
in there like

943
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:29,839
11:00 you know it's yeah the shops need

944
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,240
to get together in my opinion for

945
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:34,000
sure I'm just saying that affected us

946
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,159
you know that affected us here locally

947
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,798
that affected me locally medical

948
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,519
patients you're on the that's so why

949
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:42,319
that really sucks is because as a

950
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:46,679
medical on the medical side the herb is

951
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:50,439
cheaper to just to start um it's

952
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,360
considered medicine it's it's not even

953
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,759
uh you know I I I'm not going to lie

954
00:33:52,359 --> 00:33:56,278
about it I have it for not strangling my

955
00:33:54,759 --> 00:33:57,398
wife and children don't say that on

956
00:33:56,278 --> 00:33:58,480
there there you have it for stress

957
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:00,079
relief

958
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,519
but so on the medical side it's a little

959
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:04,000
bit cheaper to start with on the

960
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,519
recreational side they charge you more

961
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,119
then on the recreational side they add a

962
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,918
tax to it so let's just move the same

963
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,919
product from the recreational from the

964
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:14,158
medical side right over to the

965
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:16,559
recreational side mark it up 10 bucks an

966
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,480
e more screw the medical patients out of

967
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:21,000
it more than that 15 bucks an eigh more

968
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,838
half it's half the price more yeah right

969
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,960
so so yeah just mark it up way high

970
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:26,078
charge an extra tax for it and then

971
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,079
don't even care about the medical

972
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,639
patients anymore how can a shop do that

973
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,280
how can a business owner do that and

974
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:34,519
look his patients his customers in the

975
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,399

1061
00:37:28,318 --> 00:37:31,639
title of this article I'm looking for

1062

1068
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,440
road um all right prosecutors object to

1069
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:50,079
war on weed by Chris weant I probably

1070
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,400
said that wrong but you know that's how

1071
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,839
I do stuff whoa technical glitch there

1072
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,800
sound like I cut out for a second anyway

1073
00:37:54,838 --> 00:37:58,318
uh where was I Chris we get all right

1074
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,440
the prosecution objects that's one way

1075
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:02,719
to put it at any rate two news stories

1076
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,679
from the Pacific Northwest today pose an

1077
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,159
interesting question are prosecutors

1078
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:07,960
beginning to get fed up with the war on

1079
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,199
weed the two stories are completely

1080
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,318
unrelated I should mention one is about

1081
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,960
a current prosecutor at the local level

1082
00:38:12,318 --> 00:38:16,480
and one is about a formal former Federal

1083
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,559
prosecutor making a noteworthy

1084
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,760
endorsement neither has anything to do

1085
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,880
with the other but both show some common

1086
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,640
sense being applied in a in refreshing

1087
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,960
ways it's too early to call it a trend

1088
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:29,598
even a regional Regional One but it

1089
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:32,920
certainly is a step in the right

1090
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,119
direction at the very least so first the

1091
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,800
local

1092
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:41,280
story Seattle's elector geez Seattle's

1093
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,200
elected prosecutor said Monday he's

1094
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,000
dropping all tickets issued for the

1095
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:47,078
public use of marijuana through the

1096
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,760
first seven months of this year because

1097
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:51,119
most of them were issued by a single

1098
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,599
officer who disagrees with the legal pot

1099
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,160
law in a briefing to City Council on

1100
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,880

1101
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:01,199
is moving to dismiss a approximately 100

1102
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:03,838
tickets issued by the Seattle Police

1103
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,279
Department between January 1st and July

1104
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:09,519
31st his office also said it would be

1105
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:13,519
seeking a refund for 22 people who have

1106
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:15,559
already paid their $27 ticket so one

1107
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,679
state to the South a former Federal

1108
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:19,519
prosecutor for Oregon has thrown her

1109
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:21,598
support behind a ballot initiative to

1110
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,838
legalize recreational marijuana for

1111
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,359
adults in the state Chris Olen who

1112
00:39:23,838 --> 00:39:28,039

1113
00:39:26,358 --> 00:39:30,119
prosecutor during the Clinton

1114
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,318
Administration made the news by joining

1115
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:36,280
House member Earl bomhower and a former

1116

1119
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,200
marijuana laws but they don't work

1120
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:45,358
Olsson said in a statement announcing

1121
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,879
her endorsement filling our courts and

1122

jails has failed to reduce marijuana use

1123
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,559
and drug cartels are pocketing all the

1124
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,199
profits she said citing fed Federal

1125
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:58,559

1133
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:18,519
the the guys who take care of patients

1134
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:20,920
they're like hold on they're not

1135
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:23,838
just we don't have control over

1136
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:25,639
everything so we need that and and

1137
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,480
that's what it's become it's not even a

1138
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:30,078
crime anymore so now they're starting to

1139
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,838
turn into well we're making tons of

1140
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,160
money but how can we get just a little

1141
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,239
more each year a little more each year

1142
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:37,519

1143
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,159
the old guys around here a lot of the

1144
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:42,358
oldtimers don't like to pay kind bud

1145
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,639
prices you know what I mean you can get

1146
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,880
if you know the right people you can get

1147
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:49,598
an eth of dank weed around here for 25

1148
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,680
bucks uh back in the day those guys used

1149
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,599
to buy that Mexican brick weed for $25 a

1150

two hits and they' just be [ __ ] but

1154
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:05,078
lately those guys are calling up like

1155
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:07,199
the guys I used to talk to years ago

1156
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:09,280
they're like hey man I I can you get any

1157

1158
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,960
of their old swag connects anymore all

1159
00:41:11,159 --> 00:41:15,719
that [ __ ] is gone that cartel Mexican

1160
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,318
import weed is disappearing so it's not

1161
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:21,000
around hook him up with that high CBD so

1162
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:22,199
we got a first story here and this is my

1163
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,838
interjection here I'm not into the

1164
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:25,919
article right now uh the first story

1165
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:27,799
here is about a prosecutor saying that

1166
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,720
he's going to drop tickets written by a

1167
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,839
cop because that cop's a dick and did

1168
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,559
this out of his own you reported on this

1169
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:35,599
on an earlier episode yeah yeah [ __ ]

1170
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:38,440
that cop I'll take a dollar for that one

1171
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,920
yeah uh and then we have another person

1172
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:44,039
saying uh the laws don't work and they

1173
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,720
state that they actually the drug

1174
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:48,039
cartels are profiting so it it looks

1175
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,239
like some people are starting to

1176
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,960
understand some people are starting to

1177
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:53,959
see the light these are positive reasons

1178
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,000
why we want to legalize cannabis so I'll

1179
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:58,119
get back into the article in the first

1180
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,280
instance this was nothing short of a

1181
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,280
prosecutor using using his prosecutorial

1182
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,280
discretion to avoid wasting a lot of

1183
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,599
time in the courts and more importantly

1184
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,519
to reign in reign in one police officer

1185
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,400
who was obviously on a vendetta against

1186
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,358
the voters for passing a law he did not

1187
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,800
personally approve of one single police

1188
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:18,880
officer was was responsible for eight

1189
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,960
out of all 10 tickets issued in the

1190
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,440
Seattle for public in Seattle for public

1191
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,039
consumption of marijuana during the

1192
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,800
first half of this year the other 20%

1193
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:29,519
were written by the entire rest of the

1194
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:31,318
police Force to put this in another way

1195
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:34,280
this officer wrote one ticket he

1196
00:42:31,318 --> 00:42:36,239
considered uh this officer on one ticket

1197
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:37,079
wrote he considered the new legalization

1198
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,078
law

1199
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:41,720
silly while the other off while the

1200
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:44,119
officer has been reassigned new duties

1201
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:45,879
after this came to light there are a lot

1202
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:48,880
of folks with cases still in the legal

1203
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:50,800
system as a result of his actions what a

1204
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,960
dick of a cop cops don't realize what

1205
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,559
they're doing to you when they screw you

1206
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,039

1207
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:56,880
or whatever you're doing they don't and

1208
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:58,679
some of them do and they love it that

1209

was impressive smokes pot not a bad

1225
00:43:27,318 --> 00:43:31,920
person right yeah uh in Washington state

1226
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:33,838
of course recreational marijuana use is

1227
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,519
legal the voters approved the change in

1228
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,239
state law and the prosecutors actions

1229
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,119
quite obviously reflect the PE the will

1230
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:41,279
of the people but it didn't have to

1231
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:43,240
happen this way prosecutors in general

1232
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,319
are pretty much tough on crime types of

1233
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:47,039
people and if this particular prosecutor

1234
00:43:45,318 --> 00:43:48,880
has agreed with the cop's way of

1235
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,000
thinking then all these cases would have

1236
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,400
continued to clog the legal system all

1237
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,318
the way to The Bitter End all $27 of it

1238
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,440
this prosecutor however objected to that

1239
00:43:56,318 --> 00:43:59,759
scenario and applied some common sense

1240
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:02,400
he's even going the extra mile and

1241
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,160
trying to refund fines already paid that

1242
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,119
is truly commendable that is a truly

1243
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,480
commendable action once again reflecting

1244
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:10,880
the will of the voters in legal reality

1245
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,079
the second news item doesn't seem to

1246
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,880
deal with actual legal cases it comes

1247
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,079
from a prosecutor who no longer works

1248
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,119
for the for the Federal Department of

1249
00:44:17,079 --> 00:44:21,640
Justice still this is a stunning

1250
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,838
development Federal prosecutors after

1251
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:25,719
all are not bound by any state law and

1252
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:28,119
therefore can apply federal law whether

1253
00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,439
marijuana is still the most legal of all

1254
00:44:28,119 --> 00:44:32,599
drugs where marijuana is still the most

1255
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,880
legal of all Dr illegal of all drugs

1256
00:44:32,599 --> 00:44:36,680
without even having to weigh in on state

1257
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,240
politics Believe It or Not There are

1258
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:40,199
some extremely zealous Federal

1259
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,919
prosecutors all up and down the West

1260
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,118
Coast who are fighting tooth and nail

1261
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,838
against any state legalization efforts

1262
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:48,960
in unprecedented and creative ways so

1263
00:44:46,838 --> 00:44:51,960
hearing even a former prosecutor bluntly

1264
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:54,119
refute the entire purpose of the Federal

1265
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,519
war on weed is a welcome development

1266
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:58,400
indeed the language she used is a pretty

1267
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,358
strong condemn nation of federal laws

1268
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,639
she upheld while in office I enforced

1269
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:04,159
our marijuana laws and they don't work

1270
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,838
prosecutors are practical people who

1271
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,799
deal with the real end aftermath of

1272
00:45:05,838 --> 00:45:10,358
arresting marijuana users so the

1273
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:12,680
argument used is not a is a is not a

1274
00:45:10,358 --> 00:45:15,239
moral One locking up marijuana users is

1275
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:16,759
wrong or one of racial equality black

1276
00:45:15,239 --> 00:45:18,879
and brown people are treated differently

1277
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:20,800
by the court system or even a political

1278
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:22,599
one The public's mood has shifted

1279
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,599
instead it's a view from the front lines

1280
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:26,640
of the drug war which relies on personal

1281
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:28,440
experience in applying federal laws and

1282
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:30,838
the relative effectiveness of carrying

1283
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,880
out this job I enforced our marijuana

1284
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:35,480
laws and they don't

1285
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,680
work so this person instead of just

1286
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:39,960
playing by the book basically saying had

1287
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:42,118
weed go to jail had weed go to jail had

1288
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,639
a lot of weed go to prison MH they're

1289
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,079
actually looking at what they're doing

1290
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:47,279
to people like I was saying they're

1291
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:49,200
saying you had some weed you're a human

1292
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,359
let's quit smoking weed here's a fine

1293
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,480
get your [ __ ] together don't go to

1294
00:45:50,358 --> 00:45:54,119
prison forever don't go get butt raped

1295
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,400
turn it they're taking some compassion

1296
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:57,440
into this

1297
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:00,000
finally they're just start to hear the

1298
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,639
other side of the story and that's all

1299
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,838
you nine times out of 10 you got to do

1300
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,519
uh you know when you're going to court

1301
00:46:04,838 --> 00:46:08,199
and standing in front of the judge

1302
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:11,119
everybody just kind of pushes you behind

1303
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:13,960
your lawyer or public DET Pretender you

1304
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:15,920
know sitting there and that's that they

1305
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:17,639
say you have your day but a lot of times

1306
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,400
they just ask you if you understand and

1307
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:20,838
it's a yes or no question is all you

1308
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,160
really get

1309
00:46:20,838 --> 00:46:24,960
so it's good that they're finally

1310
00:46:23,159 --> 00:46:27,879
starting to be like what did you have

1311
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,800
you know yeah so all right so of all the

1312
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,880
pro-legalization arguments this could

1313
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,839
perhaps be the strongest one the laws

1314
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:35,318
don't work they don't have the intended

1315
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:37,078
effect the feds have been fighting the

1316
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:41,119
war on weed for almost a century now

1317
00:46:37,079 --> 00:46:43,280
with precious little to show for it uh

1318
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,760
yeah definitely right and in fact they

1319
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,960
have severe unintended consequences drug

1320
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,440
cartel drug cartels are pocketing all of

1321
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,838
the profits therefore mindlessly

1322
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:54,720
continuing on the same course is nothing

1323
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:56,920
short of Madness I think that's what

1324
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,399
they call Insanity Chris Olson is not

1325
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,318
the first law enforcement officer to

1326
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,760
have this Revelation and begin publicly

1327
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:04,558
trying to change the situation an entire

1328
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,760
organization already exists law

1329
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,519
enforcement against prohibition or leap

1330
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:10,559
for members of the law enforcement

1331
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:13,039
Community passed in present to Advocate

1332
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:15,800
the marijuana legal reform many members

1333
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:17,639
are former cops who have firsthand who

1334
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,960
saw firsthand how pointless the entire

1335
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:22,118
war on weed truly was throughout their

1336
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,519
careers now free to the prospect of

1337
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:25,160
ending their career over a public

1338
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,358
statement many are speaking out on the

1339
00:47:25,159 --> 00:47:29,358
subject their message is a simple one

1340
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:31,679
prohibition didn't work and prohibition

1341
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:35,400
of marijuana isn't working

1342
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:38,199
either Chris Olen is to be commended for

1343
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,079
raising her own prose prosecutorial

1344
00:47:38,199 --> 00:47:41,598
objection and for knowing her public

1345
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,880
support behind a ballot measure in the

1346
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,160
state where she used to uphold the law

1347
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:47,318
the personal connection to the state

1348
00:47:45,159 --> 00:47:49,799
ballot measure might convince a few

1349
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:52,440
voters even though even tough on crime

1350
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,079
types uh that the sorry let me move this

1351
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:57,440
page it's all scrolling on its own there

1352
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:58,800
we go uh where were we uh all the rest

1353
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,838
of the arguments aside the law needs

1354
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,559
changing because it doesn't work it does

1355
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:04,239
nothing short of waste time for the

1356
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,800
entire judicial system for something

1357
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:07,959
which shouldn't even be illegal in the

1358
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:10,318
first place the Oregon ballot measure

1359
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,079
race may be close the year Washington

1360
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,119
and Colorado legalized recreational

1361
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:16,200
marijuana Oregon had a similar but badly

1362
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:18,200
written initiative on its ballot it

1363
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:20,519
failed this time around the effort is a

1364
00:48:18,199 --> 00:48:22,879
lot more serious but reliable pulling on

1365
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:25,199
the subject is notoriously hard to do so

1366
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,559
the V the vote might be very close in

1367
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,439
November guys if you're in Oregon when

1368
00:48:27,559 --> 00:48:33,480
this comes up go vote to legalize

1369
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:35,200
cannabis so pro-legalization groups will

1370
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,920
be very closely watching the vote this

1371
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:39,879
year in Oregon and in Alaska and

1372
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,880
Washington DC so assumably

1373
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:45,200
assumably sorry my throat's burning out

1374
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,358
I'm trying to go fast assumably they'll

1375
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,159
also be closely watching the impact of

1376
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:51,440
olsson's simple the laws don't work

1377
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:53,159
message olsson's message is a powerful

1378
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,760
one because it could reach voters not

1379
00:48:53,159 --> 00:48:56,960
generally open to other uh

1380
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:58,920
pro-legalization arguments if you're a

1381
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,798
Law and Order type of voter a formal

1382
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:03,039
former Federal Prosecutor's opinion

1383
00:49:00,798 --> 00:49:04,880
should carry some weight in other words

1384
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:07,000
perhaps more prosecutors both state and

1385
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:09,039
federal both current and former can be

1386
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,440
enlisted in this movement as I said it

1387
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,920
is far too early to call this any sort

1388
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,240
of trend but it certainly is a

1389
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,358
development worth taking note of to end

1390
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:19,000
on the legal theme we began on perhaps

1391
00:49:17,358 --> 00:49:20,860
the voters will sustain these

00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:53,798
just open for debate at least yeah well

1404
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:56,719
and maybe like they said maybe now that

uh the state hasn't melted the older

people don't want to hear from you and

1407
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:02,759
me that weed is harmless that cannabis

1408
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:04,558
is helpful that medical marijuana will

1409
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,160
help you people don't want to hear that

1410
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:09,040
but if you're a former if you're a

1411

former from the FED then they have to

listen to you because you're obviously
