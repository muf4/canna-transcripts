00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,980
like to start the podcast off by letting

41
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,079
you know what I'm smoking on today I'm

42
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:32,329
taking dabs of some stuff called sinful

43
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,829
bananas this came from contraband

44
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:35,929
concentrates it's the in-house

45
00:01:33,829 --> 00:01:38,030
concentrate company at a cut above in

46
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,200
Colorado Springs when I pull this out of

47
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:41,030
the container here and give it a fresh

48
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,109
smell and I tell you guys what I think

49
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:49,099
about it when you smell it it's got a

50
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:50,629
little funky like a cookie cushy kind of

51
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:53,000
an aroma to it but then when you dab it

52
00:01:50,629 --> 00:01:54,769
it totally tastes like banana runts if

53
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,359
you've ever had a banana run or those

54
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:57,829
little banana shaped candies that come

55
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:59,090
from the little machine you put your

56
00:01:57,829 --> 00:02:00,590
quarter in there you turn the knob and

57
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,329
all the fruit shaped candy comes out

58
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,950
there's some banana shapes in there

59
00:02:02,329 --> 00:02:05,390
that's what this tastes like when you

60
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:06,859
dab it I'm gonna grab the little package

61
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:09,699
here and we'll read some test results on

62
00:02:06,859 --> 00:02:12,560
here it's got a nice lab test result of

63
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,219
eighty-seven point eight percent THC and

64
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,920
the description is

65
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:18,449
mint cookies and honey bananas blended

66
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:20,869
perfectly I would agree with that

67
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,799
delicious concentrate it's got a nice

68
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:24,240
headstone and when it writes my eyes

69
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,010
right to my head it made my shoulders

70
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,629
nice and relaxed nice mellow indica

71
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:28,889
stone I would say great concentrate

72
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,870
something new I haven't tried that

73
00:02:28,889 --> 00:02:33,029
before so I'm digging these sinful

74
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,009
bananas sauce I've got to say I really

75
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,810
enjoy the texture and consistency I

76
00:02:35,009 --> 00:02:39,209
complain a lot then when I buy sauce

77
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,069
it's too saucy which sounds ridiculous

78
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,930
but there's just too much turf water in

79
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:45,180
there and I don't that's not what I

80
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,530
prefer I prefer more crystals these guys

81
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,300
put plenty of crystals in there the

82
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,610
crystals aren't tiny but they're also

83
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,170
not so huge that you're smoking all of

84
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,570
the gram in two dads because the

85
00:02:52,169 --> 00:02:57,509
crystals are so big so great consistency

86
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:58,829
I do approve all right you guys let's

87
00:02:57,509 --> 00:03:01,259
move forward with the podcast we have

88
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:04,500

90
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:09,180

91
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,200
generous very generous contribution they

92
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,490

118
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:07,469
emails with messages with Instagram

119
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,930
interactions with patreon contributions

120
00:04:07,469 --> 00:04:11,939
it has been a lot of fun lately I have

121
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,980
made a bunch of changes in my life I was

122
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,120
a little concerned about things and you

123
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:17,579
guys have reassured me that everything

124
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,970
will be just fine so thank you guys for

125
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,250
the love and support we ranked 635 out

126
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,720
of 40,000 shows on stitcher and you guys

127
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:26,189
a lot of people are still telling me

128
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,960
they're having problems with stitcher

129
00:04:26,189 --> 00:04:30,180
intermittently random

130
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,069
stitcher won't work for you that means

131
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,930
there are people trying to listen that

132
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:36,719
aren't able to listen I'm willing to bet

133
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,840
that once I get that issue corrected we

134
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,820
will get into the top 500 on stitcher so

135
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,469

145
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,050
expected a little podcast to get this

146
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,610
far I was just doing this because I

147
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:06,720
wanted to talk about weed I wanted to

148
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,879
correct some things I read on the

149
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,620
Internet I really didn't think I'd get

150
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:12,598
300 and something episodes in and now

151

153
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:18,149
the main part of this podcast I've been

154
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,650
rambling for about 5 minutes and we

155
00:05:18,149 --> 00:05:22,109
haven't touched on the main topic of

156
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:24,448
this podcast I've gotten a lot of

157
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,520
positive feedback on the strain report

158
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:28,669
episodes that I have done in the past

159
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:32,009
I've done strain reports on morning dew

160
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:33,779
Firefly and the cream the responses to

161
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:36,120
those episodes are overwhelming and you

162
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:39,598

166
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,589
Jeffrey would rival four top two with a

167
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:50,959
grateful dog in their for top three we

168
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:53,399
can talk about that in the future but

169
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,658
currently arises one of my favorites to

170
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:56,939
work with I've been breeding with the

171
00:05:54,658 --> 00:05:58,889
rise I've got a male a rise plant that I

172
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:00,800
call King Solomon he is what I've been

173
00:05:58,889 --> 00:06:05,069
making a lot of my fresh creations with

174
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,579
arise test consistently in the high 20s

175
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:07,579
and low 30s

176
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:11,489
our friends of Arg antica in Albuquerque

177
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:13,709
New Mexico

178
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,500
grew some seeds that I gave them they

179
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:19,198
grew the arize seeds they had it tested

180
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:22,889
at steep hill labs that lab test was

181
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,158
tested one time and it revealed 35.8 4

182
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:28,650
percent THC steep hill insisted on

183
00:06:26,158 --> 00:06:31,168
testing it again then they tested it a

184
00:06:28,649 --> 00:06:33,060
third time and after that third test

185
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:35,579
they decided to call and tell our

186
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:38,339
friends at arg antica that we had hit 35

187
00:06:35,579 --> 00:06:40,800
point eight four percent THC a and it

188
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:41,459
was the record of highest THC a test at

189
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,050
that

190
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:44,819
I don't know if anything has tested

191
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,340
higher than that but at one point in

192
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:50,159
time a rise held the record for highest

193
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:51,810
THC lab test with steep hill labs and

194
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,540
that was grown again by our friends at

195
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,519
organic ax in Albuquerque New Mexico and

196
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,140
it's not just the lab test that makes me

197
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:59,669
super proud of a rise although that does

198
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,740
that is bragging rights and that is

199
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,720
something I can show but I think I

200
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:04,410
nailed what I was going for when I made

201
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,810
the cross

202
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:08,790
I took an OG Kush kind of a diesel chem

203
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,280
II dominant plant and crossed it with a

204
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,069
candy flavored tropical plant and I got

205
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,949
that perfect 50/50 indica sativa balance

206
00:07:14,069 --> 00:07:18,659
that seems to work very well but dissing

207
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:21,000
aleef or a lot of people and it seems to

208
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,890
work very well recreational for a lot of

209
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,110
people so I I feel like I made a great

210
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:26,789
strain I hit my target it's got a great

211
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,189
cushy flavor it's got a great tropical

212
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:31,170
flavor it's a very versatile strain it

213
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:34,079
Tess hi and people have been reporting

214
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:36,090
great results using it medically and I

215
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,099
feel like it gets me so lit that I am

216
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:40,889
smoking it recreationally when I smoke

217
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,840
arise I only need one medical dab of a

218
00:07:40,889 --> 00:07:44,849
rise ii dab of a rise that's all

219
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:45,839
recreational I also like the way our

220
00:07:44,850 --> 00:07:47,580
rice grows

221
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,689
she's very consistent I also like

222
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:50,519
breeding with her eyes like I've

223
00:07:48,689 --> 00:07:51,779
mentioned before a rise is just a great

224
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,729
strain to work with it's got a great

225
00:07:51,779 --> 00:07:55,859
structure there's so many great things

226
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,870
about a rise so let's talk a little bit

227
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,460
about the parents of a rise and we'll

228
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,430
get into the details here the parents of

229
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,859
a rise are a golden goat female golden

230
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:08,160
goat is Island sweet skunk cross to

231
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:09,810
Hawaiian sativa and Romulan a lot of

232
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,300
people on the internet give me credit

233
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:14,459
for making golden goat I did not do that

234
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,100
I made golden goat and feminized seed I

235
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,989
did not create golden goat golden goat

236
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,450
was made by a guy named mr. dank and

237
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:22,439
it's from Topeka Kansas so that's a

238
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:24,199
little knowledge for you we'll talk

239
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:26,519
about golden goat in the future also

240
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,550
golden goats kind of a tropical suit Eva

241
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:31,500
it doesn't grow super tall and it

242
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:33,779
doesn't grow super skinny that's because

243
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,700
they cross all of those sativas with the

244
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,350
Romulan and it kind of keeps it short

245
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,720
and it kind of lowered the flower time

246
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,060
but it still kept that tropical sativa

247
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,290
flavor and the skinny leaves and that

248
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,179
tropical head-high

249
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,159
golden goats got some great tropical

250
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:49,319
candy flavors it's kind of sweet and

251
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,409
fruity it tastes like that uh that gum

252
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,850
some some juicy fruit gum or maybe there

253
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,959
used to be these generic candies that

254
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,040
used to just come and apply

255
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,750
sticks leave and they were kind of

256
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:59,909
fruity flavored that's kind of what the

257
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,559
golden goat tastes like sometimes golden

258
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:03,389
goat is actually named here's a little

259
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:05,789
bit of knowledge golden goat is actually

260
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:07,919
named for the golden goat recycling

261
00:09:05,789 --> 00:09:09,839
center a guy that made golden goat lived

262
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,399
near a place called the golden goat

263
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,680
recycling center where people would

264
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,079
recycle cans and he said that in the

265
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:18,089
middle of the summer it made this sticky

266
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,530
sweet smell in the air and he said

267
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:21,389
that's what the golden goat plant

268
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:23,909
reminded him of and I could see that

269
00:09:21,389 --> 00:09:26,220
it's fruity and soda can like so if you

270
00:09:23,909 --> 00:09:28,079
had a whole bunch of syrupy soda that

271
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,180
was like get some orange soda and there

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,710
may be mixing in with all the colas it

273
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:33,899
would definitely give you that golden

274
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,490
goat sweetness kind of smell so that's

275
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,269
golden goat it stays short it stays

276
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,100
squat

277
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:39,689
it's Island sweet skunk and it's

278
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,370
Hawaiian sativa which gives it that

279
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:43,260
tropical flavor and the head high

280
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:45,629
then they cross the Romulan in there and

281
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:47,340
that keeps it short and stocky and makes

282
00:09:45,629 --> 00:09:49,679
it grow early or makes it flower early

283
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,570
and finish early and it's got that candy

284
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,399
flavor and a super sativa head high it

285
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:55,140
gives some people panic attacks I smoked

286
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,789
some golden go with the girl one time

287
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:59,639
and I just had to take her home that was

288
00:09:56,789 --> 00:10:03,419
the end of that day so that is the

289
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:06,750
female part of a rise the male the daddy

290
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:11,759
was day breaker day breaker is chem D

291
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:13,889
which is gassy funky fede kind of burnt

292
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,200
rubber fresh tennis ball sort of a smell

293
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:19,259
and then it's got Joseph's og in the mix

294
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:21,560
for that oh gee cush dirty feet funk

295
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:24,899
earth coffee sort of a flavor so

296
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:26,549
Daybreaker gives off a diesel e chemi

297
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,629
smelling cush sort of a thing it's

298
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:32,639
diesel cush chem fuel earth just funky

299
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:34,740
stuff dirty feet a little bit of armpits

300
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,319
in there maybe and the day breaker has a

301
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:39,000
very nice I call it a complete high it's

302
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,190
got a really good head buzz because it's

303
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,809
got that Kim D in there and then it's

304
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:44,550
got a really heavy body stone because

305
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:47,039
it's got that Joseph og in there I think

306
00:10:44,549 --> 00:10:49,229
day breaker was a really great strain

307
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,659
but it leaned really heavy on that gassy

308
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,639
cushy fuelly side and then I saw that

309
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,500
tropical flavor coming out of golden go

310
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:56,789
and they both grew with a nice stout

311
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:59,399
structure and I was like that would make

312
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:01,349
a really beautiful cross so that's what

313
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:03,990
gave me the idea that's where they came

314
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:05,519
from and that's how it started so now

315
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,700
that we know who the parents are we can

316
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,710
talk about arise arises a very

317
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,780
great balance of sativa and indica with

318
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,269
a few phenotypes that lean heavily in

319
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:16,919
one direction which is expected most

320
00:11:15,269 --> 00:11:19,860
phenotypes will finish in nine weeks

321
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,679
there will be some eight week and some

322
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,850
ten week finishers in the mix because

323
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,349
you're going to bring out some of that

324
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,509
Island sweet skunk and some of that

325
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,129
Hawaiian sativa that's gonna take a

326
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:31,470
little longer to finish that's gonna

327
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:33,059
show up in the F one's the arize seeds

328
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,519
that you guys are getting from dank seed

329
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:37,769
or from me those are F once so all this

330
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,870
is going to apply to those F one arise

331
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,639
seeds that you're getting I have made F

332
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,929
twos but I haven't released them yet

333
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,879
because I haven't done enough testing

334
00:11:42,929 --> 00:11:46,589
and I don't want to see anybody have any

335
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,570
problems and I probably won't release

336
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,950
the f2 I'll work it to an f3 and then

337
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:52,410
you'll get some of the F threes and the

338
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,879
packages will be labeled as such but for

339
00:11:52,409 --> 00:11:55,709
now you're getting F ones let's talk

340
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:58,139
more about those you're gonna get stuff

341
00:11:55,710 --> 00:12:00,600
that finishes what was I saying in eight

342
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:03,360
to ten weeks my favorite finishes right

343
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,100
around a 63 to 65 the eight-week

344
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,950
phenotype that you'll find is very

345
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,590
joseph's OG dominant but it doesn't

346
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:12,720
produce as tight of buds as the joseph

347
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:14,820
OG it's just a little fluffier and she's

348
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,440
not very high of a yield err as it not

349
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,890
doesn't throw it as much as the other

350
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,840
phenotypes the 10-week phenotype shows

351
00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,000
the hawaiian sativa or the island sweet

352
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,639
skunk structure and it makes long skinny

353
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,899
buds ha the hawaiian sativa and the

354
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,610
island sweet skunk those are gonna get

355
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,500
long and stretchy on you so if you see

356
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,539
that long stretchiness expect some

357
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,730
tropical smell some tropical flavors

358
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,980
some salt water some taffy some fruit

359
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:39,149
some pineapples some oranges there's so

360
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:40,800
many weird things that come out of that

361
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:43,110
one I really like it but that 10-week

362
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:46,169
phenotype is covered in trichomes you

363
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:48,810
guys it is just frosty a [ __ ] soaked in

364
00:12:46,169 --> 00:12:51,689
trichomes but it doesn't produce very

365
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:53,669
dense buds it they're kind of fluffy the

366
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,140
10-week phenotype smells like it's

367
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:57,120
bringing out all that Hawaiian flavor

368
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:59,519
and the goat sweetness and the head high

369
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,980
from the ten-week phenotype is amazing

370
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,659
that 10 weaker if you let her go ten

371
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,519
weeks and finish out and you're not a

372
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,990
seasoned smoker or if you're smoking

373
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,329
with new people it will give them a

374
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:11,100
panic attack and you can hear that I say

375
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,629
that with a smile I kind of enjoy panic

376
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:14,100
attack weed that's kind of a good thing

377
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,539
I'd rather get energized and like oh

378
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,850
[ __ ] then just want to sit there in the

379
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:20,099
corner and hide but my favorite

380
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:22,290
phenotypes have arise are the balanced

381
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,629
mixes that have the goat sweetness and

382
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:25,299
the

383
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:27,250
she stinkiness it's got this when you

384
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:29,589
light it up everybody goes wha

385
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:30,879
it smells like cushy stank at first and

386
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:33,040
then you puff on it and when you exhale

387
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,679
this sweetness just comes out it is

388
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,740
really nice but overall I would narrow

389
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:41,109
down the morphology of a rise to around

390
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,610
three common phenotypes and three less

391
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:44,560
common phenotypes and I know I said

392
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,720
there are six phenotypes but it is an f1

393
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:49,689
hybrid so variation is to be expected

394
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,639
and honestly I like variation I think

395
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:53,620
that variation is a way to customize and

396
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:55,090
custom tailor our gardens to our needs

397
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:57,519
while still growing the strain that

398
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,899
we're looking for variation is to be

399
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,699
expected keep that in mind when you're

400
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:04,120
growing from seed especially with an f1

401
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:06,070
hybrid so ah we've got three common and

402
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,799
three less common phenotypes and I have

403
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,530
identified them as the sativa heavy the

404
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,799
indica heavy the goat phenotype the

405
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:17,079
Daybreaker phenotype the 50/50 and the

406
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,219
one that I call the stretcher and I

407
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,660
don't call it the stretcher because it's

408
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,160
gonna put you on a stretcher I call it

409
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:22,629
the stretcher because it grows like me

410
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:24,939
it's [ __ ] tall and skinny and out of

411
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:27,759
control so let's talk a little bit about

412
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,710
the six different phenotypes and you're

413
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,610
gonna see a little bit of variation you

414
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,040
know what I mean it's not gonna be

415
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,419
[ __ ] that's exactly this one but

416
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:35,980
they're gonna fall into this category

417
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:37,779
you guys will catch on to this as we do

418
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:41,110
more Fino hunts and as we do more strain

419
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:43,059
episodes so the sativa heavy phenotype

420
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,850
of a rise is a little Airy

421
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:49,149
it smells like beach sand and juicy

422
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:51,129
fruit gum it's got a tropical aroma to

423
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:52,539
it and it smells like salt water it

424
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:54,730
smells like you're sitting on the beach

425
00:14:52,539 --> 00:14:56,469
in Hawaii it certainly has a tropical

426
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,120
smell it certainly brings out that

427
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,550
Island sweet skunk and that Hawaiian

428
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:03,220
sativa flavor the phenotype that I have

429
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:05,500
labeled as the sativa dominant phenotype

430
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:07,840
or the sativa heavy phenotype will get

431
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:09,279
really tall and there's a lot of space

432
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,440
between the nodes that's one way to

433
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,419
identify it that is the Hawaiian if

434
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,810
there is a lot of spacing in your nodes

435
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:19,059
you're gonna get that sativa heavy tall

436
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:20,199
super sativa high THC plant but there

437
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,789
would be a lot of stretching it's gonna

438
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,400
get really tall and it's gonna take ten

439
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:27,129
weeks but it will test very high in THC

440
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,409
so that's the sativa heavy phenotype it

441
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:31,480
will be very obvious it is tall and

442
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:33,819
skinny and it takes off sometimes it's

443
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:36,009
confused as a boy it may be a boy but

444
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,520
also it could be that crazy sativa heavy

445
00:15:36,009 --> 00:15:38,559
Fino

446
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:40,689
so the next one we'll talk about is the

447
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,629
indica heavy phenotype the indica heavy

448
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,279
smells like cush and feet with a little

449
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:48,580
bit of that golden goat sweetness it is

450
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,799
mostly Joseph's og and it's got a little

451
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,320
bit of that Kim D in there and it's

452
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:55,269
stinky like fie and funk and armpits and

453
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:57,550
it's got a little bit of like a fresh

454
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:59,199
tire shop that rubber smell at the tire

455
00:15:57,549 --> 00:16:01,809
shop it's got a little bit of that going

456
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:04,089
on to it ah it's gonna be shorter it's

457
00:16:01,809 --> 00:16:05,829
gonna be shorter plants it's gonna have

458
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,930
tighter node spacing it's gonna be kind

459
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:09,730
of stretchy from the Joseph og so the

460
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:11,319
node spacing will be close together but

461
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:14,500
then the branches that come off will be

462
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,450
kind of long and the bud sets from up

463
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,490
that branch will be kind of far apart

464
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:20,920
it's gonna grow more golf-ball type

465
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:23,110
stuff it's gonna have very joseph's OG

466
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:25,088
dominant traits is the indica heavy one

467
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,470
so if you see just a bunch of golf balls

468
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:29,649
popping up a stick you're gonna have

469
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,810
that Joseph og that foot cush earth sort

470
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:33,458
of smelling phenotype I enjoy it it's

471
00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:34,899
not my favorite but it is a good

472
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:38,829
phenotype if you're going for that

473
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:41,350
indica that one takes about 56 to 63

474
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,940
days for the indica phenotype let it go

475
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,709
to about 60 days if you're getting eager

476
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,720
and you think it's done at 56 let it go

477
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:48,549
to 60 see what it does you've got an

478
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,829
indica plant let it ripen up a little

479
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:52,990
extra you may enjoy that it'll be super

480
00:16:50,828 --> 00:16:55,088
stony for you all right number three is

481
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:57,909
the golden goat phenotype this one looks

482
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:59,800
and smells very similarly to golden goat

483
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:01,929
so let's talk about the way this one

484
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,000
grows the golden goat phenotype

485
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:05,799
obviously looks and smells a lot like

486
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,740
golden goat it will stay a little

487
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:11,379
shorter it'll stay squat the MainTop

488
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,088
will not get way above the rest of the

489
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,010
plant like some strains like to do the

490
00:17:13,088 --> 00:17:16,990
golden goat phenotype likes to stay kind

491
00:17:15,009 --> 00:17:18,308
of even it will have a dominant top but

492
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,740
it will stay a little bit shorter and

493
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:22,240
that's a trait from the romulan

494
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:24,939
sometimes with the golden goat phenotype

495
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,529
you will see spiraled growth now a lot

496
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:28,390
of times when you're growing a plant the

497
00:17:26,529 --> 00:17:30,039
main stock comes up you get two nodes

498
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:32,050
that come out we'll call that east and

499
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,359
west you get two east and west growing

500
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:35,919
nodes then two north and south growing

501
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:38,199
nodes come out so you've got a plus sign

502
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,429
basically a plant with its symmetrical

503
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,600
you got two coming up this way two

504
00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:42,460
coming up this way and then it will

505
00:17:40,599 --> 00:17:44,259
repeat that process and you'll have

506
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:47,500
north and south east and west north and

507
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:49,058
south east and west golden goat carries

508
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,980
a trait that will make plants produce

509
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:52,410
sets

510
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:54,360
six branches so instead of every 90

511
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:57,390
degrees you have a branch it will be

512
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,099
every sixty degrees so there will be one

513
00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:02,009
branch and then sixty degrees and

514
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:03,808
another branch so right before you would

515
00:18:02,009 --> 00:18:05,579
have that north and south east and west

516
00:18:03,808 --> 00:18:07,139
it would go a little bit shorter and it

517
00:18:05,579 --> 00:18:09,298
would make room for another set of two

518
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:12,270
so you'd have triple de branching off of

519
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:14,579
that I call it spiraled growth you'll

520
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:17,160
notice it if it's doing that the golden

521
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,349
go phenotypes smells very sweet like

522
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:23,610
golden goat it's got very short tight

523
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:25,829
node spacing and it takes about 56 to 63

524
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:28,109
days for that phenotype to finish up

525
00:18:25,829 --> 00:18:29,970
some of the visual differences between

526
00:18:28,109 --> 00:18:32,969
the golden goat and the Daybreaker

527
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,798
are the Daybreaker phenotypes are a

528
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,929
little tighter and rockier and the

529
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,759
golden goat kind of has more of a jagged

530
00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:40,500
edge to it it's a little pointy er and

531
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:41,519
it comes out a little fluffier so you'll

532
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,048
be able to tell the difference between

533
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,819
the golden goat and the Daybreaker

534
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:47,129
phenotypes now let's talk about the

535
00:18:44,819 --> 00:18:49,019
Daybreaker phenotype specifically the

536
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,809
Daybreaker phenotype looks and smells

537
00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:53,940
obviously like Daybreaker she gets tall

538
00:18:51,808 --> 00:18:55,589
but she stacks up with huge colas all

539
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,960
that tall space is going to turn into a

540
00:18:55,589 --> 00:19:00,569
giant but she stretches a little bit in

541
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,548
early flower because of the OG dad the

542
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:04,319
gas is more prevalent in the Daybreaker

543
00:19:02,548 --> 00:19:05,639
phenotype if you're looking for the gas

544
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,798
you want the Daybreaker Leeming

545
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:10,230
phenotype this one's got tight node

546
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:12,808
spacing but the branches do stretch and

547
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:14,640
early flower and that is from the joseph

548
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:16,319
OG now you've got a pretty good

549
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,240
description of the indica heavy the

550
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:18,808
sativa heavy the golden goat and the

551
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,279
Daybreaker

552
00:19:18,808 --> 00:19:21,480
you're gonna have golden goat flavours

553
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,950
you're gonna have tropical flavors

554
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,870
you're gonna have Airy fluffier buds

555
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,220
you're gonna have sativa dominant stuff

556
00:19:24,869 --> 00:19:28,439
then you're gonna have these tight golf

557
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,990
ball little rocky buds that smell like

558
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,390
fuel and cush or you're gonna get really

559
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,640
obviously sativa tropical plants or

560
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:39,210
you're gonna get really obviously indica

561
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:42,299
dominant cushy plants or maybe hopefully

562
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:44,490
you get the one I call the 50/50 mix the

563
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:46,859
arize that everybody's looking for this

564
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,929
is the mix that grows like Kim D and the

565
00:19:46,859 --> 00:19:51,779
goat mixed together you can see that

566
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:54,780
tall Kim D stout structure you can see

567
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,629
the branch enos and the strength of the

568
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:59,940
golden goat but it smells like joseph OG

569
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,700
with the hint of tropical sweetness at

570
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,289
the end of it I love the 50/50 mix

571
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,730
can see all of the parents in there you

572
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:07,950
can see the chem D you can see the

573
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:09,660
golden goat you can see the Joseph Oh G

574
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:11,670
you can see the Hawaiian sativa and

575
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,400
there you can smell that Hawaiian sativa

576
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:16,680
and the island sweet skunk the 50/50 is

577
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,240
obviously my favorite that's the

578
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,980
phenotype I keep around it's the

579
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,349
phenotype that tests in the 30 percent

580
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,380
bracket consistently this phenotype

581
00:20:22,349 --> 00:20:27,389
gives me a ripping head hi it will make

582
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:29,520
you forget what's going on but it also

583
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:31,410
will make your whole body relax you will

584
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:33,569
sit down on the couch to watch an

585
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:35,610
episode of Rick and Morty or Bob's

586
00:20:33,569 --> 00:20:37,919
Burgers and you will press play on the

587
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,569
DVR and you will sit in that seat but

588
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,730
you will not remember watching the

589
00:20:39,569 --> 00:20:44,220
episode that's the kind of high that a

590
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:46,079
rise gives you remember on Friday when

591
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,549
Craig was talking to the dog statue he's

592
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,649
brushing his shirt off and brushing his

593
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:51,659
pants off that's the kind of high that a

594
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,310
rise gives you I think it's a really

595
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:55,019
balanced tie I really like the body

596
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,000
stone I really like the head high I

597
00:20:55,019 --> 00:20:58,500
really enjoy the rice that's why it's

598
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,349
one of my favorites @s hi

599
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,210
it grows great and I just love the high

600
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:05,159
that it gives me the flowers just make

601
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,950
me I feel it in my face I feel it in my

602
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,380
eyes and the dads are just super intense

603
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,420
it's it's mostly recreational when I'm

604
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,890
smoking arise it just goes straight to

605
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,940
the brain it makes me goofy it makes me

606
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,320
want to chill out it makes me want to

607
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,059
play music and it makes me want to talk

608
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,460
a lot so let's keep talking about this

609
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:23,159
specific phenotype the 50/50 phenotype

610
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,920
this phenotype puts out huge harvests

611
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,140
it's fairly easy to grow you can top it

612
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,960
or you cannot top it and it will grow

613
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,430
like crazy you'll recognize this

614
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,769
phenotype when it's growing because it

615
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:36,480
will have a long chunky bud and it'll

616
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:38,519
look like it's got that kembe structure

617
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,349
but then the leaves will get long and

618
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,839
skinny and they will kind of taco up

619
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:44,250
just a little bit it won't be fat leaves

620
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,409
if they're big and fat leaves it's

621
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,299
probably not the 50/50 phenotype they

622
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,070
get a little bit skinnier and really

623
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:52,319
pointy and then they kind of taco and

624
00:21:50,069 --> 00:21:54,269
point up just a little tiny bit so

625
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,399
that's the phenotype that I really like

626
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:58,079
to smoke and really like to grow that's

627
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,670
the one that tests high that's the one

628
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,259
that organic a tested high with that's

629
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,820
the one we tested high with that's the

630
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:04,890
one that makes all the good concentrates

631
00:22:02,819 --> 00:22:06,960
so that is the one that you want that's

632
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,670
the 50/50 phenotype that's the one to go

633
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,590
for that's the one you see me posting

634
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:12,779
pictures of so let's talk about number

635
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:14,159
six the one I call the stretcher I know

636
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:15,450
you would hope I call it the stretcher

637
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,290
because it makes you want to call an

638
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,539
ambulance

639
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:20,609
but that's not it this phenotype is

640
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,109
super easy to identify it's taller than

641
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:23,579
every plant in the [ __ ] grow room

642
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:25,619
this plant is what I call the non

643
00:22:23,579 --> 00:22:27,539
desirable phenotype I'll admit it

644
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:29,819
there's one that sucks throw it away

645
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:32,309
she stays skinny and produces long

646
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,659
skinny leaves really long really skinny

647
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:35,909
leaves I think that's the Hawaiian

648
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,440
sativa doing that the buzz that come

649
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:39,269
from this phenotype are coated in

650
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,980
trichomes and the high is straight to

651
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:42,900
your head it'll make your eyes bright

652
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:44,279
red it'll make your eyes squinty and you

653
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,900
won't be able to find your keys while

654
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,700
they're in your hand you'll lose your

655
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:49,860
sunglasses while you're wearing them but

656
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:52,200
the problem with the stretcher is that

657
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:54,869
she will triple in size in the first

658
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,600
three or four weeks of flower and she

659
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:59,609
takes like ten full weeks maybe 11 or 12

660
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,409
full weeks to flower depending on the

661
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:03,329
phenotype that you find out of that one

662
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:05,490
if you've got high ceilings and a lot of

663
00:23:03,329 --> 00:23:06,929
time to experiment it's got a lot of

664
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,700
potential but I would rather just cut

665
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:10,500
her down and grow some of the other

666
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,360
phenotypes that pop up so I will admit

667
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,190
it there's a phenotype in there that you

668
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:15,719
might want to get rid of the sativa high

669
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:17,420
that comes from that thing the amount of

670
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,860
trichomes that fall off of it are

671
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,150
amazing and impressive but it's such a

672
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,319
pain in the ass to grow that it's not

673
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,240
even worth it so that's the one I call

674
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:25,769
the stretcher it takes off it gets super

675
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,890
tall it's a super skinny

676
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:31,170
I basically grows one long skinny switch

677
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:32,610
it's not the one to keep so if you got

678
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,470
that one popping up maybe get rid of her

679
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:36,269
early but don't confuse it for the

680
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,250
sativa dominant phenotype if you see a

681
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:39,900
lot of branching that's the sativa if

682
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,519
you don't see branching that's the girl

683
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,980
I call the stretcher go ahead and cut

684
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:46,589
her down get her out of there so those

685
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,990
are basically the six phenotypes to

686
00:23:46,589 --> 00:23:51,629
expect you should expect variation these

687
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,460
are F ones this is nature it's what's

688
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,110
expected that's how [ __ ] works until I

689
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,400
release the F threes or f 4s which I

690
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:58,469
will announce and label the packages

691
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,690
accordingly expect the variation from

692
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:02,460
the arize I appreciate variation and

693
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:04,259
enjoy it that's part of the fun from

694
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:07,500
growing from seed now if you're gonna

695
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:09,539
grow a rise I would suggest you grow 63

696
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,910
to 70 days for each phenotype if it's

697
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:13,680
your first time if you've got 77 days

698
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:17,370
and you think it may need it give it

699
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:18,720
that don't be shy 63 to 70 days maybe 77

700
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,699
if needed and see what they do and

701
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,100
adjust from there the next time don't

702
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,779
forget that a female hunt is the start

703
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:27,719
of dialing in a long-term relationship

704
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:29,490
with a selected phenotype you're not

705
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,779
just trying to get this one

706
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,700
Elden the first time you're gonna have

707
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:35,519
to date her a couple of times before you

708
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,808
do it right that's how it goes ah let's

709
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,940
see most of the phenotypes are gonna

710
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:41,399
give you generous yields and the potency

711
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,370
on a rise is always impressive so any

712
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:46,410
phenotype you pull out will be covered

713
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:49,739
in trichomes it'll be highly potent it

714
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:52,019
will be very desirable medicine arises

715
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,549
very fast to veg and she loves lots of

716
00:24:52,019 --> 00:24:55,980
light give her as much light as you can

717
00:24:53,549 --> 00:24:57,990
a rise also grows quickly in flower and

718
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:00,000
you will need some sort of supports in

719
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:01,410
early flower she's gonna get tall and

720
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,039
heavy on you those buds are gonna get

721
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,740
fat

722
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:06,599
she likes to produce big bud so be

723
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,000
prepared have some sticks or trellising

724
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:10,589
or tomato cages I like to crack and pop

725
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,359
the stems you guys I talk about it a lot

726
00:25:10,589 --> 00:25:14,220
super cropping start at the bottom of

727
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,689
the plant grab the plant with your fist

728
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,679
grab the plant with the other fist I

729
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,390
remember when you did the thing in

730
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:19,679
baseball you'd go up the bat and see who

731
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:21,570
gets to bat first I don't know if you

732
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,340
guys all did that but you put one hand

733
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:24,928
one hand above the other and just twist

734
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:27,000
them opposite directions and the stem is

735
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:29,100
gonna go just gonna make a little pop

736
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,660
noise that's fine you don't want to

737
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:32,339
crush and destroy the plant you want it

738
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:34,440
to pop you were breaking the cellulose

739
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:36,539
in the plant and it's gonna get stronger

740
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,580
because of that it's also gonna stroke

741
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:40,529
slow down the stretching so I like to

742
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:43,109
pop them I like to twist them that

743
00:25:40,529 --> 00:25:45,178
always helps me slow down the stretch

744
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:46,889
and it also makes the stalk stronger to

745
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:48,570
support the upcoming Bud sets because

746
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,480
the rise is gonna have some beefy buds

747
00:25:48,569 --> 00:25:53,759
get a head start on that a rise also has

748
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,940
a very nice array of flavors and aromas

749
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:59,308
I would recommend a carbon filter you're

750
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:01,350
going to need carbon filtration even the

751
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:03,569
sweet like golden goat candy smelling

752
00:26:01,349 --> 00:26:05,250
phenotypes will get attention people you

753
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:07,169
like what is that smell it's got a hint

754
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,789
of skunk it's got a hint to funk then

755
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:10,110
there's this candy and ice cream smell

756
00:26:08,789 --> 00:26:11,399
going on your neighbors are gonna notice

757
00:26:10,109 --> 00:26:12,299
that somebody's gonna want to know

758
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,009
what's going on

759
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:17,009
somebody got raided here in our area

760
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:18,869
recently because the neighbors reported

761
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:20,819
this smell of marijuana so the police

762
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:22,589
went there knocked on the door the guy

763
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:24,299
gave shitty answers the police came back

764
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:26,399
and took everything because he had too

765
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:28,529
much it was illegal but that aroma is

766
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,000
what got him in trouble so you guys take

767
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:31,799
care of your aromas if you're growing

768
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,839
legally or illegally because it's legal

769
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,879
here and they still call the police on

770
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,889
him for the aroma so pay attention to

771
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,770
that carbon filters are a must

772
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:43,350
let's see where am I on let's see a rise

773
00:26:40,769 --> 00:26:45,179
can handle heavy feedings she

774
00:26:43,349 --> 00:26:46,649
likes a lot of nutrients she can handle

775
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,080
snapping and popping and she takes

776
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,000
stress training well she can also handle

777
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:52,619
problems pretty well we had a technical

778
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,558
issue in Agra where an air conditioner

779
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:56,909
went out and her eyes just kept growing

780
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:58,619
everybody else was pissed off

781
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:00,779
we had another room where the auto water

782
00:26:58,619 --> 00:27:02,788
did not turn off one time while every

783
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:04,558
plant got way too much water because the

784
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:06,990
auto the shut-off switch didn't it

785
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,970
anyway we got too much water that arise

786
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,009
plant loved it everybody else wanted to

787
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,600
[ __ ] die so our eyes can take a lot

788
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:14,038
of stress we have beat the [ __ ] out of

789
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:17,490
her in several different environments

790
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:20,038
and she seems to love it she does well

791
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:22,079
in high heat and humidity some

792
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:26,490
phenotypes of her eyes you'll notice

793
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:28,649
they have huge fan leaves that's okay

794
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,329
that's a trait from Daybreaker those

795
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,030
traits those leaves will hang down

796
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:35,519
that's okay I encourage you to remove

797
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,379
the excess leaves that are really big to

798
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,349
allow light and air to get to your

799
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,000
plants and your buds those larger leaf

800
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:43,918
phenotypes will look droopy sometimes

801
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,890
for no reason like I said earlier that's

802
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,960
a trait from day breaker I've seen it in

803
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:50,880
several crosses that I've made from the

804
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,740
arize male it's not a problem the leaves

805
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,299
are just so big that they droop a little

806
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,679
bit all the time the plant can't hold

807
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,929
those big-ass leaves up they're not

808
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,450
thirsty they're not having problems it

809
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:02,970
just makes huge leaves those phenotypes

810
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,679
are very oh jee dominant and the ones

811
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,919
with the big leaves that hang down a lot

812
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:10,890
usually produced that cushy chemi aroma

813
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,750
that I was enjoying one thing I should

814
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,730
warn you about her rises to not let it

815
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,890
become a root bound the roots grow as

816
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,710
quickly as the plant above the dirt so

817
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:22,559
keep that in mind she is growing just as

818
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:24,538
fast inside that pot so pay attention a

819
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,000
root bound plant will trick you into

820
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:29,250
thinking it has other issues like pH or

821
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,380
cal-mag problems pay attention to your

822
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:33,450
container size and plan ahead this plant

823
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:36,000
is gonna take 8 to 10 weeks to flower

824
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:37,710
make sure you have the proper pot size

825
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,679
make sure you flower on time so you

826
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:43,110
don't overload your pot also I recommend

827
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,940
using an air pot so that if the plant

828
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:46,288
does get too big it'll kind of feel that

829
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,048
air out there and it'll kind of prune

830
00:28:46,288 --> 00:28:50,879
itself that will help you out my best

831
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:53,668
result personally with the rise have

832
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,530
come from air pots with cocoa using

833
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:57,600
vegetable nutrients and a few additives

834
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:59,999
those additives were from nuuma

835
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,398
I'd recommend shine at the last week of

836
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:04,350
edge and in the flower when you're

837
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,609
leaving veg add the shine at that point

838
00:29:04,349 --> 00:29:07,619
in time the last week of veg and

839
00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:09,928
starting flower put shine in there and

840
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,819
that will help reduce the stretch in

841
00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:13,470
early flower that will slow down that

842
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:15,359
arise stretch because they do like to

843
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,129
take off on you you guys be prepared for

844
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,288
that now let's talk a little bit about

845
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:20,878
smoking arise we've talked a long time

846
00:29:19,288 --> 00:29:23,490
about growing we've talked about the

847
00:29:20,878 --> 00:29:26,278
phenotypes let's talk about smoking on

848
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:28,710
some arise so people have reported that

849
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:30,148
a rise as the perfect nighttime medicine

850
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:32,819
to relax them at the end of the day

851
00:29:30,148 --> 00:29:34,829
other people report that arise is the

852
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:36,990
perfect high-energy daytime smoke now

853
00:29:34,829 --> 00:29:40,138
the funny thing is both of those reports

854
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:41,788
came from the same batch of a rise they

855
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:43,829
were buying the same product and people

856
00:29:41,788 --> 00:29:45,749
were having completely different

857
00:29:43,829 --> 00:29:47,668
reactions that's because it's such a

858
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:49,259
balanced phenotype that is just working

859
00:29:47,669 --> 00:29:50,700
for everybody in a different way we all

860
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:53,700
have different body chemistry

861
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:56,129
I like arises my recreational smoke it

862
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:58,288
gives me a really good head high and it

863
00:29:56,128 --> 00:30:00,058
makes me social and creative it makes me

864
00:29:58,288 --> 00:30:02,249
talkative it makes me like to play music

865
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:03,898
and honestly it makes me just forget

866
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:05,368
about any stress or anything like that

867
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:06,508
it kind of just puts all that [ __ ] to

868
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:09,058
the back of my mind it's kind of just

869
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:10,649
like stress reliever dads so I like to

870
00:30:09,058 --> 00:30:12,329
smoke a rise when I play music or when

871
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:14,428
I'm writing podcast episodes or when I

872
00:30:12,329 --> 00:30:15,898
have to go somewhere and I don't if

873
00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:17,340
you're not in the mood to be social and

874
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:18,628
you gotta go talk to damn people and

875
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:19,859
you're not feeling it smoke summarize

876
00:30:18,628 --> 00:30:21,748
you'll get there and you just won't shut

877
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,819
the [ __ ] up hey I'm here guys it's good

878
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:26,129
to see everybody that's what a rise does

879
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:28,558
to me medical patients have reported

880
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:30,028
their rise helps with their headaches a

881
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:33,118
lot of people have said it helps with

882
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:35,429
depression and PTSD symptoms I know it

883
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:37,888
helps with migraines I know it will help

884
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:39,659
with appetite if you're not eating you

885
00:30:37,888 --> 00:30:42,240
can smoke some arise and it will make

886
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:44,220
you hungry the indica part of a rise

887
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,628
will work if you've got pain it'll chill

888
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,308
out all of your body pain if you've got

889
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:49,498
some aches and pains I think a rise

890
00:30:47,308 --> 00:30:50,999
would be great for that I could also see

891
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,579
it working as sort of an antidepressant

892
00:30:50,999 --> 00:30:55,230
because it's got such an uplifting

893
00:30:52,579 --> 00:30:57,388
positive high which is kind of why I

894
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:59,128
called it a rise it makes me want to

895
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:00,298
wake up part of my brain that just

896
00:30:59,128 --> 00:31:02,069
doesn't seem to want to wake up

897
00:31:00,298 --> 00:31:04,168
sometimes that lazy part that you like

898
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:06,628
man it just puts it another vibration in

899
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:08,429
there and it makes your brain arise so

900
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:09,959
that's why I called it that also you'll

901
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:10,680
notice a lot of the things that I bred

902
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,319
from daybreak

903
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:15,870
have a one word name like cascade and a

904
00:31:13,319 --> 00:31:18,059
rise and Firefly I was kind of trying to

905
00:31:15,869 --> 00:31:20,099
honor gage green genetics since that day

906
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:23,099
breaker came from gage they like to use

907
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:24,599
one word inspirational type words to

908
00:31:23,099 --> 00:31:26,429
name their estranged and I was trying to

909
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,859
keep with that vibe and I thought a rise

910
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:30,180
was beautiful cascade Firefly things

911
00:31:28,859 --> 00:31:32,069
like that that came from the day breaker

912
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,930
will have those sort of names that's

913
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:35,909
where the naming scheme comes from kind

914
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:38,610
of just trying to do some honor - gage

915
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:40,350
green genetics and the name arise

916
00:31:38,609 --> 00:31:42,389
actually may have been mentioned by

917
00:31:40,349 --> 00:31:43,859
somebody on social media I was trying to

918
00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,270
name something else and they said how

919
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:46,559
about arise and I was like that's not

920
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:48,000
the name for this cross but that is

921
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,649
certainly something for the future and I

922
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,059
wrote it down and then when this one

923
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:52,950
came up I was like that's where this

924
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,599
goes so sometimes those strain names

925
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:56,130
just get written down and they get saved

926
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:57,569
for the right time and that's what

927
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:59,700
happened here with this one I'm pretty

928
00:31:57,569 --> 00:32:01,619
sure that's how it went all right you

929
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,990

954
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:58,170
of my genetics if you're doing a great

955

job maybe I'll send you more seeds to

956
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:02,759
work with all right you guys that was my

957
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:04,860
report on a rise there's only one more

958
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:07,890
thing I want to ask of you I want to get

959
00:33:04,859 --> 00:33:09,419
a rise on Leafly Leafly is a website

960
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:10,890
that recommends strains and highlight

961
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,450
strains a lot of people that need

962
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:14,430
information on shopping at a dispensary

963
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,620
will go to Leafly and try to find a

964
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,810
strain that works for them let's get a

965
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:20,579
rise on Leafly the only way we can do

966
00:33:18,809 --> 00:33:22,319
that is to create an account there's a

967
00:33:20,579 --> 00:33:24,240
little tab that says add a strain you

968
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:26,369
have to leave a strain review if you

969
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,019
groans smoke consumes smelled or seen a

970
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:30,149
rise you're qualified to go leave a

971
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:32,250
review there go talk about a rise on

972
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:34,230
Leafly and eventually they will add it

973
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:36,240
