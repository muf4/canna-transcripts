136
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,819

straight isolated crystals he brought me

138
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,259

the two combined so I've got the Terps

141
00:04:54,149 --> 00:04:57,389
I've got the crystals and then I've got

142
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,750
the saucy mixture put together at a

143
00:04:57,389 --> 00:05:04,379
beautiful ratio you guys the mixture

144
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:06,389
smells like cupcake frosting and cookie

145
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:08,189
dough and then we need to take a dab of

146
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,139
it it tastes like you just took a big

147
00:05:08,189 --> 00:05:12,000
bite of cookie dough with cupcake

148
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:13,560
frosting on it and then when you blow it

149
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
out it smells like somebody's baking

150
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,030
fresh cookies in the room it smells like

151
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,280
warm chocolate chip and cinnamon cookies

152
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:23,219
filling the room this concentrate is

153
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,929

154
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,770

155
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,300
throat tingle

156
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:30,120

00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,000
am obviously loving these cream dabs

168
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,310
grown and extracted by a local farmer

169
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,620
hey bro great work I truly do appreciate

170
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:01,019
it in fact this episode is gonna be

171
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,490
really long so I've got all the opening

172
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:04,529
business covered I'm gonna press pause

173
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm gonna take a DAB probably the last

174
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:09,478
two dads of this cream and when I get

175
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,860
back I will give a long lesson on drying

176
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:14,279
and curing your freshly harvested

177
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,030
cannabis plants all right podcast rolled

178
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:17,159
I am back

179
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,169
I am well medicated I am well hydrated

180
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,450
and I am ready to talk about drying and

181
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:24,449
curing your freshly harvested cannabis

182
00:06:21,449 --> 00:06:26,279
plants now let me do a quick update from

183
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:28,349
the last episode in the last episode we

184
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,789
talked about harvesting your plants we

185
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:31,410
talked about cutting them down we talked

186
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,780
about hanging them in a room upside down

187
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:35,610
in a climate-controlled room one thing I

188
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:38,869
failed to mention you should only hang

189
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,230
one crop in a space at a time to prevent

190
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,709
remoisturize

191
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:45,300
the first crop don't cut down one crop

192
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,879
and then let it hang for four or five

193
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:49,500
days five or seven days and then bring

194
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,209
in a fresh crop and lock that in the

195
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,740
same room because what you're doing is

196
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,509
just introducing a whole bunch of

197
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,220
moisture into that room and it's just

198
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,870
gonna go into the other plants you're

199
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,880
going to re moisten the other plants and

200
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,590
make them take longer and now you've got

201
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:04,829
to kind of restart you're dry and cure

202
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:06,899
process so one one crop at a time is

203
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:08,039
ideal hanging in the room that's

204
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:10,439
something I should have mentioned on the

205
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,450
episode before and I didn't remember to

206
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:14,939
mention that so now we are up to speed

207
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:17,339
now let's actually get into drying and

208
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:20,459
curing our freshly harvested cannabis

209
00:07:17,339 --> 00:07:24,179
plants now after spending four weeks and

210
00:07:20,459 --> 00:07:25,799
veg eight to ten weeks and flower you

211
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,319
really don't want to mess these plants

212
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,530
up at the very end here curing is a very

213
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,899
critical process curing you can make the

214
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,699
most delicious buds taste like total

215
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:38,310
[ __ ] from drying and curing them

216
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:39,569
improperly you can ruin the entire crop

217
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,339
at this point don't get too scared

218
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:43,439
because I'm gonna guide you through not

219
00:07:41,339 --> 00:07:46,019
ruining it but keep in mind that this is

220
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,969
one of the most critical parts in the

221
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:50,099
growing process this is a huge process

222
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:52,680
and a lot of things can go wrong if you

223
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,050
don't pay attention so take your time

224
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:58,590
and pay attention and don't rush to

225
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,449
smoke your new crop you've waited what

226
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:02,399
what do we say about 14 weeks probably

227
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:04,409
is what we did the math on 120 days

228
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,870
you've grown these plants for 120 days

229
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,120
is about how long it takes why not wait

230
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,220
a couple of days longer until they are

231
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,079
perfect before you start smoking it so

232
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,780
let's get it actually drying and curing

233
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:17,459
these plants now the last grow episode

234
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:19,229
was a harvest episode and it left us

235
00:08:17,459 --> 00:08:21,419
with our plants hanging upside down in a

236
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:23,670
room with proper temps proper humidity

237
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,860
and minimal light now we've been waiting

238
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:27,660
for the sticks for our plants to snap

239
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,729
we've got plants hanging upside down

240
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,770
they've been delete or just way

241
00:08:29,728 --> 00:08:34,769
for the right humidity within the plants

242
00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:36,569
for the sticks to pop the sticks should

243
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:38,338
snap we're waiting for him to snap but

244
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:40,680
not explode when you grab a branch of

245
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,020
the plant and you just bend it you want

246
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,489
it to sound kind of like that you don't

247
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,629
want it to go Shh

248
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,159
you don't want it to explode with

249
00:08:45,629 --> 00:08:49,110
dryness you don't want it to fall apart

250
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:52,169
and you don't want it to be gummy or

251
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:54,659
rubbery or bendy you don't want it to to

252
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:57,240
bend you want it to snap and pop so the

253
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:59,009
stick should snap the bigger sticks and

254
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,470
larger plants are going to take a little

255
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,909
bit longer the skinnier sticks and

256
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,649
smaller plants are obviously going to

257
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:07,079
dry more quickly because they don't hold

258
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:09,778
as much moisture also if you took off

259
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,520
Leslie for more relief they're going to

260
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:12,659
dry more quickly without the leaf and

261
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,549
they're going to take a little longer

262
00:09:12,659 --> 00:09:15,750
with that extra leaf on there because

263
00:09:14,549 --> 00:09:17,729
it's going to hold more moisture

264
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,919
there'll be more moisture in the room

265
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,769
just more moisture overall to deal with

266
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,469
so we're waiting for is those sticks to

267
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:27,929
snap when the sticks snap that's when

268
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:30,420
the container curing process begins I

269
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:32,278
use two different methods for this based

270
00:09:30,419 --> 00:09:34,559
on crop size don't forget that I run

271
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:35,850
commercial grows in a commercial setting

272
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,679
we do things a little differently than

273
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:39,959
we would do in a home setting I'm used

274
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,639
to pulling down 50 or more pounds in a

275
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:43,379
commercial environment you don't want a

276
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:44,819
bunch of jars you don't really have the

277
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,649
space for a bunch of jars you don't have

278
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,629
the manpower to open a bunch of jars all

279
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:51,028
day so we do things a little differently

280
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:53,939
in a home grow it's not as many pounds

281
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:56,039
it's less jars so I use jar technique in

282
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,920
a home grow but let's talk about the way

283
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,778
I would do it in a commercial grow in a

284
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:02,939
commercial grow I'll chop the large

285
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:05,399
stalk and naked stems out of the plants

286
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,980
and place the buds still on sticks into

287
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:08,879
large Rubbermaid containers so you've

288
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,579
got a big plant

289
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,899
you've lollipop tup probably 12 to 18

290
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:14,309
inches of it so you've got some naked

291
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,799
sticks right that's what I mean by naked

292
00:10:14,309 --> 00:10:18,929
sticks the the shaved legs and that main

293
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,088
big stalk I'll cut all of that out and

294
00:10:18,929 --> 00:10:22,828
that goes to waste and a commercial grow

295
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:26,220
that's actually got to be weighed and

296
00:10:22,828 --> 00:10:28,799
documented as removed waste so now I've

297
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,149
got two piles one pile is naked sticks

298
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,409
that need to be documented as waste

299
00:10:30,149 --> 00:10:33,570
they'll be chipped up and thrown away

300
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:35,189
then there's another pile that's the

301
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,560
usable product of the sticks with buds

302
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,290
up it they need to be trimmed those buds

303
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,018
still on the sticks get put into the

304
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:44,328
Rubbermaid containers on

305
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:46,129
prynt there's something to keep in mind

306
00:10:44,328 --> 00:10:48,318
carefully label your Rubbermaid

307
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:51,438
containers do not label the lids never

308
00:10:48,318 --> 00:10:53,328
label lids in a facility in a home grow

309
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:55,969
don't label the lids lids are

310
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:58,488
interchangeable label the container so

311
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:00,769
chop the sticks out put the good usable

312
00:10:58,489 --> 00:11:02,209
buds into the Rubbermaid container don't

313
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:04,278
squish them in there too tight fill it

314
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:05,599
up pretty well but don't cram anything

315
00:11:04,278 --> 00:11:06,588
in there you need some air space in

316
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,058
there and you don't want to smash

317
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,309
anything and if it's too tightly pressed

318
00:11:08,058 --> 00:11:12,379
together it'll get funky it'll start to

319
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:13,818
smell bad Moisture will get trapped in

320
00:11:12,379 --> 00:11:15,619
there and you'll start to get that stale

321
00:11:13,818 --> 00:11:17,509
ammonia smell and that's what we were

322
00:11:15,619 --> 00:11:19,579
trying to avoid with proper drying and

323
00:11:17,509 --> 00:11:21,829
curing so I would go through and remove

324
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:23,328
all of the sticks get all the good buds

325
00:11:21,828 --> 00:11:25,159
into the containers and then once they

326
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:27,048
are all completed I would go through and

327
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,669
put the lids on every container at that

328
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:30,708
point I would have everything labeled it

329
00:11:28,669 --> 00:11:32,838
all be sitting open and then when we're

330
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:34,548
done with every plant that's gonna get

331
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:36,199
been that day that's when I start

332
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:37,938
putting the lids on and sealing up the

333
00:11:36,198 --> 00:11:39,558
containers now I feel like I haven't

334
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:41,539
described these containers properly

335
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:44,988
these Rubbermaid containers are like the

336
00:11:41,539 --> 00:11:47,778
size of maybe a laundry basket they're

337
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:52,429
about three feet wide I guess and then

338
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:53,899
maybe a foot or so wide I know I said

339
00:11:52,428 --> 00:11:56,509
wide but three feet long and a foot or

340
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:58,519
so wide and then probably about eighteen

341
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:01,188
maybe twenty inches deep they're the one

342
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:02,568
that you uh use for packing or you just

343
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,219
put a bunch of clothes in there just a

344
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:05,479
bunch of [ __ ] or it's the one when

345
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,920
the kids come to the front door they're

346
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,329
trying to sell candy for church like I

347
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,948
got some candy for church sir would you

348
00:12:08,328 --> 00:12:11,269
like to raise some money I think if the

349
00:12:09,948 --> 00:12:13,248
big Rubbermaid container that's the

350
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:15,078
container I'm talking about it's just

351
00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:16,999
like a moving box or something is what

352
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:20,239
it looks like a storage container we can

353
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:22,159
fit three or four large plants in those

354
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,209
containers from the commercial grow so I

355
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:24,528
guess I should have mentioned that a

356
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,118
little earlier but it just dawned on me

357
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:28,188
that I did not describe these containers

358
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:30,649
in any way so now let's talk more about

359
00:12:28,188 --> 00:12:33,168
what happens to these plants once they

360
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:35,659
are put into this container and the lid

361
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:38,178
is put on them they need to be opened

362
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:39,918
and rotated every day until they're dry

363
00:12:38,178 --> 00:12:41,688
enough to seal up without risking any

364
00:12:39,918 --> 00:12:43,458
mold development the first day is always

365
00:12:41,688 --> 00:12:45,379
scary when you seal them up and then

366
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,588
leave overnight that is always a scary

367
00:12:45,379 --> 00:12:50,389
feeling until you get there the next day

368
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:51,740
don't be afraid to leave them open if

369
00:12:50,389 --> 00:12:53,058
you feel like they're a little too moist

370
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,470
if you cut them down and get them in the

371
00:12:53,058 --> 00:12:55,999
bin and realize aw [ __ ]

372
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:58,189
a couple of these are too wet

373
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:59,899
don't be afraid to leave those open open

374
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:01,879
overnight you would rather leave them

375
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,229
open and get them a little too dry then

376
00:13:01,879 --> 00:13:05,808
close them up and get them a little

377
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:08,658
funky a little funky doesn't go away a

378
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:10,038
little too dry we can work with so you

379
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:11,568
seal them up you put the lids on them

380
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:12,889
and then you might want to check on them

381
00:13:11,568 --> 00:13:14,598
before you leave for the day make sure

382
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:15,979
that nothing needs to be rotated nothing

383
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:18,169
needs to be flipped around nothing needs

384
00:13:15,979 --> 00:13:20,028
to be left open like I said if it needs

385
00:13:18,168 --> 00:13:22,308
to be left open leave it open don't be

386
00:13:20,028 --> 00:13:23,808
afraid then you're gonna leave you're

387
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:25,278
gonna come back the next day you're

388
00:13:23,808 --> 00:13:27,408
gonna have a bunch of sealed containers

389
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:30,470
they need to be popped open immediately

390
00:13:27,408 --> 00:13:33,259
I would pop them open for four maybe six

391
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,819
maybe seven hours and check on him while

392
00:13:33,259 --> 00:13:36,699
they were sealed a lot of the moisture

393
00:13:34,818 --> 00:13:39,108
that was inside those sticks

394
00:13:36,698 --> 00:13:40,698
reconstituted throughout those buds and

395
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,019
a lot of moisture built up in that

396
00:13:40,698 --> 00:13:43,698
container you're gonna find a lot of

397
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:46,220
spongy and wet buds when you come in in

398
00:13:43,698 --> 00:13:48,168
the morning that's expected don't worry

399
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:49,489
it'll be okay you're gonna leave it open

400
00:13:48,168 --> 00:13:52,399
and get some of that [ __ ] out of there

401
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:53,869
that's the idea you want to open it up

402
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:55,339
every day and let that stuff out of

403
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:57,139
there when they start getting dry again

404
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,549
some of the sticks might not even snap

405
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:00,979
again some of them may have remoisten

406
00:13:58,548 --> 00:14:02,448
where they don't snap that that means

407
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:04,309
you may have gone just a little bit too

408
00:14:02,448 --> 00:14:06,168
early but it's not bad because we can

409
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:08,118
get that moisture out you don't want it

410
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:09,769
to get too dry so you're gonna pop them

411
00:14:08,119 --> 00:14:11,538
open you're gonna see how what they are

412
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,859
leave them open you may just want to

413
00:14:11,538 --> 00:14:14,509
leave them open for an hour if they're

414
00:14:12,859 --> 00:14:17,089
real dry an hour is fine

415
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:19,818
four to six hours is not uncommon on the

416
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:21,829
first day if you chop those plants down

417
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:24,438
or if you bend those plants a little bit

418
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:26,028
too early they may be really wet and you

419
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:27,858
may have to leave them open for four to

420
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:29,538
six maybe the whole shift of 8 to 10

421
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:31,729
hours they may have to stay open that's

422
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:33,708
not uncommon try not to cut them down

423
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:35,389
and put them into the bins so early next

424
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:36,498
time but you'll be okay this is

425
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:38,058
something you're gonna have to dial in

426
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:40,459
with your facility and with your

427
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:42,858
technique so the duration of burp time

428
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:46,158
is going to decrease as slowly as the

429
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:49,399
buds dry these bins are going to sit in

430
00:14:46,158 --> 00:14:52,369
a room ideally that is at 50% humidity

431
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:55,009
and 70 degrees until you have time to

432
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:56,809
trim them I run a humidifier and a

433
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:59,479
dehumidifier at the same time and

434
00:14:56,808 --> 00:15:01,848
they're both set at 50% humidity so if

435
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:04,309
that room gets to 55% humidity that

436
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:07,549
dehumidifier kicks on immediately if it

437
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:09,500
gets to 45% the humidifier comes on

438
00:15:07,548 --> 00:15:11,419
immediately I don't get out of that

439
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,679
degree range and it stays pretty close

440
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:14,059
with both of those machines and they're

441
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:16,579
fighting each other they pretty much

442
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:18,949
just stay on all the time so I've got

443
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,810
these buds they are in containers they

444
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:23,600
have not been trimmed yet and they still

445
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:25,909
need to be burped on a daily basis the

446
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,500
first thing the dry and cure manager or

447
00:15:25,909 --> 00:15:29,480
the trim team manager should do when

448
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,700
they get to the grow is pop open these

449
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,769
bins and see what type of situation

450
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:35,450
you've got they should be getting drier

451
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:37,519
and more smokeable and they should start

452
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:40,250
smelling more like dank cannabis every

453
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,620
day that fresh green wet smell should be

454
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,809
going away but you're going to have to

455
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:47,179
pop them everyday and pay attention to

456
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:48,889
how long they need to be open like I

457
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,289
said that first day you're gonna get

458
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:53,330
four to six hours maybe the second day

459
00:15:51,289 --> 00:15:55,549
four to six hours maybe the third day

460
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,139
four hours maybe the fourth day three

461
00:15:55,549 --> 00:15:58,879
hours then maybe you're gonna have to

462
00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:00,350
pop them open for an hour every day and

463
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,929
see what's going on and check it out

464
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:05,120
eventually you won't have to open them

465
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:07,639
anymore once you've gotten them to about

466
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,769
65% humidity inside the container

467
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,199
consistently you don't have to burp it

468
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:14,779
that is cured where you want it and it's

469
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,180
also in that room with 50% humidity so

470
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:19,129
it's gonna stay about 50% humidity and

471
00:16:17,179 --> 00:16:21,559
it won't get less than that and they can

472
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:23,990
the containers hold moisture in there so

473
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,399
it's gonna stay above 50% trust me so

474
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,409
while you're drying and curing inside

475
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:30,139
those bins be sure to burp the bins

476
00:16:27,409 --> 00:16:32,629
every day and rotate the buds to prevent

477
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,610
mold and funky aromas until they get dry

478
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:36,439
enough to leave alone don't be afraid to

479
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,389
take the buds and pick them up right

480
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:40,100
outside of the container and flip them

481
00:16:38,389 --> 00:16:41,809
over and set it back in so all the buds

482
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,909
that were on the bottom are now on the

483
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:45,349
top and do that you can do that once or

484
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:48,110
twice a day if you feel like you need to

485
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,370
if they are really wet now something I

486
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,620
want to keep stressing is if they are

487
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:53,600
too moist don't be afraid to leave the

488
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,339
lid off the containers and tell the buds

489
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,050
are nice and dry and you feel

490
00:16:55,339 --> 00:16:58,520
comfortable closing them up and you're

491
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:00,859
sure there's not going to get any mold

492
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:03,049
in there because if you leave it closed

493
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,838
for too long or you bend these buds too

494
00:17:03,049 --> 00:17:08,899
early you're going to create an ammonia

495
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,399
type funky terrible smell inside your

496
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,470
butts they're not going to burn well

497
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,390
they're gonna taste terrible they're

498
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:16,009
gonna smell funky and it's not gonna be

499
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:17,720
desirable and you're not gonna be able

500
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:19,910
to sell it at your dispensary or however

501
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,100
you plan on selling it so one problem

502
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,700
you may run into if you leave it closed

503
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:24,769
too long

504
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:26,990
is funky aromas the only thing you can

505
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:29,240
do to fix that is try to air it out just

506
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:31,190
leave it open let it dry try to let that

507
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:32,990
smell go away and it's probably not

508
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:35,930
going to you've probably gone too long

509
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,519
so make sure not to seal it up for too

510
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:39,980
long and make sure not to seal it up

511
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,299
when it's too moist another problem you

512
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,430
could run into during the drying and

513
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:46,069
curing process is the buds could get too

514
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:48,740
dry if your buds get too dry in those

515
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:51,470
containers a trick you can do is to go

516
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,289
pull a few leaves from your growing

517
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:56,180
plants if you've got a flower room you

518
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:57,710
probably need to be foliate a little bit

519
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:59,779
and pull some plant pull some leaves off

520
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:03,230
those flowering plants anyway so go get

521
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:05,269
I would say four to six large leaves per

522
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,450
Rubbermaid container is more than enough

523
00:18:05,269 --> 00:18:10,549
to rehydrate some semi-dry buds in one

524
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:12,559
of those containers we tried to put too

525
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:15,289
much in there and it made it really wet

526
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,960
really quickly so four to six leaves is

527
00:18:15,289 --> 00:18:19,879
more than enough to remoisten an entire

528
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,220
Rubbermaid container if you left it open

529
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,320
just a little bit too long if you got it

530
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,549
down into that Colorado crunch zone then

531
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:27,079
you've done [ __ ] up and you might not

532
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:28,309
be able to fix it but we'll talk about

533
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:30,649
that a little bit later in the episode

534
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,259
but if you didn't go too far just grab

535
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,509
four or five maybe six leaves throw them

536
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:37,309
in in the container and seal it up for

537
00:18:35,509 --> 00:18:39,500
just a few hours then go check on it

538
00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,019
that moisture will reconstitute the buds

539
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,700
and give you a second chance I would not

540
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:46,099
recommend using anything other than

541
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:48,019
cannabis leaves maybe Boveda packs

542
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:50,929
Boveda packs however you like to say it

543
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:52,879
the Boveda packs come in sixty two

544
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:55,039
percent humidity you can use those if

545
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,860
you'd like although I do not prefer them

546
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,019
myself I think they make a weird flavor

547
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:02,419
in my cannabis buds I think that using

548
00:19:00,019 --> 00:19:04,970
the leaves of the same plant is the best

549
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:07,970
idea all right so that is basically the

550
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:09,769
commercial grow version of drying and

551
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:13,279
curing your cannabis plants on a large

552
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:15,289
scale now I'm going to take a giant dab

553
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,059
and when we get back we will talk about

554
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:21,670
drying and curing your cannabis on a

555
00:19:17,059 --> 00:19:21,669
smaller scale for the home grower

556
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:39,179
[Music]

557
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:42,240
all right podcast well let's get back

558
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:44,610
into this dry and cure episode the home

559
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,349
bro or the connoisseur version of drying

560
00:19:44,609 --> 00:19:47,879
and curing your final product is a

561
00:19:46,349 --> 00:19:49,619
little bit different than the commercial

562
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,360
grow version but it's basically the same

563
00:19:49,619 --> 00:19:53,579
idea we want to slow down the drying

564
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,500
process we want to get those buds to

565
00:19:53,579 --> 00:19:57,509
feel nice and sticky you want them to

566
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:00,329
smell nice and sweet we wanted to burn

567
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:03,000
nice and smooth so this is how I would

568
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:06,359
dry and cure my product in a small

569
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,700
connoisseur batch in a smaller grow a

570
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:10,259
home grow or a boutique grow or maybe

571
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,779
something I was going to enter into a

572
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:16,200
competition if this was going into a cup

573
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,609
this is how I would cure my product the

574
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,610
main difference is that I would not be

575
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:24,240
using the gigantic Rubbermaid containers

576
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:26,279
I would use court size widemouth glass

577
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,589
jars I don't want to use bigger jars I

578
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:29,970
feel like maybe too much moisture gets

579
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:31,289
stuck in there you have the same

580
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:33,390
conditions that you create in those

581
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:35,970
Rubbermaid containers I like the smaller

582
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:38,730
more focused jars another note before we

583
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,929
get too far make sure you label each jar

584
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,169
if you're working with more than one

585
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:45,210
strain label the jars not the lids lids

586
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:46,950
are interchangeable be careful with this

587
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,880
please if you're working with different

588
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:53,340
phenotypes label the jar whatever arise

589
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,450
phenotype to arise phenotype three if

590
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:56,609
you're running a pack of seeds or

591
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,160
whatever label the jars so that you know

592
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:00,869
what you're working with basically

593
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:03,390
everything up to the point of the sticks

594
00:21:00,869 --> 00:21:05,548
snapping is the same we're waiting for

595
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,250
the sticks to snap once the sticks snap

596
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:11,579
that's when we can start the jar curing

597
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,069
process for jar tech I would take the

598
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:15,839
snappy sticks and chop off every bud

599
00:21:14,069 --> 00:21:18,119
into a bucket just get all those buds

600
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,619
off the sticks into the bucket throw

601
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,939
those sticks away get rid of them do

602
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:22,798
whatever you do with them compost them

603
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,200
shred them up toss them those are done

604
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:27,150
then I hand trim the buds I'll do

605
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,039
another episode all about hand trimming

606
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:31,230
the buds I don't like trim machines and

607
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,178
I don't like wet trim but I'll talk

608
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,650
about that in the trimming episode that

609
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:36,059
is coming up so I trim the buds

610
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,340
they should be dry enough by now to

611
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:40,379
knock off most of the leaves with your

612
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,389
thumbs and thumbnails so trim them up

613
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,090
pretty closely with your thumb then put

614
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,440
the trimmed buds into the glass jars

615
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:49,709
that we talked about the wide mouth

616
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:53,930
quart-size mason jars fill those jars

617
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:57,029
about 75 to 90% fool if your buds are

618
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,160
fluffier if your buds are bigger you're

619
00:21:57,029 --> 00:22:01,440
only gonna be able to get 75% in there

620
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,360
because of all the air space I get it it

621
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,090
makes sense if you've got smaller buds

622
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,740
you can put up to 90% in there but do

623
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:09,750
not press them down into the jar and

624
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:11,400
don't over pack them and don't squish

625
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:12,470
them in you just want them lightly

626
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,450
sitting in there

627
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:17,429
now once the jar is full I add the lid

628
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:21,000
and I set a timer I like to check my

629
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:23,550
buds about 4 hours after being sealed up

630
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,410
for the first time this first check lets

631
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:27,149
me see how much moisture is trapped in

632
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:29,730
my butts if the inside of the jar is

633
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:31,410
extremely humid I'll just leave that lid

634
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,000
off for an hour or more and the

635
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,400
commercial grow we were talking about

636
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,339
four to six maybe eight hours maybe even

637
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,559
10 hours those are much larger plants

638
00:22:38,339 --> 00:22:42,869
much larger batches and much larger

639
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:45,119
containers there is much more moisture

640
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:47,369
in there so for these smaller jars I

641
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:50,099
only want to leave it off for a little

642
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:52,169
bit at a time these smaller batches can

643
00:22:50,099 --> 00:22:54,299
get away from you quite quickly so pay

644
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,250
more attention so open it up see how

645
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,928
humid it is if it's really humid and

646
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:59,819
really squishy you're gonna want to

647
00:22:57,929 --> 00:23:01,830
leave it open for an hour maybe a little

648
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:04,289
bit more just keep checking on it and do

649
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:05,819
not forget about it set another timer if

650
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:08,399
the humidity has not made the buds

651
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:10,289
squishy again I'll leave the jar open

652
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,750
for only like 15 to 30 minutes to let

653
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:14,609
the moisture out and that old funky air

654
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,558
out of the jar and then it'll kind of

655
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:18,178
refresh with fresh air in there then

656
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,149
I'll reseal the jar and let it sit for

657
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:24,120
another four to six hours I set a timer

658
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,190
for this then in four to six hours I pop

659
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:28,259
that jar and I gently stir the buds

660
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,570
around and check the aroma that comes

661
00:23:28,259 --> 00:23:35,910
out of there what I'm looking for when I

662
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:38,189
smell is an aroma of ammonia or funk or

663
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,509
just you'll notice it your nose will

664
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:41,670
crinkle up and your eyes will make a

665
00:23:39,509 --> 00:23:44,099
weird squint you'll go [ __ ] I [ __ ] up

666
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:46,800
looking for that aroma I'm hoping that's

667
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:48,299
not present it shouldn't be also I'm

668
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,809
looking to see if it smells

669
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:54,809
less wet has it gone from that wet juicy

670
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:56,279
hey smell two more of that cured chronic

671
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,779
smell that I'm looking for because it'll

672
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,149
start doing it quickly and then it will

673
00:23:57,779 --> 00:24:01,889
improve over time so I'm cracking the

674
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:04,740
jar open I'm looking to see how much

675
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:07,259
humidity is in there um I stir him

676
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:10,079
around if the buds seem damp or extra

677
00:24:07,259 --> 00:24:11,849
spongy at this point I'll dump them out

678
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,859
of the jar and let them sit for a few

679
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:16,409
minutes until that excess moisture

680
00:24:13,859 --> 00:24:18,299
evaporates you don't want the buds super

681
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:19,980
soggy and sealed in a jar you don't want

682
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:22,169
the buds super wet and pressed together

683
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,599
in a jar if they still feel wet and

684
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,009
spongy on the outside I'll dump them out

685
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,409
and let them sit out for a few minutes

686
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:29,940
until they feel dry on the outside but

687
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,890
when you squeeze them they're mushy

688
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,779
still a little bit you just want them

689
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:35,310
dry on the outside wet on the inside is

690
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:37,829
what you're going for at this point if

691
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:39,629
the buds are sticking together then I

692
00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:41,939
dump them out completely and let them

693
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,620
dry more before putting them back in now

694
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,140
we want a little bit of moisture in

695
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:47,969
these buds the little bit of moisture is

696
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,890
going to make the drying and curing

697
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:53,009
process happen but we don't want enough

698
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:55,290
moisture to cause mold and funk so we

699
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:56,879
burp the jar about every four hours to

700
00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:59,579
make sure we don't seal too much water

701
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,410
in the jar for too long we let some of

702
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:03,449
the curing process happen by opening the

703
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:04,980
jar letting that old gas out that

704
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:07,140
contains the chlorophyll that contains

705
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,670
the sugars that gas evaporates out of

706
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,770
the jar we replace it with fresh air we

707
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,420
seal it back up then when we seal it

708
00:25:10,769 --> 00:25:14,970
it's allowed to restart the curing

709
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:16,650
process it'll start deteriorating and

710
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,839
eating up more of that chlorophyll more

711
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,009
of those excess minerals and sugars

712
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,409
inside of there and they will start

713
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:24,779
evaporating out of your buds you'll get

714
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:27,210
them out so let's get back on track here

715
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,339
after the first couple of days you can

716
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:31,950
slowly increase your burp intervals as

717
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,959
the buds get drier you may only need to

718
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,970
open these jars up every six to eight

719
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,680
hours after a little bit and the time

720
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,019
that you leave them open will also

721
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:42,150
decrease so maybe after a few days you

722
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:43,470
pop it open every eight hours maybe you

723
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,670
pop it open right before you go to work

724
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,019
you leave it open while you're brushing

725
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,519
your teeth and getting your shoes on and

726
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:48,750
then you close it up and you leave you

727
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:50,519
come back from work and then you pop it

728
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:52,799
open it's probably been 10 hours by now

729
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,029
pop it open again stir the buds around

730
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,950
make sure nothing's gone funky if

731
00:25:54,029 --> 00:25:58,019
nothing's gone funky just leave it open

732
00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:00,299
for five minutes let that air exchange

733
00:25:58,019 --> 00:26:01,619
in there seal it right back up then you

734
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,230
can go ten hours and you know you're

735
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:04,389
safe it

736
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,798
hours see what happens at 11:00 hour see

737
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,080
what happens at 12 hours just start

738
00:26:05,798 --> 00:26:09,819
stretching it every day by the end of

739
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:12,308
two weeks you'll just be popping these

740
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:13,389
jars open once a day you'll check it out

741
00:26:12,308 --> 00:26:15,279
you'll give it a good smell and you'll

742
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:17,620
say that is so close and then you can

743
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,200
close it back up by the end of two weeks

744
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:22,659
these buds will be beautifully

745
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:26,740
beautifully cured so the blood should be

746
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:28,750
sticky on the outside and spongy but not

747
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,220
dry and crumbly they should almost have

748
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,509
a little bit of squeeze a little bit of

749
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,110
give to them and then stick to your

750
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:33,940
fingers

751
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:36,459
they shouldn't fall apart and just

752
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,798
crumble up like a lot of the Colorado

753
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,419
dispensary bud does unfortunately and

754
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:41,859
the reason for that you guys is because

755
00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:43,720
it's sitting on the Shelf out there all

756
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:45,819
day they're opening up those jars and

757
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,620
showing it to you all day this stuff is

758
00:26:45,819 --> 00:26:49,750
just getting dry so that's the problem

759
00:26:47,619 --> 00:26:51,639
with the Colorado crunch I apologize for

760
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:53,048
that the growers work hard to get it

761
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:54,640
proper and then it's sent to the

762
00:26:53,048 --> 00:26:56,980
dispensary and left in those jars and

763
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,470
the bud tenders don't do us justice so I

764
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,880
apologize so on day one I chopped the

765
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,350
buds off the sticks and I trim them up

766
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,929
then I filled the jars

767
00:27:02,349 --> 00:27:07,029
about 90% full then I seal the jar I

768
00:27:04,929 --> 00:27:08,919
checked the jar in about four hours I

769
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:10,599
opened it long enough for the excess

770
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,610
moisture to come out of the jar that

771
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:14,949
could be a little while that could be a

772
00:27:12,609 --> 00:27:16,750
short amount of time it kind of depends

773
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:18,580
on how wet the buds were when you jarred

774
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,039
them up then I check it again in about

775
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:23,730
four hours I shuffled the buds if I feel

776
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,200
that's necessary it's likely necessary

777
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:28,480
then I check again in four to six hours

778
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:30,160
and leave open as necessary if they're

779
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,048
getting too sticky again I'll dump them

780
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,419
out you'll want to check as soon as you

781
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:35,950
wake up the next day the burr process

782
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:38,110
will slow down over the next few days

783
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:40,929
you want it to take as long as possible

784
00:27:38,109 --> 00:27:42,639
without allowing mildew to develop you

785
00:27:40,929 --> 00:27:44,710
want to slow it down the longer it takes

786
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,509
the better the more time that it takes

787
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:48,429
for that moisture to come out the more

788
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:50,798
opportunity you have for chlorophyll to

789
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:52,900
be removed the only thing to worry about

790
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,029
very similarly to the rubbermaid

791
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:57,460
technique is trapping too much moisture

792
00:27:55,029 --> 00:28:00,039
in your containers for too long and

793
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,890
causing yourself mildew or funky flavors

794
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,480
if you locked your buds up in these jars

795
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:06,549
long enough to where you got like white

796
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,750
MOLLE webbing growing on there and it

797
00:28:06,548 --> 00:28:09,329
looks like some cotton coming out you

798
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:12,190
[ __ ] up and didn't pay any attention

799
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:14,048
throw that away if your jar is starting

800
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,440
to get an ammonia smell you've sealed it

801
00:28:14,048 --> 00:28:17,628
up too long you've got

802
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,519
open it more frequently and longer next

803
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:21,079
time you may be able to save it but it's

804
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,579
unlikely the only thing you can do is

805
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:25,189
leave it open and let it dry out and

806
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:27,408
hopefully that smell will go away so

807
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:29,600
don't leave it closed too long

808
00:28:27,409 --> 00:28:31,250
don't let mildew happen don't let that

809
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,469
funky smell happen once you're past the

810
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,419
first few days you'll kind of be out of

811
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:37,909
the mildew danger zone but still be

812
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:40,669
careful also keep your jars in a cool

813
00:28:37,909 --> 00:28:42,590
dark place while you're curing your buds

814
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:44,538
but also don't leave them somewhere

815
00:28:42,589 --> 00:28:47,808
where you're going to forget about them

816
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:50,089
also here in Colorado I'm running a

817
00:28:47,808 --> 00:28:52,849
swamp cooler in the main portion the

818
00:28:50,089 --> 00:28:54,589
living area of my house don't go dump

819
00:28:52,849 --> 00:28:56,359
your buds on the table near the swamp

820
00:28:54,589 --> 00:28:58,278
cooler this is not going to do you any

821
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,798
good this is going to reconstitute them

822
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,990
and make them wetter think about wetter

823
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,849
is that a word anyway think about the

824
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,378
environment where you were drying and

825
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:07,759
curing your products if you're gonna

826
00:29:06,378 --> 00:29:10,250
dump them out on the table and an

827
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,980
attempt to get them more dry make sure

828
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,839
that the room is drier than the butt or

829
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,128
it's not going to work just keep that

830
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:17,599
kind of stuff in mind you guys think

831
00:29:16,128 --> 00:29:19,788
about your environment think about your

832
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,888
products so I feel like we've got a

833
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:25,069
basic understanding of how to cure our

834
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:27,558
buds now let's get into the technical

835
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:30,168
talk about why we do it and what's

836
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,538
technically happening securing your buds

837
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:34,429
properly makes your buds burn and smoke

838
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:37,128
smoothly and it also brings out the best

839
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:39,340
flavors and aromas proper drying and

840
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:42,079
curing will also increase your potency

841
00:29:39,339 --> 00:29:43,459
now why why does that happen because

842
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,278
your buds contain chlorophyll

843
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:48,980
chlorophyll is what gives your buds that

844
00:29:46,278 --> 00:29:50,599
harsh smoke and hay like flavor that

845
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,579
burn your throat kind of funky flavor

846
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:54,648
that's from too much chlorophyll that's

847
00:29:52,579 --> 00:29:57,048
from excess minerals in the plant that

848
00:29:54,648 --> 00:29:59,778
could also be from an improper flush but

849
00:29:57,048 --> 00:30:01,759
it's usually from an improper cure so

850
00:29:59,778 --> 00:30:03,558
curing the buds will remove chlorophyll

851
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:06,288
and increase your potency at the same

852
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:09,440
time the only way to remove chlorophyll

853
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:11,569
is by turning it into a gas sealing our

854
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,950
moist buds in a jar creates an

855
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:14,740
environment that will break down the

856
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:18,048
chlorophyll and turn it into a gas

857
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:21,620
darkness moisture and oxygen will create

858
00:30:18,048 --> 00:30:23,480
a bacteria within the jar that bacteria

859
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:25,609
will break down the sugars and leftover

860
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,500
minerals created by the decomposition of

861
00:30:25,609 --> 00:30:28,649
the chlorophyll and it will turn into a

862
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,019
vapor the

863
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:32,130
escape the jar when you pop it open that

864
00:30:31,019 --> 00:30:34,200
was what I was talking about earlier

865
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,970
when I said we pop open the jar and let

866
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:37,769
the chemical reaction happen now this

867
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,539
process is going to make your bud burn

868
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:41,490
smoother it's going to tape make it

869
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:44,579
taste better it's gonna bring out the

870
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,230
proper aromas the proper terpene profile

871
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:48,689
that you're looking for and it's also

872
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:51,930
going to increase the overall potency of

873
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:53,820
your finished product now if you really

874
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:56,039
want to nerd out and dial this in and

875
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:58,529
create a connoisseur product find

876
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,180
yourself a hygrometer that fits inside

877
00:30:58,529 --> 00:31:02,069
of your mason jar there are a couple

878
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:03,480
available that fit right inside the

879
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,740
mason jar you can press it up to the

880
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,349
front of the jar where you can read the

881
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,269
display without opening the jar find

882
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:12,329
yourself hygrometers that will fit in

883
00:31:09,269 --> 00:31:14,579
the jar and here are some suggestions on

884
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:17,429
when to open and close your jars and how

885
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:20,490
to dial them in perfectly if your buds

886
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:22,920
feel wet or if they are above 70%

887
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:25,170
humidity if the little display on that

888
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,930
hydrometer inside of your jar reads

889
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:31,350
above 70% humidity you need to dump

890
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:35,340
those buds out of the jar and let them

891
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:37,199
dry until they get to 65 to 70% humidity

892
00:31:35,339 --> 00:31:38,699
now when you dump them out and you leave

893
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,140
them somewhere that's not by the fan

894
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:42,120
that's not by the swamp cooler that's

895
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,410
not by the air-conditioner that's not by

896
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:45,359
something that's going to drastically

897
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:47,759
affect the rate of their drying

898
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,679
don't forget about them set a timer and

899
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:51,629
go find them some of you are a little

900
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:53,009
obsessive you're definitely not gonna

901
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,600
forget some of you are gonna take a

902
00:31:53,009 --> 00:31:56,160
couple of dabs and go play fort night

903
00:31:54,599 --> 00:31:57,899
and your buds are gonna dry up to [ __ ]

904
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,570
don't let that happen to you guys

905
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,430
so if they are too humid dump them out

906
00:32:00,569 --> 00:32:05,519
let them dry out a little bit get them

907
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:07,560
down to 65 to 70% humidity now if your

908
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,629
buds feel moist to the touch if they're

909
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:12,509
sticky and wet to the outside of the

910
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:15,180
buds and the display reads 65 to 70%

911
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:17,369
humidity pop the lid off of that jar for

912
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:19,740
fifteen to thirty minutes and let a

913
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:21,569
little moisture evaporate out if you

914
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,319
think they need longer than fifteen to

915
00:32:21,569 --> 00:32:25,049
thirty minutes

916
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,519
let them go longer but like I said don't

917
00:32:25,049 --> 00:32:28,049
start playing fortnight and start

918
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,670
building [ __ ] and shooting people and

919
00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:32,190
forget about them because you don't want

920
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:34,259
them to get too crunchy so fifteen to

921
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,110
thirty maybe 45 minutes maybe an hour

922
00:32:34,259 --> 00:32:38,430
seal them back up set yourself a timer

923
00:32:37,109 --> 00:32:40,199
to remember to check on them in a little

924
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,830
bit and now you can go play fort night

925
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,120
and relax

926
00:32:40,829 --> 00:32:47,549
now your goal is 60 to 65% humidity you

927
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:50,429
want that hydrometer to read between 60

928
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:52,740
and 65 percent humidity and you want

929
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:55,980
them dry but not crunchy they're gonna

930
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,289
feel squishy and sticky hopefully but

931
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,809
they're not wet you just want them dry

932
00:32:58,289 --> 00:33:02,250
but not crunchy you might need to let

933
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:04,139
your buds sit out for a little bit

934
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,019
before you roll a joint if it's cured

935
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:09,300
perfectly the display will say 60 to 65%

936
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:10,889
you may need to take a couple of buds

937
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,789
out of there and set them I just set

938
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:13,020
them right here on the front of my

939
00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:14,339
computer if I'm gonna roll when it's a

940
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,019
little warmer right there to suddam

941
00:33:14,339 --> 00:33:17,609
chill they're not like in the path of

942
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,660
the fan or anything just let them chill

943
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:19,889
right here that's what I'm gonna roll

944
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:21,240
the joint with in a few minutes and just

945
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:23,040
let them sit there you know just just

946
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,299
for a little bit just maybe if I'm gonna

947
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,680
go to lunch and come back and smoke a

948
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:27,450
joint I'll set them out right before I

949
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,529
go to lunch and then you go to lunch and

950
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:29,730
then you come back and then they grind

951
00:33:28,529 --> 00:33:32,430
up nice and fine and they're still

952
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:34,890
sticky oh they're still juicy and then

953
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:36,330
your joint burns super smoothly and if

954
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,610
your joints not burning super smooth

955
00:33:36,329 --> 00:33:40,439
then you probably have too much moisture

956
00:33:38,609 --> 00:33:43,079
in there and you gotta let it dry and

957
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:45,390
cure just a little bit longer now if you

958
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:47,159
hit that 55 percent or lower mark you're

959
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,110
entering what I call the Colorado crunch

960
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,000
area and your buds are gonna burn too

961
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:52,889
fast and you're also losing weight if

962
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,599
you're working with more than a quarter

963
00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:56,310
pound there and you're drying it up do

964
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:57,719
you risk losing you know a quarter of an

965
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:00,240
ounce or whatever depends on how much

966
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,029
you let it dry so if your buds get too

967
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,069
dry don't add anything funky to

968
00:34:03,029 --> 00:34:06,450
rehydrate them the only thing I would

969
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:08,610
use are fresh

970
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,650
cannabis leaves and a little bit goes a

971
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:12,269
long way so take them out when the

972
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:14,760
moisture comes back and don't let those

973
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:17,369
leaves mold up in there and [ __ ] up your

974
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:20,010
crop check on them frequently if you put

975
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:22,259
wet leaves inside of either your curing

976
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:24,960
jars or your packs or your [ __ ]

977
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,850
turkey bags however you do it make sure

978
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,039
you take them out and don't leave them

979
00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:32,489
for too long check on them after an hour

980
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:34,559
one hour is more than enough go check on

981
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:36,299
it set yourself a timer don't get stuck

982
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:39,840
doing an Instagram live video and forget

983
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:40,800
to check on your buds all right so it's

984
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,600
gonna take a little bit for your

985
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,700
hydrometer to measure the humidity in

986
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:46,679
the jar but it's gonna get you a pretty

987
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:49,259
good idea of when to open and close

988
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,210
those jars and it's gonna give you some

989
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,310
actual data to go by you'll be able to

990
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:54,570
squeeze those buds and feel how wet they

991
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:56,429
are and you'll be able to compare

992
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:57,750
that number or that moisture to the

993
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,059
number on the hygrometer and you'll go

994
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,639
oh that's what 65% feels like that's

995
00:35:00,059 --> 00:35:03,989
what's Jeffs trying to get me to so that

996
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,969
gives you something to work with it's a

997
00:35:03,989 --> 00:35:08,069
little bit of a cheater but if you're

998
00:35:05,969 --> 00:35:09,480
using one hygrometer you're gonna have

999
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,550
to seal it into the jar for a few

1000
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:13,139
minutes and wait for it to get to where

1001
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,940
it needs to be now if it's jumping real

1002
00:35:13,139 --> 00:35:17,039
fast go ahead and pull it out leave that

1003
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,000
jar open that means it's really humid in

1004
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:20,099
there and that you're just gonna seal it

1005
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,079
up and cause problems all right so we've

1006
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:24,029
got a little tiny hydrometer in our jars

1007
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,179
we're watching the numbers we're trying

1008
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:29,700
to get ourselves to 60 to 65% humidity

1009
00:35:27,179 --> 00:35:31,289
inside of those jars make sure you don't

1010
00:35:29,699 --> 00:35:33,029
forget about your buds make sure you

1011
00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:34,440
don't get that funky aroma in there make

1012
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:36,420
sure it doesn't smell like ammonia and

1013
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:38,369
mildew make sure you don't ruin it you

1014
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:39,990
should be paying attention to the number

1015
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,400
on the hygrometer and then pulling some

1016
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:44,429
buds out and seeing what they feel like

1017
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,139
so that you know what 50 what 60 what 70

1018
00:35:44,429 --> 00:35:48,000
what 80% humidity if you get to 80 you

1019
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:49,650
[ __ ] up but so that you know what the

1020
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:51,570
percentage of humidity feels like inside

1021
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,980
these jars what the bud feels like this

1022
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:54,990
will give you a really good idea start

1023
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:56,909
paying attention to that stuff and you

1024
00:35:54,989 --> 00:35:59,519
will get ahead of the drying and curing

1025
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:01,829
game now once you've gotten your buds

1026
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,360
dried and cured to 55 to 65 percent

1027
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:05,549
humidity and you don't see any

1028
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:06,269
fluctuation inside that jar on the

1029
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:08,250
hydrometer

1030
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:09,900
you only need to crack them open to

1031
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,159
check on them or pull out some buds to

1032
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,990
smoke you don't need to keep popping

1033
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:14,429
those jars open they're gonna get too

1034
00:36:12,989 --> 00:36:16,109
dry if you do that so you can trap the

1035
00:36:14,429 --> 00:36:18,210
moisture in there leave it right at that

1036
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:20,370
point and your blood will be perfectly

1037
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,720
cured for whenever you need it now I've

1038
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:24,089
said before that I don't like the Boveda

1039
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:25,859
packs but they work if you do [ __ ] up

1040
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,840
the Boveda packs I would buy are the

1041
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,640
sixty-two percent and you can just drop

1042
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,070
them right inside your jar it'll help

1043
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:34,829
reconstitute that package or that jar

1044
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,330
and then sometimes I feel like they

1045
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:37,559
leave kind of a watery flavor on the

1046
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:40,289
buds but I guess I'd rather have a

1047
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:42,389
properly cured bud that has that aroma

1048
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:44,190
within some Colorado crunch it's just

1049
00:36:42,389 --> 00:36:46,920
gonna burn up when I light my joint at

1050
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:49,019

website I actually bought a MacBook so I

1083
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,228
need to pay for the MacBook I actually

1084
00:37:56,759 --> 00:37:59,608
buy these little microphone covers so

1085
00:37:58,228 --> 00:38:00,778
that when granny and giddy are on they

1086
00:37:59,608 --> 00:38:03,328
don't have to spit into these same

1087
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:04,559
microphone covers over and over again so

1088
00:38:03,329 --> 00:38:06,150

1089
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,130
