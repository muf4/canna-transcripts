00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,929
to read it on the show also find the

136
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:47,300
comments on stitcher and read those on a

137
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,650
future episode stitcher is kind of weird

138
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,139
they don't put the comments all in one

139
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:52,819
spot they spread them around they stay

140
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:54,680
on each episode so unless I go search

141
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:57,980
back through the episodes I won't find

142
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:59,418

143

00:06:40,288 --> 00:06:45,449
article comes from voxcom Vox explains

193

everything you need to know in two

194
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,389
minutes

195
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,610
so I got two minutes this article is

196
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:54,569
written by German Lopez and it was

197
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:56,249
written on may 30th the article says the

198
00:06:54,569 --> 00:06:57,749
US House of Representatives

199
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,460
late Thursday passed a measure that

200
00:06:57,749 --> 00:07:01,110
would prohibit the federal government

201
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:04,019
from interfering with States medical

202
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,669
marijuana laws this bill is the first

203
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,498
time in history that any Chamber of

204
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:10,109
Commerce has acted to protect medical

205
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:12,389
marijuana businesses and users it also

206
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:14,669
got bipartisan support a hundred and

207
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:17,218
seventy Democrats and 49 Republicans

208
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:18,778
voted in favor of the bill the measure

209
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:20,819
was attached to a funding bill for

210
00:07:18,778 --> 00:07:22,348
several federal agencies and it blocks

211
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,028
the part of the Department of Justice

212
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:25,949
and Drug Enforcement Administration from

213
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:27,899
using funds to prevent States from

214
00:07:25,949 --> 00:07:30,419
implementing their own medical marijuana

215
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:32,430
laws the measure however will require

216
00:07:30,418 --> 00:07:35,188
approval from the Senate and President

217
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:37,228
Barack Obama as soon as a Senate is

218
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:38,759
expected to pass its own funding bill so

219
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:41,209
the Medical Marijuana amendment will

220
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:43,229
need to survive through both chambers

221
00:07:41,209 --> 00:07:46,079
reconciliation process and then obtain

222
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:47,610
Obama's signature to become law so are

223
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,098
two steps away from getting these

224
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,899
[ __ ] to quit [ __ ] with us and

225
00:07:50,098 --> 00:07:53,490
letting us do business and grow our herb

226
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,230
and take care of our patients and do

227
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,290
what we need to do

228
00:07:55,230 --> 00:08:00,240
I don't want to rattle the cage too much

229
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:01,890
so the article says still marijuana

230
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,500
legalization advocates praised the

231
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,759
houses decision Congress is officially

232
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,860
pulling out of the war on medical

233
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,480
marijuana patients and providers federal

234
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,009
tax dollars will no longer be wasted

235
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,600
arresting seriously ill medical

236
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,849
marijuana patients and those who provide

237
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,500
to them dan riffle director of federal

238
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:19,260
policies at the Marijuana Policy Project

239
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:20,790
says a statement this is a historic vote

240
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:22,740
and it's yet another sign that our

241
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:25,830
federal government is shifting toward a

242
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,660
more sensible Marijuana Policy the vote

243
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:29,069
while historic and a bit surprising even

244
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,960
advocates as part of the federal

245
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:33,750
government's ongoing shift toward more

246
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:36,149
liberal marijuana policies just a few

247
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,590
weeks ago the feds increased how much

248
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,689
marijuana can be grown for medical

249
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:41,668
research President Barack Obama and his

250
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,560
administration have taken steps to

251
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:45,179
mitigate prosecutions against marijuana

252
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,879
businesses that operate illegally under

253
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:49,769
state laws marijuana advocates in

254
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,539
previous interviews have said that this

255
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,549
is the logical progression for Marijuana

256
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:55,740
Policy as popular opinion shifts in

257
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:57,809
favor of legalizing the drug and more

258
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,820
states begin to seriously consider fully

259
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:01,079
legalizing marijuana as more

260
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,810
congressional leaders gain more

261
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,370
constituents that complete that legally

262
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:07,379
used marijuana for recreational and

263
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,179
medical purposes they will face

264
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:12,509
increasing pressure to relax their

265
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:13,979
stance on the drug still legalization

266
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:15,809
advocates have their work cut out for

267
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,310
them marijuana is still illegal under

268
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:19,019
federal law and considered a more

269
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:21,449
dangerous drug than cocaine and men

270
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:23,129
under the DEA scheduling system as a

271
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,960
result banks don't have enough faith in

272
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:26,939
marijuana businesses to let them open

273
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,519
bank accounts which horses pot shops and

274
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,350
cultivators to run is risky cash-only

275
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,019
enterprises we've talked about that a

276
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,300
little bit on the show so as it stands

277
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:37,259
we are only two steps away from the

278
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:39,509
federal government

279
00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:41,460
stopping raiding patients providers and

280
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,490
dispensaries for marijuana production

281
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:46,259
and possession maybe once we get to that

282
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:48,240
point the banks will start accepting our

283
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:51,319
funds and the dispensaries will start

284
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,750
being taken seriously like businesses

285
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,180
we can only hope right here's another

286
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,460
article involving the feds and some of

287
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,319
their silliness I looked all over for

288
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,780

such use to the Department of Justice

333
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,769
and document the reporting actions

334
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,039
according to the temporary policy most

335
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:46,490
about the u.s. be our website

336
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:48,649
so if an employee of the reclamation

337
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,589
reclamation department finds that you're

338
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:54,139
using water to grow some weed they're

339
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:59,149
supposed to report to the Department of

340
00:11:54,139 --> 00:12:00,889
Justice man whatever so currently 21

341
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:03,429
states in the District of Columbia have

342
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:05,419
legalized marijuana for medical purposes

343
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:07,219
recreational marijuana is now legal in

344
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:08,719
Colorado and Washington State and about

345
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,339
a dozen other states are considering a

346
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,440
legalization in the coming years

347
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,360
still the federal government continues

348
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,550
to ban the plant classifying in a

349
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:20,089
Schedule one substance alongside heroin

350
00:12:16,549 --> 00:12:22,639
and LSD we get our way pretty soon here

351
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,709
we got two more steps and we may see

352
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,230
some change maybe they'll give us our

353
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,699
water back but Obama tells them to stop

354
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:31,580
rating off illegal growers and grow

355
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:33,410
facilities there's actually a dispensary

356
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,940
in Pueblo West that's suffering right

357
00:12:33,409 --> 00:12:36,889
now because their waters been turned off

358
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:40,480
and I called them and tried to get in

359
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:43,399
touch with them but they did not respond

360
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,170
all right let's read another article our

361
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,470
next article actually comes from Pueblo

362
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:49,500
Colorado

363
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,889
it's in the Pueblo chieftain the article

364
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:55,279
was written by Peter Roper that's a

365
00:12:52,889 --> 00:13:02,340
[ __ ] poor name if I ever heard one

366
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:04,589
okay the article is headlined webelo

367
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,100
City Council nota making hash no

368
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:09,269
agreement on where pot should be smoked

369
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:11,129
making hash oil will be illegal in

370
00:13:09,269 --> 00:13:12,960
Pueblo that's one decision City Council

371
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,909
didn't have trouble with Tuesday night

372
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,530
as it wrangled over some simple and some

373
00:13:14,909 --> 00:13:18,329
complicated questions about allowing the

374
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:21,360
use of recreational marijuana in the

375
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:22,740
city hash oil by the way is a potent

376
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,990
cannabis concentrate that is made with

377
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:26,940
butane a flammable gas that has caused

378
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:29,370
the exploding houses in Colorado Springs

379
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,050
and elsewhere Council collectively shook

380
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,240
their heads no Tuesday night after

381
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,129
assistant city attorney

382
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,779
Carlos Sykes explained some of the

383
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:39,899
hazards of hash oil during the weekly

384
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:41,699
work session but the tougher question

385
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,350
should city residents be able to smoke

386
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,930
pot on their front porches or in their

387
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:46,980
yards did not get resolved although the

388
00:13:45,929 --> 00:13:49,319
city doesn't allow the sale of

389
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,090
recreational pot council is trying to

390
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,460
give city residents guidance on how they

391
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:55,950
can legally use in the city I want to

392
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:58,470
mention that there are dispensaries like

393
00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:01,230
five miles outside of the city limits in

394
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:03,420
Pueblo West and twelve County and just

395
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:05,490
south at stamp Beach so for five or ten

396
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,750
minutes away we don't have access to it

397
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,250
they just don't allow it right inside

398
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,149
city limits which we have talked about

399
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:13,769
which we find silly so we'll continue

400
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,929
councilman Steve Morocco councilman

401
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,059
Steve Nawrocki and Ed Brown as well as

402
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:20,189
Councilwoman Aimee Nawrocki all spoke up

403
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:21,689
for letting people use legally use

404
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,280
marijuana anywhere on their property

405
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,730
just like smoking cigarettes or drinking

406
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,709
beer

407
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,269
we just have to trust people to use

408
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:29,730
their best judgment Steve Baraka

409
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:31,559
contended Council President sandy daffy

410
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:33,800
responded by underlining her opposition

411
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:35,958
letting people use pot their front yard

412
00:14:33,799 --> 00:14:38,659
my community deserves better than this

413
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,428
she said sikes explained how other

414
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:42,169
Colorado cities such as Arvada and

415
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:45,110
Boulder restrict the use of recreational

416
00:14:42,169 --> 00:14:46,308
pot to backyards and enclosed yards I'm

417
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,869
kind of offended by the statement that

418
00:14:46,308 --> 00:14:50,419
she said my community deserves better

419
00:14:47,869 --> 00:14:54,639
than this what's wrong with me sitting

420
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:57,048
on my porch on a nice summer day sit

421
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,308
with my damn phone in the sunshine I

422
00:14:57,048 --> 00:14:59,989
know that's ridiculous but I watch the

423
00:14:58,308 --> 00:15:02,028
traffic and I cool off and just let my

424
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:03,829
thoughts wander for a minute sometimes I

425
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:04,850
put the phone away just I'd like to be

426
00:15:03,828 --> 00:15:06,378
able to just smoke a joint without

427
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,399
anybody [ __ ] there yeah I don't do it

428
00:15:06,379 --> 00:15:09,170
cuz I don't want to bring any attention

429
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:11,828
to myself but I wish I could do it

430
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:14,360
without anybody just bitching and I know

431
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,708
like why can't dread locks I'd be the

432
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:18,889
perfect target for them to go [ __ ] with

433
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:21,349
so I just don't do that but we deserve

434
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:22,818
better than this we we voted this in we

435
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,798
voted to be able to use cannabis we

436
00:15:22,818 --> 00:15:27,229
voted for it to be recreational we

437
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,838
should feel free as adults to smoke

438
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,249
where we feel like we can smoke all

439
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,600
right I got a quick drink I'm all choked

440
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:38,720
up from the jab dad hold on for one

441
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:40,308
second all right

442
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,470
front yards and walks are essentially

443
00:15:40,308 --> 00:15:44,769
public she said an amendment 64 does not

444
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:47,360
allow the public use of marijuana

445
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:48,919
Denver does allow open use in yards and

446
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,629
Steve Nawrocki said he wants the city

447
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:52,938
staff to bring forward an ordinance that

448
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:54,558
starts with the Denver language if there

449
00:15:52,938 --> 00:15:58,259
are votes to change it they can amend it

450
00:15:54,558 --> 00:16:00,969
he said he was referring to death

451
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:03,159
councilman Chris Coffman Councilwoman

452
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,080
IVA Montoya and councilman Chris nickel

453
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:07,299
who have all challenged recreational pot

454
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,920
in one way or another there are some

455
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:11,379
decisions about whether to allow

456
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:13,329
marijuana clubs if bought is legal for

457
00:16:11,379 --> 00:16:15,458
recreational purposes why shouldn't

458
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:17,110
there be clubs allowed where people can

459
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,909
use it together but the general

460
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:20,769
consensus on council leaned against that

461
00:16:18,909 --> 00:16:22,059
a major reason was the challenge of

462
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,970
having city police or firefighters

463
00:16:22,059 --> 00:16:27,219
respond to incidents at such a club

464
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,320
where they might be to have prolonged

465
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,879
contact with marijuana smoke that could

466
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,860
affect their job performance I know I

467
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,230
laugh to do that because I read it it

468
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:36,639
got [ __ ] silly to me but I tried to

469
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:38,860
read through that [ __ ] again without

470
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,449
laughing at you guys the major reason

471
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,550
was the challenge of having city police

472
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:43,930
or firefighters respond to incidents at

473
00:16:42,549 --> 00:16:46,240
such a club where they might have

474
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:48,250
prolonged contact with marijuana smoke

475
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,409
that could affect their job performance

476
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,778
so one of the reasons they're trying to

477
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,909
stop us from having a recreational smoke

478
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,799
lounge chair at Pueblo Colorado is

479
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:59,860
because they're afraid if the cops are

480
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,419
the firefighters have to go there they

481
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,220
will have prolonged contact with

482
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:07,269
marijuana smoke that could affect their

483
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,519
job performance that's some [ __ ]

484
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:10,660
that's that's over worrying how long do

485
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:12,609
you think they're gonna be in there how

486
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,480
smoky do you think it's gonna be chill

487
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:17,119
the [ __ ] out

488
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,699
I was actually asked recently to be on

489
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,039
the council that's going to write the

490
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:24,650
rules the proposed rules to get a

491
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:25,970
recreational shop open here in my

492
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:27,169
neighborhood actually people that are

493
00:17:25,970 --> 00:17:29,298
opening you don't even realize I live

494
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:31,130
right by that they came to me they said

495
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:34,609
that the council is gonna stop it from

496
00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,169
being possible if we don't proactively

497

ago and it's still relevant says I'm

519

521
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,849

522
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,110

America with your buds this is my first

526
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,509
piece of advice before you ever order a

527
00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:53,149
seed or purchase a clone before you even

528
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:54,619
walk into the hydro shop before you open

529
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:56,390
a catalog to see what kind of nutrients

530
00:18:54,619 --> 00:18:58,099
you want to use arabic i recommend

531
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,740
buying yourself a good grow book from a

532
00:18:58,099 --> 00:19:02,569
reputable grower author i recommend and

533
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,700
Rosenthal's marijuana growers handbook

534
00:19:02,569 --> 00:19:06,168
or Jorge Cervantes marijuana

535
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,880
horticulture at the medical growers

536
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:10,250

you have a nice knowledge base take a

542
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:22,368
look at dr. Robert Cullen Clarke's

543
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:24,259
marijuana botany or Greg greens cannabis

544
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:26,538
breeders Bible there's a plethora of

545
00:19:24,259 --> 00:19:28,308
knowledge in each of these books if you

546
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:30,259
read and study before you start a garden

547
00:19:28,308 --> 00:19:32,088

548
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:33,979
how to build your grow space what to

549
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:36,019
plan for during the grow which types of

550
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:38,269
jet genetics you want to grow and a good

551
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:40,819
plan for preventing problems problems

552
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:42,649
will arise during your grow if you read

553
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:44,178
about the possibilities you'll have the

554
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:46,428
better eye for spotting problems before

555
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:48,528
they get out of control you'll also save

556
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:50,559
a ton of money by not buying unnecessary

557
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:52,608
equipment or products and making growers

558
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,200
this is just me and rejecting because

559
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,699
you when you go to the grocery put all

560
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,379
kinds of cool [ __ ] at the front of the

561
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,328
store it's just like when you go to any

562
00:19:57,378 --> 00:20:01,189
store those are impulse buys it's [ __ ]

563
00:19:59,328 --> 00:20:02,358
that you don't really need they just

564
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,869
want you to pick that up and spend a few

565
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:07,519
extra bucks sorry to bust out the grow

566
00:20:05,868 --> 00:20:10,608
shops like that's that's their job you

567
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,778
need to take your buck so make sure you

568
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:13,489
need something before you buy it just

569
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:15,409
because it's shiny or flashy or has a

570
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:17,808
new bite on it don't don't buy that just

571
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:19,579
Google so save your money a good book

572
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:21,108
will be the best 20 bucks you could

573
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:23,028
spend on your garden but it will only be

574
00:20:21,108 --> 00:20:24,828
usable if you take your time to read it

575
00:20:23,028 --> 00:20:27,618
don't be afraid to make notes in your

576
00:20:24,828 --> 00:20:28,788
books you should see some of my favorite

577
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:30,168
girl books they look like they're beat

578
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:35,739
to [ __ ] they've been through battles

579
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:35,739
their book markers in them there's

580
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:40,368
that's my best advice for any grower

581
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:42,858
there are people on the internet who

582
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:44,358
love to give new growers advice but how

583
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:46,189
do you know that they have any real

584
00:20:44,358 --> 00:20:47,868
education or experience I've seen tons

585
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:49,910
of bad advice online don't let a

586
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:51,559
stranger ruin your crop

587
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,150
the first step is to learn about your

588
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:54,529
plants and patients before you build the

589
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:57,500
grow room once you understand what

590
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:58,639
you're getting into some type of let's

591
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,230
see once you understand what you're

592
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,310
getting into set some type of goals for

593
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:05,599
your grow how many people are you supply

594
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:07,879
how much do you smoke every three months

595
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,159
how do you produce enough herb to supply

596
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,290
those people and cover your costs and

597
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,930
how can you do this all discreetly and a

598
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:16,220
safe you have to buy everything

599
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:17,990
somewhere and you have to get it all

600
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,430
into your house without neighbors

601
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:22,220
singing your new lights in your new soup

602
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:25,250
co2 set up have fun sneaking that hydro

603
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:27,019
table into your house after your crop is

604
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:28,490
complete you'll have a bunch of soil and

605
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:30,139
or sticks to get rid of if you're

606
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:31,759
running hydrate you don't have as much

607
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,920
soil to get rid of but if you're running

608
00:21:31,759 --> 00:21:36,170
soil crops or soilless medium there's a

609
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:38,390
lot of [ __ ] to get rid of where's all

610
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:41,029
that stuff gonna go are you gonna put it

611
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:42,590
out your trash by the curb will you have

612
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:44,240
enough you'll have enough to think about

613
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:46,189
while your grows happen a little reading

614
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,109
of preparation before you start will

615
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,330
make your grow much more enjoyable and

616
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:52,750
much more relaxing experience grow from

617
00:21:50,329 --> 00:21:56,240
your heart and the plants will reflect

618
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:57,710
so get prepared if you're gonna grow

619
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,680
some weed my first piece of advice to

620
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:01,970
everybody get prepared understand what

621
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:03,110
you're getting into because a lot of

622
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,640
people think they're gonna start this

623
00:22:03,109 --> 00:22:06,829
little closet grow they got their seeds

624
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,000
going and they're living week to week

625
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:10,099
with their grow which is almost

626
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,390
disrespectful and embarrassing to your

627
00:22:10,099 --> 00:22:13,549
plants you're not gonna grow good weed

628
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:14,990
like that you gotta be I try to be good

629
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:16,639
for weeks ahead of myself which

630
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:19,009
sometimes I do get ahead of myself

631
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,590
literally but I tried I trying to have a

632
00:22:19,009 --> 00:22:23,509
plan I know when this clone is being cut

633
00:22:21,589 --> 00:22:26,419
I know when it's gonna flowers generally

634
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:27,890
I have a good idea so have a good idea

635
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,230
of what you're trying to do have the

636
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:32,240
equipment in advance have the nutrients

637
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:33,319
in advance because things sneak up on

638
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
you and they're drawn weed you get

639
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:36,259
distracted by life you have to be kind

640
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,600
of secretive about your grow in some

641
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:40,160
cases so you can't always do things at

642
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:41,779
the ideal times it's easier to try to

643
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,050
get to things a little sooner than later

644
00:22:41,779 --> 00:22:45,980
so your crop is at stake here I love

645
00:22:45,049 --> 00:22:48,019

646
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,819

00:22:57,950 --> 00:23:01,340
so before you're drilling it your seeds

653
00:22:59,839 --> 00:23:03,199

654
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:04,609
with them at a few days and a few weeks

655
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,580
and all the way through flower and cure

656
00:23:04,609 --> 00:23:09,469
don't skip any steps don't think about

657
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:11,000
harvesting and selling that crop don't

658
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:14,990
even think about that yet cuz you gotta

659
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,369
think about getting it going before you

660
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,710
dream innate your seeds I totally

661
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:20,418
recommend you have cups or pots for baby

662
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,980
plants to live in for about two weeks to

663
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:24,320
a month or maybe even to finish it

664
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:25,819
you're gonna need some soil today I

665
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,888
actually went bought some light warrior

666
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:30,259
soil I like light warrior and happy

667
00:23:27,888 --> 00:23:32,000
frogs my babies you'll need basic

668
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:33,879
nutrients and some maybe some rude

669
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,159
inoculants in about a week or two

670
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,840
another good piece of advice is to try

671
00:23:37,159 --> 00:23:41,210
to use good seeds if you can back seat

672
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:43,668
is fine I mean chem dog was bagged seed

673
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:45,440
you know but it's less reliable and less

674
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:47,778
predictable so try to use seeds from a

675
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,700
reliable breeder if possible I know and

676
00:23:47,778 --> 00:23:51,349
what you're growing with will make your

677
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,819
job much easier in the long run if you

678
00:23:51,349 --> 00:23:54,888
need seeds check out nature's green

679
00:23:52,819 --> 00:23:56,058

States so you don't have to worry about

681
00:23:56,058 --> 00:24:00,168
customs taking your seeds or are you

682
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:02,388
getting a yellow package with green tape

683
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:04,278
across the front of it and matrix green

684
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:06,229

685
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:09,619
package will arrive in just a few short

686
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:13,099
days to driven eight you're gonna need

687
00:24:09,619 --> 00:24:15,319
some paper towels a marker a plate some

688
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:16,939
water plain tap water is cool the

689
00:24:15,319 --> 00:24:19,339
bottled water is better in my opinion

690
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,750
you'll be just fine with either do you

691
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:23,399
want the water room temp so

692
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,400
grab all the things you need and will

693
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,540
germinate some seats together I'm

694
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,580
actually gonna trim innate some seeds

695
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:32,250
while we're on the show right now I'm

696
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:34,679
gonna start three seeds with you guys

697
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:36,720
right now I'm actually gonna start these

698
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,370
are something I just bred I haven't

699
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,579
germinated any of these nobody's seen

700
00:24:38,369 --> 00:24:43,799
these before these are actually called

701
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:46,169
its grateful DAW it's blue dream a blue

702
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:48,629
dream here's a quick tip when you're

703
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:50,279
listening genetics put the female first

704
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:52,620
like ladies first try to remember that

705
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,480
so if you're crossing strains the girl

706
00:24:52,619 --> 00:24:56,039
strain goes first the male stream comes

707
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,569
after that so ladies first all the time

708
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:00,109
when you listen etics that just calm to

709
00:24:57,569 --> 00:25:02,909
practice standard so this is blue dream

710
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:04,619
prostitute the grateful dog it's a

711
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:06,779
feminized seed I reversed the grateful

712
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:08,909
dog who's that reversed pollen do that

713
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:10,319
on the blue tree and I've created a

714
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:13,050
strain that I would like to call blue

715
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,009
heeler if it proves successful so I'm

716
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:15,839
gonna germinate some of these right now

717
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:16,769
we're gonna do two to three of them I

718
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:18,119
don't have room for a lot of extra

719
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:19,349
clients right now this is kind of an

720
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:22,649
experiment I just want to see how these

721
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:24,059
go so my first step I say do you need a

722
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:26,430
paper towel right I'm gonna fold the

723
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:29,730
paper towel into a small square I'm

724
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,470
gonna fold it one two three four times

725
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:33,299
I've got like a little a couple inch by

726
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,620
couple inch here [ __ ] the square now

727
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,200
it's nice and compact it's nice and

728
00:25:34,619 --> 00:25:42,739
thick so it's in a whole bunch of water

729
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,740
label it blue heeler

730
00:25:43,269 --> 00:25:49,129
[Music]

731
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:50,419
blue heeler all right now I'm gonna

732
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,589
throw that on a plate

733
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,589
[Music]

734
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:04,839
[Music]

735
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:12,989
[Music]

736
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:20,000
fold it up labels I'm gonna go ahead and

737
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:29,640
soak put the paper on the plate and just

738
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:32,049
soak the [ __ ] out of it you want it's

739
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,460
[Music]

740
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:35,960
actually got some seeds on the plate

741
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,610
that I did earlier some paper towels

742
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,930
folded up there labeled that I did a

743
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:42,319
little bit ago so I'm starting some new

744
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,700
stuff gonna kind of recreate something

745
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,789
that I did a long time ago and got known

746
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:48,680
for quit making it cause it was not

747
00:26:46,789 --> 00:26:49,639
exciting to me anymore but it's time to

748
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,250
bring it back anyway

749
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:53,450
ah now this plate has too much water on

750
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,619
it I can tell that there's standing

751
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:55,819
water on this plate I could see it

752
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:59,119
sitting here I don't want that there so

753
00:26:55,819 --> 00:27:00,379
I'm actually gonna tip it off so hang on

754
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,169
for one second while I run to the sink

755
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,590
hold on here I go and aback wasn't that

756
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,630
fast

757
00:27:03,589 --> 00:27:07,609
I love that it ain't cool after two

758
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,950
paper towels nice and soggy and excess

759
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:11,179
water is gone unfold it two times I know

760
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:12,410
that sounds weird we just folded it up

761
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,970
right but I want to get these seeds down

762
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:15,470
in there in the middle so I just

763
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:23,000
unfolded it now I'm gonna drop the seeds

764
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:24,259
in got one get - we got this is exciting

765
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,990
for me because I get to see what happens

766
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:29,259
with some [ __ ] that I just created fold

767
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,259
it back up

768
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:32,490
yeah just fold it back up so you got

769
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,230
it's all soaked you just put them in the

770
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:35,339
middle there

771
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:36,809
now you want the paper towel to stay wet

772
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:39,119
make sure it's damp and cold your hand

773
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:41,519
at all times if that paper towels dries

774
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,699
out your seeds will perish and you'll be

775
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:47,069
shopping for seats soon so keep them

776
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,569
damp but not soggy from here out I set a

777
00:27:47,069 --> 00:27:51,359
timer to remind myself to check on on

778
00:27:48,569 --> 00:27:52,889
every like four to six hours pour a

779
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,229
splash of water on him whatever the

780
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,030
paper towel seems to be getting dry the

781
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,819
time between watering is gonna depend on

782
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:01,109
your environment I actually traded I

783
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:02,759
moved them from one room to the other

784
00:28:01,109 --> 00:28:04,500
today to have them sitting next to me

785
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,809
during the podcast and recording and the

786
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:08,339
ones I started earlier they dried up

787
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,779
because I have a swamp cooler right

788
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:11,009
above where I'm sitting and I kind of

789
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,970
dried them out quite quickly when they

790
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:15,000
were in another room

791
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:16,920
they stayed wet for most of the day so

792
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,259
that'll make a huge difference depending

793
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:21,269
on where you are make sure you check

794
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:23,430
them often if you need to be gone for an

795
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:25,319
extended amount of time something that I

796
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,150
recommend you can do is put the paper

797
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,369
towel that you've got into a ziplock

798
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:31,769
baggie and seal it to keep the moisture

799
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:35,279
in I don't do this because I like to let

800
00:28:31,769 --> 00:28:37,349
my seedlings get a little more air but

801
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,720
it helps if you're forgetful if you're a

802
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:41,879
pocket-like a lot of us are so I'm like

803
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,110
24 to 48 hours hopefully you've got some

804
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,660
seedlings that have little sprouted

805
00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:47,699
tails the tail is called the tap roof

806
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,930
that's super sensitive that's that's

807
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,940
really important to your plant right now

808
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:52,049
keep that thing in tact be careful with

809
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,660
the tap root while you're handling it

810
00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:55,859
while you're planting your seedlings

811
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,779
that tap root is gonna be the source of

812
00:28:55,859 --> 00:29:00,119
life that suckers gonna dig all the way

813
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,529
down to the bottom of your pot it's

814
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,669
gonna start spiraling out that's what's

815
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:04,730
gonna make your client flourish

816
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:07,350
hopefully if you do things right so

817
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,610
you've got a little tiny seedling that's

818
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:09,839
sitting in a paper towel after a couple

819
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:12,119
days right now you got to get it into

820
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,859
some soil hopefully you've got some cups

821
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,069
or whatever kind of pots you're gonna

822
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:18,629
put it in on it's ready so get your soil

823
00:29:17,069 --> 00:29:21,210
pack it into the container that you're

824
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:22,290
gonna use the cup or whatever did it

825
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,120
lightly pack do you want it in there

826
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,920
kind of firm but not like hard you want

827
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,119
those roots to be able to grow but you

828
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,230
also want them do a little bit of work

829
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:30,629
you don't want them to just be able to

830
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:32,730
push through kind of make your plants

831
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:34,650
tough at this point and also if you're

832
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:36,089
using cups make sure you have plenty of

833
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:38,060
drainage holes in there and make sure

834
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:40,759
that the pots are using or

835
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:42,889
these clay pots use use plastic pots or

836
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,930
earth pots or air pots or root pots

837
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:47,120
something cool like that there are

838
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,610
couple of reasons for that so you've got

839
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,239
these seedlings they got your cup full

840
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:51,740
of dirt

841
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,349
or your container full of dirt I

842
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,109
recommend to water the containers with

843
00:29:54,349 --> 00:29:58,279
pH balanced water and if you're gonna

844
00:29:56,109 --> 00:29:59,899
don't use nutrients at this time wait

845
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,819
wait T wait till a little bit later to

846
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,100
use nutrients so get your pot filled

847
00:30:01,819 --> 00:30:05,720
with soil and water it you're gonna see

848
00:30:04,099 --> 00:30:07,490
the pot kind of the dirt is gonna kind

849
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,600
of cave in cuz you've left air spots in

850
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:10,220
there that's just out dirt works when

851
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,480
you water it the first time maybe have

852
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:13,730
to go back and sprinkle a couple more

853
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,200
handfuls of dirt in there if it's a

854
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,960
larger pot if it's a cup you just need a

855
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,890
little bit more ice cream cone

856
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,750
butt-fuckin so make sure the dirts right

857
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:26,330
before you put the seed in there what I

858
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:29,029
do is I just push my finger in up to

859
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:30,889
about the first knuckle into the dirt or

860
00:30:29,029 --> 00:30:33,289
down I guess into the end of the dirt to

861
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:34,640
my first knuckle and just make a little

862
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:36,109
addition with my finger and then I just

863
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,610
set the seed right inside there and I

864
00:30:36,109 --> 00:30:40,129
don't even bury really I just kind of

865
00:30:37,609 --> 00:30:42,409
backfill the dirt real gently just kind

866
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,970
of push it on top of there just where

867
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,230
it's covered up from the light and give

868
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,569
it a little bit of a challenge to push

869
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:49,220
through to the top and it grows more

870
00:30:47,569 --> 00:30:51,319
quickly down than it does up so it'll

871
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,000
push its way through really quickly when

872
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,399
it does hopefully it's got a nice rooted

873
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,109
bottom to it so now you've got your

874
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,840
little see links they've sprouted and

875
00:30:57,109 --> 00:31:01,099
about 24 to 48 little while long if they

876
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:02,689
don't if they take a little longer don't

877
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:04,969
worry just let them go keep them Wyatt

878
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:06,920
let them keep going I've seen seeds take

879
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:08,750
up to four or five days to pop sometimes

880
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:11,000
older seeds need more love or whatever

881
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:12,349
but give them time so you've got your

882
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,089
seedlings they've got a little sprout

883
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:15,949
you sold your couplets or your container

884
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:17,389
with water pearl with the dirt sorry

885
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,950
filled your container with dirt you

886
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:20,540
pressed it down a little bit you watered

887
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,100
it made an addition with your finger or

888
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:24,740
drop your seed in there and you covered

889
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:28,129
it up now set that sucker under your

890
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,900
grow light t5 light works perfect right

891
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:32,240
now fluorescent at t5 you don't need a

892
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:34,519
big 400 water a thousand watt light

893
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,878

898

00:33:09,318 --> 00:33:13,739
awesome you guys might not know who

939
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:17,038
Lester Grinspoon is dr. Grinspoon was

940
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:17,909
born June 24th 1928 in Newton

941
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:19,888
Massachusetts

942
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:23,669
he graduated from Tufts University and

943
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:25,918
Harvard medicine medical school as a

944
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:28,979
doctor Grinspoon was the first American

945
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,199
physician to prescribe lithium carbonate

946
00:33:28,979 --> 00:33:32,848
for bipolar disorder I know that sounds

947
00:33:31,199 --> 00:33:35,459
crazy right but anyway here's the good

948
00:33:32,848 --> 00:33:37,648
part dr. dr. Grinspoon became interested

949
00:33:35,459 --> 00:33:38,969
in marijuana in the 1960s when its use

950
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,628
in the United States increased

951
00:33:38,969 --> 00:33:41,289
dramatically

952
00:33:39,628 --> 00:33:44,019
he had no

953
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:47,079
out it was a very harmful drug that was

954
00:33:44,019 --> 00:33:49,299
unfortunately being used by more foolish

955
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:51,220
young people who would not listen to or

956
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:52,629
could not believe or understand the

957
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,940
warnings about its dangers

958
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:58,150
when Grinspoon began studying marijuana

959
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:00,160
in 1967 his intention was to define

960
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:02,560
scientifically the nature and degree of

961
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,820
those dangers but as he reviewed the

962
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,700
existing literature on the subject

963
00:34:03,819 --> 00:34:08,168
Grinspoon reached the conclusion he and

964
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,869
the general public had been misinformed

965
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:12,699
and misled so originally when Grinspoon

966
00:34:10,869 --> 00:34:15,279
started out studying cannabis he wanted

967
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:17,439
to prove that it was making people crazy

968
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,860
and it was all a problem but the more

969
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,480
research dr. Grinspoon did the more he

970
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:28,599
realized that we were being lied to and

971
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:30,519
misled dr. Grinspoon once said there was

972
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:32,230
little empirical evidence to support my

973
00:34:30,519 --> 00:34:34,300
beliefs about the dangers of marijuana

974
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:36,340
and he was convinced cannabis was much

975
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,470
less harmful than he had believed the

976
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:43,570
title marijuana reconsidered reflected

977
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:45,250
change in that view Grinspoon is widely

978
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:47,140
known as the author or co-author of

979
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:49,320
several cannabis psychedelic related

980
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,119
books including marijuana reconsidered

981
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,890
psychedelic drugs reconsidered marijuana

982
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:55,929
the forbidden medicine and psychedelic

983

cannabis supporter in your and your day

1023
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:22,480
you were brainwashed to think that this

1024
00:36:19,088 --> 00:36:25,509
plant was dangerous and you did your own

1025
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:26,409
research and you had enough balls to

1026
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,910
come out and say you know what I was

1027
00:36:26,409 --> 00:36:29,348
wrong and this plant is actually

1028
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:31,118

take care of pops for us also so Jesse's

1144
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:16,369
here we'll get right down to it last

1145
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:18,259
time jesse was here we talked about

1146
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:20,449
pretty much prepping for outdoor season

1147
00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,310
talked about security we talked about

1148
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:24,889
soil prep we talked about caging and

1149
00:41:22,309 --> 00:41:26,929
pruning we touched on strange selections

1150
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:28,819
we got our plants in the ground

1151
00:41:26,929 --> 00:41:30,019
we had them top several times so by now

1152
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,830
we should have some happy little bushes

1153
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:36,170
that are adjusted to being outside right

1154
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:53,929
cool one thing we skipped though is

1155
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:55,820
hardening off the plants well you should

1156
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:57,319
have done you should put your plan out

1157
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:59,210
for a couple hours one day it brought it

1158
00:41:57,320 --> 00:42:01,670
inside and then maybe a few more hours

1159
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:02,990
the next day and brought it inside you

1160
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,490
didn't want to throw that poor bastard

1161
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:06,129
he'll look cool they just [ __ ] tell

1162
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:08,959
it to live and wish it good luck

1163
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,250
hopefully you caught on and hopefully if

1164
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,170
it's out there already and it's just

1165
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,260
stuck hopefully it's strong

1166
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,260
[Music]

1167
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:20,559
if it lifts through the hill that we got

1168
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:21,909
tonight in Pueblo you've got a good plan

1169
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,710
be prepared for that well it's a good

1170
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:28,449
way to prevent that plant from getting

1171
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:32,250
beat to [ __ ] by some hail so you mean

1172
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:32,250
like maybe a trashcan or something oh

1173
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:40,980
[Music]

1174
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:43,510
yeah I just throw a tarp right over oh

1175
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:47,880
well it's kind of built like some kind

1176
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:50,470
of framing okay maybe some PVC hoops

1177
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,410
you know fence defense or something like

1178
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:56,139
that some tent stakes you know get

1179
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:58,569
creative most owners are yeah we're

1180
00:42:56,139 --> 00:43:00,159
creating a creative fun all right

1181
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:01,180
however those babies oh yeah that's

1182
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:03,460
stuff that you guys gonna have to think

1183
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,659
about so if you got it covered if you

1184
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:06,929
want to put a heater in there later on

1185
00:43:04,659 --> 00:43:10,859
in the season is that gonna be wise I

1186
00:43:06,929 --> 00:43:14,339
personally utilize the system like that

1187
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:17,590
so I can wrap my area and plastic and

1188
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:21,070
keep my plants going I've had a minute

1189
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:22,870
of November that's crazy

1190
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,910
I don't usually a Halloween is your

1191
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:27,039
cutoff time for what most people said

1192
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:31,119
yeah humidity build up so you gotta have

1193
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:33,730
a vent you know some fans some fans to

1194
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,579
the humidity view not being stagnant one

1195
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,389
spot oh yeah all right it'll create all

1196
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:40,599
kinds of problems

1197
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:42,489
normally how do we run any risk what if

1198
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:44,650
we did not have that ten thing going on

1199
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:46,269
the cover would we run any risk of

1200
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:47,480
humidity problems of mold or anything

1201
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:48,639
like that outdoors

1202
00:43:47,480 --> 00:44:39,619
[Music]

1203
00:43:48,639 --> 00:44:42,409
you know they've been a little bit

1204
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:44,449
longer to switch from the vegetative

1205
00:44:42,409 --> 00:44:47,239
phase into flower I know the indoors I

1206
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:49,339
see signs in like 10 days maybe 14 days

1207
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:51,619
on a longer switching strain yeah you're

1208
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:56,690
gonna have you know what I refer to as a

1209
00:44:51,619 --> 00:44:59,630
stress period and just a little

1210
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:02,599
different period that you don't have

1211
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:04,820
indoors and they're not gonna barely be

1212
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:07,940
developing flowers they're just still

1213
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:10,519
bolt all of a sudden it kind of and

1214
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:14,929
you're like wow what's going on and yeah

1215
00:45:10,519 --> 00:45:16,789
it's quite different in indoors so

1216
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:19,339
inside your plants usually kind of

1217
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:21,349
double in size outside I think in the

1218
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,920
triple do you think yeah maybe even more

1219
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:26,440
maybe even more this

1220
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,358
I say you get those you know if you

1221
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,088
didn't top the plant the things gonna

1222
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:33,130
get gigantic it's like if it's like a

1223
00:45:31,088 --> 00:45:35,440
seed plant that used to call you stop

1224
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,880
yeah so if I've got my plants outside my

1225
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:38,139
fence is like six or eight feet tall I

1226
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,059
better just keep them short before

1227
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:41,348
flower time comes right for sure all

1228
00:45:40,059 --> 00:45:42,790
right all right so that's where we got

1229
00:45:41,349 --> 00:45:45,519
to learn about trellising and [ __ ] so

1230
00:45:42,789 --> 00:45:46,659
gonna some outside plants they're happy

1231
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,369
they're having a good time

1232
00:45:46,659 --> 00:45:49,480
how are we gonna keep them from getting

1233
00:45:48,369 --> 00:45:51,250
too tall we talked about a little bit

1234
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,358
last time those buds are gonna get big

1235
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,829
and floppy pretty soon they're gonna

1236
00:45:52,358 --> 00:45:55,000
start taking are not the buds but the

1237
00:45:53,829 --> 00:45:56,920
branches are gonna get big and floppy

1238
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,829
yeah we want to use sticks just like I

1239
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:06,818
do inside stakes elastics tomato cages I

1240
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:10,660
think we touched on a tomato or a cage

1241
00:46:06,818 --> 00:46:14,529
built out okay my for fencing all right

1242
00:46:10,659 --> 00:46:17,558
netting like the end or netting even

1243
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:19,599
like a screen of green idea yeah or even

1244
00:46:17,559 --> 00:46:22,630
just throw it over the plant stake into

1245
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,329
the ground and you know pull the

1246
00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:26,858
branches down into the different little

1247
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:28,089
squares okay yeah

1248
00:46:26,858 --> 00:46:30,608
that's pretty smart I would not have

1249
00:46:28,088 --> 00:46:33,338
thought of that and then you know one

1250
00:46:30,608 --> 00:46:36,098
bud talk per square you're a beautiful

1251
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:37,449
little Christmas tree yeah people don't

1252
00:46:36,099 --> 00:46:39,548
think about trying to maximize their

1253
00:46:37,449 --> 00:46:41,199
space and they forget about that they

1254
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:43,809
want a big giant Cola yeah you want more

1255
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,460
more but for space alright so they're

1256
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:46,690
looking happy we've figured out how to

1257
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:51,190
keep them safe what are we gonna feed

1258
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:52,510
while we're outside if were you a lot of

1259
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:53,920
people are gonna just mix up some

1260
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:55,480
bottled crap and pour that rush the

1261
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,769
doors which sucks I would recommend

1262
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,969
don't do that to our earth don't do that

1263
00:46:56,769 --> 00:46:58,568
to your plants if you could avoid your

1264
00:46:57,969 --> 00:47:00,219
going outside

1265
00:46:58,568 --> 00:47:03,279
let's go natural let's stick with

1266
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:07,389
Jesse's ideas as close as we can with

1267
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,210
organics is easiest outside but you know

1268
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:11,500
the plan

1269
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:14,568
feeding off the soil that you build up

1270
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:32,059
to supplement and help keep the soil

1271
00:47:14,568 --> 00:47:40,369
healthy teeth with different cuantos I

1272
00:47:32,059 --> 00:47:41,900
kind of to my qua nose to what that's

1273
00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:43,608
what I would probably go for I've

1274
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,200
noticed a lot of the sea bird stuff is

1275
00:47:43,608 --> 00:48:05,900
really beneficial any kind of see

1276
00:47:45,199 --> 00:48:07,549
products perfect all right so uh compost

1277
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,289
tea do you how do you make your compost

1278
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:10,789
tea you got some molasses you said

1279
00:48:09,289 --> 00:48:12,769
you've got the worm castings you got

1280
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:14,150
your guano whatever else we're gonna add

1281
00:48:12,769 --> 00:48:16,849
in there just for fun that's when you

1282
00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:23,869
guys gotta get creative on your own how

1283
00:48:16,849 --> 00:48:27,920
do you need air stones a little aquarium

1284
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:30,980
air pump four gallons or dechlorinated

1285
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,568
water or reverse osmosis water let's

1286
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,929
talk about the later shoe write that

1287
00:48:32,568 --> 00:48:36,829
down

1288
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:38,960
borrow water yeah something I'll cover

1289
00:48:36,829 --> 00:48:44,200
for the guys later

1290
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:46,960
so fall asleep bro you're right

1291
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:49,759
[Music]

1292
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,829
you can mix them up in a pantyhose all

1293
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,559
you different ingredients like your dry

1294
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:57,400
ingredients you could just put them

1295
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,990
right in the bucket I've seen both ways

1296
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,130
it works either way okay so something

1297
00:48:59,989 --> 00:49:02,989
like a tea bag out of the pantyhose

1298
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,190
pretty much or just drop it right in

1299
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:06,078
there just let it stir around I

1300
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:08,809
personally just drop it right in there

1301
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,750
let it mingle my book it's normally I

1302
00:49:08,809 --> 00:49:13,040
have a lot of hair full of stuff stirs

1303
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:15,710
around pretty good you get it nice and

1304
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:17,509
frothy yes - are you gonna dilute that

1305
00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:20,809
five-gallon bucket into a larger portion

1306
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:24,619
or just use that that kind of depends on

1307
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:28,490
your recipe okay I I use it diluted

1308
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:33,019
actually I use like 25 30 gallons and do

1309
00:49:28,489 --> 00:49:37,308
the 10 different sized operation right

1310
00:49:33,019 --> 00:49:40,880
yeah yeah I know where you guys work the

1311
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:42,590
boss over there what up hanky so you got

1312
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:46,660
your tea how often do you feed the teas

1313
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:49,579
[Music]

1314
00:49:46,659 --> 00:49:52,308
like I said tie to tune the ingredients

1315
00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:55,309
to the growth period the things that

1316
00:49:52,309 --> 00:49:57,980
always remain constant is a product

1317
00:49:55,309 --> 00:50:02,000
called great white worm castings

1318
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:04,309
molasses and I make my own compost - so

1319
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,260
are we still got that in there - Colts

1320
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:11,030
are using food and stuff for your

1321
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:12,770
compost or yeah their scraps awesome way

1322
00:50:11,030 --> 00:50:14,329
to recycle everybody should start a

1323
00:50:12,769 --> 00:50:16,940
compost pile you can do it in a very

1324
00:50:14,329 --> 00:50:18,530
little space it's very beneficial for

1325
00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:19,639
your plants it's beneficial for the

1326
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:21,079
earth you'll learn a lot

1327
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:22,489
you'll start to change better care of

1328
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:25,280
your body once you start seeing okay

1329
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:28,608
cycle of the plan everything I think so

1330
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,109
I did so do you use your chickens yeah

1331
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:34,650
yeah I have chicken stew

1332
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:39,150
I just they're escaping say get settle a

1333
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:42,630
non-gmo food and some stuff growing on

1334
00:50:39,150 --> 00:50:45,239
my family farm vegetable scraps some

1335
00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:47,548
types as well as when I clean your

1336
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:51,559
little yard all that stuff goes into the

1337
00:50:47,548 --> 00:50:54,809
bottle their eggshells to their feathers

1338
00:50:51,559 --> 00:50:57,209
defenders does that mean God does it the

1339
00:50:54,809 --> 00:51:01,859
chicken stuff make the soil real hot yes

1340
00:50:57,208 --> 00:51:04,679
yeah chicken compost I cook it twice as

1341
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:06,929
long it's just regular vegetable compost

1342
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:08,608
okay all right that makes good sense

1343
00:51:06,929 --> 00:51:10,259
that's gonna advance stuff you guys

1344
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:11,248
don't don't don't worry if you're not

1345
00:51:10,259 --> 00:51:14,338
caught up on that will talk about

1346
00:51:11,248 --> 00:51:20,009
composting way later way later in more

1347
00:51:14,338 --> 00:51:21,358
episodes it's easy though once we've got

1348
00:51:20,009 --> 00:51:23,458
you growing wolf we'll talk you through

1349
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:25,048
that we mentioned some of the dry

1350
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:29,038
fertilizers that they offer and top

1351
00:51:25,048 --> 00:51:31,788
feeding top feeding I personally use

1352
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:35,009
like your ingredients bone meal but now

1353
00:51:31,789 --> 00:51:39,809
the different cuantos again compost all

1354
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:41,179
kind of repetitive fish meal there's

1355
00:51:39,809 --> 00:51:44,339
another thing I chopped for you - this

1356
00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:46,699
fish bone meal actually yeah what isn't

1357
00:51:44,338 --> 00:51:51,809
flowering

1358
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:53,639
and just various amounts I tend to so

1359
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:55,259
you mixing that up in water almost like

1360
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:57,210
your tea or you pow sprinkling that

1361
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,160
right onto the top um I suppose you

1362
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:02,639
could do it both ways but I dig it into

1363
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:08,190
the top first a little bit yeah just use

1364
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:10,049
my fingers and sometimes like the ref

1365
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:13,849
talks about doing spikes I was gonna

1366
00:52:10,050 --> 00:52:13,850
recommend his buddy be into all this yes

1367
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,789
shout out to the referee true living

1368
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:22,320
organics but you have to be you know

1369
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:25,230
doing the spikes where you dig a little

1370
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:28,019
hole next to the plant basically and you

1371
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:30,030
can drop the stuff down there and order

1372
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:33,449
your ingredients down in there fill it

1373
00:52:30,030 --> 00:52:36,540
back up with dirt the theory is is that

1374
00:52:33,449 --> 00:52:39,389
I guess the bigger fruits get it okay

1375
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:40,800
yes the Nexus and then you water that in

1376
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:42,239
and they all kind of becomes part yeah

1377
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,550
okay it's all natural like there are

1378
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:47,729
doubts instead of for speeding it you're

1379
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:51,180
actually letting it okay now if that's

1380
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:52,500
you know a little scared of but you

1381
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:56,609
still feel like you're playing need some

1382
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:59,909
extra the dry fertilizer packs from a

1383
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:05,070
cage old nothing wrong with using those

1384
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:07,319
took us not my first choice but still

1385
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:09,360
better than bottle matrix as long as

1386
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,250
it's not anything from Scotts or a

1387
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,550
Miracle Grow for anything made by

1388

dispersal [ __ ] you want natural stuff

1392

just go to a hydroponics store not the

1393
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:27,230
hardware store not the garden center

1394
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,240
it's at the hydro shop or Mama's pops

1395
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:33,090
yeah we'll have it be careful have

1396
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,139
respect when you go in those places they

1397
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:35,460
know you're growing but you don't

1398
00:53:34,139 --> 00:53:36,659
already tell up don't just go in they

1399
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,889
already know don't feel the need to go

1400
00:53:36,659 --> 00:53:39,299
in there and tell them they'll kick you

1401
00:53:37,889 --> 00:53:41,699
I hope they kick you out

be discreet view Pro go in there buy

stuff for your tomato plants you don't

1404
00:53:44,099 --> 00:53:46,409
even have to talk about what you're

1405
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,940
growing you just need to talk about what

1406
00:53:46,409 --> 00:53:57,529
you need to buy a square that is where

1407

business order online don't go to the

good advice even in Colorado I don't I

1414
00:54:23,519 --> 00:54:27,570
try not to be parked outside of there

1415

too often because it's not just the not

just the law enforcement but people are

people are

just veg and chilling out yeah what do

we need to worry about next what's

was like what there's a little seed it's

either I don't know random s1 or testing

I would guess [ __ ] with your plants too

1434
00:56:27,389 --> 00:56:31,889
much but 14 to 10 days before a flower

00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:34,109
maybe outside you maybe we'll be able to

go about seven days you'll be able to

00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:44,690
about now but what's a finis yield oh

1441
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:47,210
yeah that's your last chance so you know

1442
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:49,490
pretty much you're done top and go ahead

1443
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:51,380
and get the super crop in there being

1444

space we're just talking super strapping

1445
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,769
yeah that's something I learned from

1446
00:56:52,579 --> 00:56:57,139
soba well not directly I rent from soma

1447
00:56:54,769 --> 00:57:00,019
I wish came to taught me that [ __ ]

1448
00:56:57,139 --> 00:57:01,489
super dropping you basically find a

1449
00:57:00,019 --> 00:57:03,650
branch you can tell it's gonna grow up

1450
00:57:01,489 --> 00:57:06,139
to high and just grab it and [ __ ]

1451
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:07,550
break it bend it over to the left and

1452
00:57:06,139 --> 00:57:09,319
it's gonna snap and it's gonna scare you

1453
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:11,960
but if it's a strong hardy plant within

1454
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:15,380
six hours that will start drawing right

1455
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,570
back up squeeze the area around just

1456
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:19,940
Bertie I'll break it off first of those

1457
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:22,130
walls if it's strong and healthy little

1458
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:23,720
crunches like like good celery

1459
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:26,539
yeah just like good celery that's a

1460
00:57:23,719 --> 00:57:28,969
description and it is safe too you know

1461
00:57:26,539 --> 00:57:37,099
yeah I mean you can just crank them over

1462
00:57:28,969 --> 00:57:38,539

boki cannabis was the only thing that

1526
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:26,410

any any state you live in people are

1532
01:00:35,139 --> 01:00:38,139
going to smoke it's just yeah this

1533
01:00:36,938 --> 01:00:40,298
culture yeah

1534
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:43,719
so you know when you're around people

1535

that are smoking illegal states you know

1536
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:48,849

safe place it's you know in trouble but

01:08:17,369 --> 01:08:21,988
1970 strop obtained his undergraduate

1674
01:08:20,548 --> 01:08:24,778
degree in political science from the

1675
01:08:21,988 --> 01:08:27,179
University of Illinois in 1965 and in

1676
01:08:24,779 --> 01:08:29,700
1968 he graduated from Georgetown Law

1677
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:31,289
School in Washington DC following two

1678
01:08:29,699 --> 01:08:33,599
years as staff counsel for the National

1679
01:08:31,289 --> 01:08:35,189
Commission on product safety mr. Straub

1680
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,079
founded normal and ran the organization

1681
01:08:35,189 --> 01:08:42,329
through 1979 during which 11 states

1682
01:08:39,079 --> 01:08:44,579
decriminalized minor marijuana offenses

1683
01:08:42,329 --> 01:08:46,890
I should take a second and explain to

1684
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:49,109
you what normal is normal stands for the

1685
01:08:46,890 --> 01:08:51,810
National Organization for the Reform of

1686
01:08:49,109 --> 01:08:54,390
Marijuana Laws that's right mister strop

1687
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:55,950
was the founder of this organization

1688
01:08:54,390 --> 01:08:57,630
which actually was the first group I

1689
01:08:55,949 --> 01:09:00,358
ever heard of as an activist group for

1690
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:02,909
cannabis back in High Times Magazine

1691
01:09:00,359 --> 01:09:05,009
many many years ago and I actually think

1692
01:09:02,909 --> 01:09:07,380
I saw Tommy Chong or somebody really

1693
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:10,319
famous warning a normal shirt and I was

1694
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:11,730
really proud to see that so Keith strop

1695
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,520
is the founder one of the guys that got

1696
01:09:11,729 --> 01:09:16,738
this huge movement sort of public and

1697
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:18,210
political so strop has also practice

1698
01:09:16,738 --> 01:09:20,548

1700

defense lawyers which is the NACDL which

1703
01:09:27,449 --> 01:09:31,920

1731
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:38,389
way for stoners he is paving the way he

1732

edibles here in Colorado and she ate him

her hotel room with a marijuana infused

edible

1844
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:20,810
she got no guidance from the bud tender

1845
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:22,699
on dosage and she wasn't familiar with

1846
01:16:20,810 --> 01:16:25,340
the state recommended 10 milligram dose

1847
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:27,859

read our useful edibles 101 8 tips for

01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:34,160
plugging his own stuff so instead she

1851
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,350
asked what could go wrong with the bite

1852
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:39,229
or two and then her trip turned into it

1853
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:42,230
dark downward spiral god have you ever

1854
01:16:39,229 --> 01:16:43,579
eaten too many edibles I have it's been

1855
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:46,609
a really long time since I've eaten too

1856
01:16:43,579 --> 01:16:47,510
many edibles but when I was younger once

1857
01:16:46,609 --> 01:16:51,049
I made some cookies

1858
01:16:47,510 --> 01:16:54,260
I actually made them and I threw two

1859
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:58,880
ounces of schwag weed in there and a

1860
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:59,750
brownie cookie mix for 24 cookies and I

1861
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,640
baked it

1862
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:03,979
I made butter out of it and then I baked

1863
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,930
it the butter was green and [ __ ] but I

1864
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:07,639
ate some of it my girlfriend ate some of

1865
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:09,800
it and uncle ate some of it and a friend

1866
01:17:07,640 --> 01:17:13,100
ate some of it and nobody went back for

1867
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:15,619
seconds those cookies [ __ ] us up I was

1868
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:16,789
high for two days that was supposed to

1869
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:18,710
go to dinner that night with somebody

1870
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:20,260
with some family so I went over there to

1871
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:22,270
dinner and I just sat with my head

1872
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:23,619
and when people would talk to me I've

1873
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:26,350
just looked at him like would you please

1874
01:17:23,619 --> 01:17:28,779
shut up cuz their voices it was annoying

1875
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:30,579
trying to keep up with them talking

1876
01:17:28,779 --> 01:17:33,429
I felt [ __ ] and couldn't do it I

1877
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:35,260
would just quit cuz I can't even nothing

1878
01:17:33,430 --> 01:17:37,539
they were saying was making any sense to

1879
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:38,710
me I felt like I was trapped in time or

1880
01:17:37,539 --> 01:17:39,760
something because they would talk and

1881
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:40,930
then by the time I'd figure out what

1882
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,079
they said they were about eight

1883
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:45,700
sentences ahead of themselves I was in a

1884
01:17:44,079 --> 01:17:47,289
bad bad bad way

1885
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:48,609
my girlfriend refused to come to dinner

1886
01:17:47,289 --> 01:17:50,800
with me that night because she was too

1887
01:17:48,609 --> 01:17:55,299
high she ate one of those cookies I ate

1888
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:57,039
two of them she ate one we came home and

1889
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:58,750
we found her well first of all she

1890
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,850
called me to ask if she could swallow

1891
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:03,819
the lining of her mouth which I think

1892
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:05,320
she meant her mouth I thought maybe her

1893
01:18:03,819 --> 01:18:07,090
tongue I don't know what she meant but

1894
01:18:05,319 --> 01:18:11,319
she was super high and we came home and

1895
01:18:07,090 --> 01:18:14,890
found her crawling up the stairs and my

1896
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:16,210
uncle he uh he was a 325 pound guy he

1897
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:20,590
had a couple of those cookies in his

1898
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:22,390
eyes or bread like brick-red for two

1899
01:18:20,590 --> 01:18:25,090
days straight he said he'd never wanted

1900
01:18:22,390 --> 01:18:27,250
to be that high again those cookies I

1901
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:28,150
don't know if it was the schwag weed I

1902
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:31,180
don't know if there was something else

1903
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:34,629
in there we were wrecked but it was it

1904
01:18:31,180 --> 01:18:36,909
was no fun to be that high this poor

1905
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:40,560
ladies never consumed cannabis as far as

1906
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:43,750
I know and she is laying in a hotel room

1907
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:46,180
having eaten way too much of a weed

1908
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:47,439
edible and she just flip it out so let's

1909
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:49,409
read a little bit more about what she

1910
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:51,669
says remember her last statement was

1911
01:18:49,409 --> 01:18:53,559
what could go wrong with a bite or two

1912
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:56,920
and then her trip turned into a dark

1913
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:58,480
downward spiral but then I thought a

1914
01:18:56,920 --> 01:19:00,609
scary shudder go through my body and

1915
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,019
brain I barely made it from the desk to

1916
01:19:00,609 --> 01:19:03,880
the bed where I lay curled up in a

1917
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:07,060
hallucinatory state for the next eight

1918
01:19:03,880 --> 01:19:09,010
hours I was thirsty but couldn't move to

1919
01:19:07,060 --> 01:19:10,960
get water or even turn off the lights

1920
01:19:09,010 --> 01:19:12,340
I was panting at paranoid sure that when

1921
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,409
root when the room service waiter

1922
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:15,970
knocked and I didn't answer he'd call

1923
01:19:14,409 --> 01:19:18,760
the police and have me arrested for

1924
01:19:15,970 --> 01:19:20,949
being unable to handle my candy so this

1925
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:22,090
lady's flipping out she's so thirsty she

1926
01:19:20,949 --> 01:19:24,909
can't reach for water

1927
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:26,949
she can't even turn off the lights she's

1928
01:19:24,909 --> 01:19:28,449
laying there panting at paranoid I've

1929
01:19:26,949 --> 01:19:29,429
been in a room with a girl who was this

1930
01:19:28,449 --> 01:19:31,229
high

1931
01:19:29,430 --> 01:19:33,110
and God it was hard to calm her down and

1932
01:19:31,229 --> 01:19:35,609
she just wanted to do all the wrong [ __ ]

1933
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:37,139
she wanted to go out in public she

1934
01:19:35,609 --> 01:19:38,729
wanted to call people and I was like no

1935
01:19:37,140 --> 01:19:39,780
you just gotta be high right here just

1936
01:19:38,729 --> 01:19:41,369
keep this high and you're in a little

1937
01:19:39,779 --> 01:19:44,069
bubble don't [ __ ] up the rest of your

1938
01:19:41,369 --> 01:19:45,390
life just keep it contained sometimes

1939
01:19:44,069 --> 01:19:49,019
it's a struggle to keep those kind of

1940
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:50,579
folks in the right state of mind so if

1941
01:19:49,020 --> 01:19:52,380
the lady says I strained to remember

1942
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:54,479
where I was or even what I was wearing

1943
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:56,970
touching my green corduroy jeans and

1944
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:59,129
staring at the exposed brick wall is my

1945
01:19:56,970 --> 01:20:00,990
paranoia deepened I became convinced

1946
01:19:59,130 --> 01:20:03,210
that I had died and no one was telling

1947
01:20:00,989 --> 01:20:04,439
me so she said she was straining to

1948
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:06,060
remember where she wasn't what she was

1949
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:08,939
wearing but she vividly seems to

1950
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:11,070
remember touching green corduroy jeans

1951
01:20:08,939 --> 01:20:12,449
and a brick wall see she never would

1952
01:20:11,069 --> 01:20:14,099
have noticed that stuff if she hadn't

1953
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:17,399
gotten all [ __ ] up she was introduced

1954
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:20,010
to some new things in life poor lady she

1955
01:20:17,399 --> 01:20:22,829
is paranoid and freaking out she thought

1956
01:20:20,010 --> 01:20:24,720
she was convinced that she had died and

1957
01:20:22,829 --> 01:20:26,130
nobody was telling her just imagine

1958
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:29,220
sitting there in a hotel room by herself

1959
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:30,779
thinking you're dead just thinking that

1960
01:20:29,220 --> 01:20:32,220
you're dead and what do you do he's

1961
01:20:30,779 --> 01:20:34,920
gonna wait for housekeeping to come find

1962
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:36,840
you dead and lay there it had to be the

1963
01:20:34,920 --> 01:20:38,310
worst [ __ ] eight hours of her life so

1964
01:20:36,840 --> 01:20:40,260
it says this is hardly the first

1965
01:20:38,310 --> 01:20:42,690
newspaper columnist to eat too many

1966
01:20:40,260 --> 01:20:44,640
edibles and land in a dark place at

1967
01:20:42,689 --> 01:20:46,379
least dad didn't up in the didn't end up

1968
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:47,970
in the hospital after a weird trip like

1969
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:49,770
Pittsburgh post-gazette columnist

1970
01:20:47,970 --> 01:20:51,300
McKenzie carpenter I might read that

1971
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:52,980
article next we'll open that up in

1972
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,630
another tab we'll see what happened to

1973
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:56,939
her let's get through it and see if it's

1974
01:20:54,630 --> 01:20:59,640
worth reading I'll keep going on this

1975
01:20:56,939 --> 01:21:01,439
one dad goes on and her piece referenced

1976
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:03,810
the two deaths Denver police are linking

1977
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:04,949
two edible marijuana a college student

1978
01:21:03,810 --> 01:21:06,900
who jumped to his death and the

1979
01:21:04,949 --> 01:21:08,309
observatory park man who hallucinate it

1980
01:21:06,899 --> 01:21:10,829
an allegedly shot and killed his wife

1981
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:13,770
and you're gonna say why didn't you talk

1982
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:15,899
about those I didn't want to give more

1983
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:18,000
height to the people that they're trying

1984
01:21:15,899 --> 01:21:19,739
to link these deaths to cannabis I

1985
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,359
didn't want to push that story even more

1986
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:23,550
I thought it was getting enough press I

1987
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:25,500
chose to ignore that I apologize if you

1988
01:21:23,550 --> 01:21:27,659
feel left out that was my responsibility

1989
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,520
uh I thought it was my responsibility to

1990
01:21:27,659 --> 01:21:31,409
keep my mouth shut on that one but it's

1991
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,119
related so we're talking to it or about

1992
01:21:31,409 --> 01:21:34,309
it

1993
01:21:32,118 --> 01:21:37,488
so she addresses issues of edible

1994
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:40,449
packaging presentation and potency and

1995
01:21:37,488 --> 01:21:43,189
she asks Incredibles co-owner bob is

1996
01:21:40,448 --> 01:21:44,928
paranoid the Downs most pressing

1997
01:21:43,189 --> 01:21:47,059
observation is the column in the column

1998
01:21:44,929 --> 01:21:50,750
was a plea for more regulations and

1999
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:52,849
warnings to the casual user I reckoned

2000
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:54,889
that the fact I was not a regular

2001
01:21:52,849 --> 01:21:56,569
marijuana smoker made me more vulnerable

2002
01:21:54,889 --> 01:21:58,909
and then I should have known better but

2003
01:21:56,569 --> 01:22:00,079
it turns out five months in some kinks

2004
01:21:58,908 --> 01:22:01,969
need to be ironed out with the

2005
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:06,559
intoxicating open bar at the mile-high

2006
01:22:01,969 --> 01:22:08,689
club so there's a lot of stuff going on

2007
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:10,280
people are coming here and doing stuff

2008
01:22:08,689 --> 01:22:11,779
like this they're gonna start kind of

2009
01:22:10,279 --> 01:22:13,550
making the rules a little tighter for

2010
01:22:11,779 --> 01:22:15,019
the guys like us that know what we're

2011
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:18,650
doing so check it out if you come to

2012
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:21,590

and you don't eat Colorado edibles every

2018

Dumber getting a mile high in Colorado

2041
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:38,570
all right I read that article just as I

2042
01:23:36,949 --> 01:23:41,569
suspected some lady came from another

2043
01:23:38,569 --> 01:23:43,189
state her two friends split a candy bar

2044
01:23:41,569 --> 01:23:46,599
has a mile-high candy bar actually was

2045
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:49,189
100 milligrams they didn't realize such

2046
01:23:46,600 --> 01:23:51,020
she was at the pot shop to be novel she

2047
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:52,219
bought a joint to be cute for friend

2048
01:23:51,020 --> 01:23:54,830
bought her an edible they split the

2049
01:23:52,220 --> 01:23:56,630
edible they both went to dinner

2050
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:58,489
her friend fainted because she was so

2051
01:23:56,630 --> 01:24:01,279
damn high her friend got all freaked out

2052
01:23:58,489 --> 01:24:03,079
they ended up at the hospital and the

2053
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:04,939
guy at the doctor at the hospital said

2054
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:06,739
this happens every single day because of

2055
01:24:04,939 --> 01:24:08,539
edibles and the lady kind of made a big

2056
01:24:06,739 --> 01:24:10,340
deal about it so that's the basic part

2057
01:24:08,539 --> 01:24:12,260
of that story she got too [ __ ] up just

2058
01:24:10,340 --> 01:24:14,510
another case of exactly what we are

2059
01:24:12,260 --> 01:24:15,739

2066

2068

2070
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,570

01:24:38,510 --> 01:24:57,659
I'll be back hold on

2072
01:24:40,569 --> 01:24:57,658
[Music]

2073
01:24:58,039 --> 01:25:02,369
alright guys I am back got a hoodie took

2074
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:04,380
a couple of dabs and feeling better now

2075
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:05,970
couple episodes ago we did a crash

2076
01:25:04,380 --> 01:25:08,369
course in germinating seeds and getting

2077
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:09,570
seeds into the soil to get started if

2078
01:25:08,369 --> 01:25:10,979
you guys started seeds you should have

2079
01:25:09,569 --> 01:25:12,359
little sprouts pop it up out of the dirt

2080
01:25:10,979 --> 01:25:14,729
and everything should be growing off to

2081
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:16,289
a good start looking happy one thing I

2082
01:25:14,729 --> 01:25:18,929
didn't talk enough about was the light

2083
01:25:16,289 --> 01:25:20,909
scheduled for your new seedlings a t5

2084
01:25:18,930 --> 01:25:23,100
light is perfect I use a 24 hour light

2085
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:24,210
cycle when my plants are small I don't

2086
01:25:23,100 --> 01:25:27,120
let him sleep until they get a little

2087
01:25:24,210 --> 01:25:29,430
bit bigger like I said T fives are

2088
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:30,899
perfect for that metal halide lamp is

2089
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:34,200
perfect for that you don't need anything

2090
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:35,699
big like a 400 watt is almost overkill

2091
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:38,099
to start your seeds you can't start them

2092
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:39,960
under a thousand but it's not necessary

2093
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:42,690
at all t5 lights are perfect for that

2094
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,100
little fluorescence so the guys you

2095
01:25:42,689 --> 01:25:45,539
people that started ceilings you can

2096
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:46,920
kick back and let your babies grow while

2097
01:25:45,539 --> 01:25:49,289
we teach everyone how to take a clone

2098
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:50,699
but pay attention because you're gonna

2099
01:25:49,289 --> 01:25:52,739
be taking clones from that plant that

2100
01:25:50,699 --> 01:25:55,649
grows from that seed here in about two

2101
01:25:52,739 --> 01:25:57,269
months alright so I feel like if we cut

2102
01:25:55,649 --> 01:25:59,189
clones this week and we let them get

2103
01:25:57,270 --> 01:26:01,080
rooted over the next couple weeks we

2104
01:25:59,189 --> 01:26:03,059
should have clones and seedlings caught

2105
01:26:01,079 --> 01:26:04,729
up about the same size and ready for veg

2106
01:26:03,060 --> 01:26:07,920
here in just a couple of more episodes

2107
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:11,250
so now let's talk about taking a clone

2108
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:13,199
from a mother or a donor plant a mother

2109
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:14,609
plant is a plant that's kept in veg

2110
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:17,369
indefinitely so that we can take

2111
01:26:14,609 --> 01:26:20,039
cuttings from it at any time if you keep

2112
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:22,260
that plant under 24 hours of light or 18

2113
01:26:20,039 --> 01:26:23,939
hours of light it won't flower if you

2114
01:26:22,260 --> 01:26:25,860
treat it well if you prevent it from

2115
01:26:23,939 --> 01:26:27,289
getting root bound and you top it and

2116
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:29,639
take clones from that every so often

2117
01:26:27,289 --> 01:26:32,010
that plant will stay in veg so you'll

2118
01:26:29,640 --> 01:26:33,480
always have it available because it's

2119
01:26:32,010 --> 01:26:35,180
great to have a reliable dependable

2120
01:26:33,479 --> 01:26:37,500
strain around that's how you hear about

2121
01:26:35,180 --> 01:26:39,150
all the strains that are your favorites

2122
01:26:37,500 --> 01:26:41,159
those are kept around as a mother plant

2123
01:26:39,149 --> 01:26:42,929
by somebody who has given them out in

2124
01:26:41,159 --> 01:26:45,659
clone form so a bunch of people don't

2125
01:26:42,930 --> 01:26:46,140
have those clones the tangi the Gorilla

2126
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:47,670
Glue

2127
01:26:46,140 --> 01:26:49,530
somebody somewhere discovered the

2128
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:50,789
gorilla glue or even Girl Scout cookies

2129
01:26:49,529 --> 01:26:52,739
somebody discovered the Girl Scout

2130
01:26:50,789 --> 01:26:54,630
cookies and some seeds they had they

2131
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:56,760
gave out a clone of that

2132
01:26:54,630 --> 01:26:58,078
somebody gave they let it grow into a

2133
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:59,489
mother plant they took a clone of that

2134
01:26:58,078 --> 01:27:02,519
and gave it out now those strains are

2135
01:26:59,488 --> 01:27:04,348
all over the Girl Scout cookies is

2136
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:06,929
available from California to New York

2137
01:27:04,349 --> 01:27:08,730
now because of clones and cuttings and

2138
01:27:06,929 --> 01:27:12,270
mother plants so if you keep that mother

2139
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:13,799
plant in veg forever then this strain

2140
01:27:12,270 --> 01:27:14,730
will exist forever you can always go to

2141
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,860
that mother plant

2142
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:18,598
cut enough clones off of it to fill up

2143
01:27:16,859 --> 01:27:20,158
your flower room and then you can keep

2144
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:22,139
growing more crops and more crops of

2145
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:24,868
Girl Scout cookies or gorilla glue or

2146
01:27:22,139 --> 01:27:26,429
grateful dog or whatever it is that

2147
01:27:24,868 --> 01:27:27,779
you've grown from seed or gotten a clone

2148
01:27:26,429 --> 01:27:29,699
up you can keep it going forever that

2149
01:27:27,779 --> 01:27:31,529
way some people are gonna ask why they

2150
01:27:29,698 --> 01:27:33,539
shouldn't grow from seed every time they

2151
01:27:31,529 --> 01:27:35,939
start a new grow well the reason for

2152
01:27:33,539 --> 01:27:37,828
that is because seeds do show genetic

2153
01:27:35,939 --> 01:27:39,118
variation there will be different

2154
01:27:37,828 --> 01:27:42,149
phenotypes which is something we'll talk

2155
01:27:39,118 --> 01:27:43,649
about in a later episode but not all

2156
01:27:42,149 --> 01:27:45,179
seeds are gonna look the same imagine

2157
01:27:43,649 --> 01:27:46,469
your brothers and sisters don't all look

2158
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:49,289
the same but they came from the same

2159
01:27:46,469 --> 01:27:51,149
parents you're the same seed stock but

2160
01:27:49,289 --> 01:27:52,319
you look just a little bit different

2161
01:27:51,149 --> 01:27:54,929
than each other because that's the way

2162
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:56,908
that genetics work so it's good to have

2163
01:27:54,929 --> 01:27:59,520
a clone of something that you've ran and

2164
01:27:56,908 --> 01:28:01,439
trusted and you know is reliable because

2165
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,909
medical patients are limited to a

2166
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:05,279
certain amount of plants and if you're

2167
01:28:02,908 --> 01:28:06,509
running plants that are not going to be

2168
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:08,670
what you need in the end he kind of

2169
01:28:06,510 --> 01:28:12,150
might be wasting space i heavily

2170
01:28:08,670 --> 01:28:13,770
encourage seed running because i do like

2171
01:28:12,149 --> 01:28:16,920
finding those genetic differences but

2172
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:19,079
I've got space I'm an experienced grower

2173
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:20,429
so once you're comfortable with it I

2174
01:28:19,078 --> 01:28:22,439
definitely encourage you to do some

2175
01:28:20,429 --> 01:28:25,139
seeds but let's get back to talking

2176
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:27,479
about mother plants the easiest way to

2177
01:28:25,139 --> 01:28:29,310
find a mother plant is to get a clone

2178
01:28:27,479 --> 01:28:30,658
that's been tested and proven you want

2179
01:28:29,310 --> 01:28:32,280
to know that it's a female you want to

2180
01:28:30,658 --> 01:28:34,109
know that it's dank good medicine you

2181
01:28:32,279 --> 01:28:36,090
want to know that it grows without any

2182
01:28:34,109 --> 01:28:38,039
trouble so usually if you get it from a

2183
01:28:36,090 --> 01:28:40,050
shop or a fellow grower or breeder your

2184
01:28:38,039 --> 01:28:41,069
clones are gonna be solid one thing I

2185
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:42,779
should mention that it's your

2186
01:28:41,069 --> 01:28:44,609
responsibility to take a new clone that

2187
01:28:42,779 --> 01:28:47,189
you got from somebody and make sure

2188
01:28:44,609 --> 01:28:48,598
there are no bugs on it you can't get a

2189
01:28:47,189 --> 01:28:50,339
clone from somebody and then blame them

2190
01:28:48,599 --> 01:28:53,150
for having given you bugs later on if

2191
01:28:50,340 --> 01:28:55,800
you get mites or whiteflies from a clone

2192
01:28:53,149 --> 01:28:57,000
that's like not having safe sex you

2193
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,440
can't blame it on the person that gave

2194
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:00,810
that [ __ ] to you you should have been

2195
01:28:58,439 --> 01:29:02,098
taking care of that [ __ ] in advance so

2196
01:29:00,810 --> 01:29:03,960
be careful with the clone that comes in

2197
01:29:02,099 --> 01:29:06,449
there are plenty of ways to treat for

2198
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:07,408
spider mites for white flies for

2199
01:29:06,448 --> 01:29:08,308
anything you should come up with a good

2200
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:09,658
regimen maybe that

2201
01:29:08,309 --> 01:29:11,279
something we'll talk about on a future

2202
01:29:09,658 --> 01:29:14,189
episode is a way to get rid of and

2203
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:16,920
prevent bugs on incoming clones one way

2204
01:29:14,189 --> 01:29:19,019
to do it is to grow from seed but let's

2205
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:20,819
get back to clones again now once you've

2206
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:23,639
got your clone and it's healthy and bug

2207
01:29:20,819 --> 01:29:25,948
free transplant your little clone into a

2208
01:29:23,639 --> 01:29:27,538
large pot I wouldn't use any smaller

2209
01:29:25,948 --> 01:29:30,000
than a 5 gallon pot for a mother plant

2210
01:29:27,538 --> 01:29:32,908
so get into a 5 gallon pot keep it under

2211
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:34,738
24 hours or 18 hours of lights and

2212
01:29:32,908 --> 01:29:36,238
people do 18 somebody 24 I like to keep

2213
01:29:34,738 --> 01:29:38,189
my mothers under 24 hours of light

2214
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,828
that's my personal preference I feel

2215
01:29:38,189 --> 01:29:42,118
like they grow way fast and they like to

2216
01:29:40,828 --> 01:29:44,429
give me lots of cuttings and they look

2217
01:29:42,118 --> 01:29:46,920
really healthy so take that little baby

2218
01:29:44,429 --> 01:29:48,029
that somebody gave you put it in a let

2219
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:51,059
it get good and rooted put it in a

2220
01:29:48,029 --> 01:29:52,618
five-gallon pot let it grow you know let

2221
01:29:51,059 --> 01:29:55,920
it get quite a few nodes on it let it

2222
01:29:52,618 --> 01:29:57,389
get growing and then you're gonna want

2223
01:29:55,920 --> 01:29:58,618
to take the top right out of it boom

2224
01:29:57,389 --> 01:29:59,909
that's your first cutting that you're

2225
01:29:58,618 --> 01:30:01,078
gonna want to take you're gonna kind of

2226
01:29:59,908 --> 01:30:03,210
want to even out the height of that

2227
01:30:01,078 --> 01:30:06,179
plant so that every node starts growing

2228
01:30:03,210 --> 01:30:07,800
up to be the same size training a mother

2229
01:30:06,179 --> 01:30:09,750
plant how to grow by pruning it properly

2230
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:11,849
is an art that will take you a few

2231
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:14,750
plants of making them look super ugly

2232
01:30:11,849 --> 01:30:18,139
before you catch on but that's alright

2233
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:21,059
something I do about once every year

2234
01:30:18,139 --> 01:30:22,739
irie mom all of my mother's so I'll take

2235
01:30:21,059 --> 01:30:25,380
my mother plant and I'll take six or

2236
01:30:22,738 --> 01:30:27,388
seven cuttings off of it and then I'll

2237
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:28,949
take the best one of that and I'll root

2238
01:30:27,389 --> 01:30:30,150
it or I'll get it in a cup I'll get it

2239
01:30:28,948 --> 01:30:31,828
growing I'll get it into a pot and that

2240
01:30:30,149 --> 01:30:33,269
becomes my new mother plant for the next

2241
01:30:31,828 --> 01:30:34,979
year so that I have a nice healthy plant

2242
01:30:33,270 --> 01:30:36,539
because they I feel like they start

2243
01:30:34,979 --> 01:30:37,649
getting their Viggen true bound they get

2244
01:30:36,538 --> 01:30:39,840
old they get tired these plants were

2245
01:30:37,649 --> 01:30:41,129
only meant to live for a year so if you

2246
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,779
try to keep it around for too long it

2247
01:30:41,130 --> 01:30:45,679
will kind of lose its vigor so I reclone

2248
01:30:42,779 --> 01:30:48,000
it and put some youth back into it so

2249
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:50,219
that's how you could pretty much take a

2250
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,349
clone that you're given or bought from a

2251
01:30:50,219 --> 01:30:54,300
shop and turn it into your very first

2252
01:30:52,349 --> 01:30:57,059
mother plant a lot of people don't have

2253
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:59,250
access to that so they're gonna have to

2254
01:30:57,059 --> 01:31:00,840
run seeds and I was talking about that

2255
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:02,520
genetic variation from seed so you're

2256
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,489
not guaranteed of what you're gonna get

2257
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:07,949
unless somebody's taken it to the f4 or

2258
01:31:05,488 --> 01:31:10,589
f5 stage which that is a whole other

2259
01:31:07,948 --> 01:31:11,908
podcast we'll talk about later so if you

2260
01:31:10,590 --> 01:31:13,500
don't have access to good clones you're

2261
01:31:11,908 --> 01:31:15,469
gonna need to get some seeds and run

2262
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:17,639
some seeds to find your mother plant

2263
01:31:15,469 --> 01:31:19,408
what I usually do is I run a pack of

2264
01:31:17,639 --> 01:31:20,609
seeds usually between 10 and 50 seeds

2265
01:31:19,408 --> 01:31:21,359
depending on the strain of what I'm

2266
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:23,609
looking for

2267
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:24,960
I grow those seeds out and I pay very

2268
01:31:23,609 --> 01:31:26,399
close attention to the feds growth

2269
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:28,140
because veg growth is really important

2270
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:30,149
to me I need it to be a good grower I

2271
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:32,340
would like to pay attention to the way

2272
01:31:30,149 --> 01:31:34,259
each phenotype branches out I like to

2273
01:31:32,340 --> 01:31:35,970
pay attention to the rate it grows I

2274
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:38,789
like to pay attention to how many nodes

2275
01:31:35,970 --> 01:31:41,130
and how many little little flower sites

2276
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:42,750
are not flower sites but they will be

2277
01:31:41,130 --> 01:31:45,119
flower sites how many of those develop

2278
01:31:42,750 --> 01:31:49,289
in a little cluster area along the

2279
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:50,939
branches I like to pay attention so I'm

2280
01:31:49,289 --> 01:31:53,550
super careful to feed each plant and

2281
01:31:50,939 --> 01:31:55,319
tree each plant the same so that I can

2282
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:56,880
see what each pot has to offer without

2283
01:31:55,319 --> 01:31:59,789
messing it up by doing something

2284
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:01,560
different if it's nutrients or training

2285
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:04,769
or trimming or topping or whatever I

2286
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:06,510
treat each one the same so I mix up

2287
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:08,340
enough nutrients in one bucket to feed

2288
01:32:06,510 --> 01:32:09,690
all of them are in one res to feed all

2289
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:11,640
of these little seedlings and I feed

2290
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:13,799
them all the exact same [ __ ] I try to

2291
01:32:11,640 --> 01:32:16,079
rotate them under the light so that

2292
01:32:13,800 --> 01:32:18,060
nobody gets like one spot of the light

2293
01:32:16,079 --> 01:32:19,170
has maybe has better lumens there I make

2294
01:32:18,060 --> 01:32:20,730
sure that doesn't happen I make sure

2295
01:32:19,170 --> 01:32:22,140
they get moved around so that

2296
01:32:20,729 --> 01:32:24,929
everybody's kind of treated the same and

2297
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:27,570
I'll show any favoritism once you're big

2298
01:32:24,930 --> 01:32:28,950
enough to give me a few cuttings I take

2299
01:32:27,569 --> 01:32:32,159
your cutting or a clone from each plant

2300
01:32:28,949 --> 01:32:35,849
and I carefully label the plants and I

2301
01:32:32,159 --> 01:32:36,659
label the cuttings so I'll take I'm

2302
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:39,420
super careful

2303
01:32:36,659 --> 01:32:41,099
I take plant a and clone a and make sure

2304
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,020
to label those so you got your big

2305
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,760
mother plant is plant a you got a little

2306
01:32:43,020 --> 01:32:47,790
clone is cloning then you got plant B

2307
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:49,829
clone B all the way down to however many

2308
01:32:47,789 --> 01:32:51,449
you got you can do it my number you can

2309
01:32:49,829 --> 01:32:53,100
name them I've got a friend who names

2310
01:32:51,449 --> 01:32:54,630
them after old ladies for some reason

2311
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:57,210
I've got friends that name them after

2312
01:32:54,630 --> 01:33:00,270
cartoon characters I always seem to name

2313
01:32:57,210 --> 01:33:01,739
my stuff after Grateful Dead songs just

2314
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:04,530
something something that means something

2315
01:33:01,739 --> 01:33:06,510
to you letters and numbers work but once

2316
01:33:04,529 --> 01:33:08,849
I see what my my clothes are gonna root

2317
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:10,949
and I'm safe to flower out that original

2318
01:33:08,850 --> 01:33:12,480
seedling plant I flowered out and see

2319
01:33:10,949 --> 01:33:14,099
what I get from them now a lot of people

2320
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,289
will keep that original plant around as

2321
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:18,990
a mother plan that seedling plant that

2322
01:33:16,289 --> 01:33:20,310
you planted a lot of people I believe so

2323
01:33:18,989 --> 01:33:22,378
as well it's got more vigor it's a

2324
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:23,879
stronger plant

2325
01:33:22,378 --> 01:33:26,488
so they want to keep that one around as

2326
01:33:23,878 --> 01:33:27,840
a mother and na flower that one out

2327
01:33:26,488 --> 01:33:29,458
they'll wait for those other clones that

2328
01:33:27,840 --> 01:33:31,199
they took to root and then they'll

2329
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:32,908
flower those but I think I saved time by

2330
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:35,098
blooming out the original plants it's

2331
01:33:32,908 --> 01:33:37,228
already grown and ready to go and I do a

2332
01:33:35,099 --> 01:33:39,719
technique called lolli popping anyway I

2333
01:33:37,229 --> 01:33:41,128
take the bottoms off of the plants where

2334
01:33:39,719 --> 01:33:42,828
the light's not gonna penetrate those

2335
01:33:41,128 --> 01:33:44,908
little bottom branches I cut those off

2336
01:33:42,828 --> 01:33:46,259
because I feel like if the light's not

2337
01:33:44,908 --> 01:33:47,878
gonna penetrate down there there's no

2338
01:33:46,260 --> 01:33:49,429
reason to really have that on there it's

2339
01:33:47,878 --> 01:33:52,168
just gonna take energy from the tops

2340
01:33:49,429 --> 01:33:54,029
where I could build big fat heady

2341
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:55,708
nuggets and there's I've learned how to

2342
01:33:54,029 --> 01:33:57,569
grow plants with no law or no little

2343
01:33:55,708 --> 01:34:00,628
tiny bud anymore all my stuff is big and

2344
01:33:57,569 --> 01:34:04,288
chunky just by doing a little a little

2345
01:34:00,628 --> 01:34:06,479
bit of pruning like that so me I'll take

2346
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:07,738
a couple clones from that area and I

2347
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:10,019
think those make great clones and flower

2348
01:34:07,738 --> 01:34:11,638
that original sealing plant some people

2349
01:34:10,019 --> 01:34:12,958
are against that but that's just I have

2350
01:34:11,639 --> 01:34:13,979
great experience doing it it's already

2351
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:15,448
grown it's already grown you've already

2352
01:34:13,979 --> 01:34:17,159
put a couple months into it you've got

2353
01:34:15,448 --> 01:34:18,958
clones of it you're cool but during the

2354
01:34:17,158 --> 01:34:21,089
flowering process sometimes I'll even

2355
01:34:18,958 --> 01:34:24,448
pull out plants early if they show signs

2356
01:34:21,090 --> 01:34:26,429
of weakness I've seen plants that just

2357
01:34:24,448 --> 01:34:28,708
grow really wispy really weak maybe ice

2358
01:34:26,429 --> 01:34:31,199
thrown away the wrong [ __ ] but I need

2359
01:34:28,708 --> 01:34:32,519
stuff that breathes heavily and that

2360
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:34,098
grows solid so I don't want to be

2361
01:34:32,519 --> 01:34:36,119
playing with those little weak [ __ ]

2362
01:34:34,099 --> 01:34:37,889
just the way we do it we practice

2363
01:34:36,118 --> 01:34:42,089
eugenics in the breeding room definitely

2364
01:34:37,889 --> 01:34:44,189
definitely isolate males or

2365
01:34:42,090 --> 01:34:45,719
hermaphrodites go immediately if it

2366
01:34:44,189 --> 01:34:47,760
shows signs of hermaphrodite

2367
01:34:45,719 --> 01:34:49,168
I throw that sucker away really quickly

2368
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:51,389
we'll talk more about hermaphrodites in

2369
01:34:49,168 --> 01:34:52,679
another show I guess isolate the males

2370
01:34:51,389 --> 01:34:54,989
and if I'm not looking for a male to

2371
01:34:52,679 --> 01:34:56,219
breed I throw the male's away as soon as

2372
01:34:54,988 --> 01:34:58,138
I identify them if I'm looking for a

2373
01:34:56,219 --> 01:34:59,668
breeding male I already had that in mind

2374
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:01,708
when I planted those seeds I've got some

2375
01:34:59,668 --> 01:35:03,898
seeds down right now that I'm hoping for

2376
01:35:01,708 --> 01:35:05,458
a male I'm hoping for three to five

2377
01:35:03,899 --> 01:35:08,239
males out of one of those packs I'm

2378
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:11,158
hoping for three to choose from

2379
01:35:08,238 --> 01:35:13,918
selecting a male is a fun process in my

2380
01:35:11,158 --> 01:35:14,938
opinion so anyway you guys should throw

2381
01:35:13,918 --> 01:35:16,109
away your males if you're new you don't

2382
01:35:14,939 --> 01:35:17,399
want to have the males around those are

2383
01:35:16,109 --> 01:35:19,109
gonna create pollen those are gonna put

2384
01:35:17,399 --> 01:35:21,628
season on your crop which is probably

2385
01:35:19,109 --> 01:35:24,208
not what you want at this point so at

2386
01:35:21,628 --> 01:35:26,368
this point if I throw away a male or a

2387
01:35:24,208 --> 01:35:28,689
shitty plant I also toss all the clones

2388
01:35:26,368 --> 01:35:30,250
and that way you just took

2389
01:35:28,689 --> 01:35:31,779
you made space you just took your

2390
01:35:30,250 --> 01:35:35,939
numbers down one thing I should mention

2391
01:35:31,779 --> 01:35:38,199
about is uh I should talk about you

2392
01:35:35,939 --> 01:35:39,759
should plan if you can plant as many

2393
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:43,300
seeds as you think you're able to handle

2394
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:44,619
you need a vegging plant a clone and a

2395
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:45,760
flowering plant so think about whatever

2396
01:35:44,619 --> 01:35:47,260
you're doing that seedling you're gonna

2397
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,360
need three versions of those so if

2398
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:51,310
you're able to have 15 plants plant five

2399
01:35:49,359 --> 01:35:54,009
if you're ready to have six I guess only

2400
01:35:51,310 --> 01:35:55,390
plant two a lot of guys forget that

2401
01:35:54,010 --> 01:35:57,039
they're gonna take clones they're gonna

2402
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:58,539
have a mother plant they need plants and

2403
01:35:57,039 --> 01:36:00,159
veg they're gonna have plants in flower

2404
01:35:58,539 --> 01:36:02,079
so just try to keep in mind how many

2405
01:36:00,159 --> 01:36:03,399
plants you're gonna end up with because

2406
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:04,659
you're gonna it's gonna be like anything

2407
01:36:03,399 --> 01:36:06,189
else you fall in love with you're gonna

2408
01:36:04,659 --> 01:36:08,229
be like I need a plant and then you're

2409
01:36:06,189 --> 01:36:09,489
gonna pretty soon you're gonna be like I

2410
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:12,309
need a room and then you're gonna be

2411
01:36:09,489 --> 01:36:13,869
like I need a facility and then we've

2412
01:36:12,310 --> 01:36:16,240
seen how it goes you're on the internet

2413
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:18,159
too so I would say plant as many seeds

2414
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:21,519
as you think you can safely and legally

2415
01:36:18,159 --> 01:36:22,659
handle but plat one extra because some

2416
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:25,000
shits gonna die something's gonna fail

2417
01:36:22,659 --> 01:36:26,529
this plant one extra you're gonna have

2418
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,909
to think about space and stuff plan

2419
01:36:26,529 --> 01:36:29,109
ahead that's something that I like to

2420
01:36:27,909 --> 01:36:31,359
stress when we're growing here

2421
01:36:29,109 --> 01:36:34,779
so we'll let the best-looking plants

2422
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:36,939
finish now don't be shy don't be afraid

2423
01:36:34,779 --> 01:36:38,529
like if you don't like the way something

2424
01:36:36,939 --> 01:36:40,689
grows if a plant is really pissing you

2425
01:36:38,529 --> 01:36:42,329
off cut that thing down we're gonna grow

2426
01:36:40,689 --> 01:36:44,259
more weed in the future it's not the end

2427
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:46,210
some people are gonna cringe because

2428
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:48,369
maybe you just cut down the greatest

2429
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:50,829
plant ever but as a new grower don't

2430
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:52,119
worry you'll move on I've cut down I've

2431
01:36:50,829 --> 01:36:53,579
lost strains that I miss and you know

2432
01:36:52,119 --> 01:36:55,510
what I bred more I've grown more

2433
01:36:53,579 --> 01:36:57,909
forgotten all about him until now that

2434
01:36:55,510 --> 01:37:00,430
I'm talking about it so uh I usually

2435
01:36:57,909 --> 01:37:02,680
harvest trim and cure the plants smoke

2436
01:37:00,430 --> 01:37:04,060
all of them myself not all of it but I

2437
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:06,730
smoke a little bit of each plant myself

2438
01:37:04,060 --> 01:37:08,920
I also take a couple samples of each

2439
01:37:06,729 --> 01:37:10,539
phenotype and I give them to friends

2440
01:37:08,920 --> 01:37:12,190
help me decide which is best farm I'm a

2441
01:37:10,539 --> 01:37:15,039
medical marijuana provider so I have a

2442
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:16,659
great team of testers for me that will

2443
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:18,460
smoke and take good notes I've given

2444
01:37:16,659 --> 01:37:19,689
them a little a little chart to fill out

2445
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:21,189
for me to tell me what they think of

2446
01:37:19,689 --> 01:37:23,589
each strain and I don't tell them what

2447
01:37:21,189 --> 01:37:25,929
it is I just label it a B C B or

2448
01:37:23,590 --> 01:37:27,699
whatever and they tell me what they

2449
01:37:25,930 --> 01:37:29,890
think of each one and then usually I

2450
01:37:27,699 --> 01:37:32,289
agree I usually know what they're gonna

2451
01:37:29,890 --> 01:37:33,820
want me to keep so I let those guys

2452
01:37:32,289 --> 01:37:36,189
smoke it once I've narrowed it down to a

2453
01:37:33,819 --> 01:37:36,819
few my favorites I take them to a lab

2454
01:37:36,189 --> 01:37:38,559
for testing

2455
01:37:36,819 --> 01:37:38,809
I should take all of them but honestly

2456
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,400
the

2457
01:37:38,810 --> 01:37:42,890
a little bit expensive and it's two

2458
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,719
hours away and I think it's better for

2459
01:37:42,890 --> 01:37:46,460
me to let the smokers narrow it down

2460
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:48,829
because they know more than the numbers

2461
01:37:46,460 --> 01:37:49,880
do they know more than the machines and

2462
01:37:48,829 --> 01:37:51,289
that's what I'm growing it for is the

2463
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:53,300
people that are smoking I'm not trying

2464
01:37:51,289 --> 01:37:56,989
you just grow for height numbers

2465
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:58,520
sometimes I the plant that has sometimes

2466
01:37:56,989 --> 01:38:02,090
I like the plant that actually has lower

2467
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:03,470
numbers those guys like the flavor or

2468
01:38:02,090 --> 01:38:05,270
something of a plant with lower numbers

2469
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:06,829
and I think I can usually predict the

2470
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:10,000
high testers I've said this plant is

2471
01:38:06,829 --> 01:38:12,559
gonna test higher and I'm usually right

2472
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,270
to give you guys an idea of what some of

2473
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:17,030
the stuff has been testing at I'm gonna

2474
01:38:14,270 --> 01:38:18,800
pull up a PDF guy you have here on my

2475
01:38:17,029 --> 01:38:20,029
macbook I just have to find it right

2476
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:23,600
quick I've put a lot of stuff going on

2477
01:38:20,029 --> 01:38:26,420
here this is these tests were done just

2478
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:27,950
a couple of maybe a month ago it's

2479
01:38:26,420 --> 01:38:29,989
opening the PDF right now it's taking a

2480
01:38:27,949 --> 01:38:31,550
sweet time so I grew I brought a strain

2481
01:38:29,989 --> 01:38:32,689
called lemon Jeffrey it's that's

2482
01:38:31,550 --> 01:38:36,260
actually the lemons gone across the

2483
01:38:32,689 --> 01:38:39,109
Golden go and she tested at twenty four

2484
01:38:36,260 --> 01:38:42,530
point three for THC that's kind of a

2485
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:45,619
high test let me find another one for

2486
01:38:42,529 --> 01:38:49,039
you here the Capleton

2487
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:51,890
that's the white widow times grateful

2488
01:38:49,039 --> 01:38:54,260
dog got to blow it up it's real small

2489
01:38:51,890 --> 01:38:57,740
here on the screen ballot is twenty

2490
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:59,989
point five eight percent THC so that's

2491
01:38:57,739 --> 01:39:02,750
kind of what we're testing in the 20s

2492
01:38:59,989 --> 01:39:05,300
got the Grateful dog here also grateful

2493
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:08,810
dog she tested at twenty three point

2494
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:09,829
three two percent THC a so those are

2495
01:39:08,810 --> 01:39:11,720
that's kind of what some things are

2496
01:39:09,829 --> 01:39:13,909
coming out at they said at the lab

2497
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:15,650
anything over seventeen percent THC is

2498
01:39:13,909 --> 01:39:17,090
actually impressive so that means we're

2499
01:39:15,649 --> 01:39:18,859
doing some stuff right over here I

2500
01:39:17,090 --> 01:39:20,239
should probably give you huge shout out

2501
01:39:18,859 --> 01:39:22,670
to the guys over at steep hill Halen

2502
01:39:20,239 --> 01:39:24,649
labs they guided me through getting my

2503
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:27,170
stuff tested they gave me a sweet tour

2504
01:39:24,649 --> 01:39:29,119
of their lab in their facility and they

2505
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:30,770
got the results to me in like three days

2506
01:39:29,119 --> 01:39:33,140
so big shout out steep hill Halen

2507
01:39:30,770 --> 01:39:34,550
definitely recommend those guys if

2508
01:39:33,140 --> 01:39:36,920
you're not able to get your stuff tested

2509
01:39:34,550 --> 01:39:38,150
don't worry that's not it's up to more

2510
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:39,560
up to the people that are smoking and

2511
01:39:38,149 --> 01:39:41,059
then up to the lab like I said anyway

2512
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:43,460
but either way once you've got your

2513
01:39:41,060 --> 01:39:45,610
keeper and you've got a clone of it

2514
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:48,260
that should become your new mother plan

2515
01:39:45,609 --> 01:39:49,819
what like if you grew out a seed pack

2516
01:39:48,260 --> 01:39:51,710
and you and all your friends whoever's

2517
01:39:49,819 --> 01:39:54,349
gonna be partaking and participating

2518
01:39:51,710 --> 01:39:57,230
smoking enjoying you your girlfriend

2519
01:39:54,350 --> 01:39:58,520
your best friend whoever you know make

2520
01:39:57,229 --> 01:39:59,959
sure that you guys all kind of agree on

2521
01:39:58,520 --> 01:40:02,000
the same one and you keep that one it's

2522
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:03,350
usually it's usually a no-brainer

2523
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,909
that's your new mother you're gonna have

2524
01:40:03,350 --> 01:40:06,710
that around forever or until you find

2525
01:40:04,909 --> 01:40:08,029
something better to grow but I would

2526
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:09,469
definitely recommend sticking with that

2527
01:40:08,029 --> 01:40:10,880
strain for a couple of runs so that you

2528
01:40:09,469 --> 01:40:13,489
can build a relationship and kind of

2529
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:16,250
learn the plant and see some consistency

2530
01:40:13,488 --> 01:40:17,389
and see your improvement either way now

2531
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:20,719
you've got your keeper you've got a

2532
01:40:17,390 --> 01:40:22,969
clone of it you keep that plant around

2533
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:24,199
forever so that you always have clones

2534
01:40:22,969 --> 01:40:26,960
of it and you've always got that strain

2535
01:40:24,199 --> 01:40:28,399
to grow I keep my mother plants in large

2536
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:30,859
pots to keep them from becoming

2537
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:31,339
rootbound I'm going to switch to air

2538
01:40:30,859 --> 01:40:32,988
pots

2539
01:40:31,340 --> 01:40:35,239
they're not cloth pots they're plastic

2540
01:40:32,988 --> 01:40:36,379
pots but they've got holes in them and

2541
01:40:35,238 --> 01:40:37,909
they're designed to keep the dirt in

2542
01:40:36,380 --> 01:40:39,890
while they still have holes in them I

2543
01:40:37,909 --> 01:40:41,359
think that those will be great for my

2544
01:40:39,890 --> 01:40:43,969
roots I'll be able to keep a mother

2545
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:45,889
plant happier for a little bit longer

2546
01:40:43,969 --> 01:40:48,079
keep them under at least 18 hours of

2547
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:51,170
light I do 24 hours of my lights never

2548
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:53,149
go off in my mother room my mom's are

2549
01:40:51,170 --> 01:40:55,100
under commercial t fives and they love

2550
01:40:53,149 --> 01:40:58,279
it make sure you love on those plants

2551
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:59,960
often love on them once a week go take

2552
01:40:58,279 --> 01:41:01,909
some cuttings off of them keep them the

2553
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:03,739
right size trim them up give them a lot

2554
01:41:01,909 --> 01:41:05,840
of airflow give them space keep them

2555
01:41:03,738 --> 01:41:07,968
Lively take cuttings even if you don't

2556
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:10,100
need them because that makes your plant

2557
01:41:07,969 --> 01:41:14,329
keep growing and stay active feeding a

2558
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:15,710
nice healthy veg nutrient regimen lots a

2559
01:41:14,329 --> 01:41:17,090
night not lots of nitrogen but enough

2560
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:20,810
nitrogen you don't want to overfeed the

2561
01:41:17,090 --> 01:41:22,819
nitrogen take good care of them don't

2562
01:41:20,810 --> 01:41:24,590
let any bugs get to these plants treat

2563
01:41:22,819 --> 01:41:27,380
them with neem oil once a week if you

2564
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:28,640
can if you're around other gardens or if

2565
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:30,619
you're around places where people have

2566
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:32,780
bugs maybe you need to step up your

2567
01:41:30,619 --> 01:41:34,849
treatment game maybe you need to find a

2568
01:41:32,779 --> 01:41:36,800
more integrated pest management system

2569
01:41:34,850 --> 01:41:38,120
which we will talk about in more

2570
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,159
episodes I've got a friend who's really

2571
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:41,948
good at such things he'll come and help

2572
01:41:40,159 --> 01:41:43,658
us out with that in the future

2573
01:41:41,948 --> 01:41:44,948
all right so now we understand the

2574
01:41:43,658 --> 01:41:46,388
mother plants right I hope we've got a

2575
01:41:44,948 --> 01:41:48,549
good understanding we put some time into

2576
01:41:46,389 --> 01:41:50,319
that one let's actually take some

2577
01:41:48,550 --> 01:41:51,760
clothes from the mother plant or any

2578
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:54,458
plant that's actually in the vegetative

2579
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:55,719
state you can clone from flowering

2580
01:41:54,458 --> 01:41:57,248
plants but I definitely don't recommend

2581
01:41:55,719 --> 01:42:00,069
it the hormones and those plants have

2582
01:41:57,248 --> 01:42:01,748
changed you've got to kind of revert the

2583
01:42:00,069 --> 01:42:03,759
whole plant back to the vegetative state

2584
01:42:01,748 --> 01:42:05,288
while it roots so unless you're

2585
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:07,269
experienced and that strain is super

2586
01:42:05,288 --> 01:42:08,649
amazing I wouldn't even attempt it I

2587
01:42:07,269 --> 01:42:11,498
would just grow some more seeds or get

2588
01:42:08,649 --> 01:42:13,238
some on the clones so I need to grab a

2589
01:42:11,498 --> 01:42:14,920
drink and I need to take a fat dab and

2590
01:42:13,238 --> 01:42:19,478
then I will be right back and we will

2591
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:21,219
cut some clothes together all right guys

2592
01:42:19,479 --> 01:42:23,920
I am back and it's time to cut some

2593
01:42:21,219 --> 01:42:25,569
clones the first thing I should say is

2594
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:28,748
that the most important part of cutting

2595
01:42:25,569 --> 01:42:30,308
clones is cleanliness be clean I wear

2596
01:42:28,748 --> 01:42:31,719
rubber gloves while I cut clones I also

2597
01:42:30,309 --> 01:42:33,429
clean all my tools with rubbing alcohol

2598
01:42:31,719 --> 01:42:36,939
before I get started and I try to make

2599
01:42:33,429 --> 01:42:39,279
sure take have my cloning my working and

2600
01:42:36,939 --> 01:42:41,169
my clone room really clean everything I

2601
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:44,170
use is it's cleaned right before I cut

2602
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:46,868
my clones so you're also gonna need a

2603
01:42:44,170 --> 01:42:48,639
few items you'll need a pair of good

2604
01:42:46,868 --> 01:42:49,929
scissors or a razor blade you want

2605
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:51,038
something that makes a nice clean cut on

2606
01:42:49,929 --> 01:42:52,958
the first try you don't want to go

2607
01:42:51,038 --> 01:42:54,399
sawing off little pieces of your planner

2608
01:42:52,958 --> 01:42:56,319
you just want to whack it one time and

2609
01:42:54,399 --> 01:42:58,899
be done you need some good rooting

2610
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:00,488
hormone or cloning gel you're also gonna

2611
01:42:58,899 --> 01:43:03,549
need a cup of water and you should have

2612
01:43:00,488 --> 01:43:04,538
some pH down to lower the pH of your

2613
01:43:03,550 --> 01:43:08,559
water what comes out of your tap is

2614
01:43:04,538 --> 01:43:10,439
probably pH around 8 or 7 we want to get

2615
01:43:08,559 --> 01:43:15,998
for cutting clones we want to get about

2616
01:43:10,439 --> 01:43:17,439
6.0 would be ideal all right so there

2617
01:43:15,998 --> 01:43:19,448
are two ways of cloning that I want to

2618
01:43:17,439 --> 01:43:21,698
discuss today one is the old rock wool

2619
01:43:19,448 --> 01:43:23,998
cube and tray and dough method and the

2620
01:43:21,698 --> 01:43:26,469
other is the EZ cloner style method I

2621
01:43:23,998 --> 01:43:28,510
prefer the EZ cloner because they are

2622
01:43:26,469 --> 01:43:30,340
fast and simple but they're also kind of

2623
01:43:28,510 --> 01:43:33,489
expensive a good easy cloners gonna run

2624
01:43:30,340 --> 01:43:36,130
you probably 250 to 300 bucks plus

2625
01:43:33,488 --> 01:43:38,939
shipping plus you got to get a couple of

2626
01:43:36,130 --> 01:43:41,019
nutrients for it so for the cost of that

2627
01:43:38,939 --> 01:43:44,708
shipping you could probably get the

2628
01:43:41,019 --> 01:43:47,100
entire set up for the dome and rock wool

2629
01:43:44,708 --> 01:43:49,599
cube and tres style

2630
01:43:47,100 --> 01:43:51,730
so if you're using the dome and tray

2631
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,740
method you'll need a cloning tray a dome

2632
01:43:51,729 --> 01:43:55,569
to put over your babies well what the

2633
01:43:53,739 --> 01:43:56,760
dome does is it traps humidity in and

2634
01:43:55,569 --> 01:43:59,229
gives your clones a happy environment

2635
01:43:56,760 --> 01:44:01,750
you'll need rock wool cubes or something

2636
01:43:59,229 --> 01:44:03,159
similar to that I've used rapid rooters

2637
01:44:01,750 --> 01:44:05,079
and I've used route riots there pretty

2638
01:44:03,159 --> 01:44:06,819
much all the same thing for this type of

2639
01:44:05,079 --> 01:44:09,369
cloning I use dip and grow for my root

2640
01:44:06,819 --> 01:44:11,739
hormone I basically just dip it in there

2641
01:44:09,369 --> 01:44:13,329
and it's ready to go if you're doing the

2642
01:44:11,739 --> 01:44:15,760
tray and dough method I also recommend

2643
01:44:13,329 --> 01:44:17,470
that you use a heat mat and a thermostat

2644
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,840
to keep the clones warm that'll help

2645
01:44:17,470 --> 01:44:22,690
increase humidity and also increase your

2646
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:24,069
survival rate for your new clones so if

2647
01:44:22,689 --> 01:44:24,969
you're doing the easy color method all

2648
01:44:24,069 --> 01:44:27,189
you need is the cloner

2649
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:29,530
some nutrients and your neoprene discs

2650
01:44:27,189 --> 01:44:32,529
to put the clones into for the easy

2651
01:44:29,529 --> 01:44:34,779
cloner I use clone X for the gel and I

2652
01:44:32,529 --> 01:44:37,929
also like to add some stuff called clear

2653
01:44:34,779 --> 01:44:39,550
res I'm able to take some pretty big

2654
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:41,860
clones a route fairly quickly and I can

2655
01:44:39,550 --> 01:44:42,340
usually put them into dirt in 7 to 10

2656
01:44:41,859 --> 01:44:44,799
days

2657
01:44:42,340 --> 01:44:47,800
use an EZ corner so first I'll describe

2658
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:49,029
using the EZ cloner method make sure

2659
01:44:47,800 --> 01:44:50,350
hands are clean and hopefully where are

2660
01:44:49,029 --> 01:44:51,819
some rubber gloves make sure your

2661
01:44:50,350 --> 01:44:56,260
scissors are clean make sure your mother

2662
01:44:51,819 --> 01:44:58,210
plant is healthy I like to water the

2663
01:44:56,260 --> 01:45:00,579
plant with plain water the day that I'm

2664
01:44:58,210 --> 01:45:03,310
going to cut clones from it I'll just

2665
01:45:00,579 --> 01:45:04,359
put a plain pH balanced water right

2666
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:06,280
through it in the morning and then I'll

2667
01:45:04,359 --> 01:45:08,199
cut clones that night is usually the way

2668
01:45:06,279 --> 01:45:09,819
I like to do it so then I get my clone

2669
01:45:08,199 --> 01:45:11,739
or all set up I've got the EZ cloner

2670
01:45:09,819 --> 01:45:13,599
I've got to fill it with water it's

2671
01:45:11,739 --> 01:45:18,399
running it's got nutrients in it its pH

2672
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:21,579
dat 6.0 for my ez cloner I use advanced

2673
01:45:18,399 --> 01:45:22,569
nutrients jungle juice grow and micro

2674
01:45:21,579 --> 01:45:25,180
for my ez cloner

2675
01:45:22,569 --> 01:45:27,609
I mix my solution in 5-gallon buckets in

2676
01:45:25,180 --> 01:45:30,820
each 5-gallon bucket I use 25

2677
01:45:27,609 --> 01:45:33,309
milliliters of grow and 15 milliliters

2678
01:45:30,819 --> 01:45:35,619
of micro okay

2679
01:45:33,310 --> 01:45:38,350
each 5-gallon bucket gets that I feel

2680
01:45:35,619 --> 01:45:39,760
each cloner just below the sprayers make

2681
01:45:38,350 --> 01:45:41,050
sure not to overfill your clone ER with

2682
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,570
water because it will shoot the water

2683
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:46,230
all over the place now once you've got

2684
01:45:43,569 --> 01:45:49,359
it filled up then you adjust the pH to

2685
01:45:46,229 --> 01:45:50,889
6.0 and make sure you have the neoprene

2686
01:45:49,359 --> 01:45:52,479
discs in there before you plug it in and

2687
01:45:50,890 --> 01:45:55,329
turn it on or the water will go spraying

2688
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:56,739
all over the place again so now we need

2689
01:45:55,329 --> 01:45:59,019
a healthy mother plant and a few healthy

2690
01:45:56,739 --> 01:46:00,679
shoots to cut off so the lower branches

2691
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:02,270
are easier to clone because they're soft

2692
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:04,039
and the fresh roots will grow out of

2693
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:06,380
that more easily but I like to take the

2694
01:46:04,039 --> 01:46:07,670
tops of my plants for a fat clone so

2695
01:46:06,380 --> 01:46:09,710
from the top of your plant find a node

2696
01:46:07,670 --> 01:46:11,180
that looks healthy has a nice set of fan

2697
01:46:09,710 --> 01:46:12,380
leaves at the top something that sticks

2698
01:46:11,180 --> 01:46:15,140
up and looks like it'll become a nice

2699
01:46:12,380 --> 01:46:16,760
healthy plant on its own at the top if

2700
01:46:15,140 --> 01:46:18,320
you've got a new plant that hasn't ever

2701
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:20,239
been cut before it's already got one fat

2702
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:22,309
top sticking off of it follow that down

2703
01:46:20,239 --> 01:46:23,779
to an intersection tour when you cut it

2704
01:46:22,310 --> 01:46:25,160
you're gonna leave a little the little

2705
01:46:23,779 --> 01:46:26,359
tiny flowers that have just are the

2706
01:46:25,159 --> 01:46:28,939
little leaves have grown out of there

2707
01:46:26,359 --> 01:46:30,439
leave that leave that behind and maybe

2708
01:46:28,939 --> 01:46:31,579
it'll grow into two spots if you cut it

2709
01:46:30,439 --> 01:46:33,500
right you'll learn how to do it after a

2710
01:46:31,579 --> 01:46:35,000
little while so you got a spot that

2711
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:37,130
looks like it's gonna become its own

2712
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:39,260
nice happy plant cut that section off

2713
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:41,779
try to give yourself about a six inch

2714
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:43,489
section I like to clean off most of the

2715
01:46:41,779 --> 01:46:45,800
extra leaves on the clone I only keep

2716
01:46:43,489 --> 01:46:48,380
the top one or two pair of leaves for my

2717
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:50,119
clone so cut this piece quickly I keep a

2718
01:46:48,380 --> 01:46:51,829
cup of water next to me and I drop my

2719
01:46:50,119 --> 01:46:53,899
cuttings directly into the cut of water

2720
01:46:51,829 --> 01:46:55,159
or into the cup of water to prevent

2721
01:46:53,899 --> 01:46:58,279
what's called an embolism from

2722
01:46:55,159 --> 01:47:00,769
developing in the fresh cut so I've got

2723
01:46:58,279 --> 01:47:01,729
my scissors in one hand I'll take a

2724
01:47:00,770 --> 01:47:03,980
couple of cuts

2725
01:47:01,729 --> 01:47:05,659
snip snip I've got two fat looking

2726
01:47:03,979 --> 01:47:07,009
6-inch cuts with nice leaves at the top

2727
01:47:05,659 --> 01:47:09,979
I just drop those into a cup of water

2728
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:11,869
and I gather gather up cuts like I'll

2729
01:47:09,979 --> 01:47:13,669
take however many I need if I need 10 or

2730
01:47:11,869 --> 01:47:15,170
15 I'll just take them off and have them

2731
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:17,449
in that cup and then walk to the easy

2732
01:47:15,170 --> 01:47:18,770
cloner so that I'm not cutting clothes

2733
01:47:17,449 --> 01:47:24,050
that sit there and have a chance to dry

2734
01:47:18,770 --> 01:47:25,580
up all right so I take enough cuts and

2735
01:47:24,050 --> 01:47:28,130
I've got a cup full and then I started

2736
01:47:25,579 --> 01:47:30,800
dipping my cups out of my cuts into a

2737
01:47:28,130 --> 01:47:32,270
one at a time into the clone acts like

2738
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,909
to get a lot of clone X on my cuttings

2739
01:47:32,270 --> 01:47:37,280
so I pour a small amount onto I use a

2740
01:47:34,909 --> 01:47:38,779
plate because it's glass and the stuff I

2741
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:40,429
won't I feel like that absorbs and I

2742
01:47:38,779 --> 01:47:42,439
don't waste it so I pour some out onto a

2743
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:44,000
plate and I roll the bottom inch inch

2744
01:47:42,439 --> 01:47:46,339
and a half of my cutting into the gel

2745
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,489
and I get it good and covered and then I

2746
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:50,659
take the neoprene disc out of the cloner

2747
01:47:48,489 --> 01:47:52,579
don't try to shove the clone into the

2748
01:47:50,659 --> 01:47:54,470
neoprene wallets in the cloner that's

2749
01:47:52,579 --> 01:47:56,149
caveman style you're gonna fail you're

2750
01:47:54,470 --> 01:47:58,909
gonna kill the clone so take that little

2751
01:47:56,149 --> 01:48:00,769
neoprene disc out of the cloner open it

2752
01:47:58,909 --> 01:48:02,108
up like a pacman and put your disc put

2753
01:48:00,770 --> 01:48:04,570
your clone in there

2754
01:48:02,109 --> 01:48:08,289
and set your clone back into the cloner

2755
01:48:04,569 --> 01:48:10,238
so basically you cut it you store it in

2756
01:48:08,288 --> 01:48:11,559
that cup for just a second until you

2757
01:48:10,238 --> 01:48:13,598
have enough cuttings you cut it you put

2758
01:48:11,559 --> 01:48:16,179
it in the cup you get your cup and over

2759
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:18,010
to your cloning area you dip it you put

2760
01:48:16,179 --> 01:48:19,748
it inside that neoprene disc and then

2761
01:48:18,010 --> 01:48:20,289
you set that neoprene disc right inside

2762
01:48:19,748 --> 01:48:22,118
of your cloner

2763
01:48:20,288 --> 01:48:24,938
and you leave it along you just cut your

2764
01:48:22,118 --> 01:48:26,918
first clone then you repeat that until

2765
01:48:24,939 --> 01:48:28,749
your cloners full just dip it and stick

2766
01:48:26,918 --> 01:48:30,908
it dip it and stick it over and over

2767
01:48:28,748 --> 01:48:32,618
again I don't even have to check my

2768
01:48:30,908 --> 01:48:34,058
cloners for like 4 or 5 days after I

2769
01:48:32,618 --> 01:48:36,338
start I just check to make sure that the

2770
01:48:34,059 --> 01:48:37,809
water isn't splashing out out of any of

2771
01:48:36,338 --> 01:48:39,128
the inputs where they are they and put

2772
01:48:37,809 --> 01:48:40,359
our output slots where you plug it in

2773
01:48:39,128 --> 01:48:41,679
and where the air hose goes and stuff

2774
01:48:40,359 --> 01:48:44,199
like that just make sure the water

2775
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:45,519
hasn't evaporated or gotten too low and

2776
01:48:44,198 --> 01:48:47,498
you can mostly set it and forget about

2777
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:49,869
it until the clones are ready to

2778
01:48:47,498 --> 01:48:51,219
transplant if you're taking clones of

2779
01:48:49,868 --> 01:48:52,958
multiple strains make sure you figured

2780
01:48:51,219 --> 01:48:54,748
out a way to mark everything and

2781
01:48:52,958 --> 01:48:57,729
identify which clones you've taken

2782
01:48:54,748 --> 01:48:59,708
sometimes I'll just use a sticky label

2783
01:48:57,729 --> 01:49:02,199
and put a name on it and stick that in

2784
01:48:59,708 --> 01:49:05,019
the row or on the front to identify

2785
01:49:02,198 --> 01:49:07,029
which row those clones are sometimes I

2786
01:49:05,019 --> 01:49:09,458
use a cup and I cut it into small like a

2787
01:49:07,029 --> 01:49:11,288
Solo Cup and I cut it into strips like

2788
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:12,550
the size of a plant label and I write

2789
01:49:11,288 --> 01:49:15,219
the name on there and I just stick that

2790
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:16,449
in a little pac-man slot of the neoprene

2791
01:49:15,219 --> 01:49:17,948
you'll know what I mean when you play

2792
01:49:16,448 --> 01:49:19,418
with the neoprene by the pac-man slot

2793
01:49:17,948 --> 01:49:20,768
right in the mouth just put it in the

2794
01:49:19,418 --> 01:49:22,779
mouth there and then each clones label

2795
01:49:20,769 --> 01:49:24,099
be sure to to label your clones if

2796
01:49:22,779 --> 01:49:26,168
you're working with more than one strain

2797
01:49:24,099 --> 01:49:27,338
there's nothing like having a clone that

2798
01:49:26,168 --> 01:49:29,319
you're not sure what it is

2799
01:49:27,338 --> 01:49:30,969
you grow it out and you get to wait till

2800
01:49:29,319 --> 01:49:33,488
about day 30 or 40 to figure out what

2801
01:49:30,969 --> 01:49:35,139
you're working with sometimes alright

2802
01:49:33,488 --> 01:49:37,868
that should get you guys through the

2803
01:49:35,139 --> 01:49:39,248
basics of using the ez cloner I feel

2804
01:49:37,868 --> 01:49:41,618
like I need to take a DAB and get a

2805
01:49:39,248 --> 01:49:43,238
beverage right quick again I hope you

2806
01:49:41,618 --> 01:49:45,128
guys join me and take a quick dab and

2807
01:49:43,238 --> 01:49:47,049
then I'll be back with a the lesson on

2808
01:49:45,128 --> 01:49:51,338
how to use the tray and doe method hang

2809
01:49:47,050 --> 01:49:53,769
in there I'll be right back yeah through

2810
01:49:51,338 --> 01:49:55,748
the magic of editing I am back already

2811
01:49:53,769 --> 01:49:57,128
so the Train dough method that we were

2812
01:49:55,748 --> 01:49:58,179
talking about will require a little more

2813
01:49:57,128 --> 01:49:59,378
attention you'll have to pay more

2814
01:49:58,179 --> 01:50:01,418
attention you'll have to check on it

2815
01:49:59,378 --> 01:50:04,510
you'll have to keep the humidity high in

2816
01:50:01,418 --> 01:50:06,279
there you will need to set up your heat

2817
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:08,050
mat and a timer or thermostat

2818
01:50:06,279 --> 01:50:11,708
don't let the clones get too hot just

2819
01:50:08,050 --> 01:50:14,229
about 75 degrees is right aim for 70%

2820
01:50:11,708 --> 01:50:15,220
humidity set the tray on top of your

2821
01:50:14,229 --> 01:50:16,960
heat mat

2822
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:19,510
I've used everything from Rockwell cubes

2823
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:21,189
to rapid Reuters to every brand of root

2824
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:22,989
cubes there are most of them work the

2825
01:50:21,189 --> 01:50:25,750
same get what you like or whatever is

2826
01:50:22,988 --> 01:50:27,579
available to you Rockwell is simple and

2827
01:50:25,750 --> 01:50:28,750
it's inert so that's a good way to start

2828
01:50:27,579 --> 01:50:30,159
there are no nutrients and they're not

2829
01:50:28,750 --> 01:50:32,409
like the ones that don't have nutrients

2830
01:50:30,159 --> 01:50:34,149
in them I now take whatever you selected

2831
01:50:32,409 --> 01:50:37,449
and soak it in water that's been pH day

2832
01:50:34,149 --> 01:50:39,099
at six point oh like you use Rockwell

2833
01:50:37,449 --> 01:50:40,779
cubes so be sure to soak those things

2834
01:50:39,100 --> 01:50:42,039
thoroughly they like to float and they

2835
01:50:40,779 --> 01:50:44,380
don't absorb the water they just float

2836
01:50:42,039 --> 01:50:46,479
sometimes so I fill a five-gallon bucket

2837
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:47,980
with water and I drop all my cubes in

2838
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:49,089
there and I let them soak I pull them

2839
01:50:47,979 --> 01:50:51,429
out one at a time and set them in the

2840
01:50:49,090 --> 01:50:53,170
tray you're gonna select your cutting

2841
01:50:51,430 --> 01:50:54,520
the same way as you did before you'll

2842
01:50:53,170 --> 01:50:57,039
take the cuttings the same way you'll

2843
01:50:54,520 --> 01:51:00,070
need to cut a nice angle at the tip make

2844
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:01,569
a nice long angle because that area that

2845
01:51:00,069 --> 01:51:03,519
exposed areas where the root tips will

2846
01:51:01,569 --> 01:51:05,319
start to develop so have a cup of

2847
01:51:03,520 --> 01:51:08,470
cuttings and a nice with nice angled

2848
01:51:05,319 --> 01:51:09,670
cuts on the tips one at a time get those

2849
01:51:08,470 --> 01:51:11,110
into the dip and growing different girl

2850
01:51:09,670 --> 01:51:12,550
you just have to dip it right into there

2851
01:51:11,109 --> 01:51:14,079
you don't have to leave it in there so

2852
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:15,550
just dip it in there and then gently

2853
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:18,279
slide your cutting right into that

2854
01:51:15,550 --> 01:51:20,440
rockwool cube do not go directly into

2855
01:51:18,279 --> 01:51:21,789
the bottle of dip and grow pour some of

2856
01:51:20,439 --> 01:51:23,289
the different grow out into a shot glass

2857
01:51:21,789 --> 01:51:25,238
or something similar you don't want to

2858
01:51:23,289 --> 01:51:27,670
contaminate that whole bottle if one of

2859
01:51:25,238 --> 01:51:28,869
your plants has a problem and you put it

2860
01:51:27,670 --> 01:51:30,699
into that dip and grow now you just

2861
01:51:28,869 --> 01:51:32,079
infected the whole bottle whatever kind

2862
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:35,079
of dip cloning solution you're gonna use

2863
01:51:32,079 --> 01:51:36,189
that may work in a dipping Road I think

2864
01:51:35,079 --> 01:51:37,479
it's got a little bit of alcohol in

2865
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:39,939
there but still we don't want to risk it

2866
01:51:37,479 --> 01:51:41,639
all right I'd be careful not to bend or

2867
01:51:39,939 --> 01:51:43,960
break your cutting if you feel it snap

2868
01:51:41,640 --> 01:51:45,489
you can cut the broken part off if it's

2869
01:51:43,960 --> 01:51:46,689
still long enough and try to redo Pitre

2870
01:51:45,488 --> 01:51:48,189
stick it but I would just take another

2871
01:51:46,689 --> 01:51:49,719
cutting if you have it around

2872
01:51:48,189 --> 01:51:51,669
don't waste space with one you're not

2873
01:51:49,720 --> 01:51:53,170
certain is gonna work try to get your

2874
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:55,690
cutting about a half inch or more down

2875
01:51:53,170 --> 01:51:56,949
into the rockwool cube if you can once

2876
01:51:55,689 --> 01:51:58,329
you've finished cutting and dipping and

2877
01:51:56,949 --> 01:52:00,699
sticking the cuttings you can put the

2878
01:51:58,329 --> 01:52:03,670
dome over the tray I leave the events

2879
01:52:00,699 --> 01:52:05,139
mostly closed I leave them just a little

2880
01:52:03,670 --> 01:52:06,550
tiny bit open to let some air flow on

2881
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:08,200
the sides if you have side vents but I

2882
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:09,909
leave all those top events closed

2883
01:52:08,199 --> 01:52:12,250
I'll even close for a day or two and let

2884
01:52:09,909 --> 01:52:14,109
that humidity build up in there put them

2885
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:15,880
under the light that's always on and let

2886
01:52:14,109 --> 01:52:19,299
them take root t5 lights are perfect for

2887
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:20,710
this LEDs are good also be sure to check

2888
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:22,029
the humidity in the tamper every few

2889
01:52:20,710 --> 01:52:23,079
hours and make sure the cubes are moist

2890
01:52:22,029 --> 01:52:25,090
and never dry

2891
01:52:23,079 --> 01:52:26,619
if those rockwool cubes or whatever kind

2892
01:52:25,090 --> 01:52:27,719
of rooters you're using if those become

2893
01:52:26,619 --> 01:52:29,069
too dry

2894
01:52:27,719 --> 01:52:31,079
the clothes will die so make sure you

2895
01:52:29,069 --> 01:52:32,698
pay attention I had about two weeks

2896
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:35,309
hopefully you'll have happy clones that

2897
01:52:32,698 --> 01:52:37,349
are ready for transplanting I feel like

2898
01:52:35,310 --> 01:52:39,270
I've gone over the basics of using the

2899
01:52:37,350 --> 01:52:40,590
dome and tray method I honestly haven't

2900
01:52:39,270 --> 01:52:42,930
done that for quite a while since I've

2901
01:52:40,590 --> 01:52:45,239
gotten the EZ cloners I haven't looked

2902
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:46,710
back that's the only way to go when I do

2903
01:52:45,238 --> 01:52:48,539
it right and I pay attention and I keep

2904
01:52:46,710 --> 01:52:50,640
everything clean I get about a 99 to

2905
01:52:48,539 --> 01:52:53,279
100% success rate using my any easy

2906
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:54,270
cloners they come out with big fat roots

2907
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:56,670
and they're nice and healthy and ready

2908
01:52:54,270 --> 01:52:57,989
to go so that's the way I do it if I

2909
01:52:56,670 --> 01:53:00,390
skipped anything or if I said anything

2910
01:52:57,988 --> 01:53:01,948
that you felt was off please feel free

2911

2912
01:53:01,948 --> 01:53:06,839

2937
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:56,840
somebody who I feel has been crucial or

2938
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:00,029
beneficial or instrumental to our

2939
01:53:56,840 --> 01:54:01,440
cannabis movement and/or industry this

2940

2941
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:06,689
nice lady named brownie Mary Jane

2942
01:54:03,600 --> 01:54:09,210
Rathbun this article comes from paper

2943
01:54:06,689 --> 01:54:11,369
mag comm they actually wrote an article

2944
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:14,310
called ten historic heroes of marijuana

2945
01:54:11,369 --> 01:54:16,019
legalization by Abdullah t-kid Saeed I

2946

2947
01:54:16,020 --> 01:54:22,770
great article we're going to give thanks

2948
01:54:19,140 --> 01:54:24,480
to Mary Jane Rathbun I made her buzzword

2949
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:26,160
in state medical marijuana efforts as

2950
01:54:24,479 --> 01:54:27,779
compassion seeing the relief that

2951
01:54:26,159 --> 01:54:29,639
cannabis can bring to severely ill

2952
01:54:27,779 --> 01:54:32,309
patients makes the laws restricting them

2953
01:54:29,640 --> 01:54:35,130
seem cruel and unjust the highly

2954
01:54:32,310 --> 01:54:37,110
publicized story of brownie Mary was one

2955
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:39,600
of the first to inspire this sentiment

2956
01:54:37,109 --> 01:54:41,259
as a hospital volunteer she distributed

2957
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:43,510
weed brownies to AIDS patients

2958
01:54:41,260 --> 01:54:45,699
on the sly when she got busted for it

2959
01:54:43,510 --> 01:54:47,470
the public was on her side who can get

2960
01:54:45,699 --> 01:54:48,369
mad at a sweet old lady giving brownies

2961
01:54:47,470 --> 01:54:50,260

2962

2963
01:54:50,260 --> 01:54:54,070
her life dedicated to Cherry charity

2964
01:54:52,060 --> 01:54:56,490
work and was instrumental in the passage

2965

too afraid to ask

3105
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:07,909

02:03:00,649 --> 02:03:03,759
we're gonna talk about putting those

3168
02:03:01,788 --> 02:03:06,259
clones we cut last week into some dirt

3169
02:03:03,760 --> 02:03:08,090
but first we're gonna read some news let

3170
02:03:06,260 --> 02:03:10,460
me take a DAB real quick and we will be

3171
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:12,329
right back with a few cool news reports

3172
02:03:10,460 --> 02:03:14,199
hang tight

3173
02:03:12,329 --> 02:03:15,939
[Music]

3174
02:03:14,199 --> 02:03:17,349
all right before we get into the news I

3175
02:03:15,939 --> 02:03:19,449
want to do our first product review on

3176
02:03:17,350 --> 02:03:20,940
the show our good friends at Mary Jane's

3177
02:03:19,449 --> 02:03:23,619
glass haberdasher in Pueblo Colorado

3178
02:03:20,939 --> 02:03:26,409
we're kind enough to give me the cloud

3179
02:03:23,619 --> 02:03:28,930
poor cloud tank m2 to review on the show

3180
02:03:26,409 --> 02:03:30,639
it's a handy little dab pen I've been

3181
02:03:28,930 --> 02:03:31,960
smoking some lemon Jeffry out of it for

3182
02:03:30,640 --> 02:03:34,030
about a week and a half now

3183
02:03:31,960 --> 02:03:36,189
it hasn't burned out on me yet which is

3184
02:03:34,029 --> 02:03:38,590
actually pretty impressive for most dab

3185
02:03:36,189 --> 02:03:40,719
pins it gave me the Viking battery to

3186
02:03:38,590 --> 02:03:43,750
attach to it they said any battery of

3187
02:03:40,720 --> 02:03:47,050
this voltage will work the next part is

3188
02:03:43,750 --> 02:03:49,119
actually the cloupor tank it fits into

3189
02:03:47,050 --> 02:03:50,500
the is actually the cloud poor body it

3190
02:03:49,119 --> 02:03:53,409
fits right under the battery it just

3191
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:55,060
screws in the next part is the heating

3192
02:03:53,409 --> 02:03:56,500
element so if that part dies you can

3193
02:03:55,060 --> 02:03:58,840
just unscrew the heating element and

3194
02:03:56,500 --> 02:04:01,210
replace it the next part is the tank

3195
02:03:58,840 --> 02:04:02,739
where the your extracts your

3196
02:04:01,210 --> 02:04:04,149
concentrates will go in I've got lemon

3197
02:04:02,739 --> 02:04:06,670
Jeffrey in here now it tastes delicious

3198
02:04:04,149 --> 02:04:08,920
out of this thing so you put your

3199
02:04:06,670 --> 02:04:11,890
concentrate in you screw on the cap and

3200
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:13,390
then it's got this it's like a dome but

3201
02:04:11,890 --> 02:04:14,980
it's just a straight cylinder so it's

3202
02:04:13,390 --> 02:04:16,329
got a cylinder dome that fits on top of

3203
02:04:14,979 --> 02:04:18,549
that piece over the tank and then it's

3204
02:04:16,329 --> 02:04:19,869
got a mouthpiece now what I really do

3205
02:04:18,550 --> 02:04:22,420
like is they claim that this is all

3206
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:23,920
titanium and that the heating element is

3207
02:04:22,420 --> 02:04:26,260
ceramic which is really cool because

3208
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:28,210
what I don't like about a lot of these

3209
02:04:26,260 --> 02:04:30,460
dab pins is the plastic II taste that

3210
02:04:28,210 --> 02:04:31,720
they get and I'm sure because they do

3211
02:04:30,460 --> 02:04:33,460
have that feature where if you hit the

3212
02:04:31,720 --> 02:04:35,650
button for 15 seconds or 10 seconds

3213
02:04:33,460 --> 02:04:37,119
whatever it turns off right but we've

3214
02:04:35,649 --> 02:04:38,979
learned that trick so you just hold it

3215
02:04:37,119 --> 02:04:40,479
down for one second last let it go and

3216
02:04:38,979 --> 02:04:42,579
then start over again so that you can

3217
02:04:40,479 --> 02:04:44,619
keep heating that [ __ ] right but I've

3218
02:04:42,579 --> 02:04:46,449
tasted those dab pins melting while I'm

3219
02:04:44,619 --> 02:04:48,880
dabbing or while my buddy dabbed it too

3220
02:04:46,449 --> 02:04:50,439
long or whichever one of us overheated

3221
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:51,850
it I could taste the plastic this one

3222
02:04:50,439 --> 02:04:54,189
I've been heating the [ __ ] out of it I

3223
02:04:51,850 --> 02:04:55,480
haven't tasted any plastic yet it did

3224
02:04:54,189 --> 02:04:57,669
get clogged up one time but it was

3225
02:04:55,479 --> 02:04:59,109
really easy for me to get it clean I've

3226
02:04:57,670 --> 02:05:01,210
had two other vape pens that I've

3227
02:04:59,109 --> 02:05:03,639
clogged up and once they got clogged

3228
02:05:01,210 --> 02:05:05,409
they worked done it does have a dry herb

3229
02:05:03,640 --> 02:05:07,030
attachment available but I did not ask

3230
02:05:05,409 --> 02:05:09,279
for that I told her I wouldn't use it I

3231
02:05:07,029 --> 02:05:11,859
don't like to smoke herb out of a little

3232
02:05:09,279 --> 02:05:13,689
pen that seems silly to me I would have

3233
02:05:11,859 --> 02:05:17,529
to smoke that have to fill that thing 25

3234
02:05:13,689 --> 02:05:19,779
times to get the effect I need but I'm

3235
02:05:17,529 --> 02:05:22,239
gonna go and give it four stars or four

3236
02:05:19,779 --> 02:05:24,039
leaves out of five because it's a

3237
02:05:22,239 --> 02:05:26,319
reliable product it's lasted me two

3238
02:05:24,039 --> 02:05:27,489
weeks now it stays charged and charges

3239
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:29,170
quickly it holds

3240
02:05:27,489 --> 02:05:33,969
enough extract for me to do what I need

3241
02:05:29,170 --> 02:05:36,369
to do I haven't broken it yet it doesn't

3242
02:05:33,970 --> 02:05:38,860
taste bad the only thing is it could hit

3243
02:05:36,369 --> 02:05:40,989
a little harder like I feel like if they

3244
02:05:38,859 --> 02:05:42,549
made these little holes larger or if

3245
02:05:40,989 --> 02:05:45,159
they gave me a little bit more heat I'd

3246
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:46,390
get more of a dab it takes you get a

3247
02:05:45,159 --> 02:05:48,250
certain amount of time of heat on this

3248
02:05:46,390 --> 02:05:50,020
thing and then it cuts off and I feel

3249
02:05:48,250 --> 02:05:51,489
like if I preheat it if I hold it down

3250
02:05:50,020 --> 02:05:53,530
for half of the time like I'm holding it

3251
02:05:51,489 --> 02:05:58,569
now and then I let go and then I

3252
02:05:53,529 --> 02:06:01,750
actually go back and hit it that's the

3253
02:05:58,569 --> 02:06:03,309
way to get a fat head out of it but I've

3254
02:06:01,750 --> 02:06:05,680
learned it I like it so I'm gonna give

3255
02:06:03,310 --> 02:06:06,910
it four pot leaves out of five I want to

3256

3298
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:51,050
relating to ganja these relate to

3299
02:07:49,309 --> 02:07:53,239

private places and the use of ganja for

3302
02:07:55,639 --> 02:07:59,538
medical medicinal purposes he said

3303
02:07:57,340 --> 02:08:01,340
approval has been given also to a

3304
02:07:59,538 --> 02:08:03,139
proposal for the decriminalization of

3305
02:08:01,340 --> 02:08:05,690
the use of ganja for religious purposes

3306
02:08:03,139 --> 02:08:07,699
he said so they're doing their laws even

3307
02:08:05,689 --> 02:08:09,828
better than Colorado did because in

3308
02:08:07,698 --> 02:08:11,658
Jamaica you don't have to get cancer or

3309
02:08:09,828 --> 02:08:13,819
get in a car wreck or claim that

3310
02:08:11,658 --> 02:08:15,198
something hurts or walk funny you can

3311
02:08:13,819 --> 02:08:16,908
just go in and say that it's for

3312
02:08:15,198 --> 02:08:19,149
religious purposes and you just grow

3313
02:08:16,908 --> 02:08:23,058
some dreadlocks and get your weed Oh

3314
02:08:19,149 --> 02:08:24,589
Jamaica alright Uruguay recently became

3315
02:08:23,059 --> 02:08:26,449
the latest country to legalize marijuana

3316
02:08:24,590 --> 02:08:29,510
use joining several countries in Europe

3317
02:08:26,448 --> 02:08:32,118
as well as the United States of God okay

3318
02:08:29,510 --> 02:08:33,800
they just worded this one funny the US

3319
02:08:32,118 --> 02:08:35,779
states of Colorado and Washington I

3320
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:37,969
thought they were gonna call Colorado in

3321
02:08:35,779 --> 02:08:39,979
Washington our own states but they just

3322
02:08:37,969 --> 02:08:41,149
weren't that oddly so possession of

3323
02:08:39,979 --> 02:08:42,709
small quantities of the drug would

3324
02:08:41,149 --> 02:08:44,328
become a non arrest able tickle

3325
02:08:42,710 --> 02:08:45,980
infraction in Jamaica resulting in a

3326
02:08:44,328 --> 02:08:47,420
fine Golding said

3327
02:08:45,979 --> 02:08:49,969
and here's why they did it which i think

3328
02:08:47,420 --> 02:08:51,109
is kind of great they say too many of

3329
02:08:49,970 --> 02:08:52,760
our young people have ended up with

3330
02:08:51,109 --> 02:08:54,679
criminal convictions after being caught

3331
02:08:52,760 --> 02:08:56,329
with the spliff something that has

3332
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:58,280
affected their ability to do things like

3333
02:08:56,329 --> 02:09:00,800
get jobs and get visas to travel

3334
02:08:58,279 --> 02:09:02,630
overseas bolding said he added that the

3335
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:03,980
government would propose a bill in the

3336
02:09:02,630 --> 02:09:05,690
Jamaican Parliament soon that will

3337
02:09:03,979 --> 02:09:07,159
expose the criminal records of people

3338
02:09:05,689 --> 02:09:09,169
convicted for possession of small

3339
02:09:07,159 --> 02:09:12,409
amounts of the drug which has grown

3340
02:09:09,170 --> 02:09:14,420
widely across Jamaica the change change

3341
02:09:12,409 --> 02:09:16,340
means that a person cannot be arrested

3342
02:09:14,420 --> 02:09:19,460
if he has in his possession of to fill

3343
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:22,640
up to fifty seven grams of ganja in

3344
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:25,579
public space anyone ticketed will be

3345
02:09:22,640 --> 02:09:27,500
given 30 days to pay the fine failure of

3346
02:09:25,579 --> 02:09:29,600
which will result in becoming a minor

3347
02:09:27,500 --> 02:09:31,479
offence resulting in the offender doing

3348
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:33,800
court-ordered community service

3349
02:09:31,479 --> 02:09:35,719
according to Golding possession of ganja

3350
02:09:33,800 --> 02:09:37,039
for religious or therapeutic purposes as

3351
02:09:35,720 --> 02:09:39,380
prescribed by a registered medical

3352
02:09:37,039 --> 02:09:42,140
practitioner or for scientific research

3353
02:09:39,380 --> 02:09:45,739
by an accredited institution will also

3354
02:09:42,140 --> 02:09:48,680
be decriminalized so big up to Jamaica

3355
02:09:45,738 --> 02:09:49,759
shout out much love much respect they're

3356
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:51,500
doing the right thing it looks like

3357
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:53,770
there's nothing in there that I wanted

3358
02:09:51,500 --> 02:09:55,789
to argue with they're gonna let you have

3359

3360
02:09:55,789 --> 02:10:02,000

3363
02:10:04,399 --> 02:10:08,479

3364
02:10:06,229 --> 02:10:09,979
just get a ticket now and they're doing

3365
02:10:08,479 --> 02:10:11,479
it for the right reasons that they don't

3366
02:10:09,979 --> 02:10:15,139
want if they keep [ __ ] up the youth

3367
02:10:11,479 --> 02:10:16,369
for small things like cannabis and then

3368
02:10:15,140 --> 02:10:17,810

legislation 113 to 13 early Friday after

3386
02:10:54,260 --> 02:10:57,449

3390
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:04,829
bill would be voted on later in the day

3391
02:11:03,149 --> 02:11:07,079
when Republican lawmakers had reviewed

3392
02:11:04,829 --> 02:11:09,510
the legislation ski lows of Long Island

3393
02:11:07,079 --> 02:11:11,250
said he had planned to vote for the

3394
02:11:09,510 --> 02:11:12,930
measure and believed there were enough

3395
02:11:11,250 --> 02:11:13,640
votes to pass the bill in the upper

3396
02:11:12,930 --> 02:11:15,960
chamber

3397
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:17,640
anyway the so-called Compassionate Care

3398
02:11:15,960 --> 02:11:19,710
Act would legalize certain forms of

3399
02:11:17,640 --> 02:11:22,500
marijuana freezer for severely ill

3400
02:11:19,710 --> 02:11:24,390
patients the legislation does not allow

3401
02:11:22,500 --> 02:11:25,529
the drug to be sold in the platform or

3402
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:32,550
smoked but it can be administered

3403
02:11:25,529 --> 02:11:34,079
through a vapor or an oil base wait did

3404
02:11:32,550 --> 02:11:35,310
you guys catch that because I read this

3405
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:39,479
previously and I knew what I was getting

3406
02:11:35,310 --> 02:11:41,700
myself into cannot be sold in plant form

3407
02:11:39,479 --> 02:11:44,659
or smoked but it can be administered

3408
02:11:41,699 --> 02:11:47,039
through a vaporizer or an oil base

3409
02:11:44,659 --> 02:11:49,050
that's not medical marijuana you just

3410
02:11:47,039 --> 02:11:51,659
[ __ ] yourselves don't don't pass this

3411
02:11:49,050 --> 02:11:53,100
what do you do in New York all right I'm

3412
02:11:51,659 --> 02:11:54,930
gonna keep reading earlier in the

3413
02:11:53,100 --> 02:11:56,850
negotiations Governor Andrew Cuomo

3414
02:11:54,930 --> 02:11:58,230
sought to ban smoking the drug saying it

3415
02:11:56,850 --> 02:12:00,630
was wrong for the state to promote

3416
02:11:58,229 --> 02:12:02,189
smoking and then you have to balance the

3417
02:12:00,630 --> 02:12:04,140
needs of many of the patients and the

3418
02:12:02,189 --> 02:12:06,329
truth is we're coming to a point where

3419
02:12:04,140 --> 02:12:09,210
less and less people smoke anyway said

3420
02:12:06,329 --> 02:12:10,949
bill sponsor senator Diane Savino is

3421
02:12:09,210 --> 02:12:12,930
Staten Island Democrat on Thursday

3422
02:12:10,949 --> 02:12:15,630
marijuana could be scribed for at least

3423
02:12:12,930 --> 02:12:17,640
ten diseases including epilepsy AIDS ALS

3424
02:12:15,630 --> 02:12:19,260
and neuropathy under the direction of

3425
02:12:17,640 --> 02:12:20,579
the state's Health Department the health

3426
02:12:19,260 --> 02:12:23,579
commissioner would be able to add more

3427
02:12:20,579 --> 02:12:25,890
illnesses if approved by the legislature

3428
02:12:23,579 --> 02:12:28,500
the bill would allow the program to

3429
02:12:25,890 --> 02:12:30,090
start as soon as 18 months Oh in as soon

3430
02:12:28,500 --> 02:12:32,010
as 18 months and would allow a governor

3431
02:12:30,090 --> 02:12:33,500
to terminated under advice from the

3432
02:12:32,010 --> 02:12:36,840
Health Department or law enforcement

3433
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:39,420
what the [ __ ] is that if it's approved

3434
02:12:36,840 --> 02:12:42,659
it could start in 18 months but if a

3435
02:12:39,420 --> 02:12:45,690
governor or the health department or law

3436
02:12:42,659 --> 02:12:47,819
enforcement decide that they want to

3437
02:12:45,689 --> 02:12:48,919
shut it down they can so you guys are

3438
02:12:47,819 --> 02:12:51,599
[ __ ] up over there in New York

3439
02:12:48,920 --> 02:12:52,949
Medical Marijuana has the capacity to do

3440
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:55,200
a lot of good for a lot of people who

3441
02:12:52,949 --> 02:12:56,489
are in pain who are suffering and are in

3442
02:12:55,199 --> 02:12:58,590
desperate need of treatment that can

3443
02:12:56,489 --> 02:13:00,609
provide relief Cuomo said during a news

3444
02:12:58,590 --> 02:13:02,140
conference with lawmakers

3445
02:13:00,609 --> 02:13:04,779
sounds like somebody wrote that [ __ ] out

3446
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:06,340
for her really well doctors that have to

3447
02:13:04,779 --> 02:13:07,689
undergo training to be eligible to

3448
02:13:06,340 --> 02:13:09,970
prescribe the drug and could face a

3449
02:13:07,689 --> 02:13:11,649
felony charge punishable by up to four

3450
02:13:09,970 --> 02:13:15,130
years of prison if they write fraudulent

3451
02:13:11,649 --> 02:13:16,719
prescriptions the bill does not require

3452
02:13:15,130 --> 02:13:17,859
insurance companies to cover the cost of

3453
02:13:16,720 --> 02:13:19,180
the drug of course not

3454
02:13:17,859 --> 02:13:21,699
patients who sell their prescribed

3455
02:13:19,180 --> 02:13:23,680
marijuana could face misdemeanor charge

3456
02:13:21,699 --> 02:13:25,000
patients will be required to carry a

3457
02:13:23,680 --> 02:13:27,490
registration card showing they're

3458
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:31,000
authorized to possess the drug can be

3459
02:13:27,489 --> 02:13:32,559
subscribe' a maximum 30-day supply so

3460
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:35,409
who's gonna decide what a 30-day supply

3461
02:13:32,560 --> 02:13:37,060
is New York you've done [ __ ] up dude

3462
02:13:35,409 --> 02:13:39,819
this is not right the more I read this

3463
02:13:37,060 --> 02:13:41,800
stupid or you sound five registered

3464
02:13:39,819 --> 02:13:43,630
growing organizations will be allowed up

3465
02:13:41,800 --> 02:13:46,029

3466

I like monopolizing already with the

3469
02:13:50,829 --> 02:13:54,729
counties with the counties where the

3470
02:13:52,899 --> 02:13:56,920
marijuana is grown and sold receiving

3471
02:13:54,729 --> 02:13:58,750
revenue from an excise tax under the

3472
02:13:56,920 --> 02:14:02,199
stipulation cultivators must grow the

3473
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:03,670
drug indoors in a secure facility Cuomo

3474
02:14:02,199 --> 02:14:06,250
was initially opposed to medical

3475
02:14:03,670 --> 02:14:08,500
marijuana earlier and his term but

3476
02:14:06,250 --> 02:14:10,390
proposed a pilot program in January to

3477
02:14:08,500 --> 02:14:12,609
allow up to 20 hospitals statewide to

3478
02:14:10,390 --> 02:14:14,740
administer the drug initially wanted a

3479
02:14:12,609 --> 02:14:17,469
five-year sunset period to evaluate the

3480
02:14:14,739 --> 02:14:22,840
new program but negotiations extended

3481
02:14:17,470 --> 02:14:25,659

for marijuana

3498
02:15:02,769 --> 02:15:07,130
to policies to provide water for growing

3499
02:15:05,418 --> 02:15:08,658
marijuana within city limits and in

3500
02:15:07,130 --> 02:15:10,969
Pueblo County will be considered today

3501
02:15:08,658 --> 02:15:12,859
by the Pueblo Board of Water Works the

3502
02:15:10,969 --> 02:15:16,729
Water Board meets at 2 p.m. at the Allen

3503
02:15:12,859 --> 02:15:19,609
C Hamel Administration Building 319 West

3504
02:15:16,729 --> 02:15:21,439
4th Street two resolutions have been

3505
02:15:19,609 --> 02:15:23,658
drafted for consideration by the board

3506
02:15:21,439 --> 02:15:25,789
one for supplying treated water within

3507
02:15:23,658 --> 02:15:27,648
pueblo city limits and the other to

3508
02:15:25,788 --> 02:15:29,538
leasing raw water within Pueblo County

3509
02:15:27,649 --> 02:15:32,539
both types of water sales would be

3510
02:15:29,538 --> 02:15:34,188
subject to changes in federal law the

3511
02:15:32,538 --> 02:15:35,809
resolutions are an attempt to work with

3512
02:15:34,189 --> 02:15:37,999
the Bureau of Reclamation's temporary

3513
02:15:35,809 --> 02:15:39,590
policy which prohibits using federal

3514
02:15:37,998 --> 02:15:41,840
facilities such as lake pueblo to

3515
02:15:39,590 --> 02:15:43,668
provide water to grow marijuana it

3516
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:45,139
excludes water not under federal

3517
02:15:43,668 --> 02:15:48,408
contract that is commingled with

3518
02:15:45,139 --> 02:15:51,199
contract water the policy issued in May

3519
02:15:48,408 --> 02:15:53,058
also requires lekha Maine reclamation to

3520
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:54,888
notify the Department of Justice if its

3521
02:15:53,059 --> 02:15:56,679
employees learn water from a federal

3522
02:15:54,889 --> 02:15:58,519
facility as being used to grow marijuana

3523
02:15:56,679 --> 02:16:01,519
we talked about this in a previous

3524
02:15:58,519 --> 02:16:03,679
episode although medical marijuana was

3525
02:16:01,519 --> 02:16:05,748
approved by Colorado voters in 2000 and

3526
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:08,269
recreational marijuana passed in 2012

3527
02:16:05,748 --> 02:16:11,118
drowing marijuana remains a federal

3528
02:16:08,269 --> 02:16:12,949
crime under the proposed resolutions the

3529
02:16:11,118 --> 02:16:14,328
bubble aboard the Pueblo water board

3530
02:16:12,948 --> 02:16:16,098
would not sell any water with the

3531
02:16:14,328 --> 02:16:18,049
federal Lincoln in the supply chain to

3532
02:16:16,099 --> 02:16:21,110
marijuana growers but it would sell

3533
02:16:18,050 --> 02:16:24,260
water from its direct flow rights below

3534
02:16:21,109 --> 02:16:26,359
pueblo dam to the pot industry the

3535
02:16:24,260 --> 02:16:27,949
resolution to the city use water would

3536
02:16:26,359 --> 02:16:29,779
revise the water board's policy to

3537
02:16:27,948 --> 02:16:34,099
change the use of water based on federal

3538
02:16:29,779 --> 02:16:35,388
policy it also clarifies that sentence

3539
02:16:34,099 --> 02:16:36,738
is what that says it didn't make sense

3540
02:16:35,388 --> 02:16:38,629
when I read it but I stopped and read it

3541
02:16:36,738 --> 02:16:40,250
again and it made sense the resolution

3542
02:16:38,629 --> 02:16:41,959
to use city water would revise the

3543
02:16:40,250 --> 02:16:44,290
board's policy to change the use of

3544
02:16:41,959 --> 02:16:45,579
water based on federal policy

3545
02:16:44,290 --> 02:16:46,690
they just like to write a bunch of

3546
02:16:45,579 --> 02:16:48,700
[ __ ] to make it sound like the

3547
02:16:46,690 --> 02:16:50,110
writing stuff it also clarifies that

3548
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:51,460
some of the water rights owned by the

3549
02:16:50,110 --> 02:16:53,920
water board are not subject to federal

3550
02:16:51,459 --> 02:16:55,869
policy however the policy leaves open

3551
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:58,360
the possibility of terminating water use

3552
02:16:55,870 --> 02:17:00,450
for marijuana if federal policy changes

3553
02:16:58,360 --> 02:17:02,650
it's all about policy check your policy

3554
02:17:00,450 --> 02:17:05,740
under the second resolution the water

3555
02:17:02,649 --> 02:17:07,989
board would make up to 800 acre feet two

3556
02:17:05,739 --> 02:17:09,789
hundred and sixty million gallons of raw

3557
02:17:07,989 --> 02:17:12,190
water available to marijuana growers in

3558
02:17:09,790 --> 02:17:14,380
Pueblo County annually through leases

3559
02:17:12,190 --> 02:17:16,090
that potentially can provide up to five

3560
02:17:14,379 --> 02:17:18,159
hundred thousand dollars in revenue each

3561
02:17:16,090 --> 02:17:19,870
year using the current rate of six

3562
02:17:18,159 --> 02:17:22,239
hundred and thirty dollars per acre-foot

3563
02:17:19,870 --> 02:17:23,650
it also contains a provision to cancel

3564
02:17:22,239 --> 02:17:26,049
contracts based on federal policy

3565
02:17:23,649 --> 02:17:27,940
changes and stipulates that the water

3566
02:17:26,049 --> 02:17:30,369
board is not required to negotiate or

3567
02:17:27,940 --> 02:17:32,050
approve any water lease the city of

3568
02:17:30,370 --> 02:17:34,179
Pueblo has regulations for medical

3569
02:17:32,049 --> 02:17:35,729
marijuana and for growing manufacturing

3570
02:17:34,179 --> 02:17:38,770
and testing recreational marijuana

3571
02:17:35,729 --> 02:17:40,959
webelo County has regulations that allow

3572
02:17:38,770 --> 02:17:44,500
medical marijuana as well as growing and

3573
02:17:40,959 --> 02:17:45,759
selling recreational marijuana so

3574
02:17:44,500 --> 02:17:50,260
there's one part here that got my

3575
02:17:45,760 --> 02:17:52,690
attention it also prevent contains a

3576
02:17:50,260 --> 02:17:54,550
provision to cancel contracts based on a

3577
02:17:52,690 --> 02:17:56,860
federal policy based on federal policy

3578
02:17:54,549 --> 02:17:58,808
changes and stipulates here's the [ __ ]

3579
02:17:56,860 --> 02:18:00,909
up part that the waterboard is not

3580
02:17:58,808 --> 02:18:04,000
required to negotiate or approve any

3581
02:18:00,909 --> 02:18:06,729
water lease so if one day they decide

3582
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,190
water is now $900 per acre-foot guess

3583
02:18:06,729 --> 02:18:12,308
what they are not required to negotiate

3584
02:18:09,190 --> 02:18:14,559
or approve any water lease you guys

3585
02:18:12,308 --> 02:18:15,699
wonder people will often complain that

3586
02:18:14,558 --> 02:18:16,959
marijuana is too expensive that

3587
02:18:15,700 --> 02:18:18,429
high-grade cannabis is too expensive

3588
02:18:16,959 --> 02:18:20,789
that the shops are charging too much

3589
02:18:18,429 --> 02:18:25,000
this is the reason why [ __ ] like this

3590
02:18:20,790 --> 02:18:26,469
they every time and I'm experienced in

3591
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,899
this I have seen this I was a part of

3592
02:18:26,468 --> 02:18:31,119
this every time i dispensary I was part

3593
02:18:28,899 --> 02:18:33,399
of the wild wild west I had I was a big

3594
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:35,770
part of the very first dispensary in

3595
02:18:33,399 --> 02:18:37,959
city limits in Pueblo there were no

3596
02:18:35,770 --> 02:18:40,000
dispensaries in the city limits of this

3597
02:18:37,959 --> 02:18:42,399
town when I had a shop with some friends

3598
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:43,989
they had a shop started I helped him get

3599
02:18:42,399 --> 02:18:47,020
it going one day they got tired of it

3600
02:18:43,989 --> 02:18:49,379
handed me the keys then one day the

3601
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:51,250
police came in and closed us down but

3602
02:18:49,379 --> 02:18:52,509
every time we would get our [ __ ]

3603
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:53,888
together they'd say here's your next

3604
02:18:52,510 --> 02:18:55,960
turtle we would jump through that hurdle

3605
02:18:53,888 --> 02:18:58,079
and then they'd go oh these guys can

3606
02:18:55,959 --> 02:18:59,518
jump high let's give them a really high

3607
02:18:58,079 --> 02:19:02,069
so they put us up another hurdle

3608
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:03,960
eventually we're playing hi Joe once we

3609
02:19:02,069 --> 02:19:05,670
got good at high jump then they wanted

3610
02:19:03,959 --> 02:19:06,869
to do more [ __ ] they wanted us to

3611
02:19:05,670 --> 02:19:09,299
javelin you know what I'm saying

3612
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:11,160
it I've seen it happen the dispensaries

3613
02:19:09,299 --> 02:19:12,750
went from a few rules to ridiculous

3614
02:19:11,159 --> 02:19:15,058
rules to everything being under camera

3615
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:16,648
everything being on lockdown and every

3616
02:19:15,058 --> 02:19:18,179
one of those steps cost more money and

3617
02:19:16,648 --> 02:19:19,439
more money and more money and I think

3618
02:19:18,179 --> 02:19:22,200
that's a lot of what they're doing it

3619
02:19:19,439 --> 02:19:24,210
for is for more money but that's the

3620
02:19:22,200 --> 02:19:25,860
stuff that's making the price of

3621
02:19:24,209 --> 02:19:27,839
cannabis stay where it is instead of

3622
02:19:25,860 --> 02:19:30,269
going down with the mass supply that we

3623
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:32,849
have provided we have to come up with

3624
02:19:30,269 --> 02:19:33,469
more money for water now we didn't think

3625
02:19:32,849 --> 02:19:35,519
about that

3626
02:19:33,468 --> 02:19:36,839
all right that's another rant that I

3627
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:37,319
just went off on glad you guys were a

3628
02:19:36,840 --> 02:19:38,639
part of it

3629
02:19:37,319 --> 02:19:40,590
feel like that was enough news for the

3630
02:19:38,638 --> 02:19:43,138
day you guys want to get into a grow

3631
02:19:40,590 --> 02:19:44,340
lesson right quick in the last episode

3632
02:19:43,138 --> 02:19:46,018
we took a bunch of clones

3633
02:19:44,340 --> 02:19:47,610
I probably rooted so we better learn how

3634
02:19:46,019 --> 02:19:49,469
to get him into dirt I'm gonna take a

3635
02:19:47,610 --> 02:20:01,770
couple of dabs you guys hang out and

3636
02:19:49,469 --> 02:20:03,478
I'll be right back all right in the last

3637
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:05,640
episode we talked about mother plants

3638
02:20:03,478 --> 02:20:07,228
and cutting clones those clones should

3639
02:20:05,639 --> 02:20:10,529
be rooted and ready to go into dirt now

3640
02:20:07,228 --> 02:20:12,269
or within the next few days potting

3641
02:20:10,530 --> 02:20:13,909
clones from the easy cloner and the rock

3642
02:20:12,270 --> 02:20:16,500
cool cubes will be pretty much the same

3643
02:20:13,909 --> 02:20:17,579
you'll need to be a little bit more

3644
02:20:16,500 --> 02:20:18,719
careful with the clones from the easy

3645
02:20:17,579 --> 02:20:20,879
cloner because they don't have anything

3646
02:20:18,719 --> 02:20:22,019
holding the roots in place so just be a

3647
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:25,379
little more careful they're kind of more

3648
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:27,030
delicate before I go too far I should

3649
02:20:25,379 --> 02:20:29,309
mention something noted to me by my

3650
02:20:27,030 --> 02:20:31,320
buddy cut proof cut proof does not use

3651
02:20:29,309 --> 02:20:33,569
mother plants cut proof uses his vegging

3652
02:20:31,319 --> 02:20:35,939
plants as his mother plants and takes

3653
02:20:33,569 --> 02:20:38,389
cutting us off of them two or three

3654
02:20:35,939 --> 02:20:41,790
weeks before he flowers his big plants

3655
02:20:38,389 --> 02:20:43,260
so that saves him some space if you're

3656
02:20:41,790 --> 02:20:45,390
only growing a few streams that's a

3657
02:20:43,260 --> 02:20:47,309
great idea some cool use that uses that

3658
02:20:45,389 --> 02:20:49,619
strategy I'm kind of thinking about

3659
02:20:47,309 --> 02:20:52,889
switching to it myself to make more room

3660
02:20:49,620 --> 02:20:54,420
available so instead of having a mother

3661
02:20:52,889 --> 02:20:55,680
plant that you take cuttings from and

3662
02:20:54,420 --> 02:20:57,510
then you grow those cuttings you just

3663
02:20:55,680 --> 02:21:00,720
have this plant that's been in veg for a

3664
02:20:57,510 --> 02:21:02,309
few weeks now and you just take 2 or 3 3

3665
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:04,019
or 4 cuttings off of it now you've got

3666
02:21:02,309 --> 02:21:05,549
your new mother plant and then you've

3667
02:21:04,020 --> 02:21:06,720
also got your next round of plants to

3668
02:21:05,549 --> 02:21:08,369
veg from there

3669
02:21:06,720 --> 02:21:10,380
so as long as you're confident in your

3670
02:21:08,370 --> 02:21:11,790
clone cutting wait a couple of weeks for

3671
02:21:10,380 --> 02:21:13,560
those clones to root or whatever and

3672
02:21:11,790 --> 02:21:14,910
then throw that plant into the flower

3673
02:21:13,560 --> 02:21:16,921
room and then you've got your next

3674
02:21:14,909 --> 02:21:19,500
mother as long as you take healthy cuts

3675
02:21:16,921 --> 02:21:21,149
I don't think there is any genetic loss

3676
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:22,829
they call it genetic drift I don't think

3677
02:21:21,149 --> 02:21:25,380
it happens if you were proper with your

3678
02:21:22,829 --> 02:21:28,229
plants we could probably talk a whole

3679
02:21:25,380 --> 02:21:29,671
nother episode about that one so back to

3680
02:21:28,229 --> 02:21:31,289
getting our clones into dirt make sure

3681
02:21:29,671 --> 02:21:32,761
your area is clean and try to wear

3682
02:21:31,290 --> 02:21:33,750
rubber gloves that's really important

3683
02:21:32,761 --> 02:21:35,761
because you're gonna have the roots out

3684
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:36,959
the roots are the most gentle part

3685
02:21:35,761 --> 02:21:38,881
anything they touch they will absorb

3686
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:40,289
keep that in mind don't go setting them

3687
02:21:38,880 --> 02:21:42,209
on some dirty [ __ ]

3688
02:21:40,290 --> 02:21:43,771
it's important to use good soil for your

3689
02:21:42,209 --> 02:21:45,600
plants I like happy frog or a light

3690
02:21:43,771 --> 02:21:47,820
warrior for my babies something that

3691
02:21:45,601 --> 02:21:50,431
allows a lot of oxygen into the root

3692
02:21:47,819 --> 02:21:51,659
zone is ideal I like to use a small

3693
02:21:50,431 --> 02:21:53,610
amount of nutrients when I put these

3694
02:21:51,659 --> 02:21:55,470
babies into dirt I make sure to add some

3695
02:21:53,610 --> 02:21:58,261
kind of root inoculant you want

3696
02:21:55,470 --> 02:22:00,989
something with lots of mica Raisa I use

3697
02:21:58,261 --> 02:22:03,000
a great use great white or OGT you can

3698
02:22:00,989 --> 02:22:05,761
get OGT at hydro pueblo we talked about

3699
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,310
them earlier Michels are beneficial

3700
02:22:05,761 --> 02:22:09,989
fungi that promote root growth you'll

3701
02:22:08,310 --> 02:22:11,851
definitely notice a difference in your

3702
02:22:09,989 --> 02:22:13,171
plants performance if you use them if

3703
02:22:11,851 --> 02:22:14,700
you use them in one plant don't use them

3704
02:22:13,171 --> 02:22:16,771
in another you'll be able to tell by the

3705
02:22:14,700 --> 02:22:18,511
root acceleration once the roots gets

3706
02:22:16,771 --> 02:22:20,730
bigger get bigger they can take more

3707
02:22:18,511 --> 02:22:23,399
nutrients just makes your plants grow

3708
02:22:20,729 --> 02:22:26,039
bigger better happier faster healthier

3709
02:22:23,399 --> 02:22:29,159
so I definitely recommend using some

3710
02:22:26,040 --> 02:22:31,710
mykos in your mix I also use a small

3711
02:22:29,159 --> 02:22:33,690
dose of veg nutrients for my transplants

3712
02:22:31,709 --> 02:22:36,840
right now I mix up a five-gallon bucket

3713
02:22:33,690 --> 02:22:38,640
of water with my great white and my bed

3714
02:22:36,841 --> 02:22:41,101
nutrients that I'm using for small

3715
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:43,171
plants I do use bottled nutrients I like

3716
02:22:41,101 --> 02:22:44,671
organic care for my babies so what makes

3717
02:22:43,171 --> 02:22:47,421
up some night treks and great white and

3718
02:22:44,671 --> 02:22:49,890
then just adjust it to 65 with my pH I

3719
02:22:47,421 --> 02:22:52,610
toss an airstone in the bucket and I let

3720
02:22:49,890 --> 02:22:55,859
that water get oxygenated while I start

3721
02:22:52,610 --> 02:22:58,021
getting my containers ready so for these

3722
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:59,489
small plants they're just little babies

3723
02:22:58,021 --> 02:23:02,221
we're gonna use Solo cups like a beer

3724
02:22:59,489 --> 02:23:03,931
cup don't use clear cups you don't want

3725
02:23:02,220 --> 02:23:06,329
your roots exposed to light I take a

3726
02:23:03,931 --> 02:23:07,921
solo cup and I cut plenty of drainage

3727
02:23:06,329 --> 02:23:09,659
holes at the bottom to let excess water

3728
02:23:07,921 --> 02:23:10,890
escape you want water to drip right out

3729
02:23:09,659 --> 02:23:11,978
but you need the bottom of the cup to

3730
02:23:10,890 --> 02:23:14,389
stay intact

3731
02:23:11,978 --> 02:23:16,549
so once my cups are prepared I film

3732
02:23:14,389 --> 02:23:18,198
about halfway with soil put them in a

3733
02:23:16,549 --> 02:23:20,318
tray and water each cup with my nutrient

3734
02:23:18,199 --> 02:23:22,578
solution before I put the cloud into it

3735
02:23:20,318 --> 02:23:24,918
so you basically just want to water the

3736
02:23:22,578 --> 02:23:26,478
dirt the main difference between the

3737
02:23:24,918 --> 02:23:27,738
rockwool cubes and the EZ cloners that

3738
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:29,118
the EZ cloner is a little more

3739
02:23:27,738 --> 02:23:33,109
vulnerable and needs a little more help

3740
02:23:29,119 --> 02:23:34,998
for this next step so with the EZ cloner

3741
02:23:33,109 --> 02:23:37,039
clones I make a little mound of my cup

3742
02:23:34,998 --> 02:23:38,779
it should kind of kind of look like a

3743
02:23:37,039 --> 02:23:39,770
traffic cone so I should remind you to

3744
02:23:38,779 --> 02:23:41,328
wear rubber gloves for this whole

3745
02:23:39,770 --> 02:23:42,828
process by the way so I have a little

3746
02:23:41,328 --> 02:23:45,288
mound of dirt like a traffic cone inside

3747
02:23:42,828 --> 02:23:48,049
my cup I try to spread the roots apart

3748
02:23:45,289 --> 02:23:50,418
around that mound kind of evenly and

3749
02:23:48,049 --> 02:23:52,488
then that really promotes root root

3750
02:23:50,418 --> 02:23:53,748
growth and balance plants so once the

3751
02:23:52,488 --> 02:23:56,779
roots are carefully spread out in the

3752
02:23:53,748 --> 02:23:58,430
clonus centered add more soil into the

3753
02:23:56,779 --> 02:24:01,488
cup until you have about a half inch

3754
02:23:58,430 --> 02:24:02,779
space on top left and then water the

3755
02:24:01,488 --> 02:24:05,930
clone throughly with the nutrient

3756
02:24:02,779 --> 02:24:08,090
solution and put it under a t5 light it

3757
02:24:05,930 --> 02:24:11,689
stays on for a minimum of 18 hours per

3758
02:24:08,090 --> 02:24:14,238
day I keep my t5 lights very close to my

3759
02:24:11,689 --> 02:24:17,359
plants and get them as close to the tops

3760
02:24:14,238 --> 02:24:19,129
as I can get without exceeding about 77

3761
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:21,408
degrees definitely don't get above 80 or

3762
02:24:19,129 --> 02:24:24,019
85 in there you'll be in trouble 80 is

3763
02:24:21,408 --> 02:24:25,340
kind of high 85 you're in trouble for

3764
02:24:24,020 --> 02:24:26,810
the clones and rockwool the rapid

3765
02:24:25,340 --> 02:24:28,488
rooters they do the same thing but I'm

3766
02:24:26,809 --> 02:24:30,260
not as concerned about spreading the

3767
02:24:28,488 --> 02:24:31,609
roots out because the Rueter are at the

3768
02:24:30,260 --> 02:24:33,050
rapid Rooter the rock wall has them

3769
02:24:31,609 --> 02:24:34,880
spread out enough already and it's kind

3770
02:24:33,049 --> 02:24:36,498
of holding them intact to the base of

3771
02:24:34,879 --> 02:24:38,629
the clone which is where the real tender

3772
02:24:36,498 --> 02:24:40,639
so to set that rock wall into the wet

3773
02:24:38,629 --> 02:24:42,288
soil and fill the cup until there's

3774
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:44,658
about a half inch of space left and then

3775
02:24:42,289 --> 02:24:46,998
water the rockwool clones the same as

3776
02:24:44,658 --> 02:24:49,129
you do the EZ clone or clones and get

3777
02:24:46,998 --> 02:24:51,020
those under 18 hours or more of life t5

3778
02:24:49,129 --> 02:24:52,368
s are good and again don't get them up

3779
02:24:51,020 --> 02:24:54,709
real high in temperature try to stay

3780
02:24:52,369 --> 02:24:56,359
about 77 degrees that's really important

3781
02:24:54,709 --> 02:24:57,770
people don't pay enough attention to

3782
02:24:56,359 --> 02:25:00,529
their temperatures when they're in veg

3783
02:24:57,770 --> 02:25:01,819
and that it doesn't allow you to grow

3784
02:25:00,529 --> 02:25:03,590
strong healthy plants so that when

3785
02:25:01,818 --> 02:25:05,719
you're in flower the plants don't live

3786
02:25:03,590 --> 02:25:07,738
up to their full potential

3787
02:25:05,719 --> 02:25:10,019
alright now here's where the humidity

3788
02:25:07,738 --> 02:25:12,180
dolmen Trey and Rockwell cute method go

3789
02:25:10,020 --> 02:25:13,949
wrong for a lot of the new growers your

3790
02:25:12,180 --> 02:25:15,738
clones have been in 70% humidity for

3791
02:25:13,949 --> 02:25:17,939
most of their lives so once those clones

3792
02:25:15,738 --> 02:25:19,350
get upset about the lack of humidity

3793
02:25:17,939 --> 02:25:20,880
it's hard to bring them back

3794
02:25:19,350 --> 02:25:23,189
unless you've been taken off the dome

3795
02:25:20,879 --> 02:25:24,750
daily and letting these clones acclimate

3796
02:25:23,189 --> 02:25:26,880
slowly they're gonna freak out when you

3797
02:25:24,750 --> 02:25:28,379
expose them to the drier atmosphere so I

3798
02:25:26,879 --> 02:25:30,929
would recommend putting those cuffed

3799
02:25:28,379 --> 02:25:33,148
clones that came out of the dome back

3800
02:25:30,930 --> 02:25:34,979
into the dome if you have room I think

3801
02:25:33,148 --> 02:25:37,528
you can fit about 12 of those cups in

3802
02:25:34,978 --> 02:25:39,420
one of the domes and tray setups if you

3803
02:25:37,529 --> 02:25:41,640
can't use the dome you can put a clear

3804
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:44,100
cup on top of it get another bag of

3805
02:25:41,639 --> 02:25:45,599
those Solo cups and get clear ones this

3806
02:25:44,100 --> 02:25:47,850
time and put those on top of your red

3807
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:49,109
cups or if you accidentally bought clear

3808
02:25:47,850 --> 02:25:50,880
cups in the first place thinking you

3809
02:25:49,109 --> 02:25:52,078
were gonna put clones into those now you

3810
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:55,709
have a use for them cuz they aren't any

3811
02:25:52,078 --> 02:25:57,180
good for rooting your plants put that on

3812
02:25:55,709 --> 02:25:58,648
top and it worked like a dump for each

3813
02:25:57,180 --> 02:26:00,119
individual plant once they get rooted

3814
02:25:58,648 --> 02:26:01,680
into the soil they'll be more forgiving

3815
02:26:00,119 --> 02:26:03,619
to that humidity drop they'll have

3816
02:26:01,680 --> 02:26:06,090
another life source they won't be so so

3817
02:26:03,619 --> 02:26:07,710
dependent on the moisture in the air to

3818
02:26:06,090 --> 02:26:09,809
live because they'll be able to get

3819
02:26:07,709 --> 02:26:11,759
moisture and sustenance from the roots

3820
02:26:09,809 --> 02:26:13,228
for survival so give them more and more

3821
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:15,210
time without the domes each day until

3822
02:26:13,228 --> 02:26:18,148
they're stable and then in just a few

3823
02:26:15,209 --> 02:26:21,000
days they'll be well adjusted so once

3824
02:26:18,148 --> 02:26:22,889
your clones are in two cups and fed be

3825
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:24,299
sure to label your clones we talk about

3826
02:26:22,889 --> 02:26:25,408
this all the time it sucks having a

3827
02:26:24,299 --> 02:26:27,538
clone that you don't know what it is

3828
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:29,969
because you got stoned mislabeled it or

3829
02:26:27,539 --> 02:26:31,409
forgot to label it then you have to make

3830
02:26:29,969 --> 02:26:34,019
up a name and that just creates more

3831
02:26:31,408 --> 02:26:35,340
problems so please label your clones so

3832
02:26:34,020 --> 02:26:36,930
these clones we just put into cups are

3833
02:26:35,340 --> 02:26:38,969
gonna need a few days to adjust and dig

3834
02:26:36,930 --> 02:26:40,199
their roots into the new soil they

3835
02:26:38,969 --> 02:26:41,969
should be cooling the cups for about 10

3836
02:26:40,199 --> 02:26:43,920
to 14 days you can go a little longer if

3837
02:26:41,969 --> 02:26:45,599
you really need to I just like to leave

3838
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:46,920
them in there until I you can take off

3839
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:49,380
the cup off the dirt and just see the

3840
02:26:46,920 --> 02:26:50,639
roots kind of trying to bust out that's

3841
02:26:49,379 --> 02:26:53,129
when I want to put them into bigger pots

3842
02:26:50,639 --> 02:26:54,988
I know some guys are gonna ask why we

3843
02:26:53,129 --> 02:26:57,238
don't go to larger pots now and save

3844
02:26:54,988 --> 02:26:59,309
time well here's the answer larger pots

3845
02:26:57,238 --> 02:27:02,578
do require more soil which means more

3846
02:26:59,309 --> 02:27:04,228
nutrients which means more water larger

3847
02:27:02,578 --> 02:27:07,049
pots also take up more space with these

3848
02:27:04,228 --> 02:27:09,090
cups we can plant plants and enough dirt

3849
02:27:07,049 --> 02:27:10,349
to let the roots grow while keeping the

3850
02:27:09,090 --> 02:27:11,670
water you slow which means you don't

3851
02:27:10,350 --> 02:27:13,350
have to add a lot of nutrients which

3852
02:27:11,670 --> 02:27:15,659
kind of save you some time and saves you

3853
02:27:13,350 --> 02:27:17,250
money saves you dirt saves you space

3854
02:27:15,659 --> 02:27:19,200
I don't want to feed nutrients to a

3855
02:27:17,250 --> 02:27:21,659
three gallon pot full of dirt while I'm

3856
02:27:19,200 --> 02:27:23,400
only aiming at a cup worth of roots is

3857
02:27:21,659 --> 02:27:26,329
kind of what I'm trying to say so try to

3858
02:27:23,399 --> 02:27:28,920
be more efficient more cost-effective

3859
02:27:26,329 --> 02:27:30,149
once these clones take root and they

3860
02:27:28,920 --> 02:27:32,399
show us they're gonna survive and

3861
02:27:30,149 --> 02:27:34,229
survive that transplant process will

3862
02:27:32,399 --> 02:27:35,579
begin the vegetative growth phase will

3863
02:27:34,229 --> 02:27:36,840
have grown the cups for a couple of

3864
02:27:35,579 --> 02:27:39,030
weeks before we repot them into

3865
02:27:36,840 --> 02:27:40,920
finishing pots or the veg for a few

3866
02:27:39,030 --> 02:27:42,391
weeks or a month and then they'll begin

3867
02:27:40,920 --> 02:27:43,920
flowering so we have a long journey

3868
02:27:42,390 --> 02:27:46,079
ahead of us I hope we can grow a nice

3869
02:27:43,920 --> 02:27:47,460
crop together feel like I've been going

3870
02:27:46,079 --> 02:27:50,879
on and on and on and on so I'm gonna

3871
02:27:47,459 --> 02:27:52,289
take a dad and we'll wrap up the show

3872
02:27:50,879 --> 02:27:54,060

next episode and then on July 2nd I'm

3892
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:33,989
going to be recording the podcast live

3893
02:28:31,049 --> 02:28:35,670
from the Brickyard in Pueblo Colorado it

3894
02:28:33,989 --> 02:28:38,579
will be closing down the hookah bar for

3895
02:28:35,670 --> 02:28:40,110
me it'll be a private party I'm going to

3896
02:28:38,579 --> 02:28:41,909
see if I can't invite some of the

3897
02:28:40,110 --> 02:28:43,739
podcast listeners to come down and hang

3898
02:28:41,909 --> 02:28:46,950
out with us I have to figure out what

3899
02:28:43,739 --> 02:28:49,199
they're going to allow I may give you

3900
02:28:46,950 --> 02:28:50,670
guys a password on the next episode and

3901
02:28:49,200 --> 02:28:52,470
then you'll have to use that password or

3902
02:28:50,670 --> 02:28:54,569
something to get in and then only the

3903
02:28:52,469 --> 02:28:56,100
people that know that are allowed in but

3904
02:28:54,569 --> 02:28:58,739
we have to keep it private to be able to

3905
02:28:56,101 --> 02:29:00,750
do the things we want to do there so

3906
02:28:58,739 --> 02:29:03,239
this is the portion of the show where I

3907
02:29:00,750 --> 02:29:05,190
give thanks to somebody who I feel has

3908
02:29:03,239 --> 02:29:07,920
been beneficial in the evolution of the

3909
02:29:05,190 --> 02:29:09,690
cannabis movement I was hanging out with

3910
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:12,420
a friend of mine a few years ago several

3911
02:29:09,690 --> 02:29:14,250
years ago man this was a long time ago

3912
02:29:12,420 --> 02:29:15,630
we were talking about growing wheat he's

3913
02:29:14,250 --> 02:29:17,601
an old-school grower and an old-school

3914
02:29:15,630 --> 02:29:19,800
breeder from back in the overgrow days

3915
02:29:17,601 --> 02:29:21,900
and we're talking and he's like hey do

3916
02:29:19,800 --> 02:29:23,369
you know who soma is and I was like I

3917
02:29:21,899 --> 02:29:25,140
don't know who soma is and he said dude

3918
02:29:23,370 --> 02:29:28,021
you remind me so much of soma you need

3919
02:29:25,140 --> 02:29:30,060
to check him out so I did what any

3920
02:29:28,021 --> 02:29:32,460
responsible pothead would do I got

3921
02:29:30,060 --> 02:29:35,459
online and I checked out this guy soma

3922
02:29:32,459 --> 02:29:36,989
yeah soma and I have some related blood

3923
02:29:35,459 --> 02:29:38,459
line somewhere along the line because

3924
02:29:36,989 --> 02:29:40,649
this dude's got dreadlocks down to his

3925
02:29:38,459 --> 02:29:42,810
ass and dresses like an old hippie this

3926
02:29:40,649 --> 02:29:48,779
is the original wookie right here is

3927
02:29:42,810 --> 02:29:50,341
soma soma was born in 1949 he's probably

3928
02:29:48,780 --> 02:29:52,771
been growing wheat longer than you've

3929
02:29:50,341 --> 02:29:56,159
been alive he's the author of the book

3930
02:29:52,771 --> 02:29:58,530
organic marijuana soma style he was

3931
02:29:56,159 --> 02:30:00,239

3932
02:29:58,530 --> 02:30:02,341

3936
02:30:08,220 --> 02:30:10,949
taught me a lot of not personally but

3937
02:30:09,540 --> 02:30:12,721
through his readings and his YouTube

3938
02:30:10,950 --> 02:30:15,271
stuff it's not me a lot of things about

3939
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:16,680
mimetics and the vibe of the plant which

3940
02:30:15,271 --> 02:30:18,631
are things that I understood and

3941
02:30:16,681 --> 02:30:21,540
believed in anyway but it's good to see

3942
02:30:18,630 --> 02:30:23,459
soma out there doing the organics and

3943
02:30:21,540 --> 02:30:26,070
teaching this vibe for the plant not

3944
02:30:23,459 --> 02:30:27,810
just how to draw fat buds but how to

3945
02:30:26,069 --> 02:30:30,029
love the plan how to connect with it and

3946
