you to all of the people who warned me

101
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,318
that a couple of the audio episodes were

102
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:12,799
not posting and populating on the audio

103
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,719
server feeds i am posting it the way

104
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,478
that i'm supposed to i did what i am

105
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:19,199
required supposed to knowledgeable of

106
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,879
doing and for some reason the feeds just

107
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,400
were not catching the files that i was

108
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:26,478
posting some of the audio services

109
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:28,239
didn't have uh 7 14 15 and possibly 16

110
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,560
that issue has been corrected all of

111
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,160
those episodes are now to the best of my

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,720
knowledge those episodes are now on

113
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,439
apple podcast spotify stitcher radio pod

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,199
bean uh all that stuff i cannot get

115
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,639
google to update so if you guys are

116
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,879
watching listening waiting for the show

117
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
on google podcast i can't get it to

118
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,839
update i don't know why i've messaged

119
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:48,159
them contact customer service they don't

120
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:50,079
give a [ __ ] so that's always gonna suck

121
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,560
and be slow there also somebody asked

122
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,918
why there's only so many episodes on

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
spotify

124
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:56,959
that is not up to me i don't get to

125
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,560
decide that spotify

126
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,120
decides how much space they're going to

127
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,120
dedicate to the show guys like joe rogan

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
they get an unlimited [ __ ] feed you

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,519
can put it all up there people with

130
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,319
smaller audiences smaller viewerships

131
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,159
less numbers less clicks they get less

132
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,000
uh room on the feed they don't think you

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,680
want to listen to more than a hundred

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,240
episodes of my nonsense yet so they only

135
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,720
give me server space bandwidth space

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,038
storage space for my most 100 recent

137
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:25,840
episodes that's not up to me that is a

138
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:28,399
spotify issue i do believe apple podcast

139
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,758
hosts like 300 of my shows maybe more i

140
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,519
don't go check that the listeners tell

141
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,080
me this sort of stuff but

142
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,478
if you are upset frustrated complaining

143
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,639
bent uh vexed in some way that older

144
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:40,240
episodes have disappeared from spotify i

145
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,319
do apologize that's nothing i can

146
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,319
control until we get more listens more

147
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,240
viewership uh then they will add our

148
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,319
library will be much longer but until

149
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,079
then that's just what they do uh in the

150
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:52,639
meantime you can check out all of the

151
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:55,279
episodes on the youtube channel every

152
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,639
episode uh up till from like episode 20

153
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,638
i think all the way up should be on the

154
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,960
youtube server and the older episodes

155
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
are on the old channel agro culture

156
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,159
which has been defunct and that i think

157
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,240
i share them somewhere you should be

158
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,400
able to find everything on the grow from

159
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000

162
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,959
where uh the numbers count the most for

163
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,879
me when i'm doing advertising and

164
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:18,318
promotion and sales people want to see

these proper instructions the reason i

232
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,759
make you follow instructions is because

233

i'm not giving out free seeds to give

234
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,958
out free seeds i expect things in return

235
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,879
for these seeds i need detailed reports

236
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,039
i need feedback i need communication if

237
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,278
you can't follow a few instructions to

238
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,799
get these seeds i can't [ __ ] with you to

239
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,799
give you free seeds that's just how it

240
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,399
is a little bit of work to get you some

241

their app it's at the top of the list

270
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,079
they didn't qualify the last two phases

271
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,159
because i had my number that's all it is

272
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
i reach a number of testers i send them

273
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,159
i wait for reports to start coming once

274
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:04,639
i'm satisfied i send more it's kind of

275
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,480

packaging the tester seeds selecting the

296
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,959
testers reading the email applications

297
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:48,720

312
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,760
long time to tell people there's a bubba

313

kush to arise that has been in testing

314

315
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:25,200

316
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,919
one there is um a rise f1 number four

317

459
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,959
information that makes my brain frazzled

460
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,320
and confused and in school i didn't care

461

about half the [ __ ] they were teaching i

462
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,440
love these kind of lessons but it makes

463
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,879
your brain work better if you get a joke

464
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,800
and some laughter in the middle it's

465
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,559
like a treat it's like training a dog if

536
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:41,279
pendant on the 712 episode is [ __ ]

537
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,558
awesome that is straight fire i'm gonna

538
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,599
move the microphone out of the way kind

539
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,359
of show you the pendant for a moment

540
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,199
then we'll get right back to the podcast

541
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,879
but i agree this pendant is straight

542
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,000
[ __ ] fire i may just drop in a photo

543
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,360
of it because moving the mic might not

544
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,359
do a lot but here's what it looks like

545
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,879
it is

546
00:18:55,759 --> 00:19:00,960
a number of pastel like colors

547
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,559
in what looks to be like a bloom type of

548
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,679
a flower possibly a lotus might have

549
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,798
been what they were going for i just

550
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,519
realized that as i'm looking at it at

551
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,119
this angle uh with an ohm sign in the

552
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,519
middle of it right it says ohm right in

553
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,678
the middle of it um i saw this at a

554
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,519
glass shop i actually saw two of them

555
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,960
and i thought i know somebody that would

556
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,960
love that i'm going to get us those

557
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,480
matching pendants and so big shout out

558
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,960
to the person who has the other pendant

559
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,960
that looks just like this she knows who

560
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,960
she is she doesn't want the shout out on

561
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,640
the show she's kind of shy

562
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,160
but had to grab the pendy there's

563
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,000

586
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:18,480
looking for why did i get my notes mixed

587
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,038
up you guys saw it happen

588
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,919
this one comes from our friend andrew

589
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,599
and andrew says what's up ross to jeff i

590
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,840
recently finished my first run of

591
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,319
producing seeds isn't that a fun

592
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:32,399
exciting project except this ends in

593
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:35,038
tragedy this is a tragedy i will warn

594
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,519
you it says it was dark hollow or it was

595
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,359
a fun and unexpected unexpected project

596
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,038
and then i jumped ahead of line while i

597
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,119
was popping a bag of dark hollow i

598
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,359
stumbled upon the stinkiest male plant

599
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,119
i've ever smelled that one's gonna have

600
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,439
some stinky [ __ ] in there that dark

601
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:51,599
hollow male plant was probably a champ

602
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,400
it says great structure vigorous and an

603
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,158
intense garlicky funk that's hard to

604
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,759
describe i love it but i can almost

605
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,200
smell it in my mind because i know that

606
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,279
plant so well

607
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,480
it goes on it says i happen to have an

608
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,839
extra xanadu female and some extra space

609
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,839
i know what's going to happen here bro

610
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:09,759
you put them on a date quick summary it

611
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,199
says i kept them very small and then he

612
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,359
does go on to kind of describe the grow

613
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,480
a little bit fabric pots soil

614
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:18,000
synthetic help mars hydro uh everything

615
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,599
seemed to be great very healthy all the

616
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,119
way through i got a ton of very healthy

617
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,279
looking seeds

618
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:25,839
but here's where we turn to tragic

619
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:27,038
tragedy strategy i think it's a tragedy

620
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,359
however you want to say it this is where

621
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:32,319
the [ __ ] up part happens but the seeds

622
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,399
have shells made of vibranium after

623
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,879
several attempts at every method of

624
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,840
germinating soaking scarring scraping

625
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,520
cracking etc i finally got two seeds to

626
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,720
crack through the shell and this was

627
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,480
about after 25 attempts after examining

628
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,640
the other failed tries it appears that

629
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,640
the seed was trying to push the root

630
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,799
through but none of them were capable of

631
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,880
cracking the seed shell yes that does

632
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,720
make sense i've got a reason why and

633
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,360
possibly another tester solution you

634
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,759
could try it says i usually have good

635
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,439
germination techniques any idea what i

636
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:05,679
may have done to cause this i love your

637
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,558
show i love your seeds love your vibe in

638
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,880
general be well from my new friend

639
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:12,558
andrew andrew big love big respect thank

640
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,120
you for the great question i do have

641
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:17,119
feedback perhaps possibly an answer here

642
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,519
let's talk about what i think could have

643
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:21,678
gone wrong in your grow number one

644
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,200
answer i think you let the seeds go for

645
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,600
too long they should have been harvested

646
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,279
earlier they simply got too thick too

647
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,199
tough too strong because they were there

648
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,000
too long i've seen this happen i've done

649
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,319
this

650
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,200
um there's not much you can do now

651
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:36,639
except next time cut them down earlier

652
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,558
maybe go through and find the seeds you

653
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,600
think might really germ pull those out

654
00:22:38,558 --> 00:22:41,678
try them

655
00:22:39,599 --> 00:22:42,879
also i've seen a thing called the seed

656
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,320
cracker you could probably deal with a

657
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,600
pair of pliers or whatever else you got

658
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,359
but you're going to [ __ ] up some seeds

659
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,119
doing it there's a little device that

660
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,479
you put a seed in it and you twist a

661
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,479
handle and the seed goes crack and it

662
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,720
kind of pops the shell for you then you

663
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,400
attempt to germ it uh that may work for

664
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,880
you that may help you out but the bottom

665
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,400
line the real answer here straight up

666
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,240
without any [ __ ] without buttering

667
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,080
it up without sugar coating it i think

668
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,599
those seeds grew for too long and

669
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,798
they're all going to be probably

670
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,558
problematic it could be a silicate issue

671
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,720
it could be a feed issue it could be

672
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,200
something like that honestly i'm going

673
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,519
to say that this was a timing issue

674
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,440
those seeds simply uh they went too long

675
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:20,879
they got too hard and now they're just

676
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,360
too hard and too tough and too thick

677
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,320
that's really what i do think happened

678
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,158
to your seeds i wish i had better advice

679
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,519
i wish i had info on how to correct that

680
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,120
because you've got a batch of seeds i

681
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,440
don't know how many you made uh it

682
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,038
doesn't really say but you bought 25 of

683
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,640
them so you must have a nice number when

684
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,879
you make seeds you guys you make a lot

685
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:41,200
of seeds so you probably got a lot to

686
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,960
play with it's a bummer that it's not a

687
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,480
winner but it's cool that it was just

688
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,240
kind of a side project that you did

689
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,319
learn from so take this as a learning

690
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,120
lesson how long did you flower did you

691
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,879
take notes were you pulling seeds off

692
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,959
occasionally and squeezing them here's a

693
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,278
way we can correct this in the future

694
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,880
the next time you're making seeds

695
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,558
start pulling them out of the plant and

696
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,640
checking on them a little bit earlier

697
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,158
than you did this time when i know that

698
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,080
seeds are getting close or not even

699
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,159
close when i'm getting antsy and anxious

700
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:09,839
and nervous and want more beans i'll go

701
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,120
to the plant and i'll just pick a nug

702
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,720
somewhere on the plant i'll just reach

703
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:14,319
in and pull a seed right out you can see

704
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,919
them you can feel them if you can't

705
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:18,399
there are no seeds yours were obviously

706
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,000
hard enough start pulling a few out rub

707
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,759
the shell off put in your hands squeeze

708
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,919
it does it explode does it pop is it

709
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,759
crunch does it crack or does it leave a

710
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,200
dent in your fingers if they start

711
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:29,359
leaving dents in your fingers they're

712
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,360
close to done are they tiger striped are

713
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,278
they the color you want are they solid

714
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,000
start paying attention to that then you

715
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,679
can prevent leaving them for too long

716
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,278
sometimes you could take the tops those

717
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,120
seeds will be ready let the bottoms keep

718
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,519
going that way you only let some go too

719
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,678
long maybe some too early outdoors it's

720
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,359
kind of hard to judge but indoors you

721
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,880
should have pollinated all at once all

722
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,719
that pollen should hit at one time most

723
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,960
of the seeds should be consistent you

724
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,440
should be able to tell by plucking seeds

725
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,120
from two or three spots examining do

726
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,880
that once or twice three or four times

727
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:02,158
and you'll know how far along those

728
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,200
seeds are so once again bottom line

729
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,480
my prognosis my diagnosis my hypothesis

730
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,480
my thesis my [ __ ] stoner idea my bro

731
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,880
science does say that these seeds simply

732
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,558
grew for too long and they got too hard

733
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
too thick too robust

734
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,240
um i would try to crack them i would

735
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,480
work more on the scarification maybe a

736
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,759
longer germ soak maybe soak them for 24

737
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,240
hours uh crack them or soak them no wait

738
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,558
try that again crack them or scar them

739
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,640
then soak them for 24 then try to germ

740
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,079
them that may help you out but it sounds

741
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,000
like you've tried a lot of good methods

742
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,000
you're doing the right [ __ ] they're just

743
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,000
too hard you got the hulk you got the

744
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,240
rock they're made out of uh would you

745
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,759
say vibranium unobtainium yeah they're

746
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,919
made out of [ __ ] steel because they

747
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,599
went for too long all right i hope that

748
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,159
was good advice unfortunately i don't

749
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,519
have a real solution other than uh check

750
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:51,278
next time a little bit better that would

751
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,639
be my advice pay more attention i'm not

752
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,319
saying you didn't pay attention but pay

753
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,480
more attention next time now you know

754
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:58,319
what to look for how to correct it

755
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,000
all right my buddy andrew uh thank you

756
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:01,759

there are thousands of listeners to this

777
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,359
show if one person's got the question

778
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,199
the numbers tell me there are probably

779
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,959
multiple people that have that question

780
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,360
there are only so many opportunities and

781
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,038
things to do in cannabis growth so if a

782
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,278
question arises a lot of people were

783
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,798
probably thinking it one person said it

784
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:59,359
so it lets me know that i'm helping you

off the top of my head so that helps a

789
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,880
lot so send in those questions send the
