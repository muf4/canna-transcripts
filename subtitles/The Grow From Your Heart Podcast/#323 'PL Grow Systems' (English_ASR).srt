47
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:45,090
met you I advertised that you were from

48
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:47,349
Australia and I've been corrected yeah

49
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,350
especially singers I'm originally from

50
00:01:47,349 --> 00:01:52,569
South Africa being a link to an

51
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:55,030
Australian yeah fair enough it's a right

52
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,039
hemisphere wrong country but originally

53
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:01,960
from South Africa now living in in

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,750
England being here for 20 plus years for

55
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:09,419
my sins and I'm originally from the home

56
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:09,419
of Durban poisons beautiful

57
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:17,539
and I'm in London I've been there for a

58
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:18,889
good ten years now love the city I've

59
00:02:17,539 --> 00:02:23,780
heard a lot of great things but I have

60
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:24,649
never been visit well now I've got

61
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:29,240
somewhere to stay

62
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:31,310
so I'll come see you guys all right so

63
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,980
of course you guys are that way

64
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:36,140
absolutely you have got space well

65
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:38,090
obviously Peter and Leigh are PNL from

66
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:40,909
P&amp;L growth systems would you guys like

67
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,430
to take a minute and tell me about how

68
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:47,000
you got into this idea of creating the

69
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,830
pl grow systems product products did I

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,159
lose you

71
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:55,100
something may have gone wrong okay so I

72
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,629
think where I was I was just gonna give

73
00:02:55,099 --> 00:02:58,159
you guys an opportunity to tell me about

74
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:00,650
the company since you guys are obviously

75
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,789
Peter and Lee of P&amp;L bro systems would

76
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,310
you like to tell me a little bit about

77
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:12,229
how PNL came about and what inspired you

78
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:13,459
to create this company having the same

79
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:15,919
problem that if you wanted to take a

80
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,019
two-week holiday you'd come back to a

81
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:23,268
bunch of dead plants either in your

82
00:03:18,019 --> 00:03:25,459
greenhouse or your grow space and really

83
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,930
we went and had a look in the market to

84
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,150
go and see you know what was out there

85
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:32,000
that would allow us to keep an eye on it

86
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,980
and remotely control it and there was

87
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,680
nothing within our price bracket that's

88
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:39,139
for sure you know there's some really

89
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,409
expensive kit out there that can do it

90
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:45,018
for you and whether you can even remote

91
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:47,989
into them is optional and usually would

92
00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:49,759
require quite a bit of reconfiguring

93
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:55,480
your home or your rooters and firewalls

94
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:58,009
to let traffic in so the technologists

95
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:59,268
we just added like there's got to be a

96
00:03:58,009 --> 00:04:00,620
cheaper way an easier way of doing this

97
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:03,650
and started building systems for

98
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:06,680
ourselves we started off with some early

99
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:09,580
prototypes that when we started posting

100
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:12,680
pictures of them people took interest

101
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,390
and it was after slowly building up and

102
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,780
showing what it could do and controlling

103
00:04:14,389 --> 00:04:18,829
our own setup that interest grew and

104
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:20,750
grew and grew and we'd said they realize

105
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,449
you know we've solved the problem for

106
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:24,639
ourselves this

107
00:04:22,449 --> 00:04:27,670
to make it really easy to get up and

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,969
running and able to access it from it

109
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:32,110
anywhere in the world and other people

110
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,820
are interested it and to be honest

111
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,460
that's really how you know the company

112
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:39,279
came about we solved the problem and

113
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:41,379
really there were others that one is the

114
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,119
same solution at an affordable price the

115
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:45,870
one thing about it was this the remote

116
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:51,280
access and making it easy to set up and

117
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:55,480
we've both got decades of IT support and

118
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:57,129
within the financial world okay and so

119
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,200
trying to make this thing as easy as

120
00:04:57,129 --> 00:05:01,719
possible to reduce the number of support

121
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,879
calls I've made the fatal mistake of

122
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,140
offering my father IT support in the

123
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:07,810
past and so yeah I'm trying to make

124
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:11,289
things as simple as possible to to keep

125
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:14,019
the number of calls to a minimum is is

126
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:17,230
part of what we try to do you know if

127
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:18,189
it's not simple then we realize there's

128
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:19,840
going to be a problem for a lot of

129
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:22,149
people you know not everybody is a

130
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,429
techie that is absolutely the truth so

131
00:05:22,149 --> 00:05:26,799
that's key to what we do I mean our

132
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:28,389
devices you literally you connect them

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,340
to your Wi-Fi network that's it you

134
00:05:28,389 --> 00:05:32,469
don't have to configure anything else

135
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,939
everything happens super simply through

136
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,620
the website that's one of my favorite

137
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,389
parts about it is the simplicity and

138
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,910
also that I didn't have to add anything

139
00:05:37,389 --> 00:05:43,839
to my computer system everything I need

140
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,220
is happening for me yeah the best part

141
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,139
then you can access it from anywhere

142
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,750
yes that's my favorite part that I can

143
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:50,979
see my grow at home while I am at work I

144
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:53,709
don't have to drive home and check on

145
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,420
anything it is completely simple that's

146
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:57,129
my favorite part is that I don't have to

147
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,540
come here to look at the plants I could

148
00:05:57,129 --> 00:06:00,250
just check right on the phone I can look

149
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,569
at the cameras on one app I can look at

150
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:03,699
the minder on the other app and I know

151
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:06,730
everything is safe that's my favorite

152
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:08,979
part and the simplicity the other units

153
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:11,170
I've tried to use I've had problems and

154
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,379
this one I plugged it in and it works so

155
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,780
I think that is amazing

156
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:18,370
yeah and then we've tried to keep it

157
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:19,989
nice and modular as well so you know the

158
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,090
first unit that we've brought out is the

159
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,009
one with the sensors with ambient

160
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:25,359
temperature and humidity and another

161
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,219
temperature sensor that's waterproof

162
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,780
that you can drop into your your

163
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,870
reservoir for instance or you can put

164
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:33,129
into your grow medium I was using it out

165
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,180
in the greenhouse to check that the soil

166
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:36,379
temperature was up to the right

167
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:39,590
temperature before planting the Chili's

168
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:43,639
in the greenhouse prevent breach shock

169
00:06:39,589 --> 00:06:45,289
for instance yeah and then because it's

170
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,599
modular and you know you tend to find

171
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,030
that most people's just want temperature

172
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,020
and humidity co2 is a nice to have but

173
00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:54,579
only really if you're running in a

174
00:06:51,019 --> 00:06:56,779
sealed environment and your average home

175
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:58,819
enthusiast and home grower is not

176
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:02,359
necessarily doing co2 enriched

177
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:04,459
environments so we can well we are we do

178
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,350
have a co2 sensor coming out there is

179
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:08,509
another modular piece that you just add

180
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,740
it it's not you don't have to change

181
00:07:08,509 --> 00:07:12,769
anything and your setup you don't have

182
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,210
to buy a whole new piece of kit do this

183
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,500
well we just need to buy the sensor but

184
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,909
you don't have to upgrade anything

185
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,430
software wise or anything like that

186
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,680
which is great for people who just want

187
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,939
to add something later so if maybe they

188
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,350
can't afford the system right at the

189
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:26,029
beginning they can add on instead of

190
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:27,260
having to invest in the high priced unit

191
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:32,689
right away so that's a great great

192
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:33,980
addition there is accessible to

193
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:36,219
everybody as possible really

194
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:40,400
is there a vapor pressure deficit

195
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:44,980
reading available I mean we do that as a

196
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:47,299
calculation we so on the on the website

197
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,850
one of the outputs that you get which is

198
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:52,639
calculated on the fly is the VPD

199
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:54,560
readings excellent and that you can then

200
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,839
look at for free what we give to

201
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,149
everybody that comes with each unit when

202
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,989
you buy it you get free access to your

203
00:07:59,149 --> 00:08:07,099
current readings and then 2 hours 4

204
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:09,710
hours 6 12 24 48 and 7 days worth of

205
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:12,500
historical data charted so you can look

206
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:15,169
at over time what's actually going on in

207
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,930
the environment and we take a reading

208
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:19,189
every 30 seconds so it's fairly granular

209
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,569
as to what's going on in the environment

210
00:08:19,189 --> 00:08:22,129
you can see if somebody's open the door

211
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:23,810
and closed it again yes because you'll

212
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,579
see temperature spikes up and down you

213
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,959
can see when the fan came on page if you

214
00:08:25,579 --> 00:08:30,589
pay enough attention you can see when a

215
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:32,990
big fan kicks on we've had a number of

216
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:35,360
clients who've actually said that being

217
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:36,979
able to see that has one of them

218
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,560
identified that the fan had sucked some

219
00:08:36,979 --> 00:08:40,910
plastic up because they knew the fan was

220
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:42,319
supposed to be on and they couldn't see

221
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,620
the temperature drop so they went to see

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
what was wrong with the fan and others

223
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,250
have realized oh hang on I haven't

224
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,240
turned the heater on yes I can see when

225
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:51,409
he was supposed particular

226
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,149
can suddenly they don't see the

227
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,379
temperature actually coming up I

228
00:08:53,149 --> 00:08:56,990
actually had an air there the other

229
00:08:54,379 --> 00:08:58,549
interesting oh I had an everything I had

230
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:00,139
an air conditioner fail and I would not

231
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,699
have known without the minder unit I

232
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,259
checked to see what the temp was and it

233
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,580
was really high in there so I knew

234
00:09:03,259 --> 00:09:07,129
something's wrong I need to get over

235
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,450
there and if I hadn't looked I wasn't

236
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,250
coming home from work for another four

237
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,600
or five hours and four or five hours at

238
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,730
that temperature I would have not had a

239
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:17,570
crop so it was worth the investment

240
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:19,909
already that's something that people

241
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:21,860
don't mean you know when we come to an

242
00:09:19,909 --> 00:09:24,110
to sort of the whole environment control

243
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,360
node and monitoring of the environment

244
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:27,830
we listen to lots of podcasts and they

245
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,180
often talk about all the nutrients and

246
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,180
the lighting and all of that which is

247
00:09:29,179 --> 00:09:34,129
all good and well but if the environment

248
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:37,088
is off it doesn't matter how good the

249
00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:40,159
lighting is how good the nutrients are

250
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:41,510
if it's there forty five degrees

251
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,199
centigrade and ten percent humidity

252
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:48,769
everything's dead absolutely absolutely

253
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:51,640
growing cacti it's it's not surviving

254
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:54,319
there and the problem with your

255
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:56,509
run-of-the-mill hygrometer is that it

256
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,560
gives you the maximum temperature that

257
00:09:56,509 --> 00:09:59,838
it was at and the minimum temperature

258
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,759
rosette with no indication as to how

259
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,410
long you were at the maximum and the

260
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,110
minimum temperature was it just a blip

261
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:10,278
were you there for 10 minutes or was it

262
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:12,289
four hours and so you know that's the

263
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,958
extra information that we provide and it

264
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:17,629
gives people their real insight into

265
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,729
what's actually going on I've noticed

266
00:10:17,629 --> 00:10:21,470
that most of the swings happen right

267
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,389
when the lights go on or right when the

268
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,950
lights go off within the next hour is

269
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:26,750
when things really go different and

270
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,800
you're never there for that time you

271
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,450
don't know what's happening in that

272
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:31,819
grill room when those lights go off for

273
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,259
that hour it's really neat to find out

274
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,028
what happens with your lights your

275
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:37,009
temperature your humidity your vapor

276
00:10:35,028 --> 00:10:38,929
pressure deficit in that our swing

277
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:40,819
that's the most interesting part in my

278
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:42,379
opinion so it's really neat to get

279
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,589
something like this and be able to chart

280
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:47,629
what's happening and then you can start

281
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,230
to do things like plan to actually have

282
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:50,570
fans

283
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,180
come on 15 minutes before the lights

284
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,850
come on just sort of reduce that as the

285
00:10:53,179 --> 00:10:58,370
lights kick in and give everything an

286
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,199
opportunity to start up if I'm allowed

287
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:01,429
to come on and the same of the lights go

288
00:11:00,198 --> 00:11:02,809
off you can actually stop things

289
00:11:01,429 --> 00:11:03,829
expecting 10 minutes before if you're

290
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:07,539
running an already small

291
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:10,070
bass where if it carries on extracting

292
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:11,839
after the lights have gone off it cools

293
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,400
down too quickly so you might say well

294
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,870
before just before the lights turn off

295
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,490
turn the fans off and we'll stop

296
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,250
extracting than just a channels of

297
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,740
ambient cooling that happens and reduce

298
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,059
that drop off so you've already

299
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,440
mentioned several ways that these things

300
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:26,449
are going to improve our Gardens I've

301
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,490
already mentioned one great way I bet

302
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:32,780
getting into the states has been a huge

303
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:35,840
job for you guys well precisely I mean

304
00:11:32,779 --> 00:11:38,209
that's where we see there being a really

305
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,560
big market and and that's you know it's

306
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,110
not kid ourselves you know if you look

307
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:43,429
at it as the as the gold rush equivalent

308
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:47,080
as it has been named that you know the

309
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:49,699
green rush absolutely during that time

310
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,889
everybody all the gold miners had to

311
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,780
have mining equipment whether they were

312
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:57,590
successful or not at the end of the day

313
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:59,269
that's the reality and you know this is

314
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:01,820
missing equipment that gives somebody

315
00:11:59,269 --> 00:12:04,519
the edge in the green rush it allows you

316
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,610
to be able to have a much finer view and

317
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:11,689
control of the environment and with that

318
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:13,970
market there the fact is is that all the

319
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:15,650
homie growers and they're all missing

320
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,750
out they can go and spend three four

321
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,220
thousand which is really pricing them

322
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:23,090
out of the market for a you know an

323
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:25,700
equivalent ish system ours comes in at

324
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:28,490
just alright to do the exchange rate

325
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:30,230
conversion well our basic our entry unit

326
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,629
the mind oh it doesn't have a screen on

327
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:34,129
it which is ideal for like large but for

328
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:36,230
really small home users as well as all

329
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:37,639
the way through to large growth faces

330
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,990
that need to have lots of sensors

331
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:40,699
hanging and you don't want to screen on

332
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:44,299
all of them that these are just small

333
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,070
units got sensors hanging off them we

334
00:12:44,299 --> 00:12:49,069
tell them 470 pounds

335
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:51,530
oh well that's affordable so that's what

336
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,910
about 120 dollars that's about 120 US

337
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:55,519
dollars so that's definitely affordable

338
00:12:52,909 --> 00:12:57,679
yeah and if you can go ahead you know

339
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,500
and then you get all that data on the

340
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,419
website and we can we add analytics over

341
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:04,460
time I mean if we have enough customers

342
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:05,899
you say we'd like to see this we can

343
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:09,470
just add it to the website and everybody

344
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:11,209
gets it doesn't require applications or

345
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:13,220
software on people's phones etc to be

346
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:15,200
updated and that's what's beautiful

347
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,399
about it I have seen and the short time

348
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,360
I've been working with you guys I have

349
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,679
seen vast and

350
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,200
movements to the website it was a little

351
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:23,179
it was very new when I was introduced to

352
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,528
it and now it looks like a professional

353
00:13:23,179 --> 00:13:26,419
website looks like one of the major

354
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:28,519
companies it looks like NASA now I think

355
00:13:26,419 --> 00:13:31,519
it's really great yeah it's come a long

356
00:13:28,519 --> 00:13:33,289
way since we first start thinking it has

357
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,149
heavy that started off

358
00:13:33,289 --> 00:13:37,819
yeah the approach is the same as we've

359
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:40,578
done with the product range is it starts

360
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:42,410
off it has to do what it needs to do and

361
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:43,189
then worry about making it look pretty

362
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:46,278
afterwards

363
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:48,529
there you go home so you know that's the

364
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,088
first step is is making sure it is what

365
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:51,500
it is I think in this end does exactly

366
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:53,029
what it says on the tin and in this

367
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,528
industry too many people did that

368
00:13:53,028 --> 00:13:57,009
backwards they tried to make it pretty

369
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:59,720
and then figure out how to make it work

370
00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:01,370
yeah yeah Superman

371
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,700
pick a solution and then try and find a

372
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:07,039
problem for it yes that's the other well

373
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,570
you've told us about the the 70 pound

374
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:12,528
unit what's the other unit you've got

375
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:15,860
available for us we have is the mind a

376
00:14:12,528 --> 00:14:20,870
plus and that has a screen on it and

377
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:22,490
that retails for 90 pounds so 50 dollars

378
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,970
I guess you're still very high that's

379
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,259
nice yeah and the nice thing about that

380
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,550
one is if you've got a sealed

381
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,870
environment for instance you can mount

382
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:31,698
it on the outside and then have the

383
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:34,159
leads running into into the environment

384
00:14:31,698 --> 00:14:36,559
so you could have one on the outside but

385
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,838
you can see what's going on and then you

386
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,000
could hang a couple of the other minder

387
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:44,089
units without the screens within the

388
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,019
space if you wanted to monitor more or

389
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:50,180
areas now how were how many square feet

390
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:51,860
would you recommend I hang each unit how

391
00:14:50,179 --> 00:14:53,599
far apart what I need them if I've got a

392
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,240
large room how many would I would you

393
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,980
recommend per square foot or so or I

394
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,980
guess you do a meter there I apologize

395
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:07,609
each sensor by its default I mean each

396
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:14,529
unit by default comes with two and a

397
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:18,050
half meter leads which is very Phoebe

398
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:19,730
yeah and we do them up to much longer

399
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:25,189
leads as well we do up to ten meters

400
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:27,500
which is about 30 okay so it really

401
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,570
comes down to how tight somebody wants

402
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:34,620
to be measuring it I guess each one

403
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:36,120
and I hang to me house that's three

404
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,799
meters wide but that's two of the

405
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,389
ambient ones and one it just each end of

406
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:41,069
the greenhouse a certain amount of

407
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:43,500
that's gonna refer depend on how much

408
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,260
airflow you've got moving around the the

409
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,659
room as well I mean I've got one in a

410
00:15:46,259 --> 00:15:51,120
five meter by four meter area and that

411
00:15:48,659 --> 00:15:54,029
gives me a relatively good a good

412
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,500
consistent reading so probably five

413
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,059
meters square would probably be good you

414
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,320
could possibly go a bit low but as I say

415
00:15:57,059 --> 00:16:00,149
it depends on how much airflow you've

416
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,010
got going around the room as well that's

417
00:16:00,149 --> 00:16:03,389
quite a large space to monitor that's uh

418
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:08,100
that's pretty impressive for one unit I

419
00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:10,500
like that I expected less space yeah I

420
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,420
mean I would yeah so most home growers

421
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,600
are gonna be able would get away with

422
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:18,839
just one unit exactly I mean and I think

423
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,519
most the customer base does that is

424
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,560
excellent that's excellent I could

425
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,730
probably get away with one maybe two in

426
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:28,829
almost all of my larger grow rooms and

427
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,230
then what you can also do with them I

428
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:33,210
mean a little sort of a nice bit which

429
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:34,529
is probably more relevant to to the US

430
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:39,900
actually because you've got multiple

431
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:41,879
time zones which we don't have here is

432
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,319
you can actually set each device to be

433
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:44,460
in its own time zone so when you're

434
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,770
looking at the data you're actually

435
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,060
seeing it relevant to the local time oh

436
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:50,279
that's not telling to do a mental

437
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:53,579
calculations if you had grow facilities

438
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:55,559
if you were if you own you know multiple

439
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:57,090
facilities and you wanted to be actually

440
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:59,429
keep a nice centrally on what was going

441
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:02,009
on in each one of them locally in local

442
00:16:59,429 --> 00:17:04,409
time we can Wheatley support there

443
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:07,319
straight away and then that's something

444
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:09,750
I haven't necessarily seen on others but

445
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:14,460
we hire a comedy comment emotion that's

446
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:18,900
a great feature sounds like when he has

447
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:20,660
a plane flying overhead indeed there's

448
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:28,259
plenty at h-hour

449
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:29,759
yeah and then the what these two perks

450
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:33,299
the mind and the mind of plus there are

451
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:35,099
entry level product and that's the ones

452
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:39,750
that we've gone to market with just

453
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:42,629
start but the real the crown jewel is is

454
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:44,369
the controller unit which allows you to

455
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:49,260
control

456
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:54,199
humidifiers dehumidifiers fans a CD

457
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:58,440
units heaters etc buy in response to

458
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:03,150
readings from the census so it comes

459
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:07,259
with four four sockets and we're close

460
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:08,550
to launching this in the UK and we've

461
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:10,200
have had a number of early adopters

462
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:11,399
you've taken this up and this is where

463
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:14,940
wheels for the US market and that's

464
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:16,470
where it gets really interesting is now

465
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,660
the ability to automate the controlling

466
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,039
of an environment so when the humidity

467
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,690
gets too low then it'll fire up my

468
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:23,399
humidifier and then when it gets to the

469
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,720
direct in turn that off and then if it

470
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,420
gets too high it'll put my dehumidifier

471
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,370
for me correct correct

472
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,679
excellent that's we can all use stuff

473
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:35,069
like that automation is key and mercial

474
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:39,030
grows yeah and again for the home girl

475
00:18:35,069 --> 00:18:41,099
we're which is you know the target

476
00:18:39,029 --> 00:18:43,349
market with the technology being able to

477
00:18:41,099 --> 00:18:48,000
scale up in terms of what it can control

478
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:50,579
in size and magnitude yeah a a

479
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,700
dehumidifier a probably the states like

480
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:56,069
a $50 you know there's three new lyric

481
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,289
humidifiers that only turn on I mean

482
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:59,700
that's switch it on you tell it how fast

483
00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:01,829
it needs to run and that's about the

484
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,539
only control you have over it you can't

485
00:19:01,829 --> 00:19:05,460
tell it to cut off at different humidity

486
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:08,399
right if you want that you're spending

487
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,279
like $500 on a humidifier that will know

488
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,470
who to turn off at 75% humidity need for

489
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:17,639
example there's a huge price difference

490
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:19,589
in those systems but with ours this now

491
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,600
allow somebody to take their thirty or

492
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:23,970
fifty dollar humidifier and make it

493
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,339
perform like in terms of functionality

494
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:28,440
like a five hundred dollar humidifier

495
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:29,939
but I'll turn on and off only when it

496
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,009
needs to come on and all that's gonna be

497
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:34,890
helpful I do have a price point in mind

498
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:38,339
for that unit when it's ready

499
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:40,710
um in the UK we're looking at 400 pounds

500
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,449
for theft unit okay and that's worth it

501
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:43,710
that's it may sound like a high number

502
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:46,380
but for something that's going to turn

503
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:48,509
on and off my devices well worth the

504
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,250
price there that's more affordable than

505
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:51,740
a major controller from a lot of the

506
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:54,180
larger brands here

507
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,720
well that will that also be controlling

508
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:00,660
the lights and all of the HVAC yes you

509
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,490
can ever to control it'll operate it

510
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,290
operates as a standalone unit as well if

511
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,900
you just had it completely stand-alone

512
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:10,559
it is like an agricultural time at SRI

513
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,290
will do lights pumps it's when you then

514
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,690
link it to one or more of the minor

515
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:18,690
units that you get the additional

516
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,279
functionality of okay I understand

517
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,080
that's the humidity in that space and

518
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,700
that's connected to this plug is

519
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,139
connected to the humidifier that runs

520
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:28,410
over there I need to turn it on or turn

521
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,330
it off excellent this is gonna be a

522
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:35,340
great unit you guys I'm excited to get

523
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:37,079

524
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:39,119
for we're looking for you know the

525
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:43,169
interest from the firm from the US

526
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:44,779

527
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,130
business perspective there are

528
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:49,139
opportunities to killya however there

529
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:52,620
are we looking to work with whoever we

530
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:57,630
can to make it happen these different

531
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:59,909
regulations in terms of electrical and

532
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,340
all sorts of fun funny games and I say

533
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:03,000
it's a great fun starting your own

534
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:04,500
business

535
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,809
oh I'm sure you get to amend it you get

536
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,920
to design a product and then master it

537
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:09,299
there and then before you send it to us

538
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,710
you have to redesign it because you have

539
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:17,099
to redo a few things I'm sure yeah and

540
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:21,210
there are 37 different plugs all around

541
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:22,949
the world so for me you're going for a

542
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,470
treaty global market you know when

543
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:28,049
that's 37 different plugs how far into

544
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:36,089
it were you before you realized 37 plugs

545
00:21:28,049 --> 00:21:38,129
were the option at that point yes you

546
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:39,000
had to buy all 37 plugs to figure them

547
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,140
out that's great

548
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,660
well I appreciate the work you've put

549
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:44,700
into it you guys when do we when can we

550
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,440
expect the controller unit to be

551
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,440
available for the US market

552
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:53,699
if everything goes according to plan

553
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,870
over the next few months probably

554
00:21:53,700 --> 00:22:01,710
looking towards Brad about early next

555
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:03,269
year okay but that's you know I would

556
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:06,179
much rather err on the side of caution

557
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:08,460
than know the optimistic

558
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:17,190
hey if any of the right investors who

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,470
things that can be done all of a sudden

577
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,720
with the US market it really it's

578
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:17,490
amazing I mean just speaking about that

579
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:21,500
looking at from over here there so it's

580
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:21,500
absolutely crazy to see what's going on

581
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:28,380
inspirational do you see any

582
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:37,409
legalization coming your way in your

583
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:39,960
guyses area I'm soon interesting mixed

584
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:42,000
bag because there's some economists is

585
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,519
saying within five years because of how

586
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:48,619
much the rest of the world is changing

587
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:52,589
and you know I don't know if it was

588
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:55,739
white Mike or guru and the do growth and

589
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:58,519
on the DG's he sure who said what first

590
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,019
accursed sales it's now exceeding

591
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:02,450
equivalent or exceeding cosmetic sales I

592
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:04,609
mean that's a big in this

593
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:05,750
yes that was that was minor when you

594
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,389
happen to the 50

595
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:11,390
I thought so when you up into the fifty

596
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:14,210
billion dollar market yeah the rest of

597
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,340
world starts to think maybe it's not so

598
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:20,930
evil maybe no it won't make you crazy

599
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:22,579
and actually no thought okay so I think

600
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:27,320
yeah I think it's interesting to see

601
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:28,819
with her talk that's honest we said the

602
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:31,460
same thing at the same time my friend

603
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:37,129
money does talk money's got the loudest

604
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:41,450
voice in the room every time when they

605
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:43,880
lose the tax on cigarettes I can't go

606
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,769
[ __ ] need to hear that somewhere else

607
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:47,930
yep and maybe that'll be your guys's way

608
00:24:45,769 --> 00:24:50,869
in because I'm sure that when they

609
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,759
legalize cannabis and your area you will

610
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:59,029
be in every grow room because you're

already ahead of the game you know giant

612

we've spoken to investors here as soon

637
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:16,189
as you talk about the US market and the

638
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:16,519
analogy with the gold mine room and you

639
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:18,019
know

640
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,058
rush in the green rush and the goldmine

641
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:22,669
equipment suppliers and that's what

642
00:26:20,058 --> 00:26:24,588
we're doing and we're in there you know

643
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:25,969
in scenaries support business we don't

644
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:27,618
touch the product at all you know we

645
00:26:25,969 --> 00:26:32,929
don't process it we don't touch it it's

646
00:26:27,618 --> 00:26:34,338
got nothing to do with that and what I'm

647
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:39,379
looking with you know to build into the

648
00:26:34,338 --> 00:26:43,219
system going forward is ability for your

649
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:45,829
home be able to select distrained from a

650
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:48,229
database see what the previous flowering

651
00:26:45,829 --> 00:26:51,019
time is and what the average uses

652
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:52,909
flowering time was they can select it

653
00:26:51,019 --> 00:26:55,489
till the system that's what I'm growing

654
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:58,579
I'm starting it on this date I want you

655
00:26:55,489 --> 00:27:01,129
to veg it for four weeks and then cut

656
00:26:58,578 --> 00:27:03,108
over to flower to whichever the reader

657
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:05,538
or the flowering and average user flower

658
00:27:03,108 --> 00:27:09,259
time for instance so you can really make

659
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:10,158
it easy for them in the system will do

660
00:27:09,259 --> 00:27:11,749
that it will just do the lighting

661
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,469
schedule for you for instance and they

662
00:27:11,749 --> 00:27:17,058
can set up their punch a jewel so where

663
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:18,139
the pumps are linked to the lighting

664
00:27:17,058 --> 00:27:19,128
[ __ ] you'll so if you change the

665
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:20,978
lighting [ __ ] you'll someth

666
00:27:19,128 --> 00:27:24,578
automatically address this you've said

667
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:27,229
never come on when the lights are off

668
00:27:24,578 --> 00:27:28,638
Iran has changed 15 different pump

669
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:32,028
timers because you've changed you like

670
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:34,008
it right automatically updates itself

671
00:27:32,028 --> 00:27:35,959
and follows it and that's gonna save a

672
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:39,108
grower time for a guy like myself who

673
00:27:35,959 --> 00:27:41,989
has 25 fans to go change they've all

674
00:27:39,108 --> 00:27:46,578
just adjusted themselves for me yeah

675
00:27:41,989 --> 00:27:47,538
exactly that's gonna save me time yeah

676
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:51,618
you're talking about

677
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:53,959
VPD well yeah that's the other bit that

678
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:55,578
comes into play is as the lights go over

679
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:58,759
all the temperature comes down humidity

680
00:27:55,578 --> 00:28:01,428
goes up VPD you know plummets for

681
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,378
instance and again if your humidifier

682
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,778
even a $500 humidifier

683
00:28:03,378 --> 00:28:07,728
I guess 500 humidifier it doesn't know

684
00:28:05,778 --> 00:28:11,259
that when the lights go off it needs to

685
00:28:07,729 --> 00:28:13,940
drop to 50% humidity just as an example

686
00:28:11,259 --> 00:28:15,378
from 75 to 50 when the lights are on you

687
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,729
need to keep it up here because of the

688
00:28:15,378 --> 00:28:17,928
increase in temperature and the like to

689
00:28:16,729 --> 00:28:21,828
get one of a feeling to drop it because

690
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:24,829
of the decrease in temperature again

691
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:26,298
that's something man Wow yeah this is

692
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:29,220
software that we're working on that's

693
00:28:26,298 --> 00:28:32,369
what it sells for the controller

694
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,000
the idea is be able to tell that I won

695
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:38,969
for the first five weeks that eligio

696
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,250
eight and for the next ten weeks VP of

697
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:43,319
sixteen and the system just takes care

698
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,819
of it for you in terms of monitoring

699
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:46,619
temperature and humidity that's pretty

700
00:28:44,819 --> 00:28:48,960
impressive that's gonna save me a lot of

701
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:51,629
time a lot of energy a lot of questions

702
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,430
I can go in before the flowering cycle I

703
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,380
can set up what I need and then I can

704
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:57,120
just know that it's all gonna happen for

705
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,500
me I don't have to ask one of the grow

706
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,839
Tech's to make sure to turn something

707
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,299
down or turn something off that's gonna

708
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:06,359
prevent a lot of error because humans

709
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:07,710
make mistakes hopefully we've taken that

710
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:09,839
out of the computers and they're not

711
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,039
going to make those mistakes so this is

712
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:12,839
one of the other things that we've

713
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,609
implemented as well is that you can set

714
00:29:12,839 --> 00:29:17,519
an alert so that way if your temperature

715
00:29:14,609 --> 00:29:18,779
does go above a particular level you may

716
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,339
be see goes from above a ticket

717
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:22,980
particular level you'll get an email

718
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:24,539
that tells you that it's high so you've

719
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:26,339
got chance to go and intervene and

720
00:29:24,539 --> 00:29:28,649
you'll get one of them at the moment

721
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:29,879
every 15 minutes so that where you get

722
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,560
reminded that there's a problem you've

723
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,750
got a chance to go fix it before any

724
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:34,980
damage gets done my way can get in the

725
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,599
car and drive right over there and

726
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,259
unplug those lights before they roast my

727
00:29:36,599 --> 00:29:42,629
plants exactly I love it or you can tell

728
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:44,700
I mean better still really what you can

729
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:46,140
do is you can just you should just go to

730
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,450
the website and tell the controller to

731
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,050
turn the lights off you didn't have to

732
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,710
get in the car

733
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:54,389
letting someone stay where that's a

734
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:56,579
standard feature you get with the minder

735
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:58,080
as well each of the minders other than

736
00:29:56,579 --> 00:30:00,389
just recording your data you can also

737
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:02,519
set your maximum and minimum temperature

738
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:04,020
and humidity and you'll get emails if it

739
00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:05,460
breaches either of them that is

740
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:07,559
excellent so I don't even have to drive

741
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:08,819
I can just say turn that off until I can

742
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:11,869
finish recording and then I'll go over

743
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:15,139
there and fix that absolutely I

744
00:30:11,869 --> 00:30:17,639
appreciate that you know for the you

745
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:21,230
know from a shops perspective what's

746
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:24,330
kind of nice is somebody can walk in and

747
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:25,799
they've got a problem with the growth at

748
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:27,359
home they can walk into the shop and

749
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:29,339
they can actually show the guy behind

750
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:31,139
the counter the data that they're always

751
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:32,279
asking for you know what's your

752
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:35,700
temperature and humidity being for the

753
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:37,049
last week and now they can show them so

754
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,840
instead of just you know standing there

755
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,339
looking at the guy gone missing like I

756
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:44,409
don't know

757
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:46,119
hot and not very humid you know not not

758
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,170
very accurate they can actually show

759
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:50,949
them that they can get a far better

760
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:53,080
analysis of what may be wrong it's been

761
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:54,460
from the consumers point of view spend

762
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,720
less money on trying to solve the

763
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,720
problem because we get it right the

764
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,250
first time and maybe reputationally

765
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,049
wires from the shops perspective is that

766
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:05,259
they're giving the right advice first

767
00:31:02,049 --> 00:31:06,849
part yes so the product the products are

768
00:31:05,259 --> 00:31:07,990
available online if people want to go

769
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:10,119
look for them

770
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:15,069
they can find you at Pio grow systems is

771
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:17,439
that correct peel grow dot systems all

772
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:19,659
right so that's where the the minder the

773
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,170
minder plus and coming soon the

774
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:24,970
controller unit will be available right

775
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:26,259
all right no the pressure is on you guys

776
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:28,000
cuz I just told everybody but that

777
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,740
controller unit is coming so you guys

778
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:40,240
got to get in the the workshop there and

779
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:42,308
stir soldering but we have a number of

780
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,900
early adopters you've been running it

781
00:31:42,308 --> 00:31:46,359
and are running it at the moment

782
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:50,590
and to help us make sure that we're

783
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:52,149
going down the right line with it from

784
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:53,558
everything I have seen you guys are

785
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,910
going down the right line the

786
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:57,369
improvements on the website have been

787
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:59,710
amazing the upgrade to the the second

788
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:02,019
system that you sent me was obvious the

789
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,480
minute it came out of the box the second

790
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:06,069
one was much more sturdy so I can see

791

we need to ship you the two new the

838
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:14,029
newest design once we'll send a couple

839
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,829
over and we'll throw in an extra mind a

840
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:18,619
unit that you can give away a surprise

841
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:20,269
to someone oh that sounds amazing

842
00:34:18,619 --> 00:34:22,099
I'm sure my listeners ession my

843
00:34:20,269 --> 00:34:23,148
listeners are already drooling for that

844
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:24,379
they're already waiting to figure out

845
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:25,969
how we're gonna do that so we'll set up

846
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:27,348
a giveaway I appreciate that more than

847
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:35,000
you even know that is gonna make

848
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:36,889
everybody really excited the other great

849
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,289
podcast as well it would be good to hear

850
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:44,000
more about you know where all the best

851
00:34:39,289 --> 00:34:46,308
ways of maintaining an environment what

852
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,539
are the tricks okay because it changes

853
00:34:46,309 --> 00:34:49,129
you know you know there's small

854
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:52,608
environments where people are growing in

855
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:54,798
spaces that are 3 feet by 2 feet and

856
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:56,838
that's keeping that regulated compared

857
00:34:54,798 --> 00:34:58,009
to something that's you know 30,000

858
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:00,630
square feet there's a very different

859
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:03,600
game I mean even up to you know 10 by 10

860
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,860
for just an idea you know that whole how

861
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,239
it changes and what are the tricks for

862
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:08,970
being you know try and maintain it

863
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,679
that's one of the ideal temperatures and

864
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:13,219
humidity is because this is where vpe

865
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:15,509
gets interesting is it can kind of throw

866
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:19,439
conventional thinking out the window

867
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:21,270
absolutely one blade you said that

868
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,900
because the next podcast I have written

869
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:26,369
is all about VPD so we'll go from VPD

870
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,260
and then we'll start talking about more

871
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:30,989
environmental controls from there so

872
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:39,300
perfect timing great suggestion I'm glad

873
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:41,489
you said that in our simulations once we

874
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:43,860
got the VPD dialed in and we main

875
00:35:41,489 --> 00:35:46,199
managed to maintain it so on our charts

876
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:48,900
you've got though the maximum ideal VPD

877
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:50,849
and the minimum VPD we've managed to

878
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,309
keep it pretty consistent between the

879
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:54,929
lines and within three days you can see

880
00:35:53,309 --> 00:35:56,909
the difference the plants are just

881
00:35:54,929 --> 00:35:59,369
they're more turgid they're preying up

882
00:35:56,909 --> 00:36:01,730
more it's such a significant difference

883
00:35:59,369 --> 00:36:07,650
when you can keep it in that zone the

884
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:10,380
ranges for the sake of clarity yeah the

885
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,480
minimum and maximum is suggested ve D is

886
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:14,579
precisely that it suggested we highly

887
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,510
recommend that you look into it yourself

888
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:21,719
before committing yes it is a minefield

889
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:24,750
a little bit of a leaf size and shape

890
00:36:21,719 --> 00:36:27,889
difference may affect your desired vpb

891
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:30,780
is something I've noticed yeah

892
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:32,359
all right gentlemen find out what what

893
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:34,620
the target numbers are for you're using

894
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:37,800
growing and then that's what you go from

895
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:40,139
out is purely an indicative minimum and

896
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:43,500
maximum yes something like like a

897
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:45,059
hydroponic lettuce versus aa something

898
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,099
that's not hydroponic I'm I don't want

899
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:50,460
to say cannabis but versus cannabis you

900
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:52,469
may have vastly different desired VPD so

901
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:55,429
pay attention to your plants and make

902
00:36:52,469 --> 00:36:57,869
sure you dial it in for your plants

903
00:36:55,429 --> 00:36:59,789
everything is a suggestion there are no

904
00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:02,539
hard fast rules when it comes to growing

905
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:04,679
cannabis well gentlemen I'm going to

906
00:37:02,539 --> 00:37:06,090
yeah we could chat for hours that's

907
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,669
where I was gonna say I'm gonna wrap up

908
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:10,410
