decent podcast in the last episode I

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,469
promised another grow lesson if you've

20
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:45,750
been following along you know I've been

21
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:48,270
doing a long series of grow lessons the

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,799
grow series started at episode 351 if

23
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:53,129
you haven't caught up I suggest you head

24
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:55,049
back to episode 351 an episode 351 we

25
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:56,759
set a goal for our garden and then we

26
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:58,288
move on to selecting a space for our

27
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:59,878
garden we also select the proper

28
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,429
equipment then we build the grow room

29
00:00:59,878 --> 00:01:04,259
then we talk about seeds and clones then

30
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:05,969
we veg our plants then we talk about a

31
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,100
few tricks and tips to get our plants up

32
00:01:05,969 --> 00:01:10,200
to speed for quality production and at

33
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,929
this point in my grow lessons it is day

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,450
one of flower it is time to flip our

35
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:18,420
crop from the vegetative phase into the

36
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,978
flowering phase of our grow so I'm gonna

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,600
press pause for a moment I'm going to

38
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:23,789
listen back to this intro and see how I

39
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,399
sound and when I come back we are going

40
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,118
to talk about flowering our new cannabis

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,100
garden

42
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:30,688
all right podcast rolled I apologize

43
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,489
that I do sound kind of crappy but the

44
00:01:30,688 --> 00:01:34,258
show must go on I've been promising this

45
00:01:32,489 --> 00:01:35,908
episode I may make this one kind of

46
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,640
quick and then recap next week and move

47
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,400
forward my original idea was to do a

48
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,989
three week chunk of flowering episodes

49
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,728
we would do week one through three and

50
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,009
then four through six and seven through

51
00:01:44,728 --> 00:01:48,899
nine but we are going to focus on day

52
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:50,310
one of week one today and then we will

53
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,618
adjust from there in the following

54
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,200
episodes so let's get started on

55
00:01:52,618 --> 00:01:57,118
flowering our cannabis garden what do I

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,879
mean by flowering we want to initiate

57
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,188
the budding phase the flowering phase

58
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:04,618
for regular cannabis plants is triggered

59
00:02:02,188 --> 00:02:06,508
by reducing the light cycle if you were

60
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:08,610
working with Otto flower plants you are

61
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,409
in a total different ballgame those

62
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,540
plants will flower when they are ready

63
00:02:10,409 --> 00:02:13,799
for this discussion we're going to focus

64
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:16,349
on regular photo

65
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,969
period plants and photo period seeds so

66
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:20,430
let's talk about flowering our photo

67
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:23,400
period garden initiating flower is very

68
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:26,340
easy all we do is reduce the timer to 12

69
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,129
hours on and 12 hours off we need 12

70
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,110
hours of uninterrupted darkness every

71
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:33,689
day to trigger these plants to flower

72
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,650
I've set up several times but I'm going

73
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:37,259
to repeat myself

74
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:39,750
we need total uninterrupted darkness

75
00:02:37,259 --> 00:02:42,209
during the night phase for our flowering

76
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,370
plants a little bit of light is too much

77
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,830
if you can see a pinprick of light

78
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,780
coming in that room it is too much light

79
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,610
if you can see your hand in front of

80
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,919
your face during the dark phase in that

81
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,390
room it is too much light those plants

82
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:56,489
know that that light is there they will

83
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,799
not go to sleep properly they will not

84
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,570
flower properly if they do try to flower

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,580
properly you give them the chance of

86
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:04,620
hermaphroditic on you in mid flower

87
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:06,690
which will produce seeds in your garden

88
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,030
which will ruin your whole goal so we

89
00:03:06,689 --> 00:03:11,819
need 100% total darkness in our

90
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,520
flowering room during the night phase so

91
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,319
switch the timer to 1212 be sure that

92
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,760
you have got total dark in that dark

93
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,469
phase you need to go in there and look

94
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,870
you probably need to hang out in the

95
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:24,449
grow room for about 15 to 20 minutes for

96
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,670
your eyes to adjust properly to identify

97
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,589
the most minimal light leaks you could

98
00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:30,869
possibly have so go in there and check

99
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:33,090
for light leaks on day 1 of flower if

100
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,580
you have any light coming in you need to

101
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:38,280
correct that that will ruin your garden

102
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,350
so we've set the timer to 1212 now it is

103
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,110
on for 12 hours a day and it is off for

104
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:45,659
12 hours a day put a lot of thought into

105
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:46,830
the hours which your lights run do you

106
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,239
want those lights to come on in the

107
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:49,709
morning when you wake up so you can

108
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,509
water the plants before you go to work

109
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:52,950
and then the plants are on all day while

110
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:54,149
you're gone at work hopefully you get to

111
00:03:52,949 --> 00:03:56,549
come home and check them out before the

112
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,140
lights turn off or do you want those

113
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,459
lights to come on in the evening right

114
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:00,988
when you get home from work and the

115
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:02,610
lights can run all night while your home

116
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:03,900
and you can check on everything maybe

117
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,220
you can get up before work and they're

118
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,330
still on you can check on them again

119
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:08,159
before you go to work and make sure

120
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,780
everything's cool I would put a lot of

121
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,909
thought into scheduling my flowering

122
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,080
cycle another thing to consider while

123
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,569
you're planning your schedule is

124
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,879
electricity is cheaper during off-peak

125
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,649
hours that means that during the

126
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:21,180
evenings when everybody goes home and

127
00:04:19,649 --> 00:04:22,918
they're chilling electricity gets

128
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,990
cheaper during the daytime business

129
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:26,699
hours when everybody's using all the

130
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,699
electricity The Electric Company does

131
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:30,069
charge you more

132
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:32,139
those peak hours what many folks will

133
00:04:30,069 --> 00:04:33,849
choose to do is run those lights during

134
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,979
off-peak hours and save money on

135
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,590
electricity this is also advantageous

136
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:40,000
because it is cooler during the evening

137
00:04:38,589 --> 00:04:41,709
so you don't have the Sun up keeping

138
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,360
your grow room extra hot you're not

139
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:45,279
heating the outside with the Sun and the

140
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,540
inside with the grow lights the Sun Goes

141
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,759
Down and gets a little cooler outside

142
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,200
you can use that cool outside air to

143
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,019
your advantage and keep the grow room

144
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,329
cool so think about your scheduling when

145
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:57,879
do you want that 1212 on cycle to be

146
00:04:55,329 --> 00:05:00,669
when do you want that 1212 off cycle to

147
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:03,129
be if you do decide to run your lights

148
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:06,040
at night and have your dark cycle during

149
00:05:03,129 --> 00:05:08,170
the natural light cycle be sure that no

150
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:10,840
sunshine is creeping into your grow room

151
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,210
during that night cycle again we need

152
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,129
total darkness a very common mistake is

153
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:16,449
that people flower their plants at night

154
00:05:15,129 --> 00:05:18,250
which means they are in the sleep cycle

155
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:20,469
during the day which means there's the

156
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,850
opportunity for the sunshine to sneak

157
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,950
into your grow room if you've got a

158
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:25,810
window if you've got a doorway if you've

159
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:27,550
got some kind of insecure structure you

160
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,500
can get light in there very easily and

161
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,730
it will destroy your crop so you've

162
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,019
thought about scheduling and you know

163
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,280
how it's going to work around your work

164
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:34,449
schedule you know how it's gonna work

165
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:35,829
around your life and you know when

166
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,000
you're going to flower these plants you

167
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:38,680
know when you'll have time to give them

168
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,839
maintenance and work on them and water

169
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,490
them so plan your scheduling around that

170
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,549
so we have set the timer to twelve

171
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:48,850
twelve that is day one of flower that

172
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:51,250
first short day is day one right that

173
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,840
day down to many people forget to write

174
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,160
that down and they don't know how long

175
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:57,449
their plants have been in flower

176
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,560
write down your flowering start date

177
00:05:57,449 --> 00:06:02,439
another thing I want to make clear is

178
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,959
this is day one of flower if you've got

179
00:06:02,439 --> 00:06:07,329
a package of seeds and it says takes 70

180
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,759
to 80 days to flower this is the first

181
00:06:07,329 --> 00:06:12,219
day of that 70 to 80 days of that

182
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,019
finishing time a lot of folks like to

183
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:16,540
start the flowering phase when they see

184
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:18,969
bud set starting when they see pre

185
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,590
flowers you are 12 days into flower by

186
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:23,440
then and you were ripping yourself off

187
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:25,779
flowering starts the day we change the

188
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:26,560
timer to twelve twelve that is day one

189
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:28,179
of flower

190
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,680
so we've now switched the timer to

191
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,480
twelve twelve the plants will be on for

192
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,699
twelve hours a day and off for 12 hours

193
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:35,680
they are going to start flowering let's

194
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:37,899
talk about the environmental conditions

195
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,699
we need to provide for our flowering

196
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,259
plants here at the beginning of flower

197
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,849
this will change

198
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,079
as the plants progress right now we

199
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,300
don't have any buds to worry about

200
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,219
they're much less opportunities for

201
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:49,990
mildew and molds to take hold because

202
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,760
when you get those chunky buds the

203
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,379
mildew likes to start in the middle of

204
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,180
those buds that's not really a worry

205
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:56,560
right now so we can have the humidity a

206
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:57,970
little higher at this point we can have

207
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,920
the temps a little higher at this point

208
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,630
but as we progress we are going to lower

209
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,640
the humidity and the temperature in our

210
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,250
flowering room to accommodate those big

211
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,620
chunky buds and to prevent problems so

212
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:11,350
at this phase of the game it would be

213
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:13,720
ideal to have your grow room between 70

214
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:15,490
and 80 degrees Fahrenheit I do not

215
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,980
recommend higher than 80 I do not

216
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:19,480
recommend to lower than 70 I understand

217
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,640
that you're struggling to keep your room

218
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,670
cool a lot of new growers have issues

219
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,009
keeping the grow room cool 84 is the max

220
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:29,170
you ever want to hit when you hit 85

221
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:31,539
degrees in higher your plants will stop

222
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,270
producing they will just go into a

223
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,800
stagnant dead slowdown mode how

224
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:37,149
productive do you want to be when it's

225
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,650
110 degrees outside

226
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:39,819
you just feel like [ __ ] you don't want

227
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:42,310
to do anything you don't want to move

228
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,050
the plants feel the same way the plants

229
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,459
can't move themselves to some shade the

230
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,470
plants can't grab some water and take a

231
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:49,449
drink those plants are stuck there so

232
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,180
give them the proper environment don't

233
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:53,860
go too hot don't go too cold at this

234
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,709
phase of the flowering cycle I would

235
00:07:53,860 --> 00:08:00,040
recommend 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit

236
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:01,959
during your lights on cycle now let's

237
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:03,850
talk a little bit about the humidity of

238
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:06,009
this grow room during the start of the

239
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:08,650
flowering phase I like to have about 40

240
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:10,089
to 50 percent humidity earlier I said we

241
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,979
don't have those big buds to worry about

242
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,359
so we've just got a bunch of lush happy

243
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:15,069
plants they're just in there sucking up

244
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,530
all that humidity and growing like crazy

245
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:21,129
so 40 to 50 percent relative humidity

246
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:23,859
and 70 to 80 degrees during your daytime

247
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:25,420
cycle if you really want to dial that in

248
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:28,090
I recommend you check out my episode

249
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:29,949
about vapor pressure deficit and that

250
00:08:28,089 --> 00:08:31,269
was episode number 314 if you're

251
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,370
interested in learning more about the

252
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,139
vapor pressure deficit which I find to

253
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:37,029
be very important when it comes to

254
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,309
dialing in the grow room perfectly

255
00:08:37,029 --> 00:08:41,409
VPD will really improve the productivity

256
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:43,750
of your plants if you understand it and

257
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:45,639
dial it in correctly so that is the

258
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:47,889
daytime condition we want 70 to 80

259
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:49,990
degrees during the day 40 to 50 percent

260
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,819
relative humidity let's talk about the

261
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:53,500
nighttime temperatures when we turn off

262
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,150
the light things are going to change in

263
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:56,009
that grow

264
00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,539
I try to keep the humidity right around

265
00:08:56,009 --> 00:08:59,340
the same levels at nighttime at this

266
00:08:57,539 --> 00:09:01,289
stage of flowering I want that forty to

267
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,629
fifty percent humidity during the night

268
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:05,339
cycle now during the night cycle I like

269
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:07,470
it to get a little bit cooler it

270
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:09,420
naturally cools off at night so I feel

271
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,009
like the plants probably enjoy a little

272
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:14,269
bit cooler of a temperature at night I

273
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:16,259
try not to go any more than 10 degrees

274
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,299
difference on a day and night

275
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:20,100
temperature that is called your diurnal

276
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:22,769
temperature variation and you don't want

277
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:25,500
that to sway more than 10 degrees so if

278
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:27,149
during your day cycle here at 75 you do

279
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,750
not want your night cycle to get any

280
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:32,340
lower than 65 degrees I would generally

281
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,529
try to keep it about 5 degrees

282
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:36,300
difference but I understand we're

283
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:37,919
building new grow rooms we are learning

284
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,649
our setups we're learning to dial these

285
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:43,620
rooms in 5 to 10 degrees is acceptable

286
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:45,590
for a diurnal temperature variation but

287
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,279
if you go any more than 5 to 10 degrees

288
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:48,960
differential in your day and night

289
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,669
temperature you will cause problems

290
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,379
within the plants the plants will be

291
00:09:50,669 --> 00:09:54,209
confused the plants will begin to grow

292
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:56,759
slowly and this is also a great way to

293
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,379
invite powdery mildew so try to keep

294
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,879
your temperature swings within 10

295
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,559
degrees from your day and nighttime

296
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:03,720
temperature now when you're walking

297
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,459
through the grow sometimes just reach

298
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,379
out and grab a plant and feel the

299
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,450
temperature of the plant as the plant

300
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:11,639
warm is the plant cold how does the

301
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,320
plant feel to your hands if the plants

302
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:14,759
feel really really cold they're probably

303
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,830
really cold and you could probably

304
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,240
increase the temperature of your room if

305
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,100
the plants feel like they're warm

306
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,409
they're probably warm you can probably

307
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:24,659
lower the temperature of your room in

308
00:10:22,409 --> 00:10:26,459
the future I do plan to do a discussion

309
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:28,500
on leaf surface temperature versus

310
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:30,780
ambient room temperature but we are not

311
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,220
there yet so let's stay focused here now

312
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,139
one thing I may have overlooked when I

313
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:36,720
talked about equipment is a hygrometer

314
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:38,759
and a thermometer or some sort of a

315
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,370
monitoring device to know what is

316
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:43,350
happening in our grow room at all times

317
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,019
most of us growers can probably afford

318
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,820
the hygrometer thermometer combo that

319
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:50,159
sits in the grow room and it marks the

320
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:52,050
humidity and temperature of the room but

321
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:53,969
it will also mark the highest and lowest

322
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:55,439
points of your humidity and temperatures

323
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:57,570
so you can find your peaks and your

324
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,970
valleys and identify the temperature and

325
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,379
humidity fluctuations in your room it's

326
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,240
always nice to know where the peaks and

327
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:04,710
valleys are but I like to have more data

328
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,210
I like to have something in the room

329
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:07,089
they can tell me what's going on at all

330
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,069
times

331
00:11:07,089 --> 00:11:10,539
for a reliable monitor that can keep you

332
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,708
up-to-date on what's happening in your

333
00:11:10,538 --> 00:11:13,688
grow room at all times

334
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:16,388
I would suggest something like APO grow

335
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:18,759
systems minder unit or perhaps a smart B

336
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,798
unit you can use both of those units to

337
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:22,599
monitor your grow room at all times you

338
00:11:20,798 --> 00:11:23,978
can pull up the data on your phone you

339
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,849
can see what's happening in the room in

340
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:26,619
real time

341
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:28,658
some of these types of units allow you

342
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,519
to actually plug in other devices and

343
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:32,048
trigger them from your smart phone so if

344
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,729
you were away you open up your

345
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:35,168
application you see that it's too warm

346
00:11:33,729 --> 00:11:36,729
in that room you can say hey let's just

347
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:38,019
easily turn on the air-conditioner you

348
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:39,459
can click a button on a tab on your

349
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:40,928
phone and it will fire up the

350
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:42,998
air-conditioner in your grow room and

351
00:11:40,928 --> 00:11:44,348
you can rescue your garden while you're

352
00:11:42,999 --> 00:11:45,639
at lunch hanging out with your friends

353
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:48,158
and you don't even have to leave the

354
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,649
table so my point is have some way to

355
00:11:48,158 --> 00:11:52,479
monitor the temperature and humidity in

356
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:54,129
your grow room at all times I like to

357
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:54,849
have a report of what happens when those

358
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:56,678
lights go off

359
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:58,719
you've been running that grow light for

360
00:11:56,678 --> 00:12:00,068
12 hours in that room you have created a

361
00:11:58,719 --> 00:12:02,079
lot of heat you have created a lot of

362
00:12:00,068 --> 00:12:03,728
energy all of that heat all of that

363
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,828
light energy has created humidity

364
00:12:03,729 --> 00:12:07,419
there's water rising up in the air now

365
00:12:05,828 --> 00:12:09,158
when we kill that light everything

366
00:12:07,418 --> 00:12:11,078
changes all of that humidity in the air

367
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:12,818
is no longer being heated it's got the

368
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:14,558
opportunity to start falling it becomes

369
00:12:12,818 --> 00:12:15,938
kind of thick in the grow room that

370
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:18,188
short time period while the room

371
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:21,129
stabilizes itself out from that change

372
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:23,978
is quite often the cause of many of our

373
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:26,379
powdery mildew and botrytis issues and

374
00:12:23,979 --> 00:12:27,879
many growers don't even know that that

375
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,499
is happening in the room at that time

376
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:31,298
they look at their hygrometer they look

377
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:33,399
at their thermometer they say oh it was

378
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:35,619
72 degrees in here that's acceptable oh

379
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,278
it was 45% humidity in here that's

380
00:12:35,619 --> 00:12:37,839
acceptable

381
00:12:36,278 --> 00:12:41,438
you don't realize that there was a point

382
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,539
where it was 78 degrees and about 82%

383
00:12:41,438 --> 00:12:44,948
humidity in the room and that's because

384
00:12:43,538 --> 00:12:46,149
we turned off that light all that

385
00:12:44,948 --> 00:12:48,338
moisture that was in the air is now

386
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:49,538
falling now the plants don't have light

387
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:50,859
anymore so they are starting to

388
00:12:49,538 --> 00:12:52,718
respirate a little bit they're letting

389
00:12:50,859 --> 00:12:54,639
out a little more moisture and all of

390
00:12:52,719 --> 00:12:56,619
that chaos can really cause problems for

391
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,658
our plants in that type of environment

392
00:12:56,619 --> 00:13:00,668
so my point is try to know what's

393
00:12:58,658 --> 00:13:03,129
happening environmentally in your rooms

394
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:05,019
at all times all right it feels like we

395
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:06,609
know what our environment should be like

396
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:09,879
let's talk a little bit about feeding

397
00:13:06,609 --> 00:13:11,589
our transitioning cannabis plants if you

398
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:13,389
are working in a no-till bed or you're

399
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,249
working with super soil there's no need

400
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,509
to adjust anything at this time just

401
00:13:15,249 --> 00:13:18,099
keep doing what you're doing you

402
00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,349
basically need to water the plants

403
00:13:18,099 --> 00:13:21,160
throughout the flowering cycle if you

404
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:23,110
plan on adding

405
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,818
a cover crop or a top dress or maybe

406
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,220
feeding some tees you will need to

407
00:13:24,818 --> 00:13:29,198
adjust your tees at this time I would

408
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,300
take the nitrogen products out and focus

409
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:33,789
more on the phosphorus and potassium at

410
00:13:31,299 --> 00:13:35,799
this time if you're running tees or top

411
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:37,509
dress or a cover crop now if you are

412
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:39,758
working with bottled nutrients you can

413
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,470
probably just swap out that veg bottle

414
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,839
and replace it with the flowering

415
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,610
nutrients most of the bottle nutrient

416
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,069
companies make it very easy to follow

417
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,930
their nutrient schedule so simply swap

418
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:51,458
out that veg bottle put in the bloom

419
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,698
bottle and everything should be good to

420
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,679
go

421
00:13:51,698 --> 00:13:55,240
the main difference in our feeding

422
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:57,219
schedule at this time is that we are

423
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,750
going to reduce the amount of nitrogen

424
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:00,759
and we are going to slowly start

425
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:01,659
increasing the amount of phosphorous and

426
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:04,089
potassium

427
00:14:01,659 --> 00:14:06,159
our plants take up approximately 80 to

428
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:08,199
90 percent of their nitrogen during the

429
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,240
veg phase once we switch them into

430
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,919
flower they're done sucking up nitrogen

431
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,610
and they want more phosphorous and

432
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:14,469
potassium

433
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,019
so they can build robust branches and

434
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:18,579
big fat buds so let's reduce the

435
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,159
nitrogen and start increasing the

436
00:14:18,578 --> 00:14:23,229
phosphorus and potassium that part

437
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:25,629
should mostly be covered by your base

438
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,089
nutrients if you're running a one bottle

439
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:30,129
based nutrient a 2-part or a 3-part you

440
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:32,560
should be getting the proper nitrogen

441
00:14:30,129 --> 00:14:34,509
phosphorus and potassium from your base

442
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,129
nutrients now there are a few more

443
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:38,769
things that these plants can use at this

444
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:40,629
phase I like to add silica when I am

445
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:42,519
mixing up my nutrient solution I always

446
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,360
put potassium silicates in the water

447
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,850
first

448
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:48,339
the potassium silicates go first then I

449
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,170
mix in my base nutrients these plants

450
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:52,240
can probably use cal-mag at this point

451
00:14:50,169 --> 00:14:54,729
in time I also like to give the plants

452
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,799
some sort of a root inoculants in flower

453
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,600
don't cut back the microbes keep them

454
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,129
going keep those roots growing strong

455
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,709
keep them healthy the plants will

456
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:05,019
continue to flourish in flower I also

457
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:07,659
like some enzymes those enzymes serve

458
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:08,948
several purposes the enzymes will

459
00:15:07,659 --> 00:15:11,049
basically help to keep the root zone

460
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:12,818
clean and they will also break down any

461
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:16,088
decaying root matter and turn that into

462
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:17,558
usable energy for my plants I also like

463
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:19,089
to add some carbohydrates the

464
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:22,360
carbohydrates serve a couple of purposes

465
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:24,160
those carbs will feed my microbes those

466
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,860
carbs will also give my plants energy

467
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,490
between the carbs the enzymes and the

468
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,199
mykos

469
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:31,808
my root zone is really healthy and

470
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:34,328
really active which will show up top at

471
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:34,899
the top of our plants so we are focusing

472
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:36,938
on knife

473
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:38,589
phosphorus and potassium at this stage

474
00:15:36,938 --> 00:15:40,028
we are shifting away from the nitrogen

475
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,790
more toward the phosphorus and potassium

476
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:44,619
it's always good to add cal-mag a little

477
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:47,349
bit of a root inoculant I like some

478
00:15:44,619 --> 00:15:49,209
enzymes always some carbs and to make

479
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:51,579
everything pop I would add a little bit

480
00:15:49,208 --> 00:15:53,438
of fulvic acid now if you've chosen to

481
00:15:51,578 --> 00:15:55,508
work with a specific bottled nutrient

482
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:57,759
company most of those companies have a

483
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,499
nutrient calculator on their website so

484
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,480
you can go to whatever nutrient

485
00:15:59,499 --> 00:16:03,308
company.com you can find their nutrient

486
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,230
calculator you can type in how many

487
00:16:03,308 --> 00:16:06,610
weeks are going to flower you can click

488
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:08,649
on which products of theirs you have

489
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:11,129
purchased and it will tell you week by

490
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,839
week how much of each product to use

491
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,730
most of those charts are reliable but

492
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,709
keep in mind they want you to continue

493
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:20,230
buying products so they may recommend

494
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:23,078
you use a little more than necessary for

495
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:26,139
an ideal crop situation I generally

496
00:16:23,078 --> 00:16:29,349
reduce the recommended dosage by about

497
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:31,119
25 percent if it says to feed 100

498
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,550
milliliters of your base product I would

499
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:35,740
start off with 75 milliliters and see

500
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:37,448
what happens we can always feed the

501
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,100
plants a little more later but we can

502
00:16:37,448 --> 00:16:41,498
never take out the feeding once we've

503
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,970
put it in so don't burn the plants wait

504
00:16:41,499 --> 00:16:44,709
for them to show you that they are happy

505
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:45,069
or that they're angry and adjust from

506
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:47,498
there

507
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:49,328
most of these nutrient companies offer a

508
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:51,009
fairly balanced diet within their own

509
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:52,688
product line you shouldn't have to reach

510
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:54,159
out to another brand or another company

511
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:57,730
and fill in anything that they are

512
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:59,980
missing if you do choose to mix nutrient

513
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,259
lines be very careful that you don't

514
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:04,328
double up on anything when nutrient

515
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:06,038
company a made their product lines they

516
00:17:04,328 --> 00:17:07,688
made five bottles and they put the base

517
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,730
notes in one they put the cal mag in the

518
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:11,470
other they put the humic acid in another

519
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,149
and a bloom booster and another they

520
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,828
know what is in each bottle and they can

521
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:16,599
recommend your feeding because they know

522
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:19,480
they're not going to overdose anything

523
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:21,969
with their design when you introduce a

524
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,980
product from another company you run the

525
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:26,048
risk of doubling up on specific

526
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:28,419
nutrients nutrient company a and

527
00:17:26,048 --> 00:17:30,548
nutrient company B did not talk to each

528
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:32,380
other about their designs so you may be

529
00:17:30,548 --> 00:17:34,269
running a base product from nutrient

530
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,429
company a then you may have a bloom

531
00:17:34,269 --> 00:17:38,710
booster from nutrient company B those

532
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:40,330
companies didn't talk company a was

533
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:41,980
putting cal-mag inside their base

534
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:44,168
nutrient to help you out and save you

535
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:46,000
with the bottle company B was putting

536
00:17:44,169 --> 00:17:47,288
the cal-mag inside the bloom booster to

537
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,009
help you out save a bottle and you

538
00:17:47,288 --> 00:17:49,900
didn't know that

539
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:51,730
so now you just spent two doses of Cal

540
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:53,620
mag because you combined nutrient

541
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,240
companies and didn't read the bottles so

542
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:56,709
if you choose to use products from two

543
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,500
different companies be sure not to

544
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:00,730
overlap with any nutrients if you know

545
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,619
what's in each product and you

546
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,940
understand how the plants use each of

547
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:05,619
those products and you're not going to

548
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,450
cause any problems there is nothing

549
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:09,428
wrong with combining nutrient companies

550
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,870
if you feel like the brand you were

551
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:12,490
using is lacking something

552
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:14,349
feel free to purchase another product

553
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,929
from another company and add that into

554
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:19,539
your mix as long as you don't double up

555
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:20,769
any specific elements a good example of

556
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:22,539
what I'm talking about is in a

557
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:25,690
commercial environment I like to run veg

558
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:27,579
bloom powder nutrients in my opinion veg

559
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:30,279
bloom could use a little bit of fulvic

560
00:18:27,579 --> 00:18:31,689
acid added to the mix in my opinion veg

561
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:33,759
bloom can use a little bit of

562
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,769
carbohydrates added to the mix later in

563
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,750
flower so I am comfortable adding those

564
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,429
products and I've done my research I

565
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:41,919
know how much carbs I know how much

566
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:43,780
fulvic acid is in my starting product so

567
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,410
I know that I'm not going to overdose my

568
00:18:43,779 --> 00:18:46,450
plants

569
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:47,950
alright I'm confident that we understand

570
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,870
the environment I'm confident that we

571
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,789
understand what to feed the plants let's

572
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:54,219
talk about some more techniques to do at

573
00:18:51,789 --> 00:18:57,129
the very start of flower if you are

574
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,259
using sprayed pesticide applications now

575
00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:01,360
is a great time to apply a pesticide

576
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:03,220
application we are running out of time

577
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,289
for sprays we were going to start

578
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,990
developing bud sites very soon so we

579
00:19:05,289 --> 00:19:10,298
need to treat these plants today let's

580
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:12,519
apply a preventive product to our plants

581
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:14,829
to ensure we do not get any pests in our

582
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:16,808
veg cycle if you are not going to use

583
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:18,609
spray pesticide applications now is a

584
00:19:16,808 --> 00:19:20,319
good time to release your beneficial

585
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:22,779
insects we want to get them colonized

586
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:25,149
and built up in the grow before other

587
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:27,279
insects have an opportunity to take hold

588
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,809
in our flowering garden once the plants

589
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:31,240
are flowering we don't have a lot of

590
00:19:28,808 --> 00:19:33,789
options for pest control so let's do

591
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:36,490
everything we can now to prevent a pest

592
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:39,009
infestation while we have big chunky

593
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,319
buds so I would treat for pests at this

594
00:19:39,009 --> 00:19:43,720
time spray pesticides if that is your

595
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:46,000
approach another thing I like to do on

596
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,069
day one a flower is trellis my plants in

597
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,558
a commercial environment I am NOT able

598
00:19:48,069 --> 00:19:52,839
to move my veg plants into a room and

599
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,579
trellis them I have a veg room and I

600
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:56,949
have flowering rooms the flowering rooms

601
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:59,319
are constantly flowering so I can't veg

602
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,269
in that room so I moved the plants into

603
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:01,839
the flowering area and I put the trellis

604
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:04,210
up on

605
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,308
day one and I bend and pop and work

606
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:08,740
those plants into the net on day one

607
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:10,750
this gives them plenty of time to

608
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,880
recover from the stress of getting beat

609
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:15,159
up while they transition to the

610
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,720
flowering phase we've got about 7 to 10

611
00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:18,340
days where they're just transitioning

612
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,350
there won't be anybody won't be any

613
00:20:18,339 --> 00:20:22,089
major activity so if we beat them up on

614
00:20:20,349 --> 00:20:23,859
day one we've got plenty of time to

615
00:20:22,089 --> 00:20:26,139
recover so I like to get in there and

616
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:28,719
get them under the trellis I also do

617
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:30,850
popping and twisting which is also known

618
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,679
as super cropping I've talked about this

619
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:34,928
in depth in other episodes but I'll give

620
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:37,269
you a quick rundown I start at the very

621
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:38,019
bottom stalk of the plant where it comes

622
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:39,639
out of the dirt

623
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:41,950
I grab the base of the stalk with my

624
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,870
left hand I put my right hand above that

625
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:46,750
and I grab the stock and I twist my

626
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:48,939
right hand counterclockwise you'll hear

627
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:50,288
a pop sounds kind of like a knuckle

628
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,610
popping I pop my knuckle into the

629
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:53,648
microphone I don't know if it picked up

630
00:20:51,609 --> 00:20:55,389
you'll hear a little pop sound that is

631
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:57,819
the sound you're looking for you just

632
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:00,669
want to break the cellulose structure of

633
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:02,319
that plant so I'll break it once then

634
00:21:00,669 --> 00:21:03,909
I'll move my left hand from the bottom

635
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:05,648
right up above my right hand and I'll

636
00:21:03,909 --> 00:21:07,809
give it another break then I'll move up

637
00:21:05,648 --> 00:21:09,819
and give it another break I work my way

638
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,470
up the main stem all the way until it

639
00:21:09,819 --> 00:21:13,379
gets real thin and I feel like I could

640
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,329
cause problems by snapping it up there

641
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,500
once I've done the main stalk I go back

642
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:19,449
down to the bottom of the plant and I

643
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,700
find the lowest branch and I work that

644
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:24,069
branch all the way up then I work every

645
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,899
single branch on every single plant this

646
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:28,178
takes hours in a commercial environment

647
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:29,889
your hands will be sore but the plants

648
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:31,179
will thank you for it in the future

649
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,799
right now they look like they got

650
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:34,809
twisted they got a little bit beat up

651
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,548
but in a few days all of those twists

652
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:38,769
will create what looks like a knuckle it

653
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:40,298
will make the plant more robust it will

654
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:42,158
make it stronger it will give it more

655
00:21:40,298 --> 00:21:43,898
strength I feel like those thicker

656
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
stalks can move more nutrients which

657
00:21:43,898 --> 00:21:47,139
makes a more productive plant I feel

658
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,898
like a bigger stock can hold up a bigger

659
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,330
bud so we are working those plants to be

660
00:21:49,898 --> 00:21:54,339
more robust by cracking them they heal

661
00:21:52,329 --> 00:21:56,019
themselves and they become stronger so I

662
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:58,119
like to do popping and twisting at this

663
00:21:56,019 --> 00:22:01,210
time I also like to do a nice

664
00:21:58,119 --> 00:22:03,189
defoliation on day one of flower take

665
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:05,200
out all that excess leaf we don't need

666
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,450
it while I'm there I like to clean up

667
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,519
the bottoms quite a bit take off some of

668
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:11,350
the crappy bottom branches take off some

669
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,210
of those sucker branches take off all

670
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:14,980
the bottom leaves we don't need a lot of

671
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,660
that crap on the bottom of our plan

672
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:18,819
it's some people like to wait a little

673
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,620
bit later closer to week 2 to do the

674
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:22,178
bottoming and the wall-e popping I like

675
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,750
to do it early in a commercial

676
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:24,280
environment

677
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:26,470
things will get ahead of you so if you

678
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:28,690
don't start it right away it gets really

679
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:30,160
easy to fall behind very quickly and in

680
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,860
a commercial environment that only

681
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,660
compounds so on day 1 I move the plants

682
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:36,789
into the flower room I set up the

683
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,200
trellis I give the plants a nice pop and

684
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:40,149
twist and work them into the trellis

685
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,009
I'll do some defoliating I like to do a

686
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,630
bunch of bottoming and lolli popping and

687
00:22:42,009 --> 00:22:45,910
then right before we leave for the night

688
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:48,580
we give the plants a nice pesticide

689
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:51,759
spray another important thing to think

690
00:22:48,579 --> 00:22:54,009
about at this transitional time is bulbs

691
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,410
what kind of bulbs are you going to use

692
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:57,940
for flowering I usually recommend a

693
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,529
metal halide for vegging and a

694
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,110
high-pressure sodium for flowering

695
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:04,210
lighting technology has advanced so far

696
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:06,399
in recent years that you may be using

697
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:08,769
LEDs you may be using ceramic metal

698
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,140
halides there are tons of options but

699
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:13,808
consider changing your spectrum early in

700
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:15,700
the flowering phase one useful trick I

701
00:23:13,808 --> 00:23:17,678
have learned to help reduce the early

702
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,110
flower stretch is to leave the metal

703
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,240
halide bulbs in for the first two weeks

704
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:23,558
of flowering a lot of people will swap

705
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,390
out the metal halides for the high

706
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:27,250
pressure sodium Zonday one of flowering

707
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:29,290
I have learned that if you leave those

708
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:31,480
howards in there for two weeks your

709
00:23:29,289 --> 00:23:33,700
plants will not stretch as ridiculously

710
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,110
when you initiate flower that is natural

711
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:37,808
for plants to stretch they just want to

712
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:40,269
take off but cracking them popping them

713
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:42,519
twisting them and keeping in that metal

714
00:23:40,269 --> 00:23:45,039
halide will drastically slow down that

715
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,900
stretch all right podcast rolled I feel

716
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,730
like we have a good solid foundation on

717
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:51,429
transitioning our plants from veg to

718
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:53,710
flower at this point if you are growing

719
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,780
from seeds you will need to keep a close

720
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:56,980
eye on the plants and look out for males

721
00:23:55,779 --> 00:23:58,660
you will need to look out for

722
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,700
hermaphrodites and you will need to pay

723
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,470
attention for mutants if you've got a

724
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,970
plant in there doing some weird [ __ ] you

725
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:06,190
need to decide if you want to keep it or

726
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,650
let it finish sometimes those mutant

727
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:10,269
plants put off amazing products they are

728
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,919
also a pain in the ass to grow and they

729
00:24:10,269 --> 00:24:13,869
are problematic so sometimes it's not

730
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,759
even worth it so if you've got a mutant

731
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,829
it is up to you to decide what to do

732
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:20,169
another thing we need to stay on top of

733
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:21,730
is scouting for insects yes we did just

734
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:23,590
apply some pesticides we may have

735
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,360
released some predator bugs but that

736
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:27,899
does not mean that we are bulletproof

737
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:30,359
always be scouting for pass

738
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,310
every day as you walk through the grow

739
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:33,689
just to go from one end to the other to

740
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,399
go get the scissors you forgot down

741
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:37,799
there or to go find the broom just

742
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,330
glance at the plants as you walk by that

743
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:41,609
is when I make the most random

744
00:24:39,329 --> 00:24:43,079
discoveries I'm not even looking for

745
00:24:41,609 --> 00:24:44,189
something I was just walking by and I

746
00:24:43,079 --> 00:24:45,869
said what the hell is that out of the

747
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,820
corner of my eye now I know there's a

748
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:49,529
problem now we can solve it always be

749
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,569
paying attention always be scouting for

750
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,410
bugs and problems in the grow keep your

751
00:24:51,569 --> 00:24:54,089
eyes open

752
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:55,740
we need to look for hermaphrodites we

753
00:24:54,089 --> 00:24:56,970
need to look for males we need to look

754
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:59,970
for mutants and we need to pay close

755
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:01,440
attention for signs of pests all right

756
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:03,029
podcast world I can feel the cold

757
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,529
medicine that I took starting to kick in

758
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:06,210
my face is going numb my nose is

759
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:07,920
starting to run kind of weird I need to

760
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,960
wrap up this podcast before I get too

761
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,279
lit to be on a microphone I want to
