of the people listening we got to keep

35
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,719
in mind it's a podcast this will live

36
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:17,420
forever most of the people listening

37
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:20,129
currently are aware that we are under

38
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:22,140
stay at home orders from our government

39
00:01:20,129 --> 00:01:23,459
there's a high risk yeah please stay

40
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,280
home help us out there's a virus

41
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:28,169
spreading and it is causing Asteria and

42
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,150
illness and death and so we've been

43
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,310
asked to stay home Mike lives across

44
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,380
town and he's also got two young

45
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,850
children and a family so Mike doesn't

46
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:37,349
need to get me sick I don't need to get

47
00:01:35,849 --> 00:01:39,059
Mike and his kids sick we're trying to

48
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:40,319
be good citizens we're gonna stay at

49
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,090
home so we're gonna do some shows from

50
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,679
zoom I'm sure most of the people are

51
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,030
doing yeah we're gonna get creative here

52
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,350
I'm sure most of the people are doing

53
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,700
[ __ ] from home they're gonna be excited

54
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:50,759
just to have content while they're on

55
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,710
the home stay so if like Mike said if we

56
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,879
do get any weird audio glitches we'll

57
00:01:52,709 --> 00:01:55,618
get it figured out this is our first

58
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:58,349
time trying to forgive us our trespasses

59
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,670
I think I'm pretty good at tech gear and

60
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:03,328
editing so we'll make this sound all

61
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,710
right it sounds great that sounds good

62
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:05,938
my head but who knows what it's doing in

63
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:07,379
the recording gear maybe we should look

64
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,579
at that and see that that's happening

65
00:02:07,379 --> 00:02:09,989
dude that looks good too I think we're

66

100
00:03:26,229 --> 00:03:30,429

104
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:39,069
was unlike you how hard you went in your

105
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,870
shopping spree today I I kind of

106
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,840
chuckled and like I've been good for

107
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,459
quarantine I've I've really only left

108
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:52,360

109
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:53,769
March and run it yeah my birthday I had

112
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:01,000

115
00:04:05,289 --> 00:04:08,109
shopping let's I'm gonna segue right

116
00:04:06,489 --> 00:04:10,049
into that actually let me tell everybody

117
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:12,549
what I'm smoking I also am smoking

118
00:04:10,049 --> 00:04:15,189
apothecary Farms concentrates I just hit

119
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:16,959
Malibu pure Kush ambrosia the package

120
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:18,910
says seventy two point nine percent THC

121
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,209
eighty four point seven percent total

122
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,620
cannabinoids the Malibu pure cush tastes

123
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:24,439
like cush I know that sounds like a

124
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,899
stupid ass

125
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,480
if you're not a cush smoker but it is

126
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:33,049
exactly what I expect from a good cush

127
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,939
it's got that earthy funky nastiness and

128
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,189
the Malibu has a little sweetness to it

129
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,930
so that's the cush I was gonna ask about

130
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:40,879
your shopping experience you said you

131
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,590
went to the dispensary today how well

132
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:47,060
was that how did it happen and how

133
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:50,479
different is it for normal I got I'm

134
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:53,209
shopping med so med still allowed in the

135
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,970
stores basically a normal shopping I was

136
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:59,029
in a mask which was odd

137
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,030
I was the compliance guy for a long time

138
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:03,589
for a couple different outfits and so

139
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:05,299
the different rules we play by here in

140
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:07,519
Colorado are kind of always in my head

141
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,560
and having my face covered the whole

142
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,799
time it was just alarm bells going off

143
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,189
of my head rule seven rule seven it's

144
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,400
really was not a real no but anybody

145
00:05:16,189 --> 00:05:21,050
who's deals with the they want your ID

146
00:05:19,399 --> 00:05:22,789
checked two or three times in the

147
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,110
dispensary when you check-in the guy at

148
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,819
the door or the gal at the door or the

149
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:27,410
non-binary gender person at the door

150
00:05:25,819 --> 00:05:29,329
checks in your ID and they go oh that's

151
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,160
you it looks like you the eye color the

152
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,479
height the [ __ ] hair color the hair

153
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,830
color doesn't even matter now we've all

154
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,840
got everyone's got [ __ ] rainbow hair

155
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:37,250
for the eyes and the [ __ ] height look

156
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:38,389
kind of like you the picture looks like

157
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,040
you it says you're old enough you can

158
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:43,069
shop in our store then when you go back

159
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,480
to shop they pass your ID to the person

160
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:46,819
who is serving you we call them a

161
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:49,160
budtender and they verify you again just

162
00:05:46,819 --> 00:05:50,629
because if they sell to you and you're

163
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,360
not old enough or you're not a medical

164
00:05:50,629 --> 00:05:54,889
marijuana patient they can they're being

165
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,509
charged with a crime they just illegally

166
00:05:54,889 --> 00:06:00,649
sold a controlled substance to you so

167
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:02,329
they'll double check that ID shouldn't

168
00:06:00,649 --> 00:06:03,739
be people in jail we've got friends who

169
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:08,209
have ended up in jail because of weird

170
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:11,180
things and because of the the increased

171
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:14,449
penalties the compliance rate is over

172
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:17,060
90% for comparison with tobacco it's

173
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:20,199
usually in the high 80s or mid to high

174
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:22,850
80s and so we're several points up with

175
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,189
with the increase for the cannabis sales

176
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:26,419
because those girls are harsher so

177
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:28,069
you're in the dispensary you've got

178
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:30,949
gloves you've got a mask

179
00:06:28,069 --> 00:06:33,050
I didn't glove up I was however carrying

180
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:35,810
a disinfecting that's the I remember the

181
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:39,110
wiping their story it's

182
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:40,910

dispensaries are different I've been to

206
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,089
uh if you watch the recreational so you

207
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,469
were there I was glad I was shopping

208
00:07:38,089 --> 00:07:46,819
because there was no line the REC line

209
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,650
was substantial everybody in their cars

210
00:07:46,819 --> 00:07:50,750
I didn't count the cars but there were

211
00:07:48,649 --> 00:07:52,099
more than a few so you sit in their cars

212
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,889
they're not allowed to go inside the

213
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,110
store now right yep it's all they're

214
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:59,000
doing all drive up at the store I was at

215
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,520
yeah so you've got to I had a friend who

216
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,199
went in your order gotta call it in tell

217
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:04,609
that you go to weed Maps weed map shows

218
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,709
the current menu it's got good pictures

219
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,879
of the product you go to weed Maps see

220
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:09,319
what you want you write down a little

221
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:10,728
list you give them a call you say hey I

222
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:12,918
want this and they tell you come in 15

223
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:14,149
to 30 minutes and then when you go they

224
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:15,799
ask you your name and they've got it

225
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:18,349
bagged up with a receipt stapled to the

226
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,139
bag you give them cash they run inside

227
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:21,950
they would come out with your change

228
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:23,418
honestly you just tell them keep the

229
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:24,680
change you try to map it out right it's

230
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:26,538
looking a hundred bucks to give them a

231
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,370
120 or 110 you tell them have a good day

232
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:30,019
and you send them on their way then they

233
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,610
bring out your bag and you don't even

234
00:08:30,019 --> 00:08:34,639
have to get out of the car right now

235
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:36,349
dude I wish I kinda wish they could keep

236
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:40,158
it like that forever because that would

237
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:42,740
just nice there when we legalized

238
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:46,759
cannabis in Colorado we agreed to a lot

239
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:48,169
of rules just to placate the people who

240
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:52,490
were against us

241
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:55,039
we agreed to a lot of over and above and

242
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,959
I think a lot of that is gonna get

243
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,370
dialed back during this I think that's

244
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,309
gonna be one of the little [ __ ] up

245
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:04,549
silver lining Oh lockdown whatever good

246
00:09:01,309 --> 00:09:06,919
I think we're gonna slowly you know as

247
00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:08,539
we come out of this some of the rules we

248
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:10,879
change to deal with this they're gonna

249
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:13,639
have to justify going back to the way it

250
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:17,088
was like curbside pickup at dispensaries

251
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:18,620
is wonderfully convenient as a parent

252
00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:20,750
it's a kind of a pain in the ass because

253
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,429
I've if I'm out of the house there's an

254
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:25,519
80% chance I've got kids in the back of

255
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:27,229
the car and I can't take kids into a

256
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,389
dispensary they physically can't enter

257
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:30,949
the building right and it's not like

258
00:09:29,389 --> 00:09:32,600
there's consumption happening there

259
00:09:30,948 --> 00:09:36,919
because nobody's got a tasting room

260
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,269
permit yet but it's it's always been

261
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:40,278
sort of an over and above rule we've

262
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:44,839
dealt with in the curbside pickup gets

263
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:46,250
around that so well so your kids are the

264
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,870
age now to where you can take them to

265
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,149
the dispensary how long until you think

266
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,528
that runs out depends on the

267
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,448
communication between you and your kids

268
00:09:51,528 --> 00:09:55,698
as things evolve right well I'm not

269
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:58,639
really like they know about the world

270
00:09:55,698 --> 00:10:00,769
and the cannabis in the world and so

271
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,399
like as they grow up it's just gonna be

272
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:05,839
like that's the thing that adults do

273
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,089
that's I never thought of I haven't put

274
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,279
my brain in that perspective but the

275
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:12,199
kids after my daughter my daughter's 16

276
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:13,879
the kids after that are gonna grow up

277
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:16,789
with normalized cannabis it's gonna be

278
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,500
just like when whoever used to stop on

279
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:20,328
the way to the beach or on the way to

280
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:21,828
wherever and grab a six-pack of beer now

281
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:23,448
you stop and grab a couple of pre-war

282
00:10:21,828 --> 00:10:24,588
pre-rolls or an eighth or whatever it's

283
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:25,939
just part of life now that's kind of

284
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,790
great thanks Mike I'm glad you opened my

285
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,670
brain to that my belief on the subject

286
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:33,860
is kind of based on my interpretation of

287
00:10:31,669 --> 00:10:36,740
when I first found out about pot and I

288
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:39,860
was like you kept it secret until now

289
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:41,180
that's weird like there's all kinds of

290
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,009
dangerous [ __ ] you don't want me doing

291
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:46,759
in the world but like this one was a

292
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:51,259
secret till now why I've got to get my

293
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:52,909
hands on some of this [ __ ] and I want to

294
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:56,179
see what happens to society when that

295
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:58,039
goes away when it's just like Oh what

296
00:10:56,179 --> 00:11:00,349
are those guys doing oh there's a thing

297
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,399
in the world called cannabis and if you

298
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:04,700
smoke it

299
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,179
it's fun and adults do it just like beer

300
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,480
just yeah why'd you jumping or whatever

301
00:11:08,179 --> 00:11:16,870
else like [ __ ] that adults do the kids

302
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:20,750
shouldn't yeah take a weirdness away

303
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:22,549
maybe that's part of why I wasn't super

304
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,169
I was never afraid of cannabis I grew up

305
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:25,849
you guys have heard about my uncle's on

306
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:28,159
the podcast several times they just used

307
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,600
to smoke like it was nothing and so I

308
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,889
just grew up like it was that's just

309
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,269
what you do like before you go to the

310
00:11:30,889 --> 00:11:36,350
baseball game you [ __ ] burn one down

311
00:11:32,269 --> 00:11:40,069
on the car it's so fun we've come so far

312
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:41,600
since we were kids isn't like things we

313
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,150
can get away with doing around each

314
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,370
other like there's a great picture that

315
00:11:44,149 --> 00:11:47,899
goes around on Facebook of like an eight

316
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:50,360
year old blowing out the candles on her

317
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,159
cake and there's like six beers and an

318
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,450
ashtray and a cigar like three

319
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:56,449
cigarettes in the frame

320
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:58,100
all right around on top of this kid you

321
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,190
couldn't do any of that now but when we

322
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:03,230
were kids it was comment like oh ya know

323
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,670

pod on patreon and also we were going to

set Mike up a patreon campaign so we'll

401
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,110
get that going over the next episode we

402
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,639
should probably just press pause and do

403
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,899
it but we'll keep moving right now

404
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,299
we'll make it real easy for you to find

405
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,370
it'll probably just search for white

406
00:14:50,299 --> 00:14:53,569
Mike on patreon it's something like that

407

funding something like that yeah we'll

410
00:15:01,339 --> 00:15:05,000
get it going but Mike wasn't confident

411
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,360
in doing the patreon but since I've said

412
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,649
it on the show now it's gonna happen

413
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,659

about XII Boyd all this kovat stuff and

421
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,980
I wasn't sure how big of a deal it was

422
00:15:25,789 --> 00:15:28,789
it annoyed me it frustrated me Mike

423
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,960
called me earlier

424
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:36,259
the first thing he said was you see

425
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:38,870
these [ __ ] idiots yeah there are

426
00:15:36,259 --> 00:15:39,679
people in Denver surrounding the Denver

427
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:42,110
Capitol building

428
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,659
protesting be stay at home orders for

429
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:47,480
the kovat 19 protective orders

430
00:15:44,659 --> 00:15:51,199
protective measures that's kind of silly

431
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,740
yeah don't do that like well my whole

432
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,450
take is like what if you're wrong like

433
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,190
like that's just been one of its like if

434
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:02,060
you're gonna advocate for major [ __ ]

435
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:04,280
like I get that it sucks I [ __ ] hate

436
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:06,529
it too but what if you're wrong yeah

437
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,360
what if [ __ ] wrong and you're out

438
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:11,240
there getting everybody out there sick

439
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,590
like I know like a lot of people that

440
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,169
have businesses want to get their [ __ ]

441
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:17,480
open right away but like have you taken

442
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:20,059
a minute to imagine what it would feel

443
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,180
like to read the headline like my

444
00:16:20,059 --> 00:16:28,789
business in facts 50 people kills three

445
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:30,679
people yeah that your business can't be

446
00:16:28,789 --> 00:16:33,559
open right now or that you can't do you

447
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:42,379
think can't go enjoy whatever activity

448
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:44,359
you take your vacation or yeah yeah if

449
00:16:42,379 --> 00:16:46,610
we don't stay home and stop volleying

450
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,080
the virus the virus will keep bouncing

451
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,710
and they will keep extending the stay at

452
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,570
home orders

453
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:54,200
I don't know how real this is but my

454
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,090
fear is that if we don't voluntarily

455
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,430
just start staying at home they will

456
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,600
eventually whoever they are I know I'm

457
00:16:58,429 --> 00:17:01,309
smelling one of those Eddie Bravo

458
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,139
conspiracy theorists but there will be

459
00:17:01,309 --> 00:17:04,519
some measures taken to force us to stay

460
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:06,410
at home and limit our movement right now

461
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:08,089
they are requesting and if we comply

462
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:09,560
with requests that's cool

463
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:11,859
but if we don't I think they may up

464
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:15,200
their game a little bit in the future

465
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,759
maybe but I'm Way more worried about the

466
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,730
stupid people that I am about like the

467
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,569
government trying to insist we stay home

468
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,670
I agree with that

469
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:24,859
are they almost out there Darwinian

470
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:26,539
themselves are they kind of oh for sure

471
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:31,459
like it's been really hard for me not to

472
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:34,519
be super mean on social media like if

473
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,069
we'll know for sure in two weeks but

474
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:39,680
like if two weeks from April 19th

475
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:41,990
because it was all this weekend if in

476
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:43,039
about two weeks the the hospital numbers

477
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:46,519
spike

478
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:50,089
this is why it's the protests yeah and

479
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:52,940
it's like it's it sucks but it's so easy

480
00:17:50,089 --> 00:17:54,679
to stay home right now like it really

481
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,309
sucks but it's super easy to stay home

482
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,350
right now

483
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:59,119
it's really boring but I mean it's free

484
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:00,889

00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:03,509
one that pointed out to me the article I

555
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:05,460
read in the first the first pictures I

556
00:21:03,509 --> 00:21:07,500
saw in social media was two of them they

557
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:09,390
were just when the red light hit they

558
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,940
were just stand in the crosswalk it was

559
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,350
appropriate for people to be in during

560
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,740
that red light and then when the

561
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:18,779
crosswalk said stop get out the way they

562
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:20,370
got out the way okay they basically

563
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:22,019
cross the street back and forth and that

564
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:24,229
was their march back and forth yeah a

565
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:26,490
crosswalk they just kind of went it was

566
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:28,410
instead of crossing they just stood

567
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:33,750
there and then when it said all right

568
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:35,310
stop crossing now there's a little yeah

569
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,170
and they were just telling everybody go

570
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:38,669
home cuz this is [ __ ] silly and that

571
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,320
people are really sick in my hospital

572
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,960
and I'm trying not to make you a patient

573
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:47,789
also one of my favorite view they're

574
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,220
extra insulted oh yeah like they're

575
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:53,269
putting their safety at risk to treat

576
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:55,500
patient after patient after patient and

577
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:58,680
dealing with all sorts of fucked-up-ness

578
00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:00,690
on top of it like people dying alone and

579
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,370
having to be there with that and having

580
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:06,029
to be the conduit of family on the phone

581
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:09,000
and like on a totally non kovat related

582
00:22:06,029 --> 00:22:13,639
situation I have a family member

583
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:17,130
in hospital right now and having people

584
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:21,450
visit and not visit and can visit and

585
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:24,690
can't visit it's [ __ ] yeah not to my

586
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,850
uncle passed by himself had to pass my

587
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:28,830
himself a few weeks ago so yeah I'm

588
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:32,279
sorry we've got that going on bro

589
00:22:28,829 --> 00:22:34,710
yeah their daughter can't leave the

590
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:38,069
hospital because she can't come back

591
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,960
yeah and she's the last visitor on the

592
00:22:38,069 --> 00:22:42,119
list so she's literally stuck there

593
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,829
until this is over one way or the other

594
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:48,989
so I don't recall what everybody dude

595
00:22:46,829 --> 00:22:50,220
something that I was doing something I

596
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,930
could have gotten hurt the other day and

597
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,400
I was like nope this isn't the time like

598
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:54,840
even if I just cut my I forgot what I

599
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,730
was like I could but oops and I was like

600
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,379
no no I'm I don't even need three

601
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:59,970
stitches right now would be [ __ ] way

602
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,590
more traumatic than it needs to be

603
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:04,170
because I got to go to the hospital and

604

stuff there's been a lot of like let's

606
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:15,930
take an extra second for safety just

607
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,700
because we really it's not 13 stitches

608

00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:42,829
right now to help keep people

647
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:45,509
entertained and I thought that was a

648
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:49,399
super legit thing they're sort of kind

649
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:51,929
of realized and embrace but also like

650
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,870
it's important that we're here and we

651
00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:56,670
should use our our space here to

652
00:24:54,869 --> 00:24:59,699
encourage people to stay home like I

653
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:02,279
know how much it sucks like I'm [ __ ]

654
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,900
miserable too like I fully fantasized

655
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:08,910
about like Chuck and one of my kids over

656
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:11,670
the fence the other day just this is not

657
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:18,990
getting edited so well no I did it stuff

658
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:21,050
like it's it's really tough but just do

659
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,429
your best

660
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:24,599
if you think about it you can stay home

661
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:26,700
now or you can stay in the hospital

662
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:28,859
later it's kind of your option that's

663
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,000
that's the thing that I'm so worried

664
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:31,769
about today like there were a lot of

665
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,390
people out not as many are there

666
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:36,299
normally out celebrating around the

667
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:38,429
Capitol this weekend but there were a

668
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:40,558
shitload of people out and like car

669
00:25:38,429 --> 00:25:43,620
loads of people were packed in together

670
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:47,279
for hours driving in circles around the

671
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:49,579
Capitol packed like in heavy traffic

672
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,139
with other cars packed full of people

673
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:56,089
people walking around on the sidewalks

674
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:59,250
waving signs and [ __ ] in the parks and

675
00:25:56,089 --> 00:26:03,299
like I get how sir crazy everyone is but

676
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:06,720
like if the smart people are right a lot

677
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:08,490
of people just got infected right all

678
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,819
went home tonight and shared it with

679
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,099
their family like in that sucks

680
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:15,808
and if the smart people are right on

681
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:18,389
this one in two weeks it's gonna be ugly

682
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:20,039
yeah yeah if those people have to people

683
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,390
have half of the people got sick today

684
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,369
if a quarter of them got sick I'm not

685
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:25,559
I'm not an epidemiologist I'm not gonna

686
00:26:23,369 --> 00:26:28,199
play that game I have just described it

687
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,569
and compared it to the virus is almost

688
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,058
and this is just my simple mind to grasp

689
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:35,399
it uh and and for youngsters I was

690
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:36,720
talking to somebody much younger ah it's

691
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,040
like a volleyball

692
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,259
somebody threw a volleyball up in the

693
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:42,839
air and when it landed somebody hit it

694
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:44,339
and it broke into two and then when that

695
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,019
volleyball came back down somebody hit

696
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:47,369
those two and they turned in each one of

697
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,349
them turned into two more every time the

698
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:51,389
volleyball gets volleyed it multiplies

699
00:26:49,349 --> 00:26:53,519
it becomes two more volleyballs and so

700
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:54,720
we're out there in society just volley

701
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,250
in these volleyballs everyone's gonna

702
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,870
like it's like at a [ __ ] concert in

703
00:26:56,250 --> 00:27:00,059
the beach ball comes by everyone wants

704
00:26:57,869 --> 00:27:01,079
to hit it no beach ball oh and he hit it

705
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:02,490
up in the air and it goes flying you

706
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:04,289
don't think anything about it now you're

707
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,269
infected that balls bouncing around just

708
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:08,309
infecting everybody if we would quit

709
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:09,869
bouncing the [ __ ] beach ball around

710
00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:11,369
it would land on the ground and they

711
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:12,359
would deflate they would [ __ ] die and

712
00:27:11,369 --> 00:27:13,679
then we could go out there not have to

713
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:20,849
worry about beach balls that's kind of

714
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:24,570
the way I think about it keep your balls

715
00:27:20,849 --> 00:27:26,730
to yourself yeah super quick hey Mike

716
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:28,289
it's 420 you want to take it bad bro I

717
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,880
just realized we've been talking it's 15

718
00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:31,710
minutes into fours for 15 minutes in the

719
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:36,330
fourth warning yeah I've got a dad

720
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:38,970
loaded let's uh let's end the plea to

721
00:27:36,329 --> 00:27:45,059
stay home and like if you need better

722
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:47,250
weed like that's a good segue also this

723
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:49,440
is a good time to learn how to grow so

724
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:50,940
many people are buying seeds I see so

725
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,860
many people on Facebook groups and

726
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,080
Instagram groups about how do I grow how

727
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:56,849
do I do this now is a good time don't

728
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,399
them to say books and podcasts and

729
00:27:56,849 --> 00:28:00,869
YouTube jacket into cannabis to get out

730
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:04,740
and clean up your yard clean up your

731
00:28:00,869 --> 00:28:07,019
house I'm lucky we moved houses right

732
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,049
before this [ __ ] like in the middle of

733
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:12,180
February we moved and our move was kind

734
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:14,819
of chaotic so it didn't really end until

735
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,350
the first week of March so when they

736
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,629
were like alright everybody tried to

737
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:24,240
stay home I was like all right finally a

738
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:27,300
reason in peace the downside of that is

739
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,160
I've got a vehicle that is like bursting

740
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:30,450
with cardboard right now because I was

741
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,420
getting ready to go take it to the

742
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:35,660
recycle place and today I went to load

743
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:39,900
it up and go I see a notice that says

744
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:42,330
they're not because wherever they said

745
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,710
it is closed due to the virus and so

746
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:45,029
literally I finished loading up the car

747
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:50,160
then I checked to make sure they were

748
00:28:45,029 --> 00:28:50,599
open that day and I was like got a bunch

749
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,259
of car

750
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:55,788
now yep yeah that's one of the fun

751
00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:57,889

[ __ ] closet because you can't go

763
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,899
anywhere like oops it's not myself doing

764
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:28,548
that you can place narrow drums during

765
00:29:26,898 --> 00:29:30,288
the quarantine though I've noticed that

766
00:29:28,548 --> 00:29:31,730
all the drum equipment I buy you can

767
00:29:30,288 --> 00:29:33,888
play the [ __ ] out of that during

768
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,179
quarantine it works really well and I'm

769
00:29:33,888 --> 00:29:36,740
sure the neighbors have learned a lot of

770
00:29:35,179 --> 00:29:38,288
Led Zeppelin songs the past couple of

771
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,808
weeks

772
00:29:38,288 --> 00:29:43,548
one of my neighbors they're - they've

773
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:47,690
got a couple of girls maybe two or three

774
00:29:43,548 --> 00:29:50,720

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,409

777
00:29:52,308 --> 00:29:55,970

remember an episode and Mike is spoken

823
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:43,239
of the time that he tried to hit the

824
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:44,950
microphone he put his mouth on the mic

825
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:46,960
and then put the dab on the dab meal and

826
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:48,519
wondered why the smoke didn't flow so

827
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,279
yeah there's there's some tricks to this

828

830
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:59,829
I was just rambling not paying attention

831
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,000

832
00:31:59,829 --> 00:32:05,949
reshape the glass if we needed to I am

833
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,500

a clean bang there we go I know where

835
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:11,650

836
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:13,660

862
00:33:27,259 --> 00:33:30,470
himself in the video guys it's [ __ ]

863
00:33:28,788 --> 00:33:31,908
funny you ever watched when your friends

864
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:34,870
stare at himself in a video and forget

865
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:38,179
that he's on video that's pretty good

866
00:33:34,869 --> 00:33:40,819
longtime listeners may remark that

867
00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:42,830
coughing fit was pretty shallow for my

868
00:33:40,819 --> 00:33:44,298
normals that was pretty good especially

869
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:46,339
for the size dab you took we could tell

870
00:33:44,298 --> 00:33:49,400
that the no-smoking is working for you

871
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:51,199
bro yeah I've been able to to hit all of

872
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:54,048
my cannabis products quite a bit harder

873
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,759
lately good are you getting more stoned

874
00:33:54,048 --> 00:34:02,418
from it what I choose to hit a martyr I

875
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,950
hurt myself my dad Penn knew like the

876
00:34:02,419 --> 00:34:05,659
second day or second third day of

877
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:07,788
quarantine I was just puffing on it like

878
00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:10,159
it's kind of wanting a cigarette and

879
00:34:07,788 --> 00:34:11,570
puffing on it too much and I got up and

880
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:13,369
I went to get something in the whole

881
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:19,129
house kind of tilted like it was a boat

882
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:21,500
yeah oh [ __ ] those pins can be dangerous

883
00:34:19,128 --> 00:34:22,909
just sipping on it sipping on it and

884
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,739
suddenly you're like oh I have been

885
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,320
sipping on it and it's gone and I'm

886
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:28,898
wrecked and I think your lungs kind of

887
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,720
get used to the pen you're heading to

888
00:34:28,898 --> 00:34:34,440
they get used to the turf setup that

889
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,689
makes sense

890
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,789
I mean when I first started hitting it I

891
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:41,190
could hit it kind of but I'd COFF a

892
00:34:38,789 --> 00:34:43,139
little if I hit it harder and by the

893
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,700
time I was ready to kill it I could sit

894
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,889
there and rip on it to the white flash

895
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:48,568
to me and then tap the light a couple

896
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:53,309
times or button a couple times and hit

897
00:34:48,568 --> 00:34:54,538
that second pool yeah the Pens come in

898
00:34:53,309 --> 00:34:57,329
handy they're not my favorite but they

899
00:34:54,539 --> 00:34:59,490
do come in really handy grape Cola was

900
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,990
tasty all chattering you're almost

901
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:02,548
sweaty I could see you sweat from the

902
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:06,048
data so you pull off the Hat and smoking

903
00:35:02,548 --> 00:35:07,949

904
00:35:06,048 --> 00:35:09,690

905
00:35:07,949 --> 00:35:11,548
like I've changed my diet I'm amazingly

906
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,409
healthy you guys eat what you want I can

907
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:15,150
enjoy life but I have chosen to minimize

908
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:17,279
my diet I had a birthday recently I had

909
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:19,019

910
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,460
my diet I'm healthy and everything at

911

not eating cookies and no donuts and

926
00:35:55,949 --> 00:36:00,389
[ __ ] like that food tastes so good food

927
00:35:59,338 --> 00:36:02,929
tastes better I can taste my

928
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:05,009
concentrates better - I'm not having

929
00:36:02,929 --> 00:36:06,419
syrup tongue or whatever I was getting

930
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:13,980
from the dr. pepper and all the sugary

931
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:15,568
crap yeah I have to relearn food doesn't

932
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,108
all taste like muted cigarettes

933
00:36:15,568 --> 00:36:19,980
I do miss hanging out on the porch with

934
00:36:19,108 --> 00:36:22,199
you when you would smoke a cigarette

935
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,789
though that's kind of weird I kind of

936
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:25,019
miss my outside time too and there's no

937
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:27,900
reason to just go out on the porch and

938
00:36:25,019 --> 00:36:30,210
be weird now yep I stand out back with

939
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,460
my bong every now and again I'm not

940
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,170
comfortable in my neighborhood with my

941
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,849
new neighbors and I'm not comfortable

942
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:37,588
dabbing on the porch I'll sit out there

943
00:36:35,849 --> 00:36:39,838
and smoke a joint but I'm not down with

944
00:36:37,588 --> 00:36:41,369
the dab rig and the torch on the porch

945
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:43,469
torch on the porch is our other band

946
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:46,119
name

947
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:48,879
- guys coughing and torch on a porch is

948
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:53,798
our first record we have not confirmed

949
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,380
Avars used to have a house like it's

950
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:59,369
gonna sound like a weird and way to say

951
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,660
it but it's like a major side street

952
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:04,329
it's not meant to be a main artery

953
00:37:01,659 --> 00:37:05,949
through our town but it it's the main

954
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:10,539
way people get from one side of town to

955
00:37:05,949 --> 00:37:12,939
the other and now I mean steady traffic

956
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:14,890
it's it's only one lane each way but if

957
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,659
you sat out there all day you'd always

958
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:19,118
have a car in front of you maybe get to

959
00:37:16,659 --> 00:37:21,879
two or three minute gap with no traffic

960
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,318
but usually it's a steady stream just

961
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:32,410
out there [ __ ] dab and using a

962
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:34,329
propane torch to heat yeah yeah you guys

963

last about a year and a half two years

968
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:52,509

00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:08,318
their lives

974
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,940
it's almost suspicious how perfectly

975
00:38:08,318 --> 00:38:11,500
everything was set up for delivery and

976
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,298
then we were all told to stay home but I

977
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:17,440
am NOT going to be Eddie Bravo and I'm

978
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:19,210
not gonna go that ivory well like [ __ ]

979
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,130
like this happen before it's just

980
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:27,220
society was substantially less able to

981
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:29,048
cope with it right but we're so lucky

982
00:38:27,219 --> 00:38:32,588
right now can you imagine trying to do

983
00:38:29,048 --> 00:38:34,480
this in the 90s where there's you can

984
00:38:32,588 --> 00:38:36,068
get food delivery but it's pizza or

985
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,659
Chinese that's the [ __ ] that's it

986
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:40,288
yeah or some subway

987
00:38:37,659 --> 00:38:45,129
submarine sandwich kind of place and

988
00:38:40,289 --> 00:38:47,079
maybe if you're lucky a place that that

989
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:49,750
does like sandwiches or pastas would

990
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:52,269
deliver but only if you're lucky or live

991
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,289
in a major city yeah I was from kind of

992
00:38:52,268 --> 00:38:54,578
right that's not Long Beach in

993
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,470
California so we could get some good

994
00:38:54,579 --> 00:38:58,450
[ __ ] delivered but not much you're right

995
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:59,739
and who knows what it would have been

996
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:03,039
you know it could have been his blonde

997
00:38:59,739 --> 00:39:05,979
sister central oh my god go there touch

998
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:10,679
all those videos you got HBO Showtime

999
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:10,679
Cinemax and other basic cable channels

1000
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,550
back then my TV never really left MTV at

1001
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:17,049
beavis and butt-head and [ __ ]

1002
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:19,810
headbangers ball and everything you

1003
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:22,170
needed was on MTV yep maybe late at

1004
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:24,909
night you'd put on USA up all night but

1005
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:28,809
try to catch emannuel on Cinemax you

1006
00:39:24,909 --> 00:39:30,699
know remember watching the boring

1007
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:35,289
channels remember trying to peek through

1008
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:39,129
the blurry channel blurry channels back

1009
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:41,050
in the day bill that passed like 50 I

1010
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:43,180
thought it was funny because the cartoon

1011
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:45,550
channel was 50 and then the adult

1012
00:39:43,179 --> 00:39:47,649
channels were 51 up and I was like I

1013
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:49,450
just go to cartoons and then scroll up

1014
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:51,550
one and I can maybe catch a green boob

1015
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:52,868
on the side or something people that are

1016
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:54,730
our age know we're talking about trying

1017
00:39:52,869 --> 00:39:55,119
to watch unscrambled porn for scrambled

1018
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,059
porn

1019
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,380
that's weird podcast episode this is the

1020
00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:03,219
weirdest one of the weirdest podcast

1021
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,900

1022
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:07,500
I got lit off that bad feeling nice and

1023
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:21,880
heavily medicated

1024
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:24,389
yeah oh [ __ ] no no back in the day used

1025
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:28,030
to have I would need so much equipment

1026
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:29,920
would be say 95 I would need a camera

1027
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,470
probably the site at least the size of a

1028
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,150
shoebox to record this then I would need

1029
00:40:32,469 --> 00:40:37,000
a server probably the size of another

1030
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,380
shoe box and then 72,000 [ __ ] cables

1031
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:40,659
to make those two things work and then

1032
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:42,700
listeners if you want to laugh go look

1033
00:40:40,659 --> 00:40:45,989

1035
00:40:45,989 --> 00:40:54,459
first on the first podcast concept yeah

1036
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,160
I think it was like baby podcasting

1037
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:58,750
pirate radio yeah pirate radio we should

1038

1041
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:06,579
not be able to pull it up for free on

1042
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:07,929

1043
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:10,159
if you know how to do it if you type in

1044

Docs you can find yeah there's a way to

1049
00:41:17,179 --> 00:41:20,149
I can't think of how to do it right now

1050
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:22,159
at the top of my head but our listeners

1051
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:23,838
that are tech savvy are gonna figure it

1052
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:25,699
out you can find other movies in

1053
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:30,380
people's google drives that are open and

1054
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:32,598

1056
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:36,349
say is now old man now yeah yeah now all

1057
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:37,788
we need

1058
00:41:36,349 --> 00:41:39,829
I bought Mike I'm not trying to say I

1059
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:41,569
bought Mike but we got Mike about about

1060
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:43,280
130 bucks worth of equipment that's

1061
00:41:41,568 --> 00:41:44,719
really well you got the focus right that

1062
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,400
was about a hundred bucks the Mike was

1063
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:50,929
like 45 yeah yeah like less than 250

1064
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:52,730
bucks worth the gear we got Mike going

1065
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:54,048
and he's on a video chat with me we're

1066
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,088
looking each other face-to-face like

1067
00:41:54,048 --> 00:41:57,679
real-time there's no lag this is [ __ ]

1068
00:41:56,088 --> 00:42:00,199
awesome I expected a little bit of delay

1069
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:02,750
there zero lag happen and makes it super

1070
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:04,578
nice so yeah we're a yes we didn't get

1071
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,409
flying cars but we got the viruses from

1072
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:07,789
the movies and we got all the phone [ __ ]

1073
00:42:06,409 --> 00:42:15,409
from the movies we did not get the

1074
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:16,490
flying cars if I had a flying car I'm

1075
00:42:15,409 --> 00:42:17,929
afraid of flying cars in our

1076
00:42:16,489 --> 00:42:19,368
neighborhood bro people would be falling

1077
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:26,298
from the sky running out of gas on the

1078
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:28,220
way to work exactly yeah so it'd just be

1079
00:42:26,298 --> 00:42:31,759
the one dimensional travel than a few of

1080
00:42:28,219 --> 00:42:39,500
us would just be like [ __ ] it

1081
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:40,700
wouldn't be cool alright Mike we have

1082
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,230
been going for long enough to where I

1083
00:42:40,699 --> 00:42:43,699
think we should start wrapping this up

1084
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,079
because we're getting way off topic but

1085
00:42:43,699 --> 00:42:48,409
it's been fun I want to make sure that
