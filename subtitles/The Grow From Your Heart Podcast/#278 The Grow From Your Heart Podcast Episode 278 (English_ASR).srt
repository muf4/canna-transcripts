00:10:12,558 --> 00:10:28,850
about the traveling stoner and I for

155
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:30,378
breast cancer month one of the most

156
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:34,879
painful things I've been through in a

157
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:37,548
while ladies their nipples pierced to

158
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:39,259
raise awareness for breast cancer you

159
00:10:37,548 --> 00:10:42,259
guys that is some dedication these are

160
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:43,970
some badass women this is true I didn't

161
00:10:42,259 --> 00:10:45,528
do it for like oh let's go get a tattoo

162
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,928
or a piercing that's the way I thought

163
00:10:45,528 --> 00:10:50,419
about it because I know some people that

164
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:51,919
had breast cancer and I thought its

165
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,719
breast cancer awareness month and

166
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:56,389
somebody shared some stories with me and

167
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,860
I thought you know what if you have

168
00:10:56,389 --> 00:11:00,409
breast cancer and you're going through

169
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,070
chemotherapy God daring life probably

170
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:07,449
sucks and every day is battle

171
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:55,300
just having your mammogram uncomfortable

172
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:57,970
experience or no I didn't want to get

173
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:59,349
that - I mean really I didn't and I will

174
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,660
share something personal

175
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,790
I've been married to my husband for over

176
00:12:01,659 --> 00:12:07,500
40 years

177
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:10,299
almost 45 I know my husband very well I

178
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,070
knew he would not prove some of you or

179
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,479
be like cool but wouldn't every man like

180
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,640
their woman's nipples pierced

181
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,420
no my husband is very conservative about

182
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:21,309
your battle so I didn't tell him he knew

183
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:22,629
I was hanging out with Lindsay he knew

184
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:24,789
what was going on

185
00:12:22,629 --> 00:12:27,129
but I did not tell him and I thought if

186
00:12:24,789 --> 00:12:29,740
I tell him immediately he'll say take

187
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:32,679
him out so I waited a few days and he

188
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:34,870
knows how bad a piercing hurts so this

189
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:37,239
is how I told him he was sitting in his

190
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:42,279
chair and I had fun band-aids didn't I

191
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:47,519
travelling stoner okay so I put on I had

192
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:50,139
little brown sad face emoji and AIDS and

193
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,990
was kinda graphic but the round part

194
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:54,970
fits over a woman's areola perfectly and

195
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:57,070
so he was sitting in his chair and I

196
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,250
said I have something to tell you and he

197
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,379
said what oh my god I know you're not

198
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:06,190
gonna like it and he was like what did

199
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:08,799
you do now she and I lifted my shirt

200
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,760
there was them - sad faces looking at

201
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:14,229
get up and he said you are not 25 years

202
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:15,399
old like those kids you're hanging out

203
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:17,259
with I said

204
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:18,579
it was to raise breast cancer awareness

205
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:22,240
he said I don't wanna hear your

206
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:48,610
rationalization no I don't like it but

207
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:50,230
kind of cute wait too fast the other day

208
00:13:48,610 --> 00:14:04,980
I was putting on a onesie really fast

209
00:13:50,230 --> 00:14:16,930
and I was almost healed and it was like

210
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:18,310
360 I was gonna mention like you put a

211
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:20,079
lot of your life out there aren't you

212
00:14:18,309 --> 00:14:21,399
like don't you want to keep anything to

213
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:32,920
yourself but I don't even need to ask

214
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:35,019
that question because everything's been

215
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:36,639
a learning experience and I'll share it

216
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:38,829
with you and hopefully you'll learn if I

217
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,569
did I was young and dumb once I did some

218
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,230
stupid things that young and dumb people

219
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:46,090
do dumb not dumb and I'll share that

220
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,680
with you hopefully you'll learn from the

221
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,110
things I say because they do have a lot

222
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:54,699
of experience behind me I'll try to

223
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:56,769
learn exactly what I do I completely do

224
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:58,450
yeah I find well being a podcaster and I

225
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,220
also used to put myself on periscope a

226
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:02,020
lot I don't seem to be I don't like

227
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,730
sitting down as much I like to be on my

228
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:05,439
feet doing [ __ ] periscope makes me feel

229
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:11,050
like I get anxious for some reason after

230
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:12,610
work right thirty minutes and I'm like

231
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,829
oh [ __ ] I only meant to spend five

232
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:17,889
minutes here time does get away quickly

233
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:20,410
wise but putting that much of myself out

234
00:15:17,889 --> 00:15:22,299
I'm accountable for what I say I can't

235
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:23,919
fit at all because however many

236
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:26,620
listeners were listening listened and

237
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,029
it's on record and the pod every episode

238
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,480
is available like I've said before I'm

239
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:32,409
gonna sort put

240
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,570
old episodes even learned that the power

241
00:15:32,409 --> 00:15:38,289
of your words you really sometimes have

242
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:41,440
to stop and think I because people take

243
00:15:38,289 --> 00:15:43,689
things literally I'm really lucky that I

244
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
had a starter podcast I had another

245
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,410
friend that had kind of a comedy slash

246
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,820
community based podcast shot - wait

247
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:49,539
really you guys check out wait really

248
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,269
he's a comedian

249
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:55,269
we had a podcast together and I kind of

250
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:57,490
got to be his co-host so I got to see a

251
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:59,649
couple of dumb things on episodes and

252
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,409
realize oh I can't see that kind of dumb

253
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,789
[ __ ] like you have to figure it out but

254
00:16:02,409 --> 00:16:04,838
that's how I learned was by it [ __ ]

255
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:06,039
it up that's why I was laughing when I

256
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,990
said I'll try to learn from you but I

257
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:15,490
mean the way I learned I have to fall in

258
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:17,889
crash that sucked because so many people

259
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:19,149
do watch me we have to be and you said

260
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:21,759
something on your social media this

261
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:24,639
morning about when you become as known

262
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,289
as you are you I've you way more than

263
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,169
myself but everybody this table has a

264
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:30,669
little bit of notice but you've got when

265
00:16:29,169 --> 00:16:34,659
you get to your level of instant

266
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:37,028
celebrity it's slightly instafamous

267
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:40,500
you've got to pay attention to what you

268
00:16:37,028 --> 00:16:44,828
say who you talk to and what you share

269
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,110
yes yes it's so much easier to get

270
00:16:44,828 --> 00:16:49,239
caught up in [ __ ] when you've got

271
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:52,360
250,000 people in your hair oh just in

272
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:54,940
our cannabis community along absolutely

273
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,159
I catch myself in it catch myself

274
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,480
everybody's choosing sides all the time

275
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:59,828
in this industry and it seems like we're

276
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:05,189
all just a bunch of potheads having fun

277
00:16:59,828 --> 00:17:08,649
but that's how it should be backstabbing

278
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:10,480
I don't have time for pettiness no no

279
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:12,519
we're getting too old these kids are too

280
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,289
old for that [ __ ] too already and I

281
00:17:12,519 --> 00:17:16,990
think I think all these young people

282
00:17:14,289 --> 00:17:19,480
will learn don't get just Jeff maybe you

283
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,669
said something shitty about Bobo Blaster

284
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,578
over there you know that was me granny

285
00:17:21,669 --> 00:17:26,169
you know he's just a rotten person well

286
00:17:24,578 --> 00:17:28,568
I'm learning that some of these kids

287
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,790
will take what you said to hurt boba

288
00:17:28,568 --> 00:17:32,889
blaster over there might be damn good

289
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:35,678
person but you have a personal I've been

290
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:39,120
down because some girl you liked he

291
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,920
liked you he said she know that [ __ ]

292
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:45,739
messing up his glass business and taking

293
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,740
money off of their time just you know

294
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,149
so unless somebody's done me wrong you

295
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:52,200
can you can gossip and and talk about

296
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:54,090
somebody all you want

297
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:56,850
rest assured granny is not gonna listen

298
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:58,589
to your [ __ ] I'm old enough and wise

299
00:17:56,849 --> 00:18:00,329
enough to make my own decisions about

300
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:05,699
people you told me earlier you just

301
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:07,649
trust your gut usually is a pretty good

302
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,130
judge of what I shouldn't do with other

303
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,410
folks

304
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:11,280

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,030
either a canned food excuse me a non

328
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:23,400
expired canned food or non-perishable

329
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:26,069
canned food right something y'all would

330
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,509
eat no expired garbanzo beans and if you

331
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:33,419
like garbanzo beans I'm sorry

332
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:36,960
or like Jeff said a brand new toy in a

333
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:39,029
packaging any age rage honestly we don't

334
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,400
know we don't care you know a toys a toy

335
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:43,769
we're not gonna no we're not gonna put a

336
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,019
limit on it like that but yeah if you

337
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:49,470
bring in an item - one of the one of the

338
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:51,509
places that we'll list off you can get a

339
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:52,799
and each place is doing something

340
00:19:51,509 --> 00:19:56,670
different so

341
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,309
you'll have to ask the specific place

342
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,800
what they're going to you know do for it

343
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:04,139
but we will will have a flier and

344
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:06,180
everything for it that will be posting

345
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:11,130
and stuff with each place that we have

346
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:14,900
so we have 17 places right now confirmed

347
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:18,870
and we have three spots open four places

348
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:20,460
yeah we decided to keep it at 20 cuz we

349
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:22,799
are going to be the ones that will be

350
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:26,039
going by the dispensaries picking stuff

351
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:29,460
up I have a warehouse to store things in

352
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:31,799
until we distribute them and I think we

353
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,620
picked a good organization you know we

354
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:36,509
wanted we wanted to somehow keep it in

355
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:38,189
the cannabis community but this year on

356
00:20:36,509 --> 00:20:40,980
such short notice that's just not going

357
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:44,009
to happen so what we have decided to do

358
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,690
is I got into contact with the Marian

359
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:49,049
house and the Marian house is down on

360
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:51,150
Bijou and they feed and they clothe a

361
00:20:49,049 --> 00:20:54,960
lot of our homeless community and to me

362
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:57,450
that's a lot of veterans it's also a lot

363
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,360
of young people moving here because of

364
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:03,690
cannabis um you see a lot of young

365
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:05,669
people down there yes so I reached out

366
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,730
to them they will be happy to take

367
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:10,769
anything we have and then there's second

368
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:13,140
organization that under the Marian house

369
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:15,869
is called the Family Resource Center and

370
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,060
they deal with families that are totally

371
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:20,039
displaced homeless families that they're

372
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:22,379
getting set up in apartments and stuff

373
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,849
and these are why we're saying we'll

374
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,360
take toys because there's children

375
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:29,579
involved in most of these cases and so

376
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,349
that's why we decided you know so many

377
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:34,289
people think oh people that smoke

378
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:36,629
cannabis they're bad they don't do

379
00:21:34,289 --> 00:21:39,029
anything well guess what you're wrong we

380
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,950
love giving back to our community yes

381
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,509
and we want to start small this year we

382
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:44,220
just want to do it in Colorado Springs

383
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:45,960
but we're hoping to have a really big

384
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,910
turnout this year and be able to make it

385
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,160
into something even bigger for next year

386
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:51,630
whether that means we stay in the

387
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,360
springs and just make it bigger next

388
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:57,330
year or we you know try to do something

389
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,579
even bigger but we're really excited

390
00:21:57,329 --> 00:22:00,720
about this and the different plate do

391
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:02,399
you want to list off the different

392
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,750
places that we have I'm just gonna throw

393
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,160
one more thing in there now we'd at

394
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,109
first we were just going to do

395
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,820
we had talked about money and stuff when

396
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:12,000
we decided no but what we are going to

397
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:14,159
do all the different places that the 20

398
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,380
places we're going to put a gallon mason

399
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,269
jar there and you can drop off gift

400
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,390
certificates because like I say the

401
00:22:18,269 --> 00:22:23,400
Family Resource Center say we get enough

402
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:25,980
a meal together we get everything

403
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,720
further and this is for Christmas we get

404
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:29,640
their Christmas meal together what if

405
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,470
they don't have a roasting pan guess

406
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,290
what the Family Resource Center can say

407
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:37,350
here take this gift certificate go get

408
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:39,000
what else you need for or I think the

409
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:43,169
other thing we might want to include is

410
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:47,279
diapers diapers are really really

411
00:22:43,170 --> 00:23:00,150
expensive I think we could expand you

412
00:22:47,279 --> 00:23:03,720
know the toy diaper and food listen

413
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,970
anything that's not like expired or bad

414
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,799
or something we really couldn't donate

415
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:10,319
like don't be ridiculous please don't

416
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:11,579
bring us like you know go to the health

417
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,369
food store and get some of that Amy's

418
00:23:11,579 --> 00:23:15,960
organic chili get some soups [ __ ] that

419
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:17,909
people want to eat like something that

420
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,860
you can actually open and consume

421
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,360
instead of like some green beans I mean

422
00:23:19,859 --> 00:23:22,439
you can do that but who wants [ __ ]

423
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:23,939
green beans for dinner you go get some

424
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:33,539
soup some Campbell's good [ __ ] some

425
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:35,130
chunky [ __ ] certificates can be used

426
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,200
like we're just doing non perishables

427
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:44,250
but you need milk you need butter we

428
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:46,710
need eggs we had more time we could

429
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:49,170
probably solicit grocery stores and

430
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:51,120
stuff for turkeys but this year not this

431
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:52,860
year right next year guys yep we're

432
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:54,899
gonna make it really really huge yes

433
00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:58,619
would you prefer them wrap or not wrap

434
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,870
the gifts for the kids I say not wrap

435
00:23:58,619 --> 00:24:02,729
well let the Family Resource Center do

436
00:24:00,869 --> 00:24:05,729
that I think we'll do this and then turn

437
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:07,559
it off if you want to donate wrapping

438
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:09,390
paper so that they can be wrap to go for

439
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,500
that but don't wrap them I kind of said

440
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:13,370
that because I want to see what's in

441
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,369
there so that I made sure you're

442
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:30,168
and besides out how do you know that

443
00:24:16,308 --> 00:24:32,058
there's not a used toy wrap distribute

444
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:36,320
the boxes next Friday isn't that correct

445
00:24:32,058 --> 00:24:38,470
Lindsay we're gonna put them out next

446
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:38,470

447
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:57,558
beyond that Friday 18th the drop-off no

448
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,730
later than December 16th yep okay I'm

449
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:00,079
just making notes because I want to make

450
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:04,298

451
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,298
right time I'll put this out on the 17th

452
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,970
and we're thinking about we haven't

453
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:12,260
fine-tuned this where we're still kind

454
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:13,990
of kind of work on it but we're thinking

455
00:25:12,259 --> 00:25:18,829
we could make this and do like a little

456
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:21,558
competition some of the drop-off spots

457
00:25:18,829 --> 00:25:24,710
one of them being elevate already said

458
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:27,109
well how about if every place put a

459
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:29,630
little gift in there I'll throw

460
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:33,199
something in and then at the end the

461
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:35,059
person that collected the most gets the

462
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,548
little prize package from the 20

463
00:25:35,058 --> 00:25:39,168
drop-off spots and granny goes and

464
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:42,408
spends a day with him doing something

465
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:44,000
fun at their facility we could turn this

466
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:46,278
into a fun competition should be a lot

467
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,769
of fun you can win on a date with granny

468
00:25:46,278 --> 00:25:51,740

watched you do that dab and you just

565
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:09,809
kept going in and you didn't cough it's

566
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:11,279
so mesmerizing watch that you have Jeff

569
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,500
have been the first time we met at the

570
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,039
first podcast and we talked about

571
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,599
coughing during yeah yeah and you said

572
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:26,279
while I very rarely caught because you

573
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,740
own your lungs you can tell them what to

574
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:30,450
do so when I feel that tickle and you

575
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,940
all know what I mean when I say I feel

576
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:33,610
that tickle huh I hear your voice in my

577
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:36,580
head

578
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:39,579
and I almost meditate with my eyes open

579
00:30:36,579 --> 00:30:40,720
when I am NOT going to cough yeah yeah

580
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:42,129
all right

581
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,750
I've never talked about this on a

582
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:45,400
podcast I've only told like four people

583
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,279
in my whole life this granny was one of

584
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:52,110
them when you feel like you're gonna

585
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:52,109
cough when you feel that thing that goes

586
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:18,130
when you're walking at the mall if you

587
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:20,290
[ __ ] fall down I feel that coffee

588
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:22,630
come in and I either inhale or exhale as

589
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:24,009
hard as I can distract them like when

590
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,300
your dogs trying to run away at a cat

591
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,589
you just pull the leash and put a treat

592
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:28,240
in front of it it forgets about the cat

593
00:31:26,589 --> 00:31:28,629
it looks at the tree goes Oh treat like

594
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,430
that

595
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:35,200
I just breathe in real hard my lungs

596
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:36,730
like that's good for me or bad for me

597
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,500
but it works cause it's got to be better

598
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:55,870
than coughing so hard blowing out my

599
00:31:38,500 --> 00:32:05,980
face every now and again I've smoked

600
00:31:55,869 --> 00:32:07,419

601
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,970

603
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:14,200
with propane if you do it properly but

604
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:15,700
it comes out like live resin it comes

605
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,160
out really moist when I smoke it my

606
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:19,720
lungs feel heavy and I spit up all cough

607
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,840

608

622
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,099
once a month wanted to do a charity

623
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:02,559
event nobody seemed to want cannabis

624
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:06,099
money yeah that's the hard part about it

625
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,990
we found grow vets finally took money

626
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:11,169
but it was really really hard to find

627
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:13,930
anybody that will take cannabis the vets

628
00:33:11,170 --> 00:33:15,340
always need help and it's always great

629
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,960
to help the vets and they'll take it so

630
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:18,839
if you ever need some more to send stuff

631
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,120

640
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:50,289
do know one thing about me is that that

641
00:33:45,819 --> 00:33:53,470
sense of loyalty I have it's just it

642
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:56,170
happens I do primarily shop at green and

643
00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:07,120
healthy but I visit other dispensaries

644
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:09,760
and I go into other places I just have

645
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,009
to I cannot go to one dispensary because

646
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,260
of the different drops and I and you

647

648
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,850
different products I was complimenting

649
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:20,919
you earlier on your ability to shop

650
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:26,619

around 2:30 3 o'clock you can open up

656
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,829

to shop today there's one or two shots

658
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:43,480
of her and the cool bud tender there

659
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:46,090
they would treat her polite I love it I

660
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:47,710
love it when you pop up so I can almost

661
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:49,059
tell where you are like oh she went to

662
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:57,429
elevate and that she has

663
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:59,320
then she took all right altitude meds

664
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,299
there downtown I believe there are

665
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:03,010
several locations okay well wherever

666
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,110
they are we're gonna have boxes in all

667
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:09,060
their locations

668
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:12,789
Emerald City wellness the pink house and

669
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:16,630
stained glass LLC so that leaves three

670
00:35:12,789 --> 00:35:19,029
spots get in touch with me DM me on

671
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:20,800
Instagram dabbing underscore granny I

672
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,470
think those spots will fill up quickly

673
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,730
though and not just this Bob you'll

674
00:35:23,469 --> 00:35:26,649
probably have those filled this comes

675
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,900
out and like seven or ten days from now

676
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:31,269
so these 710 is it'd probably be filled

677
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,860
up hopefully with much faith what we

678
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:35,320
need now is people to go to these

679
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,970
locations with a non-perishable canned

680
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,440
good that you would eat you guys that

681
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:40,000
you would put in a pan and heat up

682
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,400
yourself and sit down and [ __ ] enjoy

683
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,159
like a meal by yourself don't bring us a

684
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,660
bunch of random side [ __ ] people and you

685
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,369
know what maybe you're not a big shopper

686
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:50,710
that's what that mason jar is gonna be

687
00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:52,889
for and guess what the cannabis

688
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:56,500
community is the most honorable

689
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:58,599
community you can drop your money in a

690
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,510
dispensary you will get it back you can

691
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:03,880
leave your badge or your ID behind

692
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,950
because we're all stoners and if we drop

693
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,650
some [ __ ] we hope that you're gonna hand

694
00:36:05,949 --> 00:36:10,269
it to me also

695
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:12,039
lucky but I hear it's pretty pretty

696
00:36:10,269 --> 00:36:16,360
often that people always get back

697
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:18,820
there's two yeah yeah with that said

698
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:21,550
though if you're broke and all you have

699
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,660
in your cabinet is something and all you

700
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:31,420
want to bring you want to bring

701
00:36:22,659 --> 00:36:33,399
something in like yes please don't feel

702
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:36,099
like we're sitting here and saying don't

703
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,230
bring anything in like if you know like

704
00:36:36,099 --> 00:36:45,639
believe me I've been there I was making

705
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:47,139
lobster lobster and live rats I was just

706
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,759
sitting there thinking like oh god three

707
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:54,339
years ago I would have been like well

708
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:56,230
[ __ ] I'm not bringing anything it may be

709
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,210
been one of the people that hopefully

710
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:04,420
was benefiting from our little food

711
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:06,760
drive most people unfortunately right at

712
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:09,960
that line where they don't need the help

713
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:13,360
but they can't afford to give any help

714
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:33,130
right now making decisions do I need

715
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:35,500
this or do Medicaid or wipe your butt

716
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:45,280
I'm afraid that's what Californians are

717
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:46,750
facing that's California so Colorado we

718
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,810
did all the things right we did it right

719
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:51,250
here we thought that we had lost we

720
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:53,799
thought that we've lost an initiative

721
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,090
here in Pueblo and they are recounting

722
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:57,280
and still counting and it turns out that

723
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:59,920
we may have actually won three of the

724
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,450
four major cannabis initiatives we may

725
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,950
actually get to open recreational

726
00:38:01,449 --> 00:38:04,269
cannabis facilities within the city

727
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:06,519
limits as well though before too long

728
00:38:04,269 --> 00:38:07,690
here Andy you want a new job that'll be

729
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:09,460

730
00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:11,159

00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:13,570
fun

732
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:15,279

733
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:17,350
the activist for all the things that

734
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,050
we're going on white Mike did a lot of

735
00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:25,630
groundwork and a lot of internet work

736
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:28,180
and a lot of podcast work so but yeah

737
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,880

738
00:38:28,179 --> 00:38:34,659
gained so much knowledge I appreciate it

739
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,130
and I've listened to Mike and even

740
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:39,309
though I met him one time in person

741
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:40,570
where he was so quiet it's not that way

742
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:43,000
on the podcast

743
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:44,620
he's quiet until he gets a read on you

744
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,829
and knows how much of him you want to

745
00:38:44,619 --> 00:38:49,569
hear enough he's he's polite like he was

746
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:58,179
yeah he was taught to speak when spoken

747
00:38:49,570 --> 00:39:00,250
to and he's passionate about cannabis so

748

taking that drinks I don't want you to

794
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:04,369
the new trend in cannabis that I have

795
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,369
been catching on to the suppositories

796
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:11,099
[Music]

797
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:12,509
steal some of your green cracked abs to

798
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:17,610
place on my own terms

799
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:28,110
oh this is gonna do me just fine this

800
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:29,930
green crack chirps on the nice okay when

801
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:31,920
I first heard about them damn

802
00:42:29,929 --> 00:42:34,349
suppositories even I was kind of

803
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,119
skeptical but I have a pretty sick

804
00:42:34,349 --> 00:42:37,559
husband so I thought okay this is really

805
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:41,099
gonna help waning them off the morphine

806
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,289
and all that with this pain okay what I

807
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:45,960
have discovered is most most of you men

808
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:48,659
are homophobic you met you mentioned

809
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,780
suppositories and I see you visibly

810
00:42:48,659 --> 00:42:52,230
squeezing your butt cheeks together

811
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,120
she's right

812
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:57,510
am i it's true it's accurate I don't

813
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:01,949
know why women on the other hand you

814
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:05,400
know we spit 10-pound babies out our

815
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:08,509
vaginas so what's a suppository let's

816
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:08,510
use no not me

817
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:21,690
[Music]

818
00:43:17,809 --> 00:43:26,250
my husband and I brought you there 50%

819
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:29,460
to see 50% um DVDs thank you had a brain

820
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:37,769
fart and he said you stick that up your

821
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:41,010
ass no problem and I did it is at least

822
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:43,259
12 hours of euphoria is the best way to

823
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:45,840
put it you can function you can drive

824
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:48,900
you're not intoxicated but you're

825
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:51,960
euphoric I used one the night we had our

826
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,450
girls taken care of and it ease the pain

827
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,820
okay so my thought was alright now these

828
00:43:54,449 --> 00:44:00,359
things are really wonderful if you are

829
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:02,910
truly a medical patient for real if

830
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:06,900
you're especially cancer patient if

831
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:09,480
you're vomiting right skip that whole

832
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:11,610
part of the body exactly and you and I

833
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,710
know that the divine creator did not

834
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:15,539
make our lungs to ingest irritants some

835
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:18,510
of us like to smoke we know it's really

836
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:21,210
not the best way to medicate yo if ands

837
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:23,490
or buts I like to smoke though if you

838
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:26,900
truly need to medicate there are so many

839
00:44:23,489 --> 00:44:29,429
membranes in your anus using these

840
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:30,990
suppositories is a wonderful way to

841
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:32,579
medicate cannabis isn't the first

842
00:44:30,989 --> 00:44:35,219
medicine they've used as a suppository

843
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:37,019
this is just the newest and it's just on

844
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:39,569
our realm so now it's what we're talking

845
00:44:37,019 --> 00:44:41,219
about now it's been used for hundreds of

846
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:43,610
years I'm not certain but I'm sure

847
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:46,169
people been boosting things for longer

848
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:48,900
the best way to medicate

852
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:57,449

853
00:44:55,619 --> 00:44:59,639

854
00:44:57,449 --> 00:45:01,469
grumpy after his colonoscopy using pain

858
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:11,010

860
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:16,860
right my lower back pain is gone

861
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:19,230
I don't feel the nauseousness in my

862
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:21,070
belly that I feel when I take a morphine

863
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,389
for pain

864
00:45:21,070 --> 00:45:24,950
yeah I'm swimming from that damn I might

865
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:26,079
have put a little too much Terps but I'm

866
00:45:24,949 --> 00:45:29,129
not complaining

867
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,130
[Music]

868
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:49,760
it made my brain swim around in my head

869
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:51,590
okay should I tell the story we're

870
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,710
smoking on this stuff called Green crack

871
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:57,579
which is a pretty sativa dominant strain

872
00:45:55,710 --> 00:46:05,150
[Music]

873
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:07,940
and I'm not a real sativa okay when you

874
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:10,430
buy this distilled hash it solvent

875
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:13,010
unless it comes in a little syringe it's

876
00:46:10,429 --> 00:46:16,039
not very big glass its glass it has a

877
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:17,960
very small part where the medicine

878
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:27,110
actually comes out of the syringe like

879
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:28,610
where a needle would be I guess do you

880
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:33,789
have children you've used him for

881
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:33,789
pulling up amoxicillin or antibiotic

882
00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:39,199
good to feed a baby bird it would be yes

883
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,300
it's probably a really good description

884
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,369
to put the idea it'd be perfect to feed

885
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:46,130
a baby bird if you had rodents or mites

886
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:48,139
or something like that okay so I really

887
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:51,200
do like these suppositories for

888
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:53,170
medicating and I'm not gonna say where

889
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:56,109
but about tender said Wow

890
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:58,619
have you tried that hash and I was like

891
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:22,990
No

892
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:42,760
that consumed huge amounts of caffeine

893
00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:48,250
and lots of other things too many people

894
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:50,740
sticking too much hash in their ass how

895
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:59,769
much I really wouldn't suggest doing

896
00:47:50,739 --> 00:48:01,838
that okay

897
00:47:59,769 --> 00:48:04,809
I've given some do the traveling stoner

898
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:14,829
we can ask watched her put her head down

899
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:19,420
and blushes why did one I actually did

900
00:48:14,829 --> 00:48:22,210
forea ones so I had gotten the four ones

901
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:24,820
the sample that's so long ago I never

902
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:27,400
use them and then once Gayle started

903
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:30,099
doing them was talking about them I was

904
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:32,410
supposed to go to Denver and meet up

905
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:37,030
with one of our friends for her birthday

906
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:38,739
and I was in a lot of pain that morning

907
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:40,930
and I was like [ __ ] I really need to go

908
00:48:38,739 --> 00:48:43,358
to Denver like you know we have plans

909
00:48:40,929 --> 00:48:45,039
and I really can't let this like [ __ ] up

910
00:48:43,358 --> 00:48:48,219
our plant you know plans for her

911
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,449
birthday so I said to Christ I'm like I

912
00:48:48,219 --> 00:48:50,769
don't know what to do he's like you need

913
00:48:49,449 --> 00:48:53,259
to put one of those depositories and

914
00:48:50,769 --> 00:48:54,880
then just try it the first time I ever

915
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:57,460
took one the forty ones are a lot

916
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,740
stronger they're like the 50/50 ones so

917
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,990
the first time I ever took it I was like

918
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:04,559
Gumby and I think I think because I was

919
00:49:01,989 --> 00:49:07,959
in a lot of pain like I just I'm like

920
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:09,969
immediately was out of pain I don't know

921
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:32,730
it was weird but

922
00:49:09,969 --> 00:49:32,730
like I couldn't really move today

923
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:53,249
very clean almost like a pumpkin

924
00:49:50,110 --> 00:49:53,249

932
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:35,500
before but he's looking like I know the

933
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:41,320
cupcakes pictures I was like we both

934

935
00:51:43,539 --> 00:51:50,000
brought me on stage and gave me a to

936
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:52,789
Gram dab and then asked did he do one

937
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,440
with you know you we kind of fixed it

938
00:51:52,789 --> 00:51:56,630
see he knows that I like to take big

939
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,250
dabs and we're buddies and he was on

940
00:51:56,630 --> 00:51:59,780
stage and he goes I'm higher than you

941
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:08,480
because that's his thing he likes I'm

942
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:09,710
higher than you why cuz I'm taller than

943
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,349
him so I'm always higher you're much

944
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:14,119
taller this I'm always higher I think

945
00:52:12,349 --> 00:52:17,619
you mean I was taller than yes you are

946
00:52:14,119 --> 00:52:17,619
I've got a really killer picture of the

947
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:36,559
picture he's like Jeff I'm higher than

948
00:52:26,659 --> 00:52:38,719
you come up on stage he's like you take

949
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,340
a big big dab he's like you ready for

950
00:52:38,719 --> 00:52:41,599
this and stretches out to grams and I

951
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:43,400
was like oh [ __ ] I didn't know that's

952
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,469
what was coming and he heated the nail

953
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,480
to her it was white it wasn't red it was

954
00:52:45,469 --> 00:52:49,789
white I was like let it cool and he goes

955
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,039
no just hit it I was like no let it cool

956
00:52:49,789 --> 00:52:53,389
and so I like hesitated as long as I

957
00:52:52,039 --> 00:52:55,489
could but then I just went in because he

958
00:52:53,389 --> 00:52:56,929
was pushing it on there and I pulled the

959
00:52:55,489 --> 00:52:58,429
whole thing when I blew it out and he's

960
00:52:56,929 --> 00:52:59,809
like damn this guy's a champ and it was

961
00:52:58,429 --> 00:53:01,819
like can you do a bigger dad than him

962
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:04,039
and people like yes they would come up

963
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,140
on stage and we would dab together

964
00:53:04,039 --> 00:53:07,909
you kept dabbing oh yeah yeah they

965
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:10,308
couldn't finish their dabs and I would

966
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:11,868
grab the rig from that happy

967
00:53:10,309 --> 00:53:13,459
and I would finish their dad for them

968
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:16,400
and set the rig down like now what's up

969
00:53:13,458 --> 00:53:18,348
but honestly they only lasted for one

970
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,239
cent he calls it Adam does like a little

971
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:22,609
45 minutes and then goes and takes a

972
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,228
break walks around the crowd one of

973
00:53:22,608 --> 00:53:26,119
those and I had to go sit upstairs and

974
00:53:24,228 --> 00:53:28,548

task rock yet highly educated titanium

1349
01:24:08,649 --> 01:24:11,710
the other day I went to the mailbox I

1350
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:13,539
didn't feel good in feel worth or should

1351
01:24:11,710 --> 01:24:15,550
I eat something they kicked my ass

1352
01:24:13,539 --> 01:24:17,199
man I was not living but I went to the

1353
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:19,029
mailbox and I opened up the mail and

1354
01:24:17,199 --> 01:24:21,760
there was a gift in the mail from task

1355
01:24:19,029 --> 01:24:25,889
rock highly-educated titanium I get the

1356
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:28,539
new it's a quartz and titanium combo

1357
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:34,930
domeless email of course domeless right

1358
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:37,269
I still say domeless but it's a titanium

1359
01:24:34,930 --> 01:24:40,420
nail with a quartz dish with a little

1360
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:44,050
protective titanium shroud I think is

1361
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:45,940
the proprietary lit so that you could

1362
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:47,710
carry your quartz nail with you and you

1363
01:24:45,939 --> 01:24:49,059
don't have to feel as paranoid like

1364
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:50,920
you're gonna break it because I am a

1365
01:24:49,060 --> 01:24:53,950
breaky guy I like to break glass [ __ ]

1366
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:55,210
and I will break a quartz nail so I've

1367
01:24:53,949 --> 01:24:58,300
got a quartz nail that I want to break

1368
01:24:55,210 --> 01:25:00,819
it is able to be attached to my barrel

1369
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:03,610
style email coil I like it much better

1370
01:25:00,819 --> 01:25:05,920
on my flat email coil and it's also able

1371
01:25:03,609 --> 01:25:08,559
to be used without the email setup as

1372
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,760
just an on-the-go nail so Big Shot it's

1373
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:11,860
a task thank you

1374
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:13,900
that's a sweet product I think I like it

1375
01:25:11,859 --> 01:25:15,849
a lot better with the flat coil I think

1376
01:25:13,899 --> 01:25:22,599
it's going to end up being used mostly

1377
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:34,480
with a torch I didn't work for you

1378
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:36,430
probably let's talk about some no-till

1379
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:37,989
last time will was here and he kind of

1380
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:40,119
led on a little bit about no-till

1381
01:25:37,989 --> 01:25:41,800
growing and I said elaborate and he said

1382
01:25:40,119 --> 01:25:43,390
you got to get frosty over so we've got

1383
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:45,489
frosty organics over we're gonna talk

1384
01:25:43,390 --> 01:25:47,440
about no-till I should ask frosty a

1385
01:25:45,489 --> 01:25:48,279
couple of questions before we do that

1386
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:53,619
bro how long have you been growing

1387
01:25:48,279 --> 01:25:57,099
cannabis really really growing like for

1388
01:25:53,619 --> 01:26:00,880
real growing I say a little over two

1389
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:02,950
years oh [ __ ] you're good at it yeah

1390
01:26:00,880 --> 01:26:06,190
probably probably closer to three years

1391
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:09,429
but uh you're like really figuring out

1392
01:26:06,189 --> 01:26:12,879
what I was doing and uh doing it

1393
01:26:09,430 --> 01:26:15,250
correctly I'd say about uh about two

1394
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:19,409
years okay how long into your grow

1395
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:19,409
career did you decide to go no-till

1396
01:26:20,679 --> 01:26:25,210
a year ok so you've been at the no-till

1397
01:26:23,590 --> 01:26:26,529
for like a year a year alright and

1398
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:29,500
you're good at it broke is that Gorilla

1399
01:26:26,529 --> 01:26:34,448
Glue for you brought oh yeah it lives up

1400
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:36,579
to your name my soils get at it ok this

1401
01:26:34,448 --> 01:26:41,529
guy thinks so you're making where'd you

1402
01:26:36,579 --> 01:26:44,229
get your soil recipe um there's a guy

1403
01:26:41,529 --> 01:26:48,279
that uh I've been falling for a while

1404
01:26:44,229 --> 01:26:54,579
his name is uh coop on Instagram okay

1405
01:26:48,279 --> 01:26:55,840
like a mask Clackamas cool when you said

1406
01:26:54,579 --> 01:26:57,729
cool I thought that might be who you're

1407
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:04,150
talking about he's really into like KN f

1408
01:26:57,729 --> 01:27:06,549
li yeah Korean uh yeah we really uh

1409
01:27:04,149 --> 01:27:08,349
everybody I think that does no-till is

1410
01:27:06,550 --> 01:27:11,679
like basically based off of his soil

1411
01:27:08,350 --> 01:27:14,079
recipe okay we took his soil recipe and

1412
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:15,908
then uh just added our own things into

1413
01:27:14,079 --> 01:27:20,889
it but he's really like the the founder

1414
01:27:15,908 --> 01:27:22,329
of no too nice okay who the founders

1415
01:27:20,889 --> 01:27:23,859
tell us a little about what note what's

1416
01:27:22,329 --> 01:27:25,600
the difference between no-till and what

1417
01:27:23,859 --> 01:27:27,250
most of us are probably doing most of us

1418
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:28,870
are probably going to the store getting

1419
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:31,448
bottles mixing shoot up in a shot glass

1420
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:32,859
weighing it out into a bucket part and

1421
01:27:31,448 --> 01:27:34,839
mixing it up make sure the pH is right

1422
01:27:32,859 --> 01:27:36,039
and then pouring that onto our plants so

1423
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:38,860
teach us a little about the difference

1424
01:27:36,039 --> 01:27:41,158
of what no-till is well no tool is just

1425
01:27:38,859 --> 01:27:43,779
basically kind of like living soil on

1426
01:27:41,158 --> 01:27:45,399
living soil is basically a super soil

1427
01:27:43,779 --> 01:27:46,689
that everybody's doing so everybody got

1428
01:27:45,399 --> 01:27:49,000
into an organic way and they're like

1429
01:27:46,689 --> 01:27:51,369
well you can feed you know just water to

1430
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:53,319
this soil and your plants will do what

1431
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:57,039
it's supposed to so basically all the

1432
01:27:53,319 --> 01:28:01,000
inputs in your soil is doing what it's

1433
01:27:57,039 --> 01:28:03,639
supposed to for you so like in nature

1434
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:05,710
you don't see anything in nature doesn't

1435
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:10,989
get fed with the bottle it's already in

1436
01:28:05,710 --> 01:28:12,670
the dirt it breaks it down naturally

1437
01:28:10,988 --> 01:28:14,549
because the decomposition happens from

1438
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:18,340
other things in the earth and the worms

1439
01:28:14,550 --> 01:28:20,350
and poop yep so then that's available as

1440
01:28:18,340 --> 01:28:22,719
needed by the plant and the plant isn't

1441
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:24,579
force-fed basically or starving for

1442
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:26,619
anything hopefully yeah right okay and

1443
01:28:24,579 --> 01:28:29,198
so and so I was doing superstore there

1444
01:28:26,619 --> 01:28:29,748
for a while super soil is okay sometimes

1445
01:28:29,198 --> 01:28:32,808
your soil

1446
01:28:29,748 --> 01:28:36,588
too hot they put too many amendments in

1447
01:28:32,809 --> 01:28:38,389
it or maybe the amendments that are in

1448
01:28:36,588 --> 01:28:40,698
there for deep in Flour because you

1449
01:28:38,389 --> 01:28:41,929
might have put your soil together a

1450
01:28:40,698 --> 01:28:43,728
little bit before you threw it in the

1451
01:28:41,929 --> 01:28:44,538
flour you know a late in veg or

1452
01:28:43,729 --> 01:28:46,069
something like that you want to

1453
01:28:44,538 --> 01:28:46,929
transplant into your 5 gallon right for

1454
01:28:46,069 --> 01:28:49,279
you threw it into flour

1455
01:28:46,929 --> 01:28:52,338
you might start getting too heavy of

1456
01:28:49,279 --> 01:28:54,349
news you know or uh I guess

1457
01:28:52,338 --> 01:28:56,838
natural amendments being broken down and

1458
01:28:54,349 --> 01:29:00,979
feeding your plants too hot and it'll

1459
01:28:56,838 --> 01:29:02,958
burn your plants so I guess the the way

1460
01:29:00,979 --> 01:29:05,859
to get away from that is is to just the

1461
01:29:02,958 --> 01:29:07,908
natural way with no-till is to have

1462
01:29:05,859 --> 01:29:10,819
basically the same thing but then we

1463
01:29:07,908 --> 01:29:13,368
have like compost and then we have you

1464
01:29:10,819 --> 01:29:15,469
know worms in there I don't put worms in

1465
01:29:13,368 --> 01:29:23,748
there I just put earthworm castings okay

1466
01:29:15,469 --> 01:29:26,328
from a guy here in town named Don he has

1467
01:29:23,748 --> 01:29:28,488
the greatest earthworm castings ever but

1468
01:29:26,328 --> 01:29:30,738
it has cocoons in it so those worms will

1469
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:33,108
come to life after like you know a few

1470
01:29:30,738 --> 01:29:34,668
days actually you know it'll have little

1471
01:29:33,109 --> 01:29:36,829
worms in there too you know little bitty

1472
01:29:34,668 --> 01:29:38,509
worms and stuff in there already so um

1473
01:29:36,828 --> 01:29:39,588
you know once they start getting fed and

1474
01:29:38,509 --> 01:29:41,538
stuff like that you just need to have

1475
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:44,448
mulch on top because what you want to do

1476
01:29:41,538 --> 01:29:47,929
is you want to keep basically you want

1477
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:50,148
to just keep your your soil very very

1478
01:29:47,929 --> 01:29:52,429
moist on top just because you want your

1479
01:29:50,149 --> 01:29:54,709
worms to come to the top and to break

1480
01:29:52,429 --> 01:29:56,689
down all your top dressings okay so

1481
01:29:54,708 --> 01:29:58,788
whenever you do a transplant from your

1482
01:29:56,689 --> 01:30:01,219
one gallon so usually in a one gallon

1483
01:29:58,788 --> 01:30:04,578
when I veg I use like some shitty soil

1484
01:30:01,219 --> 01:30:06,259
you know something that's very base you

1485
01:30:04,578 --> 01:30:08,838
know you could use pro mix if you wanted

1486
01:30:06,259 --> 01:30:11,719
you know I mean if that's what you chose

1487
01:30:08,838 --> 01:30:14,088
I used more something that uh you know

1488
01:30:11,719 --> 01:30:16,219
shout to Don again Don makes a base soil

1489
01:30:14,088 --> 01:30:16,969
for me I just put my plants in there in

1490
01:30:16,219 --> 01:30:19,788
one gallons

1491
01:30:16,969 --> 01:30:23,359
I've a Jim was just water only just for

1492
01:30:19,788 --> 01:30:25,728
like a month okay three weeks after that

1493
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:27,529
I put them into their their new pot and

1494
01:30:25,729 --> 01:30:30,139
then I fed them for a week in there and

1495
01:30:27,529 --> 01:30:32,949
their no-till pots but their no-till

1496
01:30:30,139 --> 01:30:37,069
pots are already working and already

1497
01:30:32,948 --> 01:30:39,798
okay let's talk about what goes into

1498
01:30:37,069 --> 01:30:42,320
that no-till pot before we put the

1499
01:30:39,798 --> 01:30:45,109
plants in and how long before I put

1500
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:46,460
one gallon paw into that no-till do I

1501
01:30:45,109 --> 01:30:47,659
want to get that mixed up

1502
01:30:46,460 --> 01:30:50,029
do I need some time to let it get

1503
01:30:47,659 --> 01:30:53,180
cooking you do for sure if you want to

1504
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:57,259
make it on your own you can buy a soil

1505
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:59,090
mix now that is basically coots mix plus

1506
01:30:57,260 --> 01:31:01,489
all the extra things we were putting in

1507
01:30:59,090 --> 01:31:04,819
it um for a few years you know we were

1508
01:31:01,489 --> 01:31:06,409
having to you know make our soil mixes

1509
01:31:04,819 --> 01:31:08,090
and put all these extra things and then

1510
01:31:06,409 --> 01:31:10,159
we started buying like a soil mix on

1511
01:31:08,090 --> 01:31:12,560
build a soil okay and we still have to

1512
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:14,239
put extra things in it you know to make

1513
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,410
it exactly what you want it to be rich

1514
01:31:14,239 --> 01:31:17,389
enough to be able to go all through

1515
01:31:15,409 --> 01:31:19,279
flour and stuff like that to have your

1516
01:31:17,390 --> 01:31:21,140
worms and your microbe life and your

1517
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:24,829
beneficials really working you know and

1518
01:31:21,140 --> 01:31:26,270
so um after after we you know we're

1519
01:31:24,829 --> 01:31:28,220
doing that for a while now he came out

1520
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:30,770
with a it's called a modern mix version

1521
01:31:28,220 --> 01:31:36,340
2.0 okay

1522
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:39,200
[Music]

1523
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:41,449
Malibu compost okay I've only heard good

1524
01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:44,119
things about those richest compost never

1525
01:31:41,449 --> 01:31:46,130
use them is it's hard to get sometimes

1526
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:47,689
it is very hard to get all right very

1527
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:51,170
very hard to get must be good [ __ ] then

1528
01:31:47,689 --> 01:31:54,109
super good [ __ ] Jeremy started making a

1529
01:31:51,170 --> 01:31:58,399
super good soil though so I've used to

1530
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:59,960
soil a few times now on a few new pots

1531
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:03,259
that I've had to put together on some

1532
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:05,029
new rooms but all my older pots that are

1533
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:07,460
like four or five rounds in I built

1534
01:32:05,029 --> 01:32:09,949
those like all the way up like we we mix

1535
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:12,680
the compost we mix the soil we had to

1536
01:32:09,949 --> 01:32:15,229
you know mix each amendment in you know

1537
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:17,000
one cup to each cubic foot you know what

1538
01:32:15,229 --> 01:32:20,089
I'm saying okay and we had to you know

1539
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,409
had to mix it up and then uh I guess

1540
01:32:20,090 --> 01:32:23,480
you'd have it sit there for maybe like a

1541
01:32:21,409 --> 01:32:24,590
week or two but then you would just you

1542
01:32:23,479 --> 01:32:27,049
know put everything in there put your

1543
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:29,150
top dress on there you know put your

1544
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:32,480
earthworm castings in there you'd put

1545
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:34,069
your uh your cover crop and stuff like

1546
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:35,479
that and then I just let it come to life

1547
01:32:34,069 --> 01:32:36,799
and then by the time you put your plant

1548
01:32:35,479 --> 01:32:38,149
in there it's already working and it'll

1549
01:32:36,800 --> 01:32:40,400
just overtake your plant

1550
01:32:38,149 --> 01:32:42,199
okay so if you even put shitty soil in

1551
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:44,119
there it'll overtake that right oh yeah

1552
01:32:42,199 --> 01:32:45,949
and you can start with old shooty

1553
01:32:44,119 --> 01:32:47,510
recycled soil you guys I'd like to take

1554
01:32:45,949 --> 01:32:49,849
my old soil that plants have already

1555
01:32:47,510 --> 01:32:51,949
been in and I will put clones in it the

1556
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:54,289
clones if you've got a clone from me

1557
01:32:51,949 --> 01:32:55,729
chances are it came in recycled soil but

1558
01:32:54,289 --> 01:32:57,350
it was treated there are no bugs

1559
01:32:55,729 --> 01:33:01,669
it's been flushed it's happy look how

1560
01:32:57,350 --> 01:33:04,400
good your soil if you're going into

1561
01:33:01,670 --> 01:33:05,869
no-till so you've got it set up about a

1562
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,189
week in advance do we want to put water

1563
01:33:05,869 --> 01:33:09,079
in there after we've got all the

1564
01:33:07,189 --> 01:33:10,219
nutrients and all the amendments in

1565
01:33:09,079 --> 01:33:11,600
there in the soil in there do we want to

1566
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:13,280
water it a week in advance or do you

1567
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:15,079
just want to let it sit kind of you want

1568
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:21,710
it moist or do you want it to dry you

1569
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:23,449
should water together keep your

1570
01:33:21,710 --> 01:33:24,949
beneficials eatin and stuff all right

1571
01:33:23,449 --> 01:33:26,659
back because whenever we put those

1572
01:33:24,949 --> 01:33:28,010
earthworm castings in there they

1573
01:33:26,659 --> 01:33:29,750
definitely already have a lot of

1574
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:32,619
beneficials and stuff in there working

1575
01:33:29,750 --> 01:33:35,779
with the worms because you know just

1576
01:33:32,619 --> 01:33:37,970
it's so rich that that shit's so rich it

1577
01:33:35,779 --> 01:33:44,539
comes so fresh he gives it to us fresh

1578
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:46,940
out of the compost of the world it's

1579
01:33:44,539 --> 01:33:48,590
beautiful all right so you can get your

1580
01:33:46,939 --> 01:33:51,109
pots loaded up about a week in advance

1581
01:33:48,590 --> 01:33:52,520
check out the modern mix 2.0 that's a

1582
01:33:51,109 --> 01:33:56,149
good start you might want to add some

1583
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:58,489
stuff I check out sub cools ah super

1584
01:33:56,149 --> 01:34:00,049
soil recipe and it's gonna be similar

1585
01:33:58,488 --> 01:34:02,809
the way he throws a tarp on the ground

1586
01:34:00,050 --> 01:34:04,130
and mixes the super soil it's the same

1587
01:34:02,810 --> 01:34:06,080
idea what we're trying to do here we're

1588
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:09,230
just using a different mix check out the

1589
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:12,170
modern mix 2.0 find your own recipe on

1590
01:34:09,229 --> 01:34:13,699
making some no-till soil and perfective

1591
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:15,350
for your plants you'll get a good start

1592
01:34:13,699 --> 01:34:16,550
with the modern makes 2.0 it sounds like

1593
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:17,930
but your plants are gonna want different

1594
01:34:16,550 --> 01:34:20,180
[ __ ] you're gonna need to protect

1595
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:22,880
perfect it for each plant but this is a

1596
01:34:20,180 --> 01:34:25,340
good start then get your plants into

1597
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,590
there about a week after you make the

1598
01:34:25,340 --> 01:34:29,180
mix then you said mulch you want to keep

1599
01:34:27,590 --> 01:34:30,980
mulch on top to keep the worms feeding

1600
01:34:29,180 --> 01:34:33,730
what are we gonna use for mulch you can

1601
01:34:30,979 --> 01:34:33,729
use old stems

1602
01:34:34,479 --> 01:34:37,579
[Music]

1603
01:34:43,029 --> 01:34:52,189
okay so cover crop what am i growing is

1604
01:34:45,590 --> 01:34:53,930
cover crop lots of clover clover you

1605
01:34:52,189 --> 01:34:55,159
know keep bugs away so you're growing

1606
01:34:53,930 --> 01:34:57,020
lemon grass right there

1607
01:34:55,159 --> 01:34:58,639
you know it's keeping bugs I was gonna

1608
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:00,290
ask about some pest management and

1609
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:01,789
no-till here in a couple of seconds but

1610
01:35:00,289 --> 01:35:03,260
it sounds like we're there lemon grass

1611
01:35:01,789 --> 01:35:05,439
what else can I use to keep the pests

1612
01:35:03,260 --> 01:35:12,550
away on my no-till crop

1613
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:14,710
eucalyptus was Mary okay you know

1614
01:35:12,550 --> 01:35:17,020
natural stuff like that um I don't

1615
01:35:14,710 --> 01:35:19,840
really spray a neem oil on my plants I

1616
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:28,389
like garage oil okay has a more milder

1617
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:29,829
smell and it's uh my face wrinkled up a

1618
01:35:28,389 --> 01:35:32,440
little bit there's something if if you

1619
01:35:29,829 --> 01:35:36,630
get a tiny drop of neem oil on anything

1620
01:35:32,439 --> 01:35:36,629
it feels like I can taste it for a week

1621
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:44,949
it doesn't go away it's the most

1622
01:35:39,670 --> 01:35:46,389
terrible flavor ever okay so basically

1623
01:35:44,948 --> 01:35:48,759
essential oils will help you keep your

1624
01:35:46,389 --> 01:35:50,260
pests away so the lemongrass in there it

1625
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:51,850
works as cover crop and it's gonna keep

1626
01:35:50,260 --> 01:35:53,860
some bugs out that's [ __ ] smooth I

1627
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:55,329
like that it's good thinking alright so

1628
01:35:53,859 --> 01:35:56,469
that's the basics to get you started and

1629
01:35:55,329 --> 01:35:57,880
set up what else do we need to think

1630
01:35:56,469 --> 01:36:00,100
about we've got mulch we've got cover

1631
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:03,190
crop we've got some good hot soil to

1632
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:04,480
keep us cooking basically your just grow

1633
01:36:03,189 --> 01:36:08,859
it now right you got a water on one

1634
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:12,819
they're thirsty what are we gonna use

1635
01:36:08,859 --> 01:36:15,339
for top dress worm castings yeah some

1636
01:36:12,819 --> 01:36:17,198
neem meals nice email neem seed meal

1637
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:20,250
that's a lot of work that's weird yeah a

1638
01:36:17,198 --> 01:36:23,559
neem seed meal kelp meal biochars good

1639
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:28,510
worm casting some fish compost is real

1640
01:36:23,560 --> 01:36:30,250
good okay good right when you transplant

1641
01:36:28,510 --> 01:36:32,380
get a like fresh dose of nitrogen right

1642
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:33,850
to him right when they're transplanted I

1643
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:36,400
feel like kelp and sea products

1644
01:36:33,850 --> 01:36:38,889
completely add flavors and aromas and

1645
01:36:36,399 --> 01:36:39,670
density a lot so okay I do a Niemann

1646
01:36:38,889 --> 01:36:42,340
kelp tea

1647
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:43,929
every other watering do you ever fool

1648
01:36:42,340 --> 01:36:45,699
your feed with your teas that you make

1649
01:36:43,929 --> 01:36:48,489
oh yeah

1650
01:36:45,698 --> 01:36:50,289
oh yeah okay I mean I don't really make

1651
01:36:48,488 --> 01:36:51,669
teas anymore on it's just more about

1652
01:36:50,289 --> 01:36:54,310
just table dressings like whenever you

01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:20,498
os a 28 so I mean I used to use

1664
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:22,148
whenever I was doing super Souls and

1665
01:37:20,498 --> 01:37:24,569
stuff it seems like Bill Doyle gets a

1666
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:27,619
lot of free shoutouts on this podcast

1667
01:37:24,569 --> 01:37:27,619
[Music]

1668
01:37:29,458 --> 01:37:38,438
question they've got a chart it's so

1669
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:39,969
basic so man we can get I had one of my

1670
01:37:38,439 --> 01:37:41,949
basic questions here is how do we start

1671
01:37:39,969 --> 01:37:43,269
but you go get some modern mix 2.0 and

1672
01:37:41,948 --> 01:37:44,708
you get some pots filled with a new

1673
01:37:43,269 --> 01:37:46,239
water them and you grow some clones and

1674
01:37:44,708 --> 01:37:47,590
then you throw it in there and then you

1675
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:49,448
pay attention and then the next time

1676
01:37:47,590 --> 01:37:50,828
you're gonna have to add amendments so

1677
01:37:49,448 --> 01:37:53,138
we've got our mulch we've got our cover

1678
01:37:50,828 --> 01:37:55,208
crop we've taken care of our pests

1679
01:37:53,139 --> 01:38:07,359
basically we're flushing the whole time

1680
01:37:55,208 --> 01:38:09,099
right and so the worms are [ __ ] you

1681
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:19,029
know and then the beneficials come and

1682
01:38:09,099 --> 01:38:22,208
break down the worm poop at the end you

1683
01:38:19,029 --> 01:38:23,978
cut down your plant it's done do you

1684
01:38:22,208 --> 01:38:26,529
just dig a little hole next to that

1685
01:38:23,979 --> 01:38:27,789
stock and put your next clone right in

1686
01:38:26,529 --> 01:38:34,389
there how you getting it started again

1687
01:38:27,788 --> 01:38:36,038
just rip your take the rubella shake it

1688
01:38:34,389 --> 01:38:38,199
you want to get as little dirt out as

1689
01:38:36,038 --> 01:38:39,969
possible okay you don't want to add any

1690
01:38:38,198 --> 01:38:42,188
new soil to it you want to just keep

1691
01:38:39,969 --> 01:38:48,998
using the same soil over and over the

1692
01:38:42,189 --> 01:38:51,909
only thing you want to add is new soil

1693
01:38:48,998 --> 01:38:53,889
if you transplant and needed to add

1694
01:38:51,908 --> 01:38:57,518
something to actually transplant you

1695
01:38:53,889 --> 01:38:58,929
just composting okay just yeah we just

1696
01:38:57,519 --> 01:39:00,340
fill that hole with worm castings I love

1697
01:38:58,929 --> 01:39:01,689
doing that when I transplant I just put

1698
01:39:00,340 --> 01:39:03,369
a nice layer of casting so I'll throw

1699
01:39:01,689 --> 01:39:08,260
some some great white shark or something

1700
01:39:03,368 --> 01:39:10,029
I'll get that moving yeah okay and then

1701
01:39:08,260 --> 01:39:12,219
what are you gonna re amendment Riya

1702
01:39:10,029 --> 01:39:19,300
mend it with the second time Oh

1703
01:39:12,219 --> 01:39:21,819
worm castings refeeding everything huh

1704
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:23,260
neem kill biochar exactly is the cover

1705
01:39:21,819 --> 01:39:24,880
crop gonna just keep growing is that

1706
01:39:23,260 --> 01:39:27,510
like

1707
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:30,279
[Music]

1708
01:39:27,510 --> 01:39:31,810
yeah the stuff that you cut off can you

1709
01:39:30,279 --> 01:39:33,550
throw that into a tea and made kind of a

1710
01:39:31,810 --> 01:39:36,090
compost tea out of it if you're using

1711
01:39:33,550 --> 01:39:36,090
cumference

1712
01:39:38,279 --> 01:39:42,009
store anymore

1713
01:39:39,789 --> 01:39:43,869
no no really no I mean even if you

1714
01:39:42,010 --> 01:39:45,789
wanted to you know make your own you

1715
01:39:43,869 --> 01:39:47,949
know basically like if you want to push

1716
01:39:45,789 --> 01:39:50,229
your plants extra hard you can use like

1717
01:39:47,949 --> 01:39:52,269
cow foes and stuff like that you can

1718
01:39:50,229 --> 01:39:55,059
make your own calcium and phosphorus

1719
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:56,980
yeah yeah it sounds like this all these

1720
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:58,240
processes are super sustainable you know

1721
01:39:56,979 --> 01:40:00,939
like especially once you get to like a

1722
01:39:58,239 --> 01:40:02,409
certain level and so just that's great

1723
01:40:00,939 --> 01:40:06,009
for your soil anyway you know you just

1724
01:40:02,409 --> 01:40:08,260
like building your own little like yeah

1725
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:10,030
and one of the major problems of home

1726
01:40:08,260 --> 01:40:12,460
growing is that when you're done you've

1727
01:40:10,029 --> 01:40:15,009
got all this trash you've got sticks

1728
01:40:12,460 --> 01:40:19,720
you've got leaves you've got you've got

1729
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:21,670
dirt bottles bottles you can throw in

1730
01:40:19,720 --> 01:40:26,220
the trash but it's all that dirt like I

1731
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:29,470
grow I used to have I would do like 20

1732
01:40:26,220 --> 01:40:30,880
28 7 gallon pots and that's a lot of

1733
01:40:29,470 --> 01:40:32,500
soil when you're done and I would have

1734
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:34,510
to find somewhere smooth to throw all

1735
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:36,520
that away and luckily I have a friend

1736
01:40:34,510 --> 01:40:37,720
who grows an outdoor vegetable garden

1737
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:38,920
and I would just have him come pick it

1738
01:40:37,720 --> 01:40:40,119
all up in his truck and he would just

1739
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,350
haul it off for me in the middle of the

1740
01:40:40,119 --> 01:40:44,319
night but if I didn't have that hookup

1741
01:40:41,350 --> 01:40:46,600
what am I gonna do with 28 7 gallon pots

1742
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:47,829
worth of soil you guys don't even have

1743
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:56,289
to worry about that your worms just

1744
01:40:47,829 --> 01:40:57,880
going like oh you need new dirt throw

1745

01:42:45,310 --> 01:42:49,960
anything differently so I wrote down how

1770
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:52,270
cost effective is this sounds like it's

1771
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:53,890
a one-time deal right oh yeah I mean

1772
01:42:52,270 --> 01:42:55,480
like you gotta keep you get occasionally

1773
01:42:53,890 --> 01:42:57,220
buy more worm castings you have to buy

1774
01:42:55,479 --> 01:42:58,719
you know you might have to buy some more

1775
01:42:57,220 --> 01:43:00,940
demon kelp meal because I do Niemann

1776
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:02,470
kelp teas just you know I just do those

1777
01:43:00,939 --> 01:43:04,449
every like third watering I think and

1778
01:43:02,470 --> 01:43:06,100
then it's top dresses as well depending

1779
01:43:04,449 --> 01:43:08,079
on how much you're doing but as far as

1780
01:43:06,100 --> 01:43:10,120
the soil goes yeah it's basically one

1781
01:43:08,079 --> 01:43:12,880
you're not buying seven bags of soil

1782
01:43:10,119 --> 01:43:18,970
every time you need to transplant twenty

1783
01:43:12,880 --> 01:43:21,130
eight seven gallon pots it sounds like a

1784
01:43:18,970 --> 01:43:23,199
lot of work but it also sounds like it's

1785
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:24,460
saving me a whole bunch of work in the

1786
01:43:23,199 --> 01:43:27,460
long run I don't have to go to the gross

1787
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:29,289
form buy bottles which are expensive and

1788
01:43:27,460 --> 01:43:31,149
it's a lot oh I'm paying for the water

1789
01:43:29,289 --> 01:43:32,920
to be shipped feels like essentially

1790
01:43:31,149 --> 01:43:34,359
because I read the ingredients and all

1791
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,859
that shit's available and build the soil

1792
01:43:34,359 --> 01:43:37,380
on a dry form well the difference

1793
01:43:35,859 --> 01:43:39,269
between like potassium silicon

1794
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:40,859
you're talking if you get premix

1795
01:43:39,270 --> 01:43:42,960
potassium silicate in a bottle it's

1796
01:43:40,859 --> 01:43:46,529
gonna cost like I mean ten times more if

1797
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:48,510
not more than that then what the bag if

1798
01:43:46,529 --> 01:43:50,219
the powder comes in and you can make 10

1799
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:53,100
times as much that comes in the bottle

1800
01:43:50,219 --> 01:43:57,300
with that it's crazy now you got me

1801
01:43:53,100 --> 01:43:59,579
rethinking everything I do and you can

1802
01:43:57,300 --> 01:44:12,210
make a gallon with 568 grams yeah easily

1803
01:43:59,579 --> 01:44:13,738
yeah okay man I wish I could I want to

1804
01:44:12,210 --> 01:44:15,420
start off just like one or two pots of

1805
01:44:13,738 --> 01:44:18,988
some stuff and to see if I can see what

1806
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:30,329
it does next to my botanic air grow or

1807
01:44:18,988 --> 01:44:32,579
whatever brand I'm using my veg it's

1808
01:44:30,329 --> 01:44:34,519
really like they're gonna want to spread

1809
01:44:32,579 --> 01:44:36,840
out they're gonna want to go to where

1810
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:38,610
you know they're gonna be needed that's

1811
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:47,670
rad so it's gonna just move over to the

1812
01:44:38,609 --> 01:44:52,049
other possible only there's plenty of

1813
01:44:47,670 --> 01:44:53,609
things lactobacillus serum I had a buddy

1814
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:56,070
that had some other plants that got some

1815
01:44:53,609 --> 01:44:57,179
PM on them and uh I was like you want to

1816
01:44:56,069 --> 01:45:00,299
get rid of that real quick you know and

1817
01:44:57,179 --> 01:45:01,739
he was like yeah for sure you know so we

1818
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:03,300
just took some lactobacillus theorem you

1819
01:45:01,738 --> 01:45:05,129
spray that for three days and it's a

1820
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:07,560
completely gone cuz beneficial fungi

1821
01:45:05,130 --> 01:45:10,139
overtakes bad fungi yeah that's a whole

1822
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:11,969
lots like a farmer still about like you

1823
01:45:10,139 --> 01:45:13,500
know PM being systematic and stuff like

1824
01:45:11,969 --> 01:45:14,789
that's definitely not systematic he went

1825
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:18,000
through his whole flower period and had

1826
01:45:14,789 --> 01:45:20,488
no PM thang so ever very nice you know

1827
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,779
she just plants can be a real [ __ ]

1828
01:45:20,488 --> 01:45:23,669
sometimes in Colorado when the

1829
01:45:21,779 --> 01:45:30,179
temperature changes yeah and it changes

1830
01:45:23,670 --> 01:45:33,000
every day I was like it's too warm I

1831

I go to a lot of comedy shows Joe Rogan

1840
01:45:57,909 --> 01:46:17,979
is probably one of the foam they're like

1841
01:45:59,859 --> 01:46:20,289
really give me super pumped so it seems

1842
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:21,819
like you guys both follow the TLO book

1843
01:46:20,289 --> 01:46:43,029
quite a bit is a good way to get started

1844
01:46:21,819 --> 01:46:44,710
you recommend the TLO book from the they

1845
01:46:43,029 --> 01:46:48,059
made him changed his facebook page to

1846
01:46:44,710 --> 01:46:48,060
his real name so that's weird

1847
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:53,500
check out the TLO book true living

1848
01:46:50,529 --> 01:46:54,909
organics what's the other book that he

1849
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:57,970
did that I did not write down the name

1850
01:46:54,909 --> 01:47:19,269
of okay everybody went blank

1851
01:46:57,970 --> 01:47:22,300
anyway the rift teach you how to keep

1852
01:47:19,270 --> 01:47:24,880
your soil food web Rock read TLO first

1853
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:26,860
cuz teeming with microbes is a little

1854
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:28,449
bit overwhelming it's not really begin

1855
01:47:26,859 --> 01:47:30,630
information you need to have you need to

1856
01:47:28,449 --> 01:47:33,099
have kind of an idea of what's going on

1857
01:47:30,630 --> 01:47:39,909
or it's you know just go right over your

1858
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:42,520
head otherwise ret LOL is a great one

1859
01:47:39,909 --> 01:47:43,599
and then once you get a good handle on

1860
01:47:42,520 --> 01:47:45,940
that you think you have an understanding

1861
01:47:43,600 --> 01:47:47,590
of like how organics work and you know

1862
01:47:45,939 --> 01:47:49,719
you want to dive a little deeper

1863
01:47:47,590 --> 01:47:51,069
open up teeming with microbes and learn

1864
01:47:49,720 --> 01:47:52,960
about the soil food web because that's

1865
01:47:51,069 --> 01:47:55,359
where that's where Noto really comes

1866
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,739
into play okay the soil food web because

1867
01:47:55,359 --> 01:47:59,579
that's what's happening inside of your

1868
01:47:56,739 --> 01:48:01,769
soil is you've got a whole ecosystem of

1869
01:47:59,579 --> 01:48:05,078
microorganisms living breathing

1870
01:48:01,769 --> 01:48:08,289
excreting you know feeding your plants

1871
01:48:05,078 --> 01:48:09,788
so yeah definitely definitely check both

1872
01:48:08,288 --> 01:48:10,689
of those out any other books you two

1873
01:48:09,788 --> 01:48:13,478
would recommend while you're talking

1874
01:48:10,689 --> 01:48:14,710
about books TV with nutrients is pretty

1875
01:48:13,479 --> 01:48:16,389
good that's a little bit less about

1876
01:48:14,710 --> 01:48:17,979
organics it's for the same guys that

1877
01:48:16,389 --> 01:48:19,269
they're teeming with microbes I've

1878
01:48:17,979 --> 01:48:20,999
skimmed through that we have it at work

1879
01:48:19,269 --> 01:48:25,599
I've skimmed through it a couple times

1880
01:48:20,998 --> 01:48:26,978
it's just more yes less organic base but

1881
01:48:25,599 --> 01:48:28,420
if you're if you don't want to do the

1882
01:48:26,979 --> 01:48:29,920
full organic ride which I understand

1883
01:48:28,420 --> 01:48:31,359
some people don't want to do it check it

1884
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,859
out it'll it'll kind of give you a good

1885
01:48:31,359 --> 01:48:35,038
a little bit better understanding what's

1886
01:48:32,859 --> 01:48:37,420
going on in your soil with your

1887
01:48:35,038 --> 01:48:40,170
nutrients and bottle-feeding and stuff

1888
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:42,578
okay cool you guys ever get any of your

1889
01:48:40,170 --> 01:48:48,460
no-till products tested by any of the

1890
01:48:42,578 --> 01:48:50,109
labs I haven't yet but I want to really

1891
01:48:48,460 --> 01:49:08,050
soon I think me and my buddy we're gonna

1892
01:48:50,109 --> 01:49:10,029
go up to Springs to uh I could just show

1893
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:11,829
how food-grade our cannabis is that we

1894
01:49:10,029 --> 01:49:13,779
don't spray no pesticides we don't use

1895
01:49:11,828 --> 01:49:16,328
no [ __ ] you know we don't use

1896
01:49:13,779 --> 01:49:18,189
bottles there's no heavy metals like you

1897
01:49:16,328 --> 01:49:20,018
could test it you know all the way down

1898
01:49:18,189 --> 01:49:23,228
and it's just gonna be a pure cannabis

1899
01:49:20,019 --> 01:49:27,460
right okay I'd love to see the tests I

1900

01:51:50,229 --> 01:51:52,779
are gorgeous last time I was there I

1966
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,790
think they had some of the gorilla glue

1967
01:51:52,779 --> 01:51:59,529
on the shelf it's beautiful it's a crowd

1968
01:51:54,789 --> 01:52:01,869
favorite it doesn't stay long busy when

1969
01:51:59,529 --> 01:52:03,429
stuff comes around so that was a huge

1970
01:52:01,869 --> 01:52:06,960
challenge to the cannon cannon you guys

1971
01:52:03,430 --> 01:52:06,960
can write the check out to Rasta Jeff

1972
01:52:10,789 --> 01:52:15,069
[Music]

1973
01:52:12,689 --> 01:52:17,169
little parchment paper that it was

1974
01:52:15,069 --> 01:52:18,460
twenty seven point something grams when

1975
01:52:17,170 --> 01:52:30,220
he dropped it off is what it looked like

1976
01:52:18,460 --> 01:52:37,050
bros nowhere near 27 being reimbursed

1977
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:40,690
for quickly if you do go to the club

1978
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:42,850
cannabis or any of the clubs learn the

1979
01:52:40,689 --> 01:52:45,519
lingo please say the proper [ __ ] use the

1980
01:52:42,850 --> 01:52:47,890
proper terminology nomenclature whatever

1981
01:52:45,520 --> 01:52:50,830
you gotta do reimburse however it goes

1982
01:52:47,890 --> 01:52:53,650
there sometimes it feels silly but

1983
01:52:50,829 --> 01:52:55,300
that's the way it works so I think we've

1984
01:52:53,649 --> 01:52:56,500
covered most of no till and it sounds

1985
01:52:55,300 --> 01:52:58,180
like this is a perfect segue into

1986
01:52:56,500 --> 01:52:59,739
something else that I wanted to talk

1987
01:52:58,180 --> 01:53:03,180
about ladies and gentlemen in Denver

1988
01:52:59,739 --> 01:53:08,789
Colorado they voted yes to allow

1989
01:53:03,180 --> 01:53:11,770
consumption of cannabis in adult places

1990
01:53:08,789 --> 01:53:13,840
some bars and clubs will begin allowing

1991
01:53:11,770 --> 01:53:16,750
people to smoke cannabis in certain

1992
01:53:13,840 --> 01:53:18,489
sections indoors in places that means

1993
01:53:16,750 --> 01:53:22,569
we're going to have social lounges in

1994
01:53:18,489 --> 01:53:23,649
Denver very soon people are looking for

1995
01:53:22,569 --> 01:53:25,559
buildings to rent right now there are

1996
01:53:23,649 --> 01:53:28,179
already places that function kind of

1997
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:29,860
legitimately kind of under the radar

1998
01:53:28,180 --> 01:53:31,840
those places are probably gonna blow up

1999
01:53:29,859 --> 01:53:33,339
and be popular or there are people out

2000
01:53:31,840 --> 01:53:42,520
there right now looking for property

2001
01:53:33,340 --> 01:53:44,199
painting the walls I've been to a couple

2002
01:53:42,520 --> 01:53:46,510
just like Springs I've been to a couple

2003
01:53:44,199 --> 01:53:48,970
that are really nice like the can of

2004
01:53:46,510 --> 01:53:50,920
Canyon the couches they went to a nice

2005
01:53:48,970 --> 01:53:53,829
place and bought brand new couches

2006
01:53:50,920 --> 01:53:55,989
they bought a rug that matched the paint

2007
01:53:53,829 --> 01:53:57,850
on the walls they got a table with end

2008
01:53:55,989 --> 01:53:59,260
tables that all match they got a shelf

2009
01:53:57,850 --> 01:54:01,300
that's the same kind of wood as the

2010
01:53:59,260 --> 01:54:03,310
tables like it looks like somebody

2011
01:54:01,300 --> 01:54:05,739
really they got they had like their gate

2012

2013
01:54:05,739 --> 01:54:10,029

2014
01:54:08,529 --> 01:54:12,519
they got all of their [ __ ] at the

2015
01:54:10,029 --> 01:54:14,529
[ __ ] the thrift store down the street

2016
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:14,860
and their [ __ ] dog laid on it for six

2017
01:54:14,529 --> 01:54:17,259
weeks

2018
01:54:14,859 --> 01:54:19,189
I honestly won't let my dreadlocks touch

2019
01:54:17,260 --> 01:54:21,900
that cabbage

2020
01:54:19,189 --> 01:54:33,869
I will let my dreads down in there I

2021
01:54:21,899 --> 01:54:35,789
keep my dreads out of the other place

2022
01:54:33,869 --> 01:54:37,590
and there are other places that are in

2023
01:54:35,789 --> 01:54:39,600
the middle and above and below that

2024
01:54:37,590 --> 01:54:41,159
there are some where I won't even take

2025
01:54:39,600 --> 01:54:44,010
my backpack in because I feel like I

2026
01:54:41,159 --> 01:54:45,149
might get jacked for it yeah are so damn

2027
01:54:44,010 --> 01:54:49,010
loud because the band is playing

2028
01:54:45,149 --> 01:54:49,009
constantly they can't even be there

2029
01:54:51,979 --> 01:55:24,029
hope somebody doesn't don't all have to

2030
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:25,770
be have to be dubstep bars one of those

2031
01:55:24,029 --> 01:55:27,479
things you can be like hey can we get a

2032
01:55:25,770 --> 01:55:30,360
permit for Saturday night so we can

2033
01:55:27,479 --> 01:55:32,579
allow smoking or is it just like a and

2034
01:55:30,359 --> 01:55:34,769
bro hypothetical now you guys this is

2035
01:55:32,579 --> 01:55:40,769
all [ __ ] that is going to come up stuff

2036
01:55:34,770 --> 01:55:42,600
okay I preach this all the time because

2037
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:44,670
if you don't write these rules in your

2038
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:46,140
role making old people in suits that

2039
01:55:44,670 --> 01:55:47,640
don't give a [ __ ] about cannabis that

2040
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:48,690
don't take dabs that don't go out or

2041
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:51,960
gonna write these rules that's gonna

2042
01:55:48,689 --> 01:55:54,659
suck so maybe you can get like like you

2043
01:55:51,960 --> 01:55:57,300
get around liquor license for a year of

2044
01:55:54,659 --> 01:55:59,849
cannabis consumption license every night

2045
01:55:57,300 --> 01:56:05,000
after 9 p.m. you can consume cannabis in

2046
01:55:59,850 --> 01:56:05,000
your facility or whatever from 90 to 93

2047
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:12,079
drinks you take some dad's and hang out

2048
01:56:08,010 --> 01:56:12,079
socialize nobody ever gets in a fight

2049
01:56:12,680 --> 01:56:18,659
well my thought too is what about like

2050
01:56:15,960 --> 01:56:22,319
if you bring your own like dabs to these

2051
01:56:18,659 --> 01:56:24,210
places the way it's gonna work with our

2052
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:25,829
marijuana Enforcement Division system

2053
01:56:24,210 --> 01:56:28,090
that's mostly the way it's gonna have to

2054
01:56:25,829 --> 01:56:30,619
work as a bring your own cannabis system

2055
01:56:28,090 --> 01:56:31,940
I'm sure they'll cut the loop out the

2056
01:56:30,619 --> 01:56:33,739
loophole out of that one pretty quickly

2057
01:56:31,939 --> 01:56:35,299
because they've seen how it worked with

2058
01:56:33,739 --> 01:56:37,279
a seen how it works down in Colorado

2059
01:56:35,300 --> 01:56:38,539
Springs with the loopholes so I feel

2060
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:40,130
like they'll probably make it so it's

2061
01:56:38,539 --> 01:56:43,489
like all right there's no no

2062
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:45,199
reimbursement is not a co-op this is you

2063
01:56:43,489 --> 01:56:47,269
can bring I think they'll make it pretty

2064
01:56:45,199 --> 01:56:53,300
clear that is like there will be no

2065
01:56:47,270 --> 01:56:58,400
money they'll have to have a they call

2066
01:56:53,300 --> 01:57:01,239
it a Barcade is a theme so I just stand

2067
01:56:58,399 --> 01:57:04,399
there like I like supernovae at Springs

2068
01:57:01,239 --> 01:57:05,840
I can play some Street Fighter and all

2069
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:10,369
you [ __ ] drunks are spilling beer on

2070
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:12,110
me honestly I I would like a beer but

2071
01:57:10,369 --> 01:57:14,510
unfortunately I don't know how to have a

2072
01:57:12,109 --> 01:57:16,639
beer I like to have about 20 or 30 beers

2073
01:57:14,510 --> 01:57:25,579
so I just don't drink at all it's a lot

2074
01:57:16,640 --> 01:57:27,500
better for me because my money or my car

2075
01:57:25,579 --> 01:57:32,329
is drink a lot of shots

2076
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:34,310
there's no drink at all but I can smoke

2077
01:57:32,329 --> 01:57:35,989
like the best of them so I wish all my

2078
01:57:34,310 --> 01:57:59,630
friends are at supernova drinking and

2079
01:57:35,989 --> 01:58:18,559
doing the ganja gourmet can go back to

2080
01:57:59,630 --> 01:58:20,480
the ocean or County to County there's

2081
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:22,340
the Clean Air Act so you're not supposed

2082
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:23,629
to be able to smoke in places but if

2083
01:58:22,340 --> 01:58:25,579
that's why I was saying you could get

2084
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:27,260
that yearly liquor license that cannabis

2085
01:58:25,579 --> 01:58:29,689
consumption license it would probably

2086
01:58:27,260 --> 01:58:39,980
break that give you that rule override

2087
01:58:29,689 --> 01:58:40,500
somehow just imagine like by the third

2088
01:58:39,979 --> 01:58:42,839
or four

2089
01:58:40,500 --> 01:58:44,460

02:02:05,699 --> 02:02:08,369
people

2116
02:02:06,329 --> 02:02:10,470
[ __ ] medicine you want to give them

2117
02:02:08,369 --> 02:02:13,739
quality medicine that is actually

2118
02:02:10,470 --> 02:02:15,390
medicine into their bodies they just go

2119
02:02:13,739 --> 02:02:17,399
get pharmaceuticals they'd go to the

2120
02:02:15,390 --> 02:02:19,440
pharmacy and get some pills and get some

2121
02:02:17,399 --> 02:02:20,939
poison yep please let's not poison

2122
02:02:19,439 --> 02:02:23,189
people that's not a very stupid [ __ ] on

2123
02:02:20,939 --> 02:02:24,839
our plants if you're growing the bottles

2124
02:02:23,189 --> 02:02:26,609
I'm not hating on you I grow a finals

2125
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:28,980
you guys I like to use botanic air pure

2126
02:02:26,609 --> 02:02:32,069
blend Pro I use veg bloom I've done

2127
02:02:28,979 --> 02:02:33,509
plenty of that organic as [ __ ] stuff my

2128
02:02:32,069 --> 02:02:35,219
lifestyle in the way that I learned how

2129
02:02:33,510 --> 02:02:36,570
to grow I'm really comfortable with the

2130
02:02:35,220 --> 02:02:38,190
bottles these guys kind of inspired me

2131
02:02:36,569 --> 02:02:40,199
to step outside the box you may see me

2132
02:02:38,189 --> 02:02:42,029
do some some attempts at some no-till

2133
02:02:40,199 --> 02:02:43,739
stuff but we're not hating on you if you

2134
02:02:42,029 --> 02:02:47,340
are drawing with bottles do me one favor

2135
02:02:43,739 --> 02:02:50,010
and flush leave for at least 10 to 14

2136
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:52,050
days I think 20 days if you've got a

2137
02:02:50,010 --> 02:02:53,670
longer strain go ahead flush for 20 days

2138
02:02:52,050 --> 02:02:55,020
if your leaves start looking a little

2139
02:02:53,670 --> 02:02:56,489
bit yellow you're doing it right don't

2140
02:02:55,020 --> 02:02:58,560
get mad at some yellow leaves at the end

2141
02:02:56,489 --> 02:03:00,479
that means a plant is using up the

2142
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:03,660
nutrients that it needed and it is now

2143
02:03:00,479 --> 02:03:05,039
time to come down look outside what

2144
02:03:03,659 --> 02:03:07,019
happens leaves change colors and they

2145
02:03:05,039 --> 02:03:10,289
come off your plant is saying it's fall

2146
02:03:07,020 --> 02:03:12,390
time to the end you should cut it down

2147
02:03:10,289 --> 02:03:16,949
and take care of it alright that's what

2148
02:03:12,390 --> 02:03:18,600
I think just one more thing as I say to

2149
02:03:16,949 --> 02:03:20,429
anybody that is like hasn't started I

2150
02:03:18,600 --> 02:03:21,990
meant to say this is the last one

2151
02:03:20,430 --> 02:03:23,730
anybody that hasn't started growing yet

2152
02:03:21,989 --> 02:03:26,279
and if you want to get into growing and

2153
02:03:23,729 --> 02:03:27,809
you think you eventually do want to get

2154
02:03:26,279 --> 02:03:29,639
into organics and you think it might be

2155
02:03:27,810 --> 02:03:32,940
smarter to learn with bottles first

2156
02:03:29,640 --> 02:03:34,829
don't I would advise you just go ahead

2157
02:03:32,939 --> 02:03:36,750
and jump straight into organics because

2158
02:03:34,829 --> 02:03:38,970
it's two totally different things yeah

2159
02:03:36,750 --> 02:03:40,199
the the styles of grow you you know

2160
02:03:38,970 --> 02:03:41,250
you'll learn how to grow with nutrients

2161
02:03:40,199 --> 02:03:43,500
and like okay cool I must wish to

2162
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:45,000
organics and it's an it's entirely

2163
02:03:43,500 --> 02:03:46,649
different you learn you start from

2164
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:48,659
scratch if you have to buy so much

2165
02:03:46,649 --> 02:03:50,670
different yeah it's it's so much

2166
02:03:48,659 --> 02:03:53,519
different in it so if you want if you

2167
02:03:50,670 --> 02:03:55,590
know you want to do organics just go

2168
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:58,260
from the get-go just go no till because

2169
02:03:55,590 --> 02:03:59,850
it sounds like no-till it's gonna cost

2170
02:03:58,260 --> 02:04:01,380
you a little bit more to get started

2171
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:03,030
versa you're gonna have to buy worms

2172
02:04:01,380 --> 02:04:04,350
you're gonna need worm castings you're

2173
02:04:03,029 --> 02:04:07,019
gonna need amendments you're gonna need

2174
02:04:04,350 --> 02:04:09,360
modern mix 2.0 you're gonna need to get

2175
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:11,070
a head start on yourself but I think if

2176
02:04:09,359 --> 02:04:15,789
you're buying something like advanced

2177
02:04:11,069 --> 02:04:18,559
nutrients or mills yeah

2178
02:04:15,789 --> 02:04:20,090
yeah so just get yourself some no-till

2179
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:21,680
and you're ready to go you only have to

2180
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:24,409
buy it once after that first harvest

2181
02:04:21,680 --> 02:04:26,780
you've paid for that richer and richer

2182
02:04:24,409 --> 02:04:35,659
and richer yeah round thirties gonna be

2183
02:04:26,779 --> 02:04:38,929
the best round ok be like you know like

2184
02:04:35,659 --> 02:04:42,289
like the like the I guess like the

2185
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:43,670
forests are like like the rainforest you

2186
02:04:42,289 --> 02:04:45,050
know like the biggest plants in the

2187
02:04:43,670 --> 02:04:46,550
world are in the rainforest it has the

2188
02:04:45,050 --> 02:04:49,000
richest soil in the world so you know

2189
02:04:46,550 --> 02:04:51,170
basically your soils gonna be like

2190
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,399
reinforced yeah its undisturbed out

2191
02:04:51,170 --> 02:04:54,469
there nothing [ __ ] with that except

2192
02:04:52,399 --> 02:04:57,139
nature so much humic sand things things

2193
02:04:54,469 --> 02:05:15,319
die and things recompose go ahead

2194
02:04:57,140 --> 02:05:17,030
definitely with compost will there ever

2195
02:05:15,319 --> 02:05:19,460
be a point when I have too many worms in

2196
02:05:17,029 --> 02:05:20,960
my pot because it just is

2197
02:05:19,460 --> 02:05:23,480
self-sustaining yeah they regulate

2198
02:05:20,960 --> 02:05:25,539
themselves deer they multiply relatively

2199
02:05:23,479 --> 02:05:44,899
quickly

2200
02:05:25,539 --> 02:05:47,060
they also yeah they regulate okay hello

2201
02:05:44,899 --> 02:05:49,069
I think the Rebbe actually gives a nice

2202
02:05:47,060 --> 02:05:50,510
little set up on how to make a worm farm

2203
02:05:49,069 --> 02:05:52,759
so that you can make your own worm

2204
02:05:50,510 --> 02:05:54,409
castings from the worms as well oh yeah

2205
02:05:52,760 --> 02:05:57,409
so you can get that going you can be

2206
02:05:54,409 --> 02:05:59,448
fully sustainable do the worm castings

2207
02:05:57,409 --> 02:06:05,119
in your garage because it does kind of

2208
02:05:59,448 --> 02:06:06,649
stink a little bit what yeah yeah and

2209
02:06:05,119 --> 02:06:08,960
I'm a vegetarian so I'm throwing in like

2210

want to drag the whole planet across the

2382

02:18:00,489 --> 02:18:04,059
works to go see Joe Rogan was the

2405
02:18:02,770 --> 02:18:06,099
headliner there was a comedian named

2406
02:18:04,059 --> 02:18:07,269
Doron Horton that opened that dude was

2407
02:18:06,099 --> 02:18:09,520
[ __ ] hilarious you guys I'd never

2408
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:11,260
heard of or seen him before when he came

2409
02:18:09,520 --> 02:18:13,420
on stage he walked in made a presence

2410
02:18:11,260 --> 02:18:15,760
and he crushed for like 30 or 40 solid

2411
02:18:13,420 --> 02:18:16,870
minutes and then he wound down and he

2412
02:18:15,760 --> 02:18:18,280
looked at the crowd and he was like I

2413
02:18:16,870 --> 02:18:20,770
think I'm done and he said ladies and

2414
02:18:18,280 --> 02:18:23,860
gentlemen Joe Rogan and Joe Rogan came

2415
02:18:20,770 --> 02:18:26,020
out and crushed guys Joe Rogan just did

2416
02:18:23,860 --> 02:18:27,550
his new comedy special for the year and

2417
02:18:26,020 --> 02:18:29,590
when a comedian records their special

2418
02:18:27,549 --> 02:18:31,029
the way they do it they kind of record

2419
02:18:29,590 --> 02:18:32,979
that special and they throw away that

2420
02:18:31,030 --> 02:18:34,960
material once your comedy special comes

2421
02:18:32,979 --> 02:18:36,699
out on Comedy Central or Netflix or

2422
02:18:34,959 --> 02:18:38,529
wherever it goes see so seems to be the

2423
02:18:36,700 --> 02:18:39,849
new [ __ ] but once your comedy special

2424
02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:41,739
comes out you throw away that material

2425
02:18:39,849 --> 02:18:43,960
you don't perform that anymore and you

2426
02:18:41,739 --> 02:18:45,340
work on your next hour and then at the

2427
02:18:43,959 --> 02:18:47,468
end of the year you want to put out your

2428
02:18:45,340 --> 02:18:49,030
whole new special of our material then

2429
02:18:47,468 --> 02:18:51,250
you do that all over again and that

2430
02:18:49,030 --> 02:18:53,349
keeps the commedia on his toes but Rogan

2431
02:18:51,250 --> 02:18:54,940
just put out a special so he's only had

2432
02:18:53,349 --> 02:18:57,670
a couple of months to work up new [ __ ]

2433
02:18:54,940 --> 02:18:59,230
maybe a month and he was here doing new

2434
02:18:57,670 --> 02:19:01,149
[ __ ] he went for an hour and a half and

2435
02:18:59,229 --> 02:19:02,409
about 45 to an hour into the show he

2436
02:19:01,149 --> 02:19:04,449
kind of looked up at the crowd with this

2437
02:19:02,409 --> 02:19:05,590
look and he goes I just ran out of [ __ ]

2438
02:19:04,450 --> 02:19:06,700
about like three minutes ago I don't

2439
02:19:05,590 --> 02:19:08,200
have any more material and he just

2440
02:19:06,700 --> 02:19:10,120
started making [ __ ] up on the fly and

2441
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:12,190
kind of joke in and he's still crushed

2442
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:14,679
it he did a little bit of crowd work but

2443
02:19:12,190 --> 02:19:16,090
he destroyed for a comedian I love Joe

2444
02:19:14,679 --> 02:19:18,670
Rogan style I love the way he does

2445
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:20,739
comedy and I agree with like 97% of what

2446
02:19:18,670 --> 02:19:22,600
he says so that's always a great show

2447
02:19:20,739 --> 02:19:24,940
Joe does a show he wraps up we're giving

2448
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:28,300
him a standing ovation he walks off the

2449
02:19:24,940 --> 02:19:30,250
stage and less than 40 seconds later he

2450
02:19:28,299 --> 02:19:32,529
comes running back on stage it had to be

2451
02:19:30,250 --> 02:19:34,389
like 1520 seconds later he ran back on

2452
02:19:32,530 --> 02:19:35,890
stage and he grabs a microphone and he

2453
02:19:34,389 --> 02:19:37,750
said sit the [ __ ] down

2454
02:19:35,889 --> 02:19:39,459
ladies and gentlemen Dave Chappelle is

2455
02:19:37,750 --> 02:19:42,639
here or he said you guys Dave Chappelle

2456
02:19:39,459 --> 02:19:45,219
is here and me and my date looked at

2457
02:19:42,639 --> 02:19:46,840
each other like what cuz what that's

2458
02:19:45,219 --> 02:19:48,219
what probably one of our favorite

2459
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:49,960
comedians both of us I've never seen

2460
02:19:48,219 --> 02:19:52,060
Dave Chappelle she's never seen Rogen or

2461
02:19:49,959 --> 02:19:53,140
Chappell I've seen Rogen before but for

2462
02:19:52,060 --> 02:19:55,510
Chappelle to walk out

2463
02:19:53,140 --> 02:19:58,109
it was awesome Chappelle was [ __ ] up

2464
02:19:55,510 --> 02:20:00,489
you guys Chappelle was intoxicated

2465
02:19:58,110 --> 02:20:01,900
luckily since I've got some friends at

2466
02:20:00,489 --> 02:20:04,810
Comedy Works I happened to be front row

2467
02:20:01,899 --> 02:20:06,220
and as you walk out onto the stage there

2468
02:20:04,810 --> 02:20:07,720
are a couple stages a couple seats

2469
02:20:06,220 --> 02:20:10,180
actually on the stage but then if you go

2470
02:20:07,720 --> 02:20:12,159
a few more feet those next two seats

2471
02:20:10,181 --> 02:20:13,931
that are in the crowd are where I was

2472
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:16,299
sitting and where Jenny Beth was sitting

2473
02:20:13,931 --> 02:20:17,980
so Chappelle just was [ __ ] up so he

2474
02:20:16,299 --> 02:20:19,359
just walked out barely onto the stage so

2475
02:20:17,979 --> 02:20:21,489
he was on the stage and he stood

2476
02:20:19,360 --> 02:20:23,710
directly in front of her and I and told

2477
02:20:21,489 --> 02:20:25,569
jokes for about 30 minutes and Shane

2478
02:20:23,709 --> 02:20:29,199
smoked cigarettes and drank Corona beers

2479
02:20:25,569 --> 02:20:31,000
he did 40 solid minutes of grabbing by

2480
02:20:29,200 --> 02:20:32,351
the [ __ ] jokes and material about Trump

2481
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:33,700
and the election he did some Dave

2482
02:20:32,351 --> 02:20:36,340
Chappelle jokes he did a little bit of

2483
02:20:33,700 --> 02:20:38,110
weed jokes but mostly grab him by the

2484
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:40,810
[ __ ] jokes like 40 minutes by Dave

2485
02:20:38,110 --> 02:20:42,040
Chappelle it was hilarious big shot

2486

allow it this week of course being the

2594
02:24:04,680 --> 02:24:08,639
Thanksgiving week I just took it off I

2595
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:10,139
wanted to hang out spend some time

2596
02:24:08,639 --> 02:24:11,549
actually worked on my garden a little

2597
02:24:10,139 --> 02:24:14,728
bit I hung out with that girl Jenny Beth

2598
02:24:11,549 --> 02:24:15,929
I've been talking about so much my kid

2599
02:24:14,728 --> 02:24:17,908
oh yes I do have a daughter and I'll

2600
02:24:15,930 --> 02:24:19,020
talk about her a lot on the podcast she

2601
02:24:17,908 --> 02:24:22,078
doesn't want to be talked about I'm

2602
02:24:19,020 --> 02:24:24,810
pretty sure on a podcast a little bit so

2603
02:24:22,078 --> 02:24:27,779
kind of took the Thursday episode off I

2604
02:24:24,809 --> 02:24:29,698

2608
02:24:33,510 --> 02:24:37,020
Monday's better that was why I put them

2609
02:24:35,010 --> 02:24:38,340
out on Monday mondays are generally

2610
02:24:37,020 --> 02:24:39,988
shitty for people who don't like their

2611
02:24:38,340 --> 02:24:41,728
jobs or don't have the best jobs you

2612
02:24:39,988 --> 02:24:43,049
little get to grow weed people that

2613
02:24:41,728 --> 02:24:44,398
aren't artists or musicians your Monday

2614
02:24:43,049 --> 02:24:46,500
probably sucks if you're in the service

2615
02:24:44,398 --> 02:24:47,760
industry your Monday sucks so that's why

2616
02:24:46,500 --> 02:24:48,689
I put them out on Monday morning I try

2617
02:24:47,760 --> 02:24:50,369
to make your day a little bit brighter

2618
02:24:48,689 --> 02:24:52,979
I'm glad I'm doing that for you dad

2619
02:24:50,369 --> 02:24:54,390

2622
02:24:55,408 --> 02:24:58,109

2623
02:24:56,728 --> 02:25:00,238

2627
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:12,770
got an email from a guy I'm gonna hit

2628
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:12,770
pause and take a drink so I can quit

2629
02:25:17,510 --> 02:25:21,000
that's a little bit better of course

2630
02:25:19,590 --> 02:25:22,920
it'll come back because I took some dads

2631
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,568
and I ate this not blaming it on the

2632
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:26,850
banana pudding bar but it is kind of

2633
02:25:24,568 --> 02:25:30,059
making my throat a little buttery thing

2634
02:25:26,850 --> 02:25:31,800
but let's get to this email let's start

2635
02:25:30,059 --> 02:25:33,538
off with an email from a dude who said

2636
02:25:31,799 --> 02:25:36,328
call him Roscoe he says hey dude it's

2637
02:25:33,539 --> 02:25:38,550
Roscoe I messaged you for advice which I

2638
02:25:36,328 --> 02:25:39,898
got from you from your episodes and it

2639
02:25:38,549 --> 02:25:42,028
was great stuff dude keep up the good

2640
02:25:39,898 --> 02:25:43,978
work I catch up every Monday at work on

2641
02:25:42,029 --> 02:25:46,170
your podcast and have done so for over a

2642
02:25:43,978 --> 02:25:47,519
year now when I came across it in fact

2643
02:25:46,170 --> 02:25:49,619
dude it was around that time you said

2644
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:51,560
he'd put money in a pot for your curse

2645
02:25:49,619 --> 02:25:54,239
words so you guys a long time ago I

2646
02:25:51,559 --> 02:25:56,158
didn't find it very professional to use

2647
02:25:54,238 --> 02:25:57,819
any profanity on my podcast and when I

2648
02:25:56,158 --> 02:25:59,920
would drop f-bombs in other words

2649
02:25:57,819 --> 02:26:01,329
I would try to throw I forgot how much

2650
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:02,771
money I said it would put in a jar and

2651
02:26:01,329 --> 02:26:04,000
we actually donated that to a good cause

2652
02:26:02,771 --> 02:26:05,620
but I filled up a jar with a bunch of

2653
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:07,209
money you guys and then somebody's like

2654
02:26:05,620 --> 02:26:08,681
that stupid be yourself I hate it when

2655
02:26:07,209 --> 02:26:09,729
he tried to restrain yourself and so I

2656
02:26:08,681 --> 02:26:11,530
decided you're right [ __ ] it

2657
02:26:09,729 --> 02:26:13,029
and now I say [ __ ] on the show is it's a

2658
02:26:11,530 --> 02:26:14,290
lot it's more of me honestly it's more

2659
02:26:13,030 --> 02:26:14,681
comfortable and I hate trying to censor

2660
02:26:14,290 --> 02:26:17,021
myself

2661
02:26:14,681 --> 02:26:18,880
it's how I don't know maybe it's not

2662
02:26:17,021 --> 02:26:20,829
professional but that's how I roll then

2663
02:26:18,879 --> 02:26:23,859
it's me I'd rather be me than not to

2664
02:26:20,829 --> 02:26:26,261
tell you the truth so she's continues to

2665
02:26:23,860 --> 02:26:28,150
say anyway safe to say due to your

2666
02:26:26,261 --> 02:26:30,431
podcast and the educated guess you have

2667
02:26:28,149 --> 02:26:32,770
on I have successfully grown a lot of

2668
02:26:30,431 --> 02:26:33,310
nice bushy plants awesome I'm glad to

2669
02:26:32,771 --> 02:26:35,471
hear that

2670
02:26:33,310 --> 02:26:37,690
he also says I've saved a ton of money

2671
02:26:35,470 --> 02:26:39,340
thanks to you guys thanks to you guys

2672
02:26:37,690 --> 02:26:41,110
seriously not buying from the local

2673
02:26:39,340 --> 02:26:43,630
riffraff has been a weight lifted off of

2674
02:26:41,110 --> 02:26:45,579
me anyway I've been thinking for a year

2675
02:26:43,629 --> 02:26:48,579
now about doing a podcast much similar

2676
02:26:45,579 --> 02:26:50,560
to yours bar a few things that I've

2677
02:26:48,579 --> 02:26:52,450
gotta back up that's something I don't

2678
02:26:50,560 --> 02:26:54,610
think about he says that I've saved him

2679
02:26:52,450 --> 02:26:58,181
money and a big hassle not having to buy

2680
02:26:54,610 --> 02:26:59,829
from the local riffraff I'm 6 foot 5 and

2681
02:26:58,181 --> 02:27:01,301
200 pounds and I don't worry a lot when

2682
02:26:59,829 --> 02:27:03,431
I used to have to go buy cannabis but I

2683
02:27:01,300 --> 02:27:06,039
can only imagine if I were not this

2684
02:27:03,431 --> 02:27:08,551
stature and I didn't have this type of

2685
02:27:06,040 --> 02:27:10,601
bringing where I'm from and I had to go

2686
02:27:08,550 --> 02:27:12,369
into my old neighborhood where I'm

2687
02:27:10,601 --> 02:27:13,870
actually from the go buy weed I could

2688
02:27:12,370 --> 02:27:15,130
just imagine how that would feel to be

2689
02:27:13,870 --> 02:27:16,990
some of those people in the stress that

2690
02:27:15,129 --> 02:27:18,430
that would be I'm sure people get robbed

2691
02:27:16,989 --> 02:27:20,190
and beat up and [ __ ] and get sold

2692
02:27:18,431 --> 02:27:22,780
terrible product that isn't even weed

2693
02:27:20,190 --> 02:27:24,040
that's gotta suck so I'm sure I could

2694
02:27:22,780 --> 02:27:25,480
lift a lot of weight off people's

2695
02:27:24,040 --> 02:27:27,280
shoulders if they're able to grow that

2696
02:27:25,479 --> 02:27:28,569
is I can only imagine that I didn't even

2697
02:27:27,280 --> 02:27:30,610
realize that just thinking about the

2698
02:27:28,569 --> 02:27:32,619
people you can avoid by not having to

2699
02:27:30,610 --> 02:27:34,120
buy herb that's helpful anyway he goes

2700
02:27:32,620 --> 02:27:35,771
on I'm rambling today you guys I

2701
02:27:34,120 --> 02:27:37,780
apologize I'm gonna blame it on the 200

2702
02:27:35,771 --> 02:27:39,900
milligram schumak bar that I ate and the

2703
02:27:37,780 --> 02:27:42,610
[Music]

2704
02:27:39,899 --> 02:27:47,979
pepper together oh that's a combo you

2705
02:27:42,610 --> 02:27:49,780
guys I'd be feeling it he says I've been

2706
02:27:47,979 --> 02:27:51,789
thinking for over a year now about doing

2707
02:27:49,780 --> 02:27:55,090
a podcast much similar to you similar to

2708
02:27:51,790 --> 02:27:56,740
yours bar a few things then he says I am

2709
02:27:55,090 --> 02:27:58,960
in the UK and there's not really a

2710
02:27:56,739 --> 02:28:00,789
podcast out here for the UK people and

2711
02:27:58,959 --> 02:28:03,520
you have inspired me to want to be that

2712
02:28:00,790 --> 02:28:05,410
podcast the law is changing slowly here

2713
02:28:03,521 --> 02:28:07,811
the NHS are testing it for the first

2714
02:28:05,409 --> 02:28:09,578
time now and all the MPs want to advise

2715
02:28:07,810 --> 02:28:13,208
our new prime minister miss

2716
02:28:09,578 --> 02:28:13,809
me to legalize cannabis oh that's

2717
02:28:13,209 --> 02:28:15,759
awesome

2718
02:28:13,809 --> 02:28:18,248
there's a lot of amazing stuff in that

2719
02:28:15,759 --> 02:28:20,439
one paragraph I have inspired somebody

2720
02:28:18,248 --> 02:28:23,588
to want to create a podcast for their

2721
02:28:20,439 --> 02:28:25,869
further the UK for the entire UK about

2722
02:28:23,588 --> 02:28:28,238
cannabis because there isn't one that's

2723
02:28:25,869 --> 02:28:29,770
awesome I am that I'm honored that I

2724
02:28:28,238 --> 02:28:31,020
inspired somebody to do that also I'm

2725
02:28:29,770 --> 02:28:33,310
glad that I inspired you to do that

2726
02:28:31,020 --> 02:28:35,770
that's gonna lead me to part of my reply

2727
02:28:33,309 --> 02:28:37,478
to your email it's also great that the

2728
02:28:35,770 --> 02:28:39,039
law is slowly changing there I know some

2729
02:28:37,478 --> 02:28:40,478
areas in the UK have really straight

2730
02:28:39,039 --> 02:28:42,429
shitty cannabis laws I'm glad that

2731
02:28:40,478 --> 02:28:45,788
they're easing up on that I love that

2732
02:28:42,429 --> 02:28:48,309
the MPs want to advise the minister that

2733
02:28:45,789 --> 02:28:50,109
they want them to legalize cannabis when

2734
02:28:48,309 --> 02:28:51,548
I'm pretty sure that's the military

2735
02:28:50,109 --> 02:28:53,229
police I'm not sure exactly I didn't

2736
02:28:51,549 --> 02:28:55,299
research that but whoever when other

2737
02:28:53,228 --> 02:28:58,478
when other people are like hey do this

2738
02:28:55,299 --> 02:29:00,369
that's really helpful I want to educate

2739
02:28:58,478 --> 02:29:02,679
people and teach them how to grow small

2740
02:29:00,369 --> 02:29:04,748
secret setups and have fun doing it UK

2741
02:29:02,679 --> 02:29:07,179
cannabis news culture education chats

2742
02:29:04,748 --> 02:29:09,638
and more if not illegal to encourage on

2743
02:29:07,179 --> 02:29:11,349
a podcast you know I don't think it's

2744
02:29:09,638 --> 02:29:13,328
illegal to encourage on a podcast but

2745
02:29:11,349 --> 02:29:14,770
where you are you may want to talk to a

2746
02:29:13,328 --> 02:29:15,968
lawyer because I don't know the rules in

2747
02:29:14,770 --> 02:29:17,439
the UK that could be completely

2748
02:29:15,968 --> 02:29:19,748
different I've been told that I'm safe

2749
02:29:17,439 --> 02:29:24,398
as long as I'm careful and we try to be

2750
02:29:19,748 --> 02:29:26,078
careful here on the show but you go on

2751
02:29:24,398 --> 02:29:29,198
to see could you give me any advice on

2752
02:29:26,078 --> 02:29:31,509
doing this any tips tricks et cetera to

2753
02:29:29,199 --> 02:29:34,149
a successful successful podcast and he

2754
02:29:31,509 --> 02:29:35,709
said thanks dude much love Roscoe they

2755
02:29:34,148 --> 02:29:37,179
also said PS don't mind if you read it

2756
02:29:35,709 --> 02:29:38,849
on your podcast which is good because I

2757
02:29:37,179 --> 02:29:41,619
just read the whole email on the podcast

2758
02:29:38,849 --> 02:29:44,078
first off thank you for the email second

2759
02:29:41,619 --> 02:29:46,088
I'm glad that I can inspire you to do a

2760
02:29:44,078 --> 02:29:47,859
podcast about cannabis third thanks for

2761
02:29:46,088 --> 02:29:49,179
being so passionate about cannabis

2762
02:29:47,859 --> 02:29:50,498
because it sounds like it's illegal

2763
02:29:49,179 --> 02:29:51,699
there and you're risking your life and

2764
02:29:50,498 --> 02:29:53,199
your safety and your family and your

2765
02:29:51,699 --> 02:29:54,908
freedom and your finances in your future

2766
02:29:53,199 --> 02:29:57,158
for this planet because you're in love

2767
02:29:54,908 --> 02:29:59,288
so thanks for being on this team and

2768
02:29:57,158 --> 02:30:01,718
that leads me to my answer my part of my

2769
02:29:59,289 --> 02:30:04,389
reply I know that you're the right

2770
02:30:01,718 --> 02:30:06,398
person to do this podcast because you

2771
02:30:04,388 --> 02:30:08,468
have taken the effort to reach out to me

2772
02:30:06,398 --> 02:30:10,448
to say what should I do

2773
02:30:08,468 --> 02:30:11,648
so that tells me right there you are

2774
02:30:10,449 --> 02:30:13,629
supposed to be the guy doing this

2775
02:30:11,648 --> 02:30:15,590
podcast be the confident dude that you

2776
02:30:13,629 --> 02:30:18,079
are

2777
02:30:15,591 --> 02:30:19,399
when you go to make your podcast talk to

2778
02:30:18,079 --> 02:30:20,780
the people just like you did to me in

2779
02:30:19,399 --> 02:30:21,710
this email because this is comfortable

2780
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:23,690
and it sounds like you're a cool person

2781
02:30:21,710 --> 02:30:25,520
and it sounds like you can connect with

2782
02:30:23,690 --> 02:30:28,101
people so do that on your podcast just

2783
02:30:25,521 --> 02:30:30,051
be yourself that's the best advice I can

2784
02:30:28,101 --> 02:30:33,079
give to any person trying to do any

2785
02:30:30,050 --> 02:30:34,640
podcast be you if you're fake your

2786
02:30:33,079 --> 02:30:36,200
listeners won't know it you won't have

2787
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:38,390
any fun it won't feel good and you'll

2788
02:30:36,200 --> 02:30:40,251
come across a fake and people can spot

2789
02:30:38,390 --> 02:30:41,630
fake and they won't listen to fake and

2790
02:30:40,251 --> 02:30:43,521
you'll get more shitty emails than you

2791
02:30:41,630 --> 02:30:47,210
could ever imagine so chill out be

2792
02:30:43,521 --> 02:30:49,489
yourself edit a little bit but don't

2793
02:30:47,210 --> 02:30:51,649
take out all of your mistakes I I

2794
02:30:49,489 --> 02:30:53,449
stutter I say dumb [ __ ] I say the wrong

2795
02:30:51,649 --> 02:30:55,550
[ __ ] and I talk over myself all the time

2796
02:30:53,450 --> 02:30:57,381
but that's me and I've learned to accept

2797
02:30:55,550 --> 02:30:58,970
me and it makes a good podcast just

2798
02:30:57,380 --> 02:31:00,739
being me people don't want me to be

2799
02:30:58,970 --> 02:31:02,449
appalling I'm not the president I don't

2800
02:31:00,739 --> 02:31:04,101
need to come out you out here up here

2801
02:31:02,450 --> 02:31:05,631
and speak some perfect [ __ ] to you

2802
02:31:04,101 --> 02:31:08,181
did you have to grow weed so be yourself

2803
02:31:05,630 --> 02:31:10,340
be comfortable get some good equipment

2804
02:31:08,181 --> 02:31:12,319
that's something I really should say you

2805
02:31:10,341 --> 02:31:14,751
don't need to spend a lot of money my

2806
02:31:12,319 --> 02:31:18,251
favorite set up is the zoom h6 on-the-go

2807
02:31:14,751 --> 02:31:21,649
I use a zoom h6 and I run for Sennheiser

2808
02:31:18,251 --> 02:31:23,030
835 835 microphones into that I'm not

2809
02:31:21,649 --> 02:31:25,040
sure what's available in the UK you

2810
02:31:23,030 --> 02:31:27,681
could probably get that or very similar

2811
02:31:25,040 --> 02:31:30,409
it's a great recording device a lot of

2812
02:31:27,681 --> 02:31:32,480
people use that for my big setup there's

2813
02:31:30,409 --> 02:31:34,610
a lot of stuff happening but sound

2814
02:31:32,479 --> 02:31:36,591
quality is certainly important people if

2815
02:31:34,610 --> 02:31:38,751
when people do phone calls on a podcast

2816
02:31:36,591 --> 02:31:42,079
or if they Skype in I don't even listen

2817
02:31:38,751 --> 02:31:45,079
so get good quality so I'd really stress

2818
02:31:42,079 --> 02:31:46,489
on good quality sound good sound the

2819
02:31:45,079 --> 02:31:48,171
best you can make sure that there's no

2820
02:31:46,489 --> 02:31:49,399
funky noise in the background or if

2821
02:31:48,171 --> 02:31:51,171
you're gonna do in a coffee shop and you

2822
02:31:49,399 --> 02:31:53,210
want that clunky like dishes and

2823
02:31:51,171 --> 02:31:54,319
waitress sound vibe kind of thing go for

2824
02:31:53,210 --> 02:31:56,239
that if that's your vibe I don't like

2825
02:31:54,319 --> 02:31:57,591
that I like it quiet I talk when I don't

2826
02:31:56,239 --> 02:31:59,720
talk there's no noise in my background I

2827
02:31:57,591 --> 02:32:00,950
love that sort of feel so sound how you

2828
02:31:59,720 --> 02:32:02,630
want to sound to achieve your sound

2829
02:32:00,950 --> 02:32:06,110
figure out how you got to do that be

2830
02:32:02,630 --> 02:32:08,090
yourself and then find content that

2831
02:32:06,110 --> 02:32:10,489
relates to the audience you want to hit

2832
02:32:08,091 --> 02:32:12,800
which is obviously cannabis and news and

2833
02:32:10,489 --> 02:32:14,751
culture and education and chats so find

2834
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:15,979
some people in your community that you

2835
02:32:14,751 --> 02:32:17,690
can get on a show and build a

2836
02:32:15,979 --> 02:32:20,239
relationship with what I found is the

2837
02:32:17,690 --> 02:32:21,560
people that come back to my show the

2838
02:32:20,239 --> 02:32:23,390
third and fourth time they come back

2839
02:32:21,560 --> 02:32:25,159
they forget they're on a podcast and

2840
02:32:23,390 --> 02:32:26,540
they're now hanging out in my little

2841
02:32:25,159 --> 02:32:28,040
recording space and we just happen to

2842
02:32:26,540 --> 02:32:29,389
have headphones and a microphone on and

2843
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:31,369
we really get talking

2844
02:32:29,389 --> 02:32:33,559
about cannabis in a way that we love

2845
02:32:31,370 --> 02:32:35,300
instead of a way that feels podcast II

2846
02:32:33,559 --> 02:32:37,100
and interviewee like you guys notice

2847
02:32:35,299 --> 02:32:38,238
when Jesse comes back the first time

2848
02:32:37,100 --> 02:32:40,399
jesse was here you guys a hundred

2849
02:32:38,238 --> 02:32:43,969
episodes Jesse talked like this like

2850
02:32:40,398 --> 02:32:45,170
said like four words like okay yeah and

2851
02:32:43,969 --> 02:32:47,840
now when Jesse comes on you can't get

2852
02:32:45,170 --> 02:32:49,158
him to shut up you guys so just kind of

2853
02:32:47,840 --> 02:32:50,930
build a relationship with somebody that

2854
02:32:49,158 --> 02:32:52,818
you can get on the podcast try to find

2855
02:32:50,930 --> 02:32:55,340
people that are experts in certain areas

2856
02:32:52,818 --> 02:32:58,728
of cannabis like I've got a guy Jesse's

2857
02:32:55,340 --> 02:33:00,020
my outdoor guy of course Sean is kind of

2858
02:32:58,728 --> 02:33:02,929
the organics guy even though he's hard

2859
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:04,550
to get ahold of lately was our extracts

2860
02:33:02,930 --> 02:33:06,020
guy even though he's moved so try to

2861
02:33:04,549 --> 02:33:07,579
have guys that you can have like special

2862
02:33:06,020 --> 02:33:09,380
like you got guys for everything in your

2863
02:33:07,579 --> 02:33:12,680
life you got a you know weed guy you

2864
02:33:09,379 --> 02:33:14,750
know you got a fireworks guy those guys

2865
02:33:12,680 --> 02:33:17,960
for your podcast also so that's

2866
02:33:14,750 --> 02:33:19,129
something I could recommend here's

2867
02:33:17,959 --> 02:33:20,719
something that I could talk about from

2868
02:33:19,129 --> 02:33:23,839
being a podcast nerd if you want to be

2869
02:33:20,719 --> 02:33:26,000
noticed in iTunes get at least 8 or 10

2870
02:33:23,840 --> 02:33:28,639
episodes put together before you launch

2871
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,500
into iTunes because your first eight

2872
02:33:28,639 --> 02:33:32,750
weeks in iTunes is when they will notice

2873
02:33:30,500 --> 02:33:34,699
you and that's if you get good ratings

2874
02:33:32,750 --> 02:33:36,680
and you pop out with a lot of quality

2875
02:33:34,699 --> 02:33:38,479
content iTunes will put you in the new

man first off thanks for listening

2944
02:35:46,979 --> 02:35:50,550
second I guess I'm glad to beat that

2945
02:35:49,111 --> 02:35:52,591
voice for the community I guess I'm just

2946
02:35:50,550 --> 02:35:55,800
the guy that grabbed a mic and wanted to

2947
02:35:52,591 --> 02:35:58,261
do that I never thought of that put too

2948
02:35:55,800 --> 02:35:59,640
much pressure on me anyway he says my

2949
02:35:58,261 --> 02:36:01,921
question I hope you can give your

2950
02:35:59,640 --> 02:36:03,421
thoughts on is a term known as bud

2951
02:36:01,921 --> 02:36:05,399
washing I had a good friend telling me

2952
02:36:03,421 --> 02:36:07,320
to try it in case you're unfamiliar with

2953
02:36:05,399 --> 02:36:09,030
the term it's where you take your just

2954
02:36:07,320 --> 02:36:11,521
harvested butts that are still on the

2955
02:36:09,031 --> 02:36:14,341
branches and you dip or wash them in

2956
02:36:11,521 --> 02:36:16,261
water I read it's supposed to get dust

2957
02:36:14,341 --> 02:36:19,140
particles off of your herb and make it

2958
02:36:16,261 --> 02:36:20,851
cleaner tastier smoke then he also says

2959
02:36:19,140 --> 02:36:22,440
thanks for turning me on to richie spice

2960
02:36:20,851 --> 02:36:24,570
I heard you mentioning him on a previous

2961
02:36:22,440 --> 02:36:26,190
episode so I searched him out and then

2962
02:36:24,570 --> 02:36:27,661
he quotes some Richie spice oh man

2963
02:36:26,190 --> 02:36:29,190
you're glad all right you're welcome I'm

2964
02:36:27,661 --> 02:36:30,720
glad you like Richie spice oh you guys

2965
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:33,181
I'm a hyah [ __ ] tonight this Shumate bar

2966
02:36:30,720 --> 02:36:37,140
is kicking in I ate this an hour and a

2967
02:36:33,181 --> 02:36:39,149
half I should go and my 200 milligrams

2968
02:36:37,140 --> 02:36:41,251
distillate will get to you plus I've had

2969
02:36:39,149 --> 02:36:43,831
a few dabs so kind of floating around I

2970
02:36:41,251 --> 02:36:45,361
like it I love it try out so I'm gonna

2971
02:36:43,831 --> 02:36:47,611
kind of talk about what he asked here he

2972
02:36:45,361 --> 02:36:49,831
said is bud washing a term that I am

2973
02:36:47,611 --> 02:36:52,141
familiar with yes I live in this from

2974
02:36:49,831 --> 02:36:54,031
Jorge Cervantes Jorge didn't do it with

2975
02:36:52,140 --> 02:36:54,489
just water Jorge took a five-gallon

2976
02:36:54,031 --> 02:36:57,880
bucket

2977
02:36:54,489 --> 02:36:59,470
of he used reverse osmosis water you can

2978
02:36:57,879 --> 02:37:01,060
use water from the hose if your water is

2979
02:36:59,470 --> 02:37:03,189
okay if you don't have funky ass water

2980
02:37:01,060 --> 02:37:05,319
you can use water from your hose to fill

2981
02:37:03,190 --> 02:37:08,021
up a 5-gallon bucket of water and then

2982
02:37:05,319 --> 02:37:10,989
Jorge was putting 25 I've seen people

2983
02:37:08,021 --> 02:37:12,610
put more you guys but 25 is probably

2984
02:37:10,989 --> 02:37:16,199
what I would recommend 25 or 30

2985
02:37:12,610 --> 02:37:19,480
milliliters of 30% hydrogen peroxide

2986
02:37:16,200 --> 02:37:21,130
into a five-gallon bucket of water not

2987
02:37:19,479 --> 02:37:23,109
the hydrogen peroxide that your mom's

2988
02:37:21,129 --> 02:37:25,180
got in the cabinet the stuff that you

2989
02:37:23,110 --> 02:37:28,721
buy you get it at the Hydra store

2990
02:37:25,181 --> 02:37:32,460
probably and get it online but it's 30%

2991
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:35,529
maybe 33 maybe 35% hydrogen peroxide

2992
02:37:32,459 --> 02:37:37,720
it's not expensive but you put about 30

2993
02:37:35,530 --> 02:37:39,880
milliliters of that 2530 mils in a

2994
02:37:37,720 --> 02:37:42,100
five-gallon bucket stir it up real good

2995
02:37:39,879 --> 02:37:44,140
and then you harvest the branches and

2996
02:37:42,101 --> 02:37:45,641
you leave is like kind of long branches

2997
02:37:44,140 --> 02:37:48,940
you know six to eight inch long branches

2998
02:37:45,640 --> 02:37:51,609
and wear rubber gloves and dunk the

2999
02:37:48,940 --> 02:37:53,110
entire branch into the water and give it

3000
02:37:51,610 --> 02:37:55,090
a swirl like freshly chopped you want to

3001
02:37:53,110 --> 02:37:57,310
chop the plants down cut off all the big

3002
02:37:55,090 --> 02:37:58,720
leaves trim it up like you're gonna trim

3003
02:37:57,310 --> 02:38:00,399
it up again later like you're just

3004
02:37:58,720 --> 02:38:02,049
cleaning it up you're not manicuring it

3005
02:38:00,399 --> 02:38:04,899
you're just kind of trimming it I've

3006
02:38:02,049 --> 02:38:06,579
been dunk that into the water solution

3007
02:38:04,899 --> 02:38:08,619
the peroxide water solution give it a

3008
02:38:06,579 --> 02:38:10,870
good swirl so that if there is perhaps

3009
02:38:08,620 --> 02:38:12,820
powdery mildew on there you can knock

3010
02:38:10,870 --> 02:38:14,829
that powdery mildew off that is a really

3011
02:38:12,819 --> 02:38:17,170
good way to get powdery mildew if you

3012
02:38:14,829 --> 02:38:18,700
don't have the PM on there I guess that

3013
02:38:17,170 --> 02:38:20,739
would knock dust off if you drew it

3014
02:38:18,700 --> 02:38:22,240
outside and it got dusty and [ __ ] but I

3015
02:38:20,739 --> 02:38:23,500
don't see how much it dust is really

3016
02:38:22,239 --> 02:38:25,810
gonna be on your plants if you drew

3017
02:38:23,500 --> 02:38:27,970
indoors in a good grow environment but

3018
02:38:25,810 --> 02:38:29,440
I've heard of this being done by Jorge

3019
02:38:27,970 --> 02:38:32,289
Cervantes and I've seen it done by other

3020
02:38:29,440 --> 02:38:34,090
people for powdery mildew and other

3021
02:38:32,290 --> 02:38:37,510
problems like that to clean that stuff

3022
02:38:34,090 --> 02:38:39,819
off so brought a little bit of proxy 25

3023
02:38:37,510 --> 02:38:41,739
to 30 mils and a five-gallon bucket to

3024
02:38:39,819 --> 02:38:43,149
clean water cut the branches into six or

3025
02:38:41,739 --> 02:38:44,590
eight inch maybe 10 inch sections it's

3026
02:38:43,149 --> 02:38:46,000
got to fit in that five-gallon bucket

3027
02:38:44,590 --> 02:38:48,640
dunk it in there give it a good shake

3028
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:49,659
then hang it up give the buds plenty of

3029
02:38:48,640 --> 02:38:51,129
space when they're hung up when they're

3030
02:38:49,659 --> 02:38:52,959
that way and they're just gonna drip

3031
02:38:51,129 --> 02:38:55,629
onto the floor you guys all that water

3032
02:38:52,959 --> 02:38:57,399
is gonna drip all over the floor which

3033
02:38:55,629 --> 02:38:59,049
is gonna run right out and then it'll

3034
02:38:57,399 --> 02:39:00,879
dry keep a fan in the room maybe a

3035
02:38:59,049 --> 02:39:02,829
dehumidifier out there pay attention to

3036
02:39:00,879 --> 02:39:04,089
the conditions in your drying area but

3037
02:39:02,829 --> 02:39:04,970
if you're gonna do this you got to pay

3038
02:39:04,090 --> 02:39:06,860
attention

3039
02:39:04,970 --> 02:39:08,331
I don't let it get to you - you made in

3040
02:39:06,860 --> 02:39:10,341
there a lot of people are gonna say

3041
02:39:08,331 --> 02:39:12,140
you're gonna soak buds that were just

3042
02:39:10,341 --> 02:39:14,181
harvested you guys if you think about it

3043
02:39:12,140 --> 02:39:15,681
cannabis plants grow outside and if it

3044
02:39:14,181 --> 02:39:18,081
weren't for us getting in the way they

3045
02:39:15,681 --> 02:39:19,551
would get wet all the damn time I don't

3046
02:39:18,081 --> 02:39:21,411
think that every cannabis plant that

3047
02:39:19,550 --> 02:39:22,489
ever got wet outside got destroyed I'm

3048
02:39:21,411 --> 02:39:25,069
pretty sure that a lot of them got

3049
02:39:22,489 --> 02:39:26,630
stronger and they got tougher if you

3050
02:39:25,069 --> 02:39:29,091
look at the shape of a cannabis plant it

3051
02:39:26,630 --> 02:39:31,550
is kind of shaped like an umbrella when

3052
02:39:29,091 --> 02:39:34,550
water hits a cannabis plant the leaves

3053
02:39:31,550 --> 02:39:36,380
push the water in an outward direction

3054
02:39:34,550 --> 02:39:38,751
and it spreads it out so that it falls

3055
02:39:36,380 --> 02:39:40,430
down that tells me that you should water

3056
02:39:38,751 --> 02:39:41,479
the plants around that area because

3057
02:39:40,431 --> 02:39:43,310
that's where the roots are gonna grow

3058
02:39:41,479 --> 02:39:44,540
out because in nature that's where the

3059
02:39:43,310 --> 02:39:45,649
water is gonna land of course you want

3060
02:39:44,540 --> 02:39:47,120
to get it in toward the stock but the

3061
02:39:45,649 --> 02:39:48,739
outward area is a little bit more--

3062
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:50,300
where you want it because nature would

3063
02:39:48,739 --> 02:39:51,831
spread it out so cannabis is gonna

3064
02:39:50,300 --> 02:39:54,950
search for roots out that way because it

3065
02:39:51,831 --> 02:39:56,511
knows that you guys also the resin

3066
02:39:54,950 --> 02:39:57,800
glands on your plant will protect it

3067
02:39:56,511 --> 02:40:00,110
from the water you're not gonna bust

3068
02:39:57,800 --> 02:40:01,341
that off by just giving it a little dunk

3069
02:40:00,110 --> 02:40:03,860
it's not gonna come off there these guys

3070
02:40:01,341 --> 02:40:05,871
that make ash they're using a washing

3071
02:40:03,860 --> 02:40:07,641
machine and ice to pull those trichomes

3072
02:40:05,870 --> 02:40:09,920
off of your buds so a little bit of a

3073
02:40:07,640 --> 02:40:10,970
dunk isn't gonna gonna pull those off of

3074
02:40:09,921 --> 02:40:13,041
there if you've already got a little bit

3075
02:40:10,970 --> 02:40:14,689
of PM or if you had an issue this is a

3076
02:40:13,040 --> 02:40:16,161
good way to get rid of it it's funny

3077
02:40:14,690 --> 02:40:17,989
because in Colorado I make the joke that

3078
02:40:16,161 --> 02:40:20,239
nobody gets powdery mildew anymore ever

3079
02:40:17,989 --> 02:40:22,310
ever since anybody infinite or figured

3080
02:40:20,239 --> 02:40:23,780
out how to make BHO everybody just

3081
02:40:22,310 --> 02:40:26,270
[ __ ] blast it even though it's got

3082
02:40:23,780 --> 02:40:28,251
powdery mildew on it but I wouldn't

3083
02:40:26,271 --> 02:40:30,351
recommend using a hole if it's got a lot

3084
02:40:28,251 --> 02:40:31,581
of powdery mildew don't don't use it get

3085
02:40:30,351 --> 02:40:32,931
rid of that product get rid of that

3086
02:40:31,581 --> 02:40:34,431
material but if you've just got a little

3087
02:40:32,931 --> 02:40:35,989
bit of a problem like people in Oregon

3088
02:40:34,431 --> 02:40:37,610
this year got pummeled with powdery

3089
02:40:35,989 --> 02:40:39,050
mildew and other molds is will not

3090
02:40:37,610 --> 02:40:40,521
handle your Brown mold this will not

3091
02:40:39,050 --> 02:40:42,411
handle [ __ ] like that but a little bit

3092
02:40:40,521 --> 02:40:44,331
of powdery mildew this peroxide solution

3093
02:40:42,411 --> 02:40:45,530
will get rid of it yes you can't do it

3094
02:40:44,331 --> 02:40:47,989
if you want to get the dust and the dirt

3095
02:40:45,530 --> 02:40:51,230
off if you drew outside a lot of people

3096
02:40:47,989 --> 02:40:53,239
find like cocoons or caterpillars silk

3097
02:40:51,229 --> 02:40:54,591
on their buds that would be a good way

3098
02:40:53,239 --> 02:40:55,911
to get rid of that stuff just give it a

3099
02:40:54,591 --> 02:40:57,171
good dunk that way you know it's clean

3100
02:40:55,911 --> 02:40:58,851
just make sure you getting plenty of

3101
02:40:57,171 --> 02:41:00,831
ventilation plenty airflow when it dries

3102
02:40:58,851 --> 02:41:03,021
it's gonna dry up like normal just gonna

3103
02:41:00,831 --> 02:41:04,610
take a little bit longer you won't

3104
02:41:03,021 --> 02:41:06,351
notice a difference I'm pretty sure you

3105
02:41:04,610 --> 02:41:07,940
can take a bud that did not get dunked

3106
02:41:06,351 --> 02:41:09,951
in a bud that did get dunked and dried

3107
02:41:07,940 --> 02:41:11,931
properly and trimmed and cured properly

3108
02:41:09,950 --> 02:41:14,359
and you can smoke them both and you will

3109
02:41:11,931 --> 02:41:16,011
not be able to tell the difference

3110
02:41:14,360 --> 02:41:17,690
that's my opinion on that so yes I've

3111
02:41:16,011 --> 02:41:19,640
heard of this I've seen it in practice I

3112
02:41:17,690 --> 02:41:20,721
don't know that I have personally tried

3113
02:41:19,640 --> 02:41:22,640
it but I've seen it done I've been

3114
02:41:20,720 --> 02:41:24,680
places that have done it it's kind of a

3115
02:41:22,640 --> 02:41:25,970
semi common practice in commercial grows

3116
02:41:24,681 --> 02:41:28,431
to tell you the truth because it is

3117
02:41:25,970 --> 02:41:31,460
legal in Colorado to do that to Budds

3118
02:41:28,431 --> 02:41:33,381
drone any commercial facility all right

3119
02:41:31,460 --> 02:41:34,430
I think that's all I've got time for I

3120
02:41:33,380 --> 02:41:35,661
don't want to start another email

3121
02:41:34,431 --> 02:41:37,310
because I've been going for close to 30

3122
02:41:35,661 --> 02:41:38,781
minutes and it's hard to do a long

3123
02:41:37,310 --> 02:41:40,911
episode by myself I feel like I just

3124
02:41:38,781 --> 02:41:44,181
start chattering get way off course so

3125
02:41:40,911 --> 02:41:47,181

3126

02:41:52,370 --> 02:41:56,540
have a donation button that is gone what

3132
02:41:54,351 --> 02:41:59,271
happened to that PayPal did not like

3133
02:41:56,540 --> 02:42:02,420
having their service attached to my

3134
02:41:59,271 --> 02:42:04,131
website that was about a podcast it was

3135
02:42:02,421 --> 02:42:05,451
about growing cannabis they felt like

3136
02:42:04,130 --> 02:42:06,831
that was inappropriate and they didn't

3137
02:42:05,450 --> 02:42:09,500
want to be involved so they made me take

3138
02:42:06,831 --> 02:42:11,060
the PayPal link off of my website so

3139

for my website

3156
02:42:42,771 --> 02:42:46,431
I read genetics Colorado com it does

3157
02:42:45,171 --> 02:42:48,591
cost me a little bit of money to keep

3158
02:42:46,431 --> 02:42:50,390
that running on a yearly basis I have to

3159
02:42:48,591 --> 02:42:53,990
pay that fee and that's what keeps the

3160
02:42:50,390 --> 02:42:55,310
roughly our podcast feed alive so that's

3161
02:42:53,990 --> 02:42:56,781
all I'm asking for I'm not trying to get

3162
02:42:55,310 --> 02:42:59,300
rich off the podcast I'm just trying to

3163
02:42:56,781 --> 02:43:00,501
offset the cost of my web fees I've

3164
02:42:59,300 --> 02:43:02,689
already bought the equipment sometimes

3165
02:43:00,501 --> 02:43:04,791
[ __ ] breaks so maybe I'll ask on patreon

3166
02:43:02,690 --> 02:43:06,081
for help with that but so far I'm just

3167
02:43:04,790 --> 02:43:08,060
trying to pay for the cost of the

3168
02:43:06,081 --> 02:43:09,951
website I would appreciate if you

3169
02:43:08,060 --> 02:43:12,140
