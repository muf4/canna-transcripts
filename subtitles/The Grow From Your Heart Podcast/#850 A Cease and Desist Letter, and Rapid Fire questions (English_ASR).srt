while you're checking my websites is

30
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,959
that there has been a change to a

31
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:34,919
popular strain name that's right the

32
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,719
strain that was named after the little

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,439
square chewy candy we can no longer use

34
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:41,039
that name that was being used I don't

35
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,078
think I can even say it right here right

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,920
now on the podcast without causing

37
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:46,679
myself some trouble because we got a

38
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,519
little letter more than a little letter

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,280
we got an important letter uh we got an

40
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:53,560
email that says we must cease and assist

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
from using um so I can say this in this

42
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,680
phrase I think without getting in any

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,439
trouble uh from now on we must cease and

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
assist from using anything with the word

45
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:03,679
star burst in it we can no longer use

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,359
the word Starburst in any branding or

47
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,920
advertising I've got a very official

48
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,840
letter here from the great Folks at Mars

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,920
Wrigley uh the part that I will share

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,519
with you says to protect Mars Wrigley's

51
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:17,000
valuable intellectual property and the

52
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,039
consuming public Mars Rigley must ensure

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,199
that its trademark are not misused by

54
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:22,479
Third parties well guess who I am I'm a

55
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:25,039
third party I was using the word

56
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,759
Starburst in branding they said no don't

57
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,318
do that they said if you do that more

58
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,639
it's going to cost you a lot of

59
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:30,919
money guess what I don't want to do I

60
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,799
don't want to give them a lot of

61
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:34,759
money so we're going to stop using that

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,360
that strain has been changed uh that

63
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:37,878
strain's actually been discontinued I

64
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,879
don't make it anymore it hasn't been for

65
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:41,840
sale for a while all of the seeds are

66
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:43,120
gone so it's gone now it's not part of

67
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,080
the production it's not part of the

68
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,000
catalog any further that problem has

69
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,800
been solved but they were very clear

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,598
about the names that we can and cannot

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,879
use uh anything with Skittles Starburst

72
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,439
Eminem Snickers Twix Lifesavers Hub

73
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:58,759
Bubba Milky Way Three Musketeers there

74
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:00,359
are a long list of names that cannot be

75
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:03,120
used and then they go on and another

76
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,560
page to make it clear that any form of

77
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,799
Skittles or Starburst cannot be used in

78
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,799
any association with any other brands

79
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:11,400
they've spelled it about 45 different

80
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:13,599
ways in this paper just to let us know

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,280
they're not around so if you do

82
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,919
go to any of my websites and you see

83
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,039
that that strain that was once named

84
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:21,119
after that little tiny pink delicious

85
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:22,959
chewy candy uh that strain name has

86
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,439
changed it's because I got the

87
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,878
oldfashioned ceas and desist letter so I

88
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,560
had to change that name I'm not up to

89
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:30,798
anything fishy I'm not trying to pull a

90
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,560
faster one on you guys uh it was a legal

91
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,400
matter and I had to take action quite

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,878
quickly um I had to respond to them uh

93
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,599
and let them know that I was going to

94
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:41,120
change it and how I was going to correct

95
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:42,598
this so I responded to them uh so far I

96
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,640
think we're in the clear all as well

97
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:46,798
this was just a hey stop before

98
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:48,719
we get you letter so at this point uh

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,760
has stopped hopefully they don't

100
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,878

of the day the vibe of the crowd um so

130

the restock at iir now I think it is

216
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,319
time to introduce a new part of the

217
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:38,120
podcast that I'm not sure if I am

218
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,680
excited or nervous about but we're going

219
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,439
to learn together here um I get a lot of

220
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,720
emails I get a lot of questions on the

221
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:46,158
podcast and I do promise that if I read

222
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,800
your question here on the show that I

223
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:50,079
will give you a coupon code for a free

224
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,240
pack of seeds at I redirect that has

225
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,240
resulted in mountains of printed emails

226
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,800
I've got stacks of paper in different

227
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,879
categories they're all piled up all over

228
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,478
this table over here right off camera uh

229
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,879
it looks like a looks like a paper

230
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,240
portraits I'm exaggerating but I've got

231
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,280
an idea uh many people have told me that

232
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,680
I talk too damn much and guess what

233
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:09,439
you're right I talk too damn much but

234
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,400
that's why I've got a podcast what I'm

235
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,240
going to do is I'm going to try to

236
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:15,198
minimize the amount of rambling and

237
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,319
chatter uh on these answers and

238
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,919
questions and I'm going to read a

239
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,879
question and I'm going to try to just

240
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,079
bang out as many questions as I can in

241
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,280
the next few minutes and not give those

242
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,079
long ridiculous long winded repetitive

243
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,638
answers I like to give we're going to

244
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,918
try to do a rapid fire question and

245
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,320
answer podcast episode it's not going to

246
00:08:30,918 --> 00:08:34,639
get rapid fire until we start shooting

247
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,240
so we're going to look at the time we're

248
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,360
at that time I know how much more time I

249
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,440
want to continue the show and from now

250
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,519
here we go Rapidfire podcast questions

251
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,120
these questions did come from my website

252
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:47,200
iry genetics.com that's right iy

253
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,320
genetics.com there's a row of tabs one

254
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,080
of those tabs says grow help or grow

255
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,879
questions if you click on that tab you

256
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,320
are given the opportunity to send me a

257
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:56,879
grow question if you send me a good grow

258
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,760
question and I do read that question

259
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:00,679
here on the podcast even if it's a rapid

260
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:02,319
fire quickie I will send you a coupon

261
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:05,639
code for a free pack of seeds from

262
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,000
idirect decom today's first quickie came

263
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:09,360
from somebody who's going to be called

264
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,958
Candyland stash I like the name the

265
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,039
question quickly says hey rosta Jeff hey

266
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,479
Candyland says I've been growing about

267
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:17,278
three years now all right that's a good

268
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,519
amount of time I have six strains all

269
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,399
right uh three years six strains I don't

270
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,879
want to lose these strains but I'm also

271
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:25,320
getting kind of bored and I'm ready for

272
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:27,439
a reset all right that's understandable

273
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,959
a few are Elite clones and a few are

274
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,360
seeds I personally popped I'm debating

275
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,399
on breeding on a breeding project to

276
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,919
preserve the genetics and even make my

277
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,159
own strain I'm torn between attempting

278
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,360
to feminize one of my six and

279
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:43,319
pollinating the room and popping a pack

280
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,720
of RS to search for a male I'm just

281
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,600
looking for some experience and some

282
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,600
some experience guid guidance on this

283
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,000
one so you've already got plenty of

284
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,480
plants and you're thinking about popping

285
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,480
another pack to find a male I wouldn't

286
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,360
do that that's a whole new feno hunt

287
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,240
that's a whole new project that could

288
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,120
Inspire some some more inspiration and

289
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,799
give you more passion of growing but I

290
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,679
wouldn't add more to this what I would

291
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:05,319
do and you're asking for my experience

292
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,639
If This Were my room I were bored with

293
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,680
these plants but I had a couple that I

294
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,240
want to preserve what I would do is I

295
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,359
would clone my favorite plant I would

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
take two clones of the favorite plant

297
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,120
then I would take all the other plants

298
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,199
and put them in the room I would reverse

299
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,159
one clone of the favorite and then I

300
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,399
would pollinate everything with that

301
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:22,799
reversal now you've basically got that

302
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:24,919
your favorite you've got that in

303
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,799
preservation you've got the S1 of that

304
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:29,039
now you've made r1's of everything else

305
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,799
and you're going to find those plants in

306
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,480
their somewhere eventually you can bring

307
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,039
that out by searching through that

308
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,000
population so you've basically got

309
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:38,039
everything kind of preserved all the

310
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,278
others are adulterated but you've got

311
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,159
something close to it and it's cross to

312
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:45,480
your favorite plant so you've

313
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,199
potentially just made uh six batches of

314
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,519
feminized seeds if you take your F you

315
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,160
said you've got six right six strains so

316
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,039
what you've got is the opportunity to

317
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:56,078
make six different feminized crosses uh

318
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:57,519
you can take your favorite plant uh take

319
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,399
two cuts of that one's going to become

320
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,159
the pollen donor will one will become

321
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,799
the receiver then the other five

322
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:04,559
favorites of your plants pollinate them

323
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,519
make seeds out of them now you've got

324
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,000
plenty of preservation for the future

325
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:09,519
now what you're also going to do is

326
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,480
Inspire yourself you're going to want to

327
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,799
grow those seeds and now you've given

328
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,800
yourself some brand new inspiration uh

329
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:18,519
some new energy to go and then you're

330
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:19,759
not bored and that reset won't be as uh

331
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,480
won't be as long you'll be more

332
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,759
motivated to get over that all right I

333
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,480
feel like I'm already rambling this

334
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:26,759
question has gone on longer than I truly

335
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,680
intended I feel like I answered you bro

336
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:30,759
reverse your favorite and pollinate

337
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:32,278
everybody the quick answer all right

338
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,078

346
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,839
question came from somebody who wants to

347
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,879
be called John at dank Perfection what's

348
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,440
up John thank you for the question it

349
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:57,159
goes like this I've been enjoying

350
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
listening to your podcast thank you I've

351
00:11:57,159 --> 00:12:00,600
been growing for just a few years and I

352
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,958
try try to be like a sponge and soak up

353
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,879
the knowledge thank you there's a lot

354
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:06,119
more I'm skipping to the question it

355
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:08,559
says my question is which of your

356
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,120
strains would be best for me to try let

357
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,799
me tell you what I'm looking for I would

358
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:14,278
love to find something that is osaman

359
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,679
dominant I can tell you right away I

360
00:12:14,278 --> 00:12:18,639
don't do a lot of lab testing for tpin

361
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,519
so I can't tell you what's got osaman

362
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,198
but I can answer your question based on

363
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:24,759
the data that you have given me I worked

364
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:28,000
for a wck farm in Washington that had a

365
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:29,879
strain called WiFi OG which was Fire OG

366
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,440
to the White I was doing a lot of

367
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:33,879
testing and found that that had off the

368
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,639
charts osine uh so basically you're

369
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:37,519
looking for the plant with osine which

370
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,759
your acrosses do you think would be

371
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,440
similar or have similar effects okay the

372
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:46,319
quick answer there is uh my Dr mind

373
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,839
Bender cut has Fire OG in it so anything

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,519
with the Dr Mindbender may get you there

375
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,160
what's got Dr Mindbender or what's going

376
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,679
to be close to that what may get you

377
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:57,120
there would be the Sunday show or also

378
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,479
I've got a skunk tester crossed to the

379
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,078
Dr Mindbender that is available on the

380
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,399
website now Dr Mindbender to skunk

381
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:05,799
number one testers are available uh

382
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,720
they're at a very affordable price

383
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,759
they're on the website right now I would

384
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,720
grab some of those uh that's probably

385
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,639
going to get you close and then also the

386
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:16,120
4K has got the potential to get you

387
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,000
close to that but Sunday show and the

388
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,560
new skunk tester are what I would

389
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,559
recommend to find that osine and get you

390
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,838
as close to that Fire OG as you do

391
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:28,078
remember my dude John make sure you

392
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,760
check your inbox check that spam folder

393
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,759
cuz you've got a coupon code for a free

394
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,078
pack of seeds at idirect decom I like

395
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,198
this you guys we burned through two

396
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,679
messages already two people have gotten

397
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:39,679
seeds we've answered a couple of good

398
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,439
questions let's keep this rapid fire

399
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,599
Pace going and see how long I can keep

400
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,760
this up all right this question

401
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,360
came from special KL special kill

402
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:51,159
special KL I'm not sure bro Special K

403
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,199
how about we're going to call you

404
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,958
Special K now that's your new

405
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:56,399
name I'm rambling already

406
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:59,119
this all up it says when getting

407
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,519
started breeding when do you use open

408
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:04,198
pollination versus selected individuals

409
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:05,399
now that's a really good question I

410
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:07,838
quickly have to talk about the

411
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,320
difference between open pollination and

412
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,839
selective breeding we're going to do it

413
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,680
super quickly don't worry open

414
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,160
pollination that is when I have multiple

415
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,278
males and females and I let them all

416
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:22,198
just have a big orgy so the pollen from

417
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,679
plant a b and c is going to hit female

418
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:26,719
plants one two and three in every

419
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:28,599
combination possible the pollen from

420
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,920
plant a went to 1 two and three the

421
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,519
pollen from plant B also hit those so

422
00:14:30,919 --> 00:14:34,719
we're going to get every combination in

423
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:37,360
the room that is an open pollination why

424
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:39,360
would we do that um that is fun that

425
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,278
shows a lot of diversity uh you're going

426
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,039
to find all of the different phenotypes

427
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,600
that are possible in those genetics

428
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:45,879
that's that's the reason for that you're

429
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,720
going to find all the different

430
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,078
combinations they may come up in that

431
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,240
gene pool it's a lot of fun it's also a

432
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:55,838
very viable and useful way to increase

433
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,120
your inventory of seeds so that's a

434
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,120
great reason for open pollination um

435
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,679
it's going to make a diverse population

436
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,000
your population is going to be very

437
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:05,319
diverse you're going to see a bunch of

438
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,519
different traits a whole bunch of

439
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,399
different growth uh different alals if

440
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:11,720
you will are going to pop up but if you

441
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,240
want to increase uh traits and inventory

442
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,240
and see what that progyny has to offer

443
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,959
open pollination is the way to do it um

444
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,600
individual selective breeding that is

445
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:22,559
when you are dialing in traits that is

446
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,040
when I want to isolate or highlight

447
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,078
traits or even breed out specific traits

448
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,000
so if you want to open up the gene pool

449
00:15:27,078 --> 00:15:31,120
and open up the breeding do that open

450
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,480
pollination if you want to do selection

451
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,120
and select for certain things that's

452
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,879
when the selective breeding comes into

453
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,360
play I feel like I answered that one

454
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,519
super quickly and just used a whole

455
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,039
bunch of weird Logic on that one

456
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,440
I hope I answered that one uh

457
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,039
sufficiently my dude Special K check

458
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,040
that inbox because you've got a coupon

459
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:52,599
code for a free pack of seeds at iy

460
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:54,078
direct.com this is kind of fun I like

461
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,839
burning through these messages it feels

462
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,599
like progress just throwing paper in the

463
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,160
burnt it pile I like that all right the

464
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,959
next one came from a friend we're going

465
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,399
to call Joey D what up Joey D it's not

466
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,359
Joey Diaz but it is damn close the

467
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,039
message says yo rosta Jeff thank you for

468
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,120
all the knowledge I appreciate all you

469
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,240
do and I've learned so much about

470
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,000
everything that has to do with cannabis

471
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,000
plus some life lessons bro that is a

472
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,240
great way to open a message to

473
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,600
me thank you I appreciate it it says

474
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,198
I've been growing three years I got my

475
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,278
hands into a little bit of pollen

476
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,679
chucking all right so after 3 years

477
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,000
you're into a little bit of pollen

478
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:30,078
chucking that makes sense it says I have

479
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,078
a blueberry spice SP cross I made that

480
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,479
sounds delightful and it's got a

481
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,599
hint of blueberry but more spice all

482
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,440
right do you think I can cross it to

483
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,639
another blueberry strain to add more of

484
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,759
the blueberry flavor or do I keep

485
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:46,680
hunting through the original cross for a

486
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:48,278
more blueberry is plant um you've got a

487
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:49,758
couple options here you can keep hunting

488
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:51,919
through the seeds if you've got a lot of

489
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:55,000
seeds find that plant that tastes just

490
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:56,439
like blueberries and then make f2s with

491
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
that if that's what you want to do or

492
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,519
breed that uh reverse it and breed that

493
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,919
one to uh the good phenotype that you've

494
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,880
got you could back across a phenotype to

495
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:08,480
the original blueberry parent if you've

496
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,600
got that original blueberry I don't know

497
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,919
if you have that I don't know which

498
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,599
parents you've got or you definitely

499
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,280
could find if you want to add blueberry

500
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:16,958
to it the easy way to do it we'll just

501
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,720
be finding something with super

502
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,839
blueberry TPS and breed it to that if

503
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,038
you want blueberry the answer is breed

504
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:24,798
it to the blueberry um but I would

505
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,879
backcross it to the original blueberry

506
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:28,240
parent if you've got that just try to

507
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,039
that way you're keeping you're still

508
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,880
working with your original genetics kind

509
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:34,240
of keeping it inhouse doing your thing

510
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,400
and keep that project alive try to not

511
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,798
fix it but update or polish the the

512
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,919
project you've already made try to put

513
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:41,200
that blueberry flavor into there with

514
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,720
what you've already got you know you've

515
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,080
got it you know you've got blueberry you

516
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,880
started with it let's see if you can get

517
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,038
it in there by using blueberry that

518
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:50,440
you've already got so I would say

519
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:52,240
backcross it um if you can backcross it

520
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,519
to the original blueberry do that I'm

521
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,319
not sure which was the male which was

522
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:58,400
the female I've got minimal info or the

523
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,359
option is like you said go find another

524
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,360
Super blueberry turp that's just focused

525
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,678
on that blueberry turp and breed it to

526
00:18:02,359 --> 00:18:05,519
that maybe you'll get what you want out

527
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,759
of there uh that was a super quick

528
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,918
answer also Joey D once again my bro

529
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,759
check your inbox for a coupon code for a

530
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,400
free pack of seeds at edirect decom

531
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,839
before I read the next message I do need

532
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,000
to remind you that those coupon codes do

533
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,959
expire those gift certificates do expire

534
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,519
they come with a clearly labeled

535
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,440
experation date yes I said experation

536
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,038
we're having fun today that expiration

537
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,159
date is real it's not a joke I'm not

538
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,400
taunting you that shit's going to expire

539
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:33,159
I've got to make them expire um because

540
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,559
for logistical bookkeeping reasons I

541
00:18:33,159 --> 00:18:37,039
can't have free money floating around

542
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,519
forever and also uh if you don't use

543
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,000
that coupon code it tells me you didn't

544
00:18:38,519 --> 00:18:42,440
even listen to the episode where I read

545
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,960
your question and you're supposed to be

546
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,880
listening all right where do we go we've

547
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,038
got another question in front of me once

548
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,640
again I'm just spitting these answers

549
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:50,599
out as quickly as I can off the top of

550
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,000
my head with very little review so I

551
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,879
hope I'm nailing these and giving you

552
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,440
guys good quick answers sometimes I

553
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,360
don't need to ramble so much which is

554
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
I've already what I've started doing now

555
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,399
let's get focused this one came from my

556
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,640
buddy Dave in Ontario shout out to my

557
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,840
Canadian friends out there sorry I can't

558
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,038
send you seeds anymore Health Canada

559
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,319
does not like me anyway this message

560
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,200
says Rost to Jeff it's Dave from Canada

561
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,678
what's up Dave out there in Canada says

562
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,480
I'm submitting another excellent

563
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,240
question for your show yes bro and I'm

564
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,880
sorry I can't send you the seeds but I

565
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,599
do send you a high five and a big fist

566
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,559
bump it says I asked this in the

567
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:24,480
Breeders chat on Discord if you want to

568
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:26,399
pop in there and chat about it but the

569
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,798
question is and this is a very good

570
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,440
question do you find that the PA and

571
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,759
donor of a feminized line will more

572
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,080
often than not be the dominant phenotype

573
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,119
so you got a feminized line the pollen

574
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,839
donor do I find that the pollen donor

575
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:44,079
will be the dominant phenotype not

576
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:45,279
regularly not always not commonly no

577
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:46,759
there's a reason for that we're going to

578
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,399
talk about in the next line of the

579
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:52,519
question um but no uh most often no

580
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,000
that's that's the bottom line on that no

581
00:19:52,519 --> 00:19:56,960
uh then it says like out of 100 seeds 50

582
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,919
or more will be leaning to the pollen

583
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,279
donor or uh dead ringers of the pollen

584
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,038
donor um no what that means is that your

585
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:09,119
pollen donor is uh more dominant in the

586
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,720
breeding mix than the pollen receivers

587
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:12,959
that uh remember when I talked about the

588
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,679
Brock Lesnar Theory this is Brock Lesnar

589
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,720
Theory uh in practice showing itself

590
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,798
right here you've got a Brock Lesnar

591
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,519
Paul and donor and those genes are just

592
00:20:19,798 --> 00:20:23,480
dominating the mix and everything that

593
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,798
you make looks like poor Brock Lesnar's

594
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,279
daughter so that's this is Brock Lesnar

595
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:30,400
Theory uh in action here in practice

596
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:31,798
showing itself if you haven't heard that

597
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,679
listen back a few episodes I don't

598
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,240
remember which one it is we talk about

599
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,360
selecting male plants I labeled

600
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,079
something the Brock Lesnar Theory go

601
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,359
listen to that episode somebody cut a

602
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:42,359
clip out of it for me and send me a

603
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,399
short please I'll send you a

604
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:46,000
gift card um we're going to get so many

605
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,280
of those the first one the best one is

606
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,558
going to get a gift card um but so that

607
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,960
I think that that leads me to believe

608
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:54,720
that your pollen donor has just got

609
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,960
dominant genes and dominant traits in

610
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,079
all aspects then it says do you find

611
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,519
that regular seeds perform differently

612
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,079
without reading the rest of the question

613
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:05,599
I'm going to say no but then it says uh

614
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:08,240
in that with regular seeds more than

615
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,278
50/50 fenos are likely sometimes a

616
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,038
phenotype is different and that's the

617
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:13,679
only thing I'm really going to uh

618
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:15,200
concede to that I will say is different

619
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,159
with fem seeds the amount of

620
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,558
phenotypical expression is a little bit

621
00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:20,320
different let me read more of what

622
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,240
you're saying more 50/50 fenos are

623
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:24,558
likely and the dominant pheno could be

624
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,960
either male or the female that dominant

625
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,000
one like I said that's going to be Brock

626
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,919
Lesnar Theory whichever if you've got a

627
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,640
really dominant male or dominant female

628
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,360
breeding uh partner that will pop up

629
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,320
that dominant trait those traits will

630
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:38,158
pop up but let me get myself back on

631
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:41,278
track do you find regular seeds perform

632
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:44,080
differently in that with regular seeds

633
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:45,558
more than more 50/50 fenals are likely

634
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,519
and the dominant pheno could be either

635
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:50,200
male or female more phenotype variation

636
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:52,960
so something I may agree to is that I do

637
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,720
see less variation in the femin seeds

638
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,640
but that's mainly with the selfing of

639
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,558
femin seeds if I took a Golden Goat S1

640
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,080
I'm not adding any other genetics to

641
00:22:00,558 --> 00:22:04,359
there so yes I'm going to see less

642
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,558
variation in that but that is kind of

643
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:08,678
the only way that I think I agree with

644
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,359
you on that what I really think is

645
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,400
happening is what I have identified as

646
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:14,839
the Brock Lesnar Theory one of your

647
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,159
plants is just simply dominant uh you've

648
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:19,558
got a big uh blond-haired blue-eyed dude

649
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,200
and you're breeding it to a bunch of

650
00:22:19,558 --> 00:22:22,558
different uh ladies with different

651
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,600
traits all your babies are coming out

652
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,720
with blonde hair blue eyes uh that's

653
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:28,798
just the genetics of that

654
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,079
caveman the andreal jeans you reading

655
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,440
with there um I think let me read this

656
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,319
one more quick

657
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,080
time yeah you're and you even said it in

658
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:40,480
here where the the dominant feno could

659
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,038
be either male or or the female uh yeah

660
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,480
that's

661
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:47,038
um yeah that's all about the gene Combos

662
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,079
and which plant was dominant I think I

663
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:49,679
answered that I think I may have

664
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,918
confused myself I think I may have

665
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,240
confused you more but I feel like I got

666
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,799
it covered there all right I'm going to

667
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:56,440
take a quick pause take a quick drink

668
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,639
and then we are going to continue with

669
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,960
these rapid fire questions all right

670
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,600
podcast world I am hydrated I am liveed

671

672
00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,879
had the camera paused you will never

673
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,759
know what could have happened while I

674
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,480
was gone let's stay focused let's get

675
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,319

there is restocked let's get back

684
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,559
into this Rapid Fire episode of The Grow

685
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,000
from your heart podcast I'm having fun

686
00:23:29,558 --> 00:23:33,158
with this we're going to bang out two

687
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,079
more quick questions of course this

688
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:37,400
question came from that growel tab on

689
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:40,399
iry genetics.com it came from my new

690
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,759
friend Smitty Smitty said hey I love the

691
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,440
podcast and all of the good information

692
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:48,480
thank you I do appreciate that it says I

693
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,480
have two 2x4 t0 both with living soil

694
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,960
beds and my last girl had an issue with

695
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,839
spidermites Bro spidermites I hate

696
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,038
spidermites but we can destroy them we

697
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:59,199
will win I said I was able to keep them

698
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:01,000
under control and finish both rounds

699
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,360
then I clean the tents as thoroughly as

700
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,599
I thought was needed but always the good

701
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,479
but when it comes to spider mites uh

702
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:10,798
this round the mites have come back so

703
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,880
my question is what can I do to

704
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,720
completely clean my tents between rounds

705
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,240
to ensure the mites are wiped out

706
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:19,960
without leaving strange chemicals in my

707
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:23,240
soil my tents are staggered by about 4

708
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,120
weeks they're spaced about 15 ft apart

709
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,720
I'm not sure if I'd be safe sanitizing

710
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,199
each tent individually oh excuse me for

711
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,600
burping it not even going to edit that

712
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,759
it's cuz I took a big fat drink right

713
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:34,480
before I recorded it says or if I should

714
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,440
let both tins finish and clean them at

715
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:38,399
the same time I'm growing The Golden

716
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:41,038
Girls pack along with cand delicious in

717
00:24:38,398 --> 00:24:43,558
the coming rounds so all of your help is

718
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:46,798
appreciated my dude uh I think I have

719
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:49,319
got what maybe a very uh viable solution

720
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,119
for a person in your situation you will

721
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,519
not have to shut down you do not have to

722
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:55,319
worry about any weird chemicals which

723
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,278
could get me going on another complete

724
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,918
side rant but what I would

725
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,319
recommend are Predator insects I would

726
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:06,159
release a bunch of Predator bugs uh

727
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:08,480
specific predators in both grow spaces

728
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,440
um especially running Perpetual it

729
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,278
sounds like you're kind of running

730
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,080
Perpetual uh you got two tents and

731
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:16,319
they're staggered uh they're four weeks

732
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:18,278
apart if you release bugs in both tents

733
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,639
they will stay there and they will stay

734
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:22,519
as protective security guards forever

735
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,480
and you may have to replenish lightly

736
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:26,519
you can have them delivered on a

737
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,360
schedule if you even want to but you may

738
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,960
have to lightly replenish these bugs

739
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,158
bugs but if you get a good population of

740
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,038
Predator bugs colonized in these grow

741
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:37,240
spaces you'll never have to spray

742
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,919
anything and you'll barely ever have to

743
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,278
replenish these Predators if it is done

744
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,880
correctly so what I would recommend and

745
00:25:42,278 --> 00:25:45,278
this is just a list of Predator bugs

746
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,480
that you can order from many different

747
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:51,398
vendors and Distributors I'm going to

748
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:55,000
recommend arbco organics.com it's a

749
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:56,639
rb- organics.com they do not pay me I'm

750
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,798
not sponsored by them I'm simply a

751
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,320
satisfied customer I have several

752
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,359
friends who have shopped with them there

753
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:04,480
are plenty of other companies and what

754
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:07,158
are they called insecti Aries they may

755
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,960
be closer to you but I can recommend I

756
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:11,399
can recommend arbo they've done great

757
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,079
work for me before but the bugs I would

758
00:26:11,398 --> 00:26:18,959
recommend are sworsky pmus Cal fornicus

759
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:21,079
hypoaspis miles and Green Lace wings and

760
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,278
there's another one cucumeris is what I

761
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,359
think it's called that may have been the

762
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:25,558
name of another one they may have

763
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:27,119
swapped a name the cucumeris is one that

764
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:30,240
I forgot to write down that I'll add to

765
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:32,839
that but we've got the sworski pmus Cal

766
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,519
fornicus hypoaspis miles Green Lace

767
00:26:32,839 --> 00:26:37,639
wings and cucumeris I would release as

768
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:40,119
many of them as you can afford into that

769
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,759
grow space and they will decimate your

770
00:26:40,119 --> 00:26:44,038
spidermites they will destroy the

771
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:46,240
spidermites release it into both spaces

772
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:48,278
you can release that in your flower room

773
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,440
without any harm without any problem at

774
00:26:48,278 --> 00:26:52,278
any time any stage of growth they will

775
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:54,360
be harmless to your flowers they will be

776
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:56,159
very beneficial uh you can use these at

777
00:26:54,359 --> 00:26:57,558
all times you can use them on your

778
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,360
seedlings all the way up to your

779
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:00,759
flowering plant plants and they will eat

780
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:02,158
up all of the bugs for you and then

781
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:03,519
they'll start looking for other bugs and

782
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,360
they'll go further and looking for other

783
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,639
bugs and there aren't any they'll leave

784
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,918
and then they'll die and then you'll

785
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,360
have to replenish them so that you don't

786
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,360
get more spidermites in the future but

787
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:13,759
this is what I recommend it's very easy

788
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:15,359
it's very reliable and if you don't want

789
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,319
to spray if you don't want weird

790
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,079
chemicals which triggers me in its own

791
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:21,639
way we'll talk about that later in a

792
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:22,879
future episode but the Predator bugs are

793
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,840
the way to go they're a little bit

794
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,640
expensive but if you think about it

795
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:29,639
they're cost effective compared to a

796
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,038
bottled pesticide Ro ation you would

797
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:32,679
want two or three different bottles

798
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,798
you're going to have to apply those I

799
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:36,440
think the bugs will be more effective

800
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,798
and cost effective one thing I'm going

801
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,840
to say don't use ladybugs because them

802
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:43,960
are lazy all right I'm

803
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,319
going to read one more message in this

804
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,919
rapid fire podcast and then what I want

805
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,879
from you guys please if you would was

806
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,480
leave me some comments in the comment

807
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,760
section and let me know what you thought

808
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,720
of this rapid fire show do you prefer

809
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:57,679
the long drawn out answers when I ramble

810
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:59,720
my face off and give you repeated too

811
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,159
much info or do you like it when I bang

812
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,278
through a whole bunch of questions and

813
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:04,840
give you a bunch of info really quickly

814
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,679
I'm curious I want to know what you

815
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:08,879
think argue about it down there in the

816
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:11,640
comments section this next question came

817
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,600
from somebody called my plants talk back

818
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,640
uh everybody's plants talk back you just

819
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,319
got to be listening this question says

820
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,759
I'm getting ready to start my first

821
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,839
breeding project I like that says I

822
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,798
don't want my whole crop to be seated

823
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:25,319
that's going to be a struggle my dude uh

824
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:27,798
it says but I want a good amount of

825
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:29,359
seeds to play with and Hunt through on

826
00:28:27,798 --> 00:28:31,759
average how many plants should I

827
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,240
pollinate from a reversed female to give

828
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:36,759
me a healthy yield of seeds also any

829
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,919
tips on reversing females would be uh

830
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,640
useful uh I've done a full podcast on

831
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,278
reversing plants so if you can find that

832
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,519
full podcast we don't have to ramble

833
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,200
about it here we could stay rapid fire

834
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,679
um I've purchased the chemicals needed

835
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,360
to make STS and I have a recipe are

836
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,919
there any additives no don't add

837
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:56,199
anything to it spray it just like it is

838
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,278
you want the silver nitrate sodium thy

839
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:00,720
sulfate distilled water that's all you

840
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:02,759
need um do you recommend collecting the

841
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,600
pollen by hand no smack that revers

842
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:05,759
plant right up against your uh pollen

843
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,759
receiver plants just give them a good

844
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:09,640
smack a good tap if you can that's the

845
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,158
way I would recommend to do it how long

846
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,440
can I store the pollen um no more than a

847
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,159
couple of months if you insist uh put

848
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,440
the reverse plan in the tent yeah do I

849
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,799
recommend you put the reverse plan in

850
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,519
the tent yes put it right next to them

851
00:29:19,798 --> 00:29:22,879
let it pollinate and then shake it and

852
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,399
then rub it up against the girls when

853
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,760
it's time um thanks love your show would

854
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,918
love to try some of your beans keep on

855
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,440
growing well my friend I apologize for

856
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,600
rubbing my eye here on the podcast I got

857
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,000
something in the eyeball I think it was

858
00:29:32,599 --> 00:29:36,480
my own dreadlocks uh my dude you do get

859
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,839
to try my seeds cuz you get a coupon

860
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,839
code for a free pack of seeds at idirect

861
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:43,519
tocom the main question here was um I

862
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,918
want a good amount of seeds on average

863
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:48,000
how many plants should I pollinate to be

864
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,480
honest with you you can make a lot of

865
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,240
seeds from very small plants when I'm

866
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,679
doing a brand new breeding project if I

867
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
just want to try something out and make

868
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,840
some seeds for myself that you don't get

869
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,599
I will pollinate plants that are in beer

870
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,558
cut cups what beer cups yes I will take

871
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:04,639
a male clone and a female clone and a

872
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:06,480
beer cup and I'll take several of those

873
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,240
clones of the females and I'll put them

874
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,599
in a little tiny room and I'll pollinate

875
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,399
them in the corner and I can hit five or

876
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:14,119
six seven or eight beer cups with one

877
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:16,038
beer cup male put them right in the

878
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:18,599
middle hit all those girls and I can

879
00:30:16,038 --> 00:30:20,599
produce 30 to 50 maybe 70 seeds of each

880
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:23,398
one of those plants and that's plenty

881
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:25,959
for me to play with so a small beer cup

882
00:30:23,398 --> 00:30:28,038
a one gon pot is a plenty big enough

883
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,159
siiz plant to make plenty of seeds for

884
00:30:28,038 --> 00:30:32,240
you to play with beer cups are easy to

885
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,000
manage if you understand how to do it uh

886
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,960
you don't need to veg them very long veg

887
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,839
it till it's about 3 and 1/2 4 and 1

888
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,640
half Ines tall then flip it let them do

889
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,720
their magic they will pollen it you'll

890
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:47,038
make plenty of seeds uh one gallon pots

891
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:49,200
will make hundreds of seeds uh you could

892
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,158
produce plenty of seeds to play with and

893
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,759
just a small pot in a small amount of

894
00:30:51,159 --> 00:30:54,919
time is what I think I'm trying to get

895
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:57,319
to I was going to ramble on a lot more

896
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:59,759
but um yeah just one plant will get you

897
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:02,119
plenty of seeds I recommend pollinating

898
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,480
several different females that way you

899
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:07,000
can see uh the representation of that

900
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,440
male amongst multiple different crosses

901
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,278
and see what he is contributing to the

902
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,798
breeding it'll give you more insight to

903
00:31:10,278 --> 00:31:14,278
what he's doing I've rambled about this

904
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:16,599
a lot in other podcasts this is not the

905
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:18,359
