68
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,260
genetics website if you go to

69
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:36,120
iregenetics.com there's a list of tabs

70
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:38,098
at the top one of them says does say

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,659
questions or grow help you'll find it

I'm sure you're smart enough give that a

73
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,620
click it will ask you a few questions it

74
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:44,639
asks you about your grow space it's

75
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,560
going to ask you where you're growing

76
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,299
indoors Outdoors what strain are you

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,519
growing what's the temp what's the

78
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,019
humidity we ask a few basic questions we

79
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:53,879
want to know what's going on that lets

80
00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:55,560
me get a heads up on how to help you the

81
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,840
more I know about your grow the easier

82
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,219
it is for me to diagnose correct and set

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,140
you up for success and help you with

84
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:02,699
your growth so we have some questions go

85
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,439
to the grow help tab after those general

86
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:06,539
questions we do give you the opportunity

87
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:08,759
to type in your full question what's

88
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:11,400
going on in the grow how can we help you

89
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:13,739
my friend JH has sent me a question on

90
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,439
the grow help Tab and it goes a little

91
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,599
bit like this hey Ross to Jeff can you

92
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:20,579
tell me about your easiest to grow

93
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:23,280
strain something I can really hit out of

94
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,959
the park without being an expert and

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,519
then he goes in parentheses and says and

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,680
don't say all of them that's really

97
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,819
funny because all of my strains are

98
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,140
pretty easy to grow and you should be

99
00:03:29,818 --> 00:03:33,419
able to bang them all out of the park

100
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,458
but I will give you some specifics and

101
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,559
some more details it says what one of

102
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,780
your strains is the healthiest uh which

103
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,759
strain can't and won't be stopped which

104
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,219
strain is beginner friendly and what

105
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,679
strain is resistant to all then they ask

106
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:47,939
follow-up questions once I determine all

107
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,500
the answers for these they want to know

108
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:51,120
what does it smell like what is the

109
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,340
flowering time and what type of

110
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,900
morphology can we expect and then are

111
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,580
there more on the list then he follows

112
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,840
up with another great question let's

113
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,640
jump into the first part of this

114
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,979
question here from our friend JH in

115
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:04,259
Canada the main part of the question is

116
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:06,179
which of my strains are easiest to grow

117
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:08,759
and then he said don't say all of them

118
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,340
so that does limit me I often say that

119
00:04:08,759 --> 00:04:14,158
Sun kiss is one of my easiest to grow

120
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,379
strains sunkiss is super easy it's very

121
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,238
forgiving if you make a mistake if you

122
00:04:16,379 --> 00:04:20,219
over water underwater over feed under

123
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:22,439
feed the sun kiss doesn't get too upset

124
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,540
about that it can take some abuse it can

125
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:26,160
take some grower error and a new grower

126
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,740
is going to make some errors and cause

127
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,540
some abuse so Sun kiss is always one of

128
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,819
my very first recommendations when it

129
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,040
comes to successful plants for a

130
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:37,439
beginner grower I also recommend the

131
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,419
strawberry Starburst the only issue with

132
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,399
strawberry Starburst is it may get a

133
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:43,500
little bit tall for a new grower if they

134
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,478
are not prepared the good side to that

135
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:47,459
is it does grow super quickly in veg it

136
00:04:45,478 --> 00:04:48,959
grows with Hyper Vigor and veg so it

137
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,519
doesn't take nearly as much flowering

138
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,560
time to get that plant big enough and

139
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:54,659
ready for a flower because it just grows

140
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,579
so quickly so your veg time is shorter

141
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,500
which gives you less time for problems I

142
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:59,939
feel like the quicker in and out we are

143
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,040
in that grow in that Garden the less

144
00:04:59,939 --> 00:05:03,360
opportunity we have for problems so a

145
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,979
quicker vegging plant will definitely

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,379
help you out however those will get

147
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:09,360
quite tall just flip early you will be

148
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,620
okay I do have a longer list tier of

149
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,720
things that I think will grow well in my

150
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,540
in your garden from my lineup I always

151
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,979
recommend Morning Dew Morning Dew is a

152
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:19,259
great cross it's very resistant to

153
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:21,060
powdery mildew very resistant to Bud rot

154
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:23,340
it grows very well it's got a great

155
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:25,800
structure and it's super stinky and

156
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:27,719
super potent product in the end so the

157
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,699
sun kiss strawberry Starburst and

158
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,900
Morning Dew are three of the classics

159
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:32,699
that I would recommend those have been

160
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,620
in my lineup for quite a while they've

161
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,060
been tried and trued we know they work

162
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,120
well in all types of environments

163
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,860
indoors Outdoors greenhouses they work

164
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,139
well for experienced Growers and they

165
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,060
definitely work well for the noobs I've

166
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,860
seen new Growers push that strawberry

167
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,240
Starburst to beautiful limits I've seen

168
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,220
some gorgeous pictures of strawberry

169
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,620
Starburst the morning dew comes out

170
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,840
super Frosty super chunky no matter who

171
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:56,819
grows it and the sun kiss is Just

172
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,319
autopilot weed if you pour water and

173
00:05:56,819 --> 00:06:00,719
nutrients on that and put lights above

174
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,000
it sunkiss is going to give you an

175
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,199
excellent amazing top shelf buds so

176
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,879
let's keep going because there are more

177
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,978
to the list I want to mention fist bump

178
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,500
fist bump is one of my newer strains

179
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:12,959
fist bumping is super easy to grow it is

180
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,120
a sour diesel to a rise cross once again

181
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,918
the only problem you may run into with

182
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,259
fist bump is it is going to get fairly

183
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:21,000
tall fairly quickly and it may need some

184
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:24,180
sort of supports but it's pretty easy to

185
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,918
grow in most cases now let's make it

186
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,019
real easy for people and let's talk

187
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,120
about some feminized lines that I do

188
00:06:28,019 --> 00:06:32,399
offer that make it very easy for people

189
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,959
to grow one of my favorites that I

190
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,638
recommend for new Growers that you guys

191
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:37,918
love that everybody out there is able to

192
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,319
grow able to knock it out of the park is

193
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:42,120
Golden Goat Golden Goat is really easy

194
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,180
to grow it needs a little extra feeding

195
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,280
but most new Growers tend to overfeed

196
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,959
anyway so since the Golden Goat needs a

197
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,879
little extra nutrients you guys do it

198
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,899
just right the new Growers do that one

199
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,000
very well

200
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:56,279
Golden Goat is a feminized seed if you

201
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,600
get seeds from me if it says Femme seeds

202
00:06:56,279 --> 00:06:59,519
on it there is a Golden Goat back cross

203
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,319
those are not Femmes however there are

204
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,538
Golden Goat feminized seeds available

205
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:05,340
you will have all female plants in your

206
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,259
lineup they will grow with great Vigor

207
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:09,060
they'll be nice and sturdy they make

208
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:11,460
beautiful plants with great colors great

209
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,839
Aromas they take about eight and a half

210
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:13,978
to nine and a half weeks to finish

211
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,599
depending on the room and the

212
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,519
phenotypical Expressions you achieve

213
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:19,680
which plants you get out of the seed

214
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:22,079
pack basically it's really easy to grow

215
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,360
and the buzz from Golden Goat is amazing

216
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,680
the flavors Aromas and Buzz are top

217
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,939
shelf that's why I breed it to

218
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,759
everything you'll notice there's Golden

219
00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:32,098
Goat somewhere in a lot of my crosses

220
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,580
let's keep going more feminized stuff

221
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:37,319
the Maze and the wombat Maze and Wombat

222
00:07:35,579 --> 00:07:39,478
are great strains for new Growers they

223
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:41,939
will work very well for you also

224
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,978
character Zero and Sunday show will be

225
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,959
great strains for new Growers those are

226
00:07:43,978 --> 00:07:48,839
all four of those are feminized there's

227
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:50,818
Maize wombat Sunday show and character

228
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,619
Zero those are all Femmes they will all

229
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:54,780
grow very well for a new grower they're

230
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,538
all very resistant to problems the

231
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:59,638
mildew the mold bugs all of those will

232
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:01,259
be very resistant the problem with those

233
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,360
last four that I mentioned is they do

234
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,580
get a little bit tall that's the only

235
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,800
issue to worry about the thing to do

236
00:08:05,579 --> 00:08:10,139
there flower early don't veg them for so

237
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,759
long which most Growers are pretty eager

238
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,800
to get the crop going they do want to

239
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,840
flower early so veg until they're about

240
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,579
maybe knee-high then flip them and I

241
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,159
think you'll do really well with those

242
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:22,139
plants so let me review that list

243
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,720
regular seeds Sun kiss strawberry

244
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,759
Starburst Morning Dew then we work into

245
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,620
fist bump fist bump is going to be super

246
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,360
stinky make sure you have carbon

247
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,060
filtration in place for the fist bump

248
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:36,839
then feminized Golden Goat is super easy

249
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:38,879
to grow Maize wombat character Zero and

250
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,399
Sunday show are very easy to grow

251
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,500
another great growing plant is the Lemon

252
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:45,659
Jeffrey however it does get really tall

253
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,639
and it's kind of picky on feeding in

254
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,559
some phenotype so if you want to really

255
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:51,059
push yourself try the lemon Jeff but

256
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:53,759
that's the next step up that one's not

257
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:55,799
going to be as easy so those are some of

258
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,259
my easiest and healthiest to grow those

259
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,819
uh can't stop won't be stopped they're

260
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:01,799
all beginner friendly and they're all

261
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,899
quite resistant to most of the problems

262
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:05,159
you're going to run into as a grower now

263
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:07,200
let's talk about some of the flavors and

264
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:10,559
Aromas of a lot of these plants

265
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,300
Sun kiss that is straight up oranges if

266
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,639
you're looking for oranges orange candy

267
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:18,719
orange Funk Sun kisses the way to go

268
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:21,179
Morning Dew is straight funky skunky uh

269
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,580
earthy uh I call it warmer notes those

270
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:25,979
are more earthy skunky gassier darker

271
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,360
sort of tones in my mind the strawberry

272
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,940
Starburst that's just straight up

273
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,600
strawberry candy uh fist bump that's

274
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,120
going to be fully offensive gas funky

275
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,339
diesel fuel gasoline sort of Terps

276
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,500
Golden Goat that one's very unique the

277
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,860
Golden Goat is kind of like a tropical

278
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:45,659
fruit a tropical fruit basket and Juicy

279
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:48,480
Fruit bubble gum that is my opinion of

280
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:51,059
Golden Goat and I love it maize maze is

281
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:53,700
uh blue raspberry truffle to the

282
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:55,319
Afterglow so you get that blue raspberry

283
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,560
truffle sorta

284
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:01,019
sort of it's like a a raspberry sort of

285
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,879
thing it's a sour uh Tangy sort of a

286
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,259
thing but then that mixes in with the

287
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,179
sweetness of the aftergone it makes

288
00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:08,338
amazing flavors wombat that's the New

289

290
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:12,300
hints of that diesel flavor and a lot of

291
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:13,919
orange diesel Lee Terps out of that one

292
00:10:12,299 --> 00:10:16,679
character Zero that one's going to give

293
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:18,719
you those earthy terpy uh more earthy

294
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,338

you cushy uh orange sort of flavors so

297
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,838
those are the flavors and Aromas from

298
00:10:24,659 --> 00:10:29,879
those flowering time uh Sun kiss eight

299
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,040
or nine weeks morning do eight or nine

300
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:35,519

strawberry starburst on nine to ten

302
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,080
weeks on that one Golden Goat nine weeks

303
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,059
maze wombat character Zero Sunday show

304
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:44,040
those are all going to be nine to ten

305
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,659
weakers you will find some early

306
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:48,240
finishers and the sun kiss and morning

307
00:10:45,659 --> 00:10:50,100
do some of those will go eight weeks 56

308
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,659
days finish the eighth week you guys

309
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,639
don't cut it down the middle of week

310
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:55,620
eight let 56 days happen I would

311
00:10:53,639 --> 00:10:58,078
recommend 60 days but some of the those

312
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,600
are a little bit earlier morphology so

313
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:03,000
since a lot of these came from the arise

314
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,600
pollen donor King Solomon a lot of them

315
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,940
have that tall uh branchy takeoff sort

316
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,000
of structure the one that doesn't do it

317
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,980
as much is Sun kiss uh Sun kiss doesn't

318
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,740
take off as hard as the others but most

319
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:19,139
of them will get a tall skinny sort of a

320
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,419
structure Golden Goat is an S1 that one

321
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,159
uh should say depending on your light

322
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,659
and your environment sometimes it stays

323
00:11:23,159 --> 00:11:26,039
a little bit shorter sometimes it does a

324
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:28,019
little stretching for people but it's

325
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,240
shorter and bushier for the Golden Goat

326
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:32,759
maze wombat character Zero and Sunday

327
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,079
show uh those are going to get tall on

328
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:36,240
you you're going to see tall stretchy

329
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,458
plants with a lot of branches but in

330
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,459
flower all of that tallness just fills

331
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:43,619
up with meaty beefy chunky trichome

332
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:45,239
covered nuggets I'm not really going to

333
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,159
dig too deep into the specific

334
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,019
phenotypes of all of these plants I gave

335
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:52,379
you the basic what to expect that's a

336
00:11:49,019 --> 00:11:54,179
lot to talk about uh second best that is

337
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,439
the one two that's like the top ten in

338
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,759
my lineup right there I couldn't pick

339
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,980
just one that's like trying to pick your

340
00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,360
favorite pair of sneakers but those are

341
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,220
a few that I would recommend for a new

342
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,899
beginner I think you'd really kick some

343
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,879
good ass with Morning Dew fist bump

344
00:12:03,899 --> 00:12:08,039
everything on that list is great to grow

345
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:10,379
then it said are all of you your

346
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,299
restraints potent that is a very good

347
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:13,620
question is everything that I breed

348
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:16,199
potent

349
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,820
um since I'm using I do very careful

350
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:21,060
selection for male plants since I'm

351
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:23,278
using top quality male plants that leads

352
00:12:21,059 --> 00:12:25,559
me to think that most of the progeny

353
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,679
should be quite potent it should contain

354
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:31,078
a lot of THC potential but that's also

355
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,819
up to the grower the environment which

356
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,620
phenotype did you select there may be

357
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,019
other terpenes or cannabinoids

358
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:40,320
dominating that mix toward the THC isn't

359
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:42,839
the most potent most prevalent compound

360
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,278
in that plant but it'll still be a very

361
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,740
potent plant so depends on what you're

362
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:48,419
looking for it depends on also how did

363
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,339
you grow it where did you grow it how

364
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,599
long did you grow it then there are a

365
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:53,940
lot of other things that come into play

366
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,759
was it dried and cured properly is it

367
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,380
the strain for you but yes in most cases

368
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,879
the things that I've bred the things

369
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:01,860
that I breed and create should be quite

370
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:03,659
potent because I'm smoking for more of a

371
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,579
head Buzz I want to walk into the store

372
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,319
and almost have a panic attack and think

373
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:09,479
oh [ __ ] I'm way too high to be in here

374
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,760
shopping and consider leaving that is

375
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:13,800
the buzz that I am seeking to achieve so

376
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,778
I do breed for that sort of head Buzz

377
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,578
sort of panicky sort of stuff uh there

378
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:19,139
will be some more uh some more cushy

379
00:13:17,578 --> 00:13:20,759
variety stuff coming from me in the

380
00:13:19,139 --> 00:13:22,440
future here because I miss those old

381
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:24,539
school cushy skunk flavors but I've

382
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,180
already said too much uh but yes

383
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:29,159
everything is quite potent you wrapped

384
00:13:27,179 --> 00:13:31,259
the message up with from your friend JH

385
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,120

question to the grow help tab on ire

390
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,379
genetics or iridirect.com they both have

391
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,180
the same tab if you send a question to

392
00:13:43,379 --> 00:13:47,639
there and I do read that question here

393
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:49,620
on the podcast that means that you win a

394
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:51,539
free pack of irie genetic seeds and of

395
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,299
course that giveaway is sponsored by

396
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,039
seedsherenow.com

397
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,599
all right let's keep this show moving I

398
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,879
do have another message here in front of

399
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,759
me this one is kind of a follow-up this

400
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:04,740
one is from JH again I know I'm spoiling

401
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,240
JH but these two questions came back to

402
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,120
back and this one was super easy to

403
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,339
answer it says hey Ross to Jeff J.H here

404
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,459
again if I like the flavor of one of

405
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:18,420
your 20 THC crosses more than one of

406
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:20,099
your 30 THC crosses should I go with the

407
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,500
flavor

408
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:24,839
um yes we often teach people here in

409
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,759
Colorado that the THC number isn't the

410
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,000
ultimate deciding factor and how good a

411
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:33,240
product is uh THC percentage in a plant

412
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,500
is what a lab detected sometimes you may

413
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,299
find that they're like I said a moment

414
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,860
ago there are better terpenes maybe

415
00:14:36,299 --> 00:14:39,299
there's better Esters paleo it's

416
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,399
flavonoids there's a lot of other things

417
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,799
in this plant that affect the way we

418
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:46,919
consume it and the way we enjoy it uh if

419
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:49,078
you've got a 30 THC plant with zero

420
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,379
Terps I might not enjoy it as much as I

421
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:54,120
would a 20 THC plant with 0.4 Terps in

422
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,379
there uh just that little bit of Terps

423
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,360
is going to make a big difference and

424
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:58,799
make it taste good would you rather eat

425
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,480
cardboard or would you rather eat

426
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,979
cardboard that tastes like strawberries

427
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,539
and candy that's what I'm talking about

428
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,879
do you want some good flavor in the

429
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,159
mouth or do you just want blandness so

430
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,559
the nose always knows follow your nose

431
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:12,659
I've done a podcast called follow your

432
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,219
nose those Terps are super important so

433
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,860
the short answer

434
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:18,600
uh if I if you like one better smoke the

435
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,980
one you like better bro and then I'm

436
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,920
gonna wrap that up and follow up by

437
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:26,399
saying we are often fooled uh Bamboozled

438
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:27,719
if you will by just THC labeling on jars

439
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,059
when you go to The Dispensary when you

440
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:32,699
go to buy seeds everybody puts a

441
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:34,198
potential THC number or a lab tested THC

442
00:15:32,698 --> 00:15:36,539
number on the product if you look at the

443
00:15:34,198 --> 00:15:38,759
dispensary the jar says whatever banana

444
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:40,500
kush however much an ounce however much

445
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:42,240
a gram whatever they list the price on

446
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,198
the jar a lot of times and then it'll

447
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,240
have a big star on it 27 THC and I watch

448
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,859
people scan the shelf and they go oh a

449
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,139
32 I want that one I'll take it out to

450
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,639
that one and sometimes that may not be

451
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,220
the best product for you I give them a

452
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:58,019
smell because I believe that the nose is

453
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,699
what matters the most my nose is going

454
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:02,519
to know if there's something in there

455
00:15:59,698 --> 00:16:05,939
that I am lacking or would enjoy my nose

456
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,440
goes no that's not the one no oh that

457
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,480
one when your nose lights up and your

458
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,800
eyes go damn that's the jar you should

459
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,019
buy that's the weed that you should

460
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,639
smoke the lab test is cool it gives you

461
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:16,860
kind of a good idea of how internet

462
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,600
could and potentially should be but the

463
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,419
other compounds in there are greatly

464
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,560
going to affect your Buzz I describe it

465
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:24,240
like this I haven't said this on the

466
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,518
podcast in a long time we got a lot of

467
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,180
new subscribers let's talk about it this

468
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,519
way I think that THC let's compare our

469
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:34,739
Buzz to a firework all right we all love

470
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,179
fireworks out there uh maybe some of you

471
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,560
don't but most of us love Fireworks we

472
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:40,559
all know what they are so this will work

473
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,018
let's just say that the THC is how high

474
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,059
up into the air your firework will go so

475
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,198
you're going to smoke THC your firework

476
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,719
is going to shoot up into the air it's

477
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,359
going to go straight up now my analogy

478
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,220
is if the terpenes are the colors of

479
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,199
that firework once that firework gets up

480
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,420
into the air it's going to explode is it

481
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:58,740
going to put off a purple ring is it

482
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:00,179
going to put off red yellow and green

483
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,440
Sparkles is it going to be the one that

484
00:17:00,179 --> 00:17:03,000
just goes

485
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,160
and all the weird [ __ ] rains from the

486
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,900
sky after it is it going to be super

487
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,179
[ __ ] loud and fly up into the air and

488
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,798
go boom and then just put off one big

489
00:17:09,179 --> 00:17:13,559
bright white ball of light for a second

490
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,699
is it going to be [ __ ] orange is it

491
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:16,019
going to be purple is it going to be

492
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,419
green is it going to be a lot of it

493
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:21,119
that's what the terpenes decide when we

494
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:23,160
get our Buzz the THC makes us go up the

495
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,438
terpenes decide do we get the munchies

496
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,540
do we get paranoid do we get the giggles

497
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,100
do you get a little turned on do you get

498
00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:31,319
[ __ ] scared of Life do you get super

499
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:33,298
introspective do you just get really

500
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:35,099
weird completely weird altogether that's

501
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:37,259
the terpenes mixing with the other

502
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:39,298
compounds deciding what kind of buzz you

503
00:17:37,259 --> 00:17:41,579
get so I think that shopping just for

504
00:17:39,298 --> 00:17:44,579
THC and focusing just on numbers like

505
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:46,379
that can be very misleading and then my

506
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:49,319
my wrap-up statement for all this talk

507
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,360
about THC percentages and potency is

508
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:52,619
um I've had a lot of weed tested in labs

509
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,719
and I've had a lot of it come back

510
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:56,639
really high in lab results but you know

511
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,440
what I've never had I've never had a

512
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,360
machine come back to buy another bag of

513
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,679
weed so those numbers don't do me any

514
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:03,599
good those are good numbers for the

515
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,880
machine but they're not perfect numbers

516
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,298
for humans humans need other compounds

517
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,160
to enjoy our product properly all right

518
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:12,599
my buddy JH you only get one free pack

519

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,400
sometimes that I had never thought about

529
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:34,380
you think in a different way than me so

530

00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,038
guys I try not to send free seeds to

534
00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:45,959
Canada because it does cost me 40.40 US

535
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:48,419
dollars in shipping to pack up some

536
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,679
seeds and send them to Canada but JH has

537
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,600
been around for a long time he's been

538

have read it and you're in Canada don't

541
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,038
worry I will send you the seeds but I

542
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:01,500
will try to limit the amount of Canadian

543
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,900
messages I do read Because 40 bucks a

544
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,519
pop does add up quite quickly but shout

545
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:09,360

551
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:20,519
came from our friend who wants to be

552
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,660
called Striker can and it says what kind

553
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:23,339
of question do you have there's a

554
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,440
problem in the garden they're growing

555
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,058
strawberry Starburst strawberry bubble

556
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,519
gum and wedding cake that's a great

557
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:31,500
lineup uh they're indoors under LEDs

558
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:35,220
there in week five of flower they're

559
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:38,700
growing in Cocoa the pH was 5.5 the EC

560
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,819
was 300 the daytime temp is 73 nighttime

561
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,100
temperature is 65. the humidity is 65

562
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:46,319
things are looking good then we get to

563
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:48,599
the question part of this message it

564
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,879
says yo Rasta Jeff I'm wondering what

565
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,699
the best thing to add to cocoa for a

566
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,700
sweetener taste taste enhancer terpene

567
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,200
Adder could be I just ordered Bud Candy

568
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,880
from advanced nutrients that product

569
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,519
will work however it is not my favorite

570
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,520
I don't like to bash products on here

571
00:20:02,519 --> 00:20:07,558
but honestly uh here's the truth when I

572
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,418
grew with Advanced Nutrients products I

573
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:11,700
felt like all of my flowers tasted the

574
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,500
same I could have OG cushion one part of

575
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,240
the room strawberry Haze and the other

576
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,380
blueberry cookies in the other part of

577
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,419
the room feed them all advanced

578
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,340
nutrients guess what they all taste like

579
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,200
Advanced Nutrients it all has that

580
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:23,579
really once you grow it smoke it a

581
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,380
little bit you'll start to recognize the

582
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:26,579
flavor you'll be in smoke circles you'll

583
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,200
hit a joint you'll hit a bowl and you'll

584
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,298
go ah an advanced nutrients grower

585
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,980
you'll start to taste it so there's in

586
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:33,480
my opinion I all tastes the same

587
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,339
otherwise there's nothing wrong with

588
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:37,140
that brand it just doesn't at all tastes

589
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:38,279
the same and I breed weed to taste

590
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,679
really unique and then when it all

591
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:42,538
tastes like the same Bud Candy to me I

592
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:44,759
don't enjoy that let's keep moving it

593
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,700
says I do already add tiger bloom

594
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:49,079
booster and ocean marine Cuisine that

595
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,640
ocean marine will definitely help you

596
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,558
out enhancing the Terps and the health

597
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,140
of the plants said I'm drying for about

598
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:57,960
10 days the first four days at 50 RH

599
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,400
then the rest down to 40. I may stay at

600
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,919
the 50 for a little longer but that's

601
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,360
all right do your thing since I use a

602
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:05,700
dehumidifier on low with added

603
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,779
ventilation in a 5x7 closet so you're

604
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,940
making the best with what you've got

605
00:21:06,779 --> 00:21:10,558
that's that's great uh I just got the

606
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,900
lemon Jeffrey as well so I really want

607
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:15,480
to bring out that sweet Citrus smell and

608
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,740
flavor thank you for any advice Rasta

609
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,500
Jeff my dude thank you for the great

610
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:21,480
question let's jump into this let's talk

611
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,919
about how to enhance flavor a little bit

612
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:25,500
in these sweeter strains in previous

613
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,419
episodes I did talk about adding kelp

614
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:30,900
products to make things taste that off

615
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:32,880
to enhance that skunky earthy funky uh

616
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,980
cushy Aroma and flavor I think the kelp

617
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,080
really brings that out that will also

618
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,460
bring out the aroma and flavors and most

619
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,740
of your other strains it's just not

620
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,480
going to be I feel like it kind of it

621
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:44,339
helps more with the cushy stuff but it

622
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,380
will help with your other products let's

623
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:48,240
talk about more specific products that

624
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:50,159
are available I don't use a lot of uh

625
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,500
terpene enhancer products I kind of just

626
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,240
try to grow an overall healthy plant

627
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,159
with a good balanced diet and a good

628
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,500
environment and then dry it and cure it

629
00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,659
properly and select good genetics but if

630
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,759
you want products that you can add there

631
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,500
is a product called turbinator I have

632
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,079
not used terpinator myself but I have

633
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,640
heard good reports and good results from

634
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:10,439
the products turbinator and it's

635
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,840
expensive so that [ __ ] better work

636
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,058
there's also a product called sweet from

637
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,678
Botanicare they offer a couple of

638
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:18,538
different flavors

639
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,759
these are exactly what you're asking for

640
00:22:18,538 --> 00:22:22,259
these are sweetener products to add to

641
00:22:20,759 --> 00:22:23,819
your nutrient mix and they claim that

642
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,400
these products will sweeten up the

643
00:22:23,819 --> 00:22:28,319
flavor of your end product I've never

644
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,120
used the sweet sweetener product with

645
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,099
the flavor I've used the sweetener

646
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:33,959
without flavors to work on sugars and

647
00:22:32,099 --> 00:22:36,418
carbohydrates in the plants and those

648
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,519
plants did come out quite tasty another

649
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:41,280
product I could recommend is humble

650
00:22:38,519 --> 00:22:42,720
honey humble honey is great [ __ ] I used

651
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:44,220
to use Humboldt honey way back in the

652
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,558
day before I made the switch to the New

653
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,298
Millennium maybe after thinking about

654
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:51,119
this myself I might start adding that

655
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:52,980
back into the mix The Humble honey had a

656
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,359
a lot of different things in there and

657
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,940
it definitely made a difference in the

658
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,759
flavor and Aroma of my product once

659
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,159
again I did mention kelp now let's talk

660
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:03,720
about just basic things instead of

661
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,700
recommending products once again those

662
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,079
companies do not pay me I'm not

663
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,880
advertising I'm just saying [ __ ] that

664
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:10,678
I've used and [ __ ] that I've read and

665
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,600
seen work I've not given any money by

666
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:14,519
any of these companies

667
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:16,619
um sugars and carbs are definitely going

668
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:18,440
to help increase the flavor of your

669
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,759
cannabis plants

670
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,960
carbonaria is a great product from New

671
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:24,058
Millennium that I would definitely

672
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,919
recommend adding to your product don't

673
00:23:24,058 --> 00:23:27,720
over feed the carbon area especially if

674
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,400
you're in a hydroponic system that

675
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,380
carbon area will gum up the works it

676
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,140
will suck if you're using a hydro system

677
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,940
I may choose a different product carba

678
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:38,820
load from Advanced Nutrients is actually

679
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,960
a pretty decent product then to all of

680
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,579
that stuff if you're using the

681
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:43,019
turbinator the sweet The Humble honey

682
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:45,839
don't use all those together pick one

683
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:48,119
the carbon area and the carbo load also

684
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,220
to that I would add Bud swell that is a

685
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:52,019
liquid bat guano product it'll make your

686
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,058
plants go shipping in multiple ways

687
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:55,558
they'll get beefier and fatter and they

688
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:57,599
will taste and smell good because of

689
00:23:55,558 --> 00:24:00,359
that product I do believe in my opinion

690
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:02,038
now I'm going to say something that may

691
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:05,219
be controversial because this is not how

692
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:07,558
I grow but sometimes Organics will bring

693
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:09,659
out the most amazing flavors in your

694
00:24:07,558 --> 00:24:12,178
plants it's all about the plant and the

695
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:13,679
phenotype some plants so let's talk

696
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,220
about a couple of things I've got a sour

697
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,320
diesel that grows okay in soil less mix

698
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,240
it does okay it doesn't have the flavor

699
00:24:19,319 --> 00:24:23,158
and Aroma that I can achieve when my

700
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,659
friend grows it in Hydro I've got a

701
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:26,880
friend that grows the same cut and a

702
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,620
hydro bucket and a hydro system and that

703
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,720
[ __ ] comes out so stinky that it makes

704
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:32,579
my eyes feel weird I've got to put it in

705
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,798
multiple baggies and that's just the

706
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:36,480
difference in how he is growing it so

707
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:38,400
maybe some phenotypes will make a

708
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,140
difference if you grow in Hydro soilless

709
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,360
mix with bottled nutrients and maybe

710
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,460
some plants will benefit from growing it

711
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:45,899
strictly organically so we got different

712
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,058
options we got to figure out what the

713
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,519
plant likes or you've got to find the

714
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:52,200
phenotype that works best with your grow

715
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:54,179
environment that's why I talk a lot

716
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,919
about you selecting the phenotype that

717
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:58,320
works best for you instead of asking me

718
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,000
my favorite phenotype my favorite might

719
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,460
not work well in your grow it probably

720
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,380
gets too tall too fast for your grow

721
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,120
environment so growing the right

722
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,500
genetics in the right environment with

723
00:25:06,119 --> 00:25:09,500
the right system will definitely help

724
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,000
you enhance the flavor and Aroma

725
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,619
genetics are very important some plants

726
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,779
just don't have a lot of flavor and

727
00:25:13,619 --> 00:25:17,639
Aroma maybe some plants have got the

728
00:25:15,779 --> 00:25:19,558
wrong flavor and are Aroma for you so

729
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,720
it's all about finding again the correct

730
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:24,240
genetics for to meet your goals they

731
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:26,460
meet your needs flavor and Aroma wise

732
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,319
and also grow well in your system you've

733
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,840
got to find that and then dial that in

734
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:32,819
and perfect that flavor so also another

735
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:35,459
thing that can definitely affect the

736
00:25:32,819 --> 00:25:37,558
flavor and Aroma of our plants is the

737
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:40,200
dry and cure process we can grow these

738
00:25:37,558 --> 00:25:42,599
plants perfectly for seven eight weeks

739
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:44,519
in veg nine or ten weeks in flour and

740
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,319
then once we cut them down we can really

741
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,538
destroy these plants I've seen a lot of

742
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:50,158
people mess up huge beautiful harvests

743
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:52,079
just by not drying and curing them

744
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,179
properly something else I should mention

745
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,158
is that there is not really One Magic

746
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:58,140
Bullet to making our cannabis perfect we

747
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,580
have to get everything right this is

748
00:25:58,140 --> 00:26:01,799
like a giant chess board and everything

749
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:03,778
on the chessboard has to be in place if

750
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,179
you want to get that Checkmate so don't

751
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:08,460
rely on just one bottle one product one

752
00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:10,740
trick one Silver Bullet to make our

753
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:12,480
product uh top shelf everything has to

754
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,740
be in line we need to start with the

755
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,240
right light if you don't have the right

756
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,880
light the right Spectrum the right

757
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,558
intensity the right duration then

758
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,260
nothing will work at all then we need

759
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:24,058
good air how is the VPD and the room is

760
00:26:22,259 --> 00:26:25,740
the temperature right is the humidity

761
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:28,200
right if it gets too hot in the room

762
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:30,359
guess what start volatizing terpenes if

763
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,100
it gets too dry guess what terpenes

764
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:34,139
start volatizing if it gets too wet

765
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,538
terpenes won't produce so we have to

766
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,120
keep everything in line from day one not

767
00:26:36,538 --> 00:26:41,460
just in flour from the veg phase we have

768
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,319
to get it started in veg and take top

769
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,298
shelf care of this plant all the way

770
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:47,700
through whatever you got like I said six

771
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:50,158
to eight weeks of veg 9 10 maybe 11

772
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,740
weeks of flour take perfect care of that

773
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,440
plant every single day every day matters

774
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,240
if you've got one day where the vpt VPD

775
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,340
got off just a little bit guess what

776
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,839
that will show in your end result it

777
00:26:59,339 --> 00:27:02,819
could have been one two maybe three

778
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:06,000
percent better not three percent more

779
00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:08,099
THC just overall a three percent better

780
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,079
product all right another thing to think

781
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:12,418
about is the environment in which you

782
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,158
are drying curing and storing this

783
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:16,200
product a lot of people are growing down

784
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,600
in a basement or in a shed or in a

785
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:20,580
garage or in a backyard if that room

786
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:22,798
stinks and smells funky when you hang up

787
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:24,240
your plants once all the moisture and

788
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:25,980
everything goes away from your plants

789
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,440
it's going to start absorbing that

790
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,659
stinky funky musty grandma's basement

791
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,340
sort of smell and that will be stuck in

792
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:34,260
your plants if you're drying in the tool

793
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,000
shed in the garage and it smells like

794
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,640
old lawn mowers or it smells like old

795
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,259
moldy house that will end up in the

796
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,299
flavor of your product so think about

797
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:44,759
where you're drying and curing it have

798
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:46,679
so a week or two weeks before it's even

799
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,480
time to harvest start planting your

800
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:50,400
drying and curing room have that ready

801
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,659
look how much product you've got think

802
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,580
about how much space you're going to

803
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:55,320
need to cure it dry it hang it up think

804
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:57,720
about how you're going to move the air

805
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:59,819
in that room keep the humidity and the

806
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,620
temperature proper in that room plan

807
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,720
that now because a lot of people like I

808
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,158
said a moment ago have destroyed crops

809
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,259
after the Harvest phase I've seen

810
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,760
commercial grows take down Giant

811
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:10,619
harvests and not know what to do with it

812
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:12,839
