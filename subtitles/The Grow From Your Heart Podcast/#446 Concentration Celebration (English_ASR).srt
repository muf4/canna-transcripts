dabbing on I've been doing some I've

26

27
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,288
event that we're gonna talk about dude

28
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,179
my lungs ah they were through the

29
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,829
marathon I've been taking it a little

30
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,780

31
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,609
we're gonna talk about this watermelon

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,530
gelato briefly today we're dabbing on

33
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,269
some watermelon gelato ambrosia from our

34
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,549
friends at apothecary farms the potency

35
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,188
label says sixty four point six percent

36
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,409
THC seventy six point seven percent

37
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:14,908
total cannabinoids I really liked the

38
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:18,000
watermelon gelato when you take a dab of

39
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:19,259
it this uh watermelon candy flavor coats

40
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,579
your mouth and then as you breathe

41
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,469
through your mouth a little bit as the

42
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,438
flavor dries out it turns into a sour

43
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:27,658
apple sort of a flavor so good when I

44
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:30,118
first hit it I was like huh I didn't

45
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:32,390
really get super high from that but then

46
00:01:30,118 --> 00:01:35,390
about three seconds later it was like oh

47
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:37,618
then about six seconds later was like oh

48
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:40,109
about 15 seconds later I was like oh

49
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:41,790
[ __ ] and then it just keeps going that

50
00:01:40,109 --> 00:01:42,989
just keeps happening for probably two or

51
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,479
three minutes you just get a little

52
00:01:42,989 --> 00:01:47,969
higher and higher and higher from it I'm

53
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:49,920
really loving the flavor the aroma and

54
00:01:47,969 --> 00:01:51,810

00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:15,689
um free water that was pretty epic for a

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,519
consumption event I when I saw that I

141
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:19,230
was like man they [ __ ] thought of

142
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,269
everything they really did try to think

143
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,860
of everything there was a from start to

144
00:05:21,269 --> 00:05:26,639
finish it was a smooth event there was

145
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:28,199
like no stubbed toes no bonked elbows no

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,389
hurt feelings that I saw it looked like

147
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,870
everything ran really smoothly I would

148
00:05:30,389 --> 00:05:33,240
agree with that

149
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:35,160
actually in my Instagram post thanking

150
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,600
Scotty for the event I said the party

151
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,610
went off without a hitch it went very

152
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,530
well it's a pretty smooth event yeah

153
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:46,350
usually it a like a sort of on the quiet

154
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:48,989
consumption event like there's a lot of

155
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:51,090
snags just because of how it's set up or

156
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,050
how it wasn't planned out as well as it

157
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,909
should have been and there was none of

158
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,949
that with the with the DGC keV it was

159
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,780
all smooth there were so many different

160
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,310
aspects of this event that there were so

161
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,549
many opportunities for things to go

162
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,310
wrong

163
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,810
something did kind of go wrong but

164
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:05,399
nobody even noticed because there were

165
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,139
so many good people involved in it that

166
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:08,579
it got overlooked and it got skipped

167
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,069
nobody even said hey what happened to

168
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:13,529
this we had an event planned we had a

169
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,579
speaker plan to do a presentation he was

170
00:06:13,529 --> 00:06:16,409
unable to make it because he had a

171
00:06:14,579 --> 00:06:17,789
family emergency I had know exactly what

172
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:19,290
happened and I completely think that

173
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,150
that was more important than this event

174
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:22,920
I'll take care of bombing but we covered

175
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:24,359
for him nobody even realized hey this

176
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,220
guy didn't do the talk he said he was

177
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,629
gonna do because we had so much fun and

178
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,070
made it such a good event that we all

179
00:06:27,629 --> 00:06:31,259
everybody was like oh wait that may have

180
00:06:29,069 --> 00:06:33,269
broken up the party anyway but the the

181
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:36,599
only snag I hit was parking and that's

182
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:38,909
sort of a key component to a successful

183
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,120
event is a lot of people attend and some

184
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,160
people who get their half hour

185
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,160
like I did have to truck it in for a

186
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,449
minute that part of my story for the

187
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,800
event was going to be the traffic

188
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:49,750
getting up there we live a hundred and

189
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:52,090
twenty inch miles from the event yeah

190
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,209
that's it was traffic was bad that day

191
00:06:52,089 --> 00:06:58,659
kind of everywhere but I mean I didn't

192
00:06:55,209 --> 00:07:00,459
that I know I'm just saying uh yeah part

193
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:02,139
of my story involves traffic I got a I

194
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:03,638
got a [ __ ] stress headache just from

195
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:06,280
the traffic from getting up there I was

196
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,019
a car and by the time I got there I was

197
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:09,789
ready to load in and get dad out and

198
00:07:08,019 --> 00:07:11,649
they made it super easy like there's a

199
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,600
table here's the torch have a good time

200
00:07:11,649 --> 00:07:15,459
I think it was super cool in there the

201
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,560
reason I was at labor because I got

202
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:19,478
caught in rained traffic and was a heavy

203
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,100
downpour right over top of the event

204
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:22,359
while I was trying to get to it and

205
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,460
that's the Rhino district you should

206
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,930
always expect shitty parking situations

207
00:07:24,459 --> 00:07:27,549
in the Rhino district I knew what I was

208
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,800
getting into when I got there and like

209
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,300
it wasn't even really it's like when I

210
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,069
pulled up and I saw that I immediately

211
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,379
had to park couple blocks away I thought

212
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,300
man like it already looks like a good

213
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:40,418
event pulling up all I see a lot of

214
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,530
people inside I could see kind of just

215
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:45,430
through one of the doors as I was

216
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:46,989
driving past and I was happy as soon as

217
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,788
I walked in i saw a bunch of people that

218
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:54,069
we knew and everybody was having a good

219
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:58,029
time there was what 20 different booths

220
00:07:54,069 --> 00:08:01,228
each with delicious hash friendly people

221
00:07:58,029 --> 00:08:04,449
and some decent swag was a good time

222
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:06,459
agree with all of that granny showed up

223
00:08:04,449 --> 00:08:07,810
we had davon granny hanging out that was

224
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,478
always a good time running into granny

225
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,829
we have so much fun together so ah oh

226
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,750
yeah yeah you always have fun with

227
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:15,819
granny no matter what she brings a party

228
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,889
she is a party in her own does she

229
00:08:15,819 --> 00:08:19,329
brings so I had my own booth set up I

230
00:08:17,889 --> 00:08:20,949
have my the brand new eye region etics

231
00:08:19,329 --> 00:08:23,288
booth I debuted that at the dude grows

232
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:26,050
event but I also set another table next

233
00:08:23,288 --> 00:08:27,310
to it for granny and grumpy grandpa and

234
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,370
it's a good thing that I did because

235
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,930
when she showed up she had boxes of raw

236
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,538
papers to give away she had deb and

237
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:36,729
granny hatpins

238
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:39,250
granny rolling trays if you could wear

239
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:40,719
it smoke it use it to consume wave it

240
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,418
around as a cannabis banner granny

241
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,670
probably had one with her to give to you

242
00:08:43,418 --> 00:08:47,350
and also give you a hug at the event she

243
00:08:45,669 --> 00:08:48,969
is a very generous lady she brings a lot

244
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,290
of good stuff she had pop sockets for

245
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:53,230
phones but I think I have a brand new

246
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:53,959
pocket for my phone yeah that she came

247
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,230
with all kinds of

248
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:59,000
[ __ ] yep hanging out with Scotty is

249
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,379
always a good time dude yeah yeah we

250
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,600
can't talk about granny without talking

251
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:04,340
about Scotty getting granny and Scotty

252
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,320
in the same area together taking dabs

253
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:08,690
with them is such a good time right it

254
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,040
was it was more like a big family

255
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,110
get-together than anything you know

256
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,049
that's kind of the way that I think

257
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:17,529
Scotty wanted it it was also aimed at

258
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:19,669
being an educational event and also a

259
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:22,129
concentrate competition we'll talk about

260
00:09:19,669 --> 00:09:24,349
that a little bit in the later part of

261
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:26,570
episode but he wanted it to be just a

262
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,700
more friendly family not like family but

263
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,930
like the kin of family sort of a tighter

264
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,120
event sort of like a family reunion

265
00:09:29,929 --> 00:09:33,739
instead of a big old blown-out weed Expo

266
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,169
because those get exhausting and

267
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,940
tiresome quickly yeah I feel like

268
00:09:36,169 --> 00:09:39,289
everybody at this event knew each other

269
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:41,270
half of the people that came up I've

270
00:09:39,289 --> 00:09:43,429
already met them and if I didn't I was

271
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:44,419
Facebook or Instagram or cannabis

272
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:46,759
friends with them shout out to our

273
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:48,709
friends on cannabis so I knew almost

274
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:51,230
everybody in there that was a lot of fun

275
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,360
so the drive was crazy getting there

276
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:54,920
getting set up was great like almost as

277
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,450
soon as I got set up and got comfortable

278
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:58,549
everybody started coming over and giving

279
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:00,440
me dabs and asking me questions about

280
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:02,569
seeds and buying shirts and saying

281
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,460
what's up oh then we started medicating

282
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,560
and dabbing out and that's when it got

283
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:08,900
super fun it's I didn't even have a

284
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:11,059
chair yet I've been there for 30 seconds

285
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,980

286
00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:15,319

absolutely

303
00:10:42,379 --> 00:10:46,399
but granny went over to the judging

304
00:10:44,539 --> 00:10:47,870
table where the concentrates were and

305
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,309
where they were being judged and Scotty

306
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,690
came over and gave me a clipboard and

307
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:52,699

308

00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:05,389
I finally got to go over to the judging

315
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:07,850
area for a few with granny and that was

316
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:10,278
a fun experience going over to that

317
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,440
judging table with granny I'm glad I

318
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:15,470
didn't try to judge you know there were

319
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,589
I think there were less than 20 complete

320
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,259
entries and halfway through that list I

321
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:23,000
would have been roasted I think I nailed

322
00:11:21,259 --> 00:11:26,300
I've got a list of winners here that

323
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,500
I'll read us there were a lot of people

324
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:30,318
that were roasted I was having a

325
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,850
conversation with Keith from Canon

326
00:11:30,318 --> 00:11:33,169
lights I think it's canon what's the

327
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,790
name of his light company [ __ ] I'm sorry

328
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,889
Keith I can't he makes cannons are one

329
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:37,730
of the LED lights that he makes sorry I

330
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:38,959

331
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,069
company right now brother but big shot

332
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,049
nothing but love and respect I was

333
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:43,490
talking to Keith and we both said

334
00:11:42,049 --> 00:11:45,828
something and looked at each other and I

335
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,600
think whatever one of us said he was

336
00:11:45,828 --> 00:11:49,189
basically like do you like ice in your

337
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,930
water and I was like Bacon's not my

338
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,800
friend and we looked at you like we're

339
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:53,838
[ __ ] and he goes

340
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,939
everybody is so high here it was just so

341
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,130
funny other conversations didn't we were

342
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,350
talking on two different frequencies it

343
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:02,360
was so funny I have this same girl she

344
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,980
came up through the at the start of the

345
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,360
event she was like hey do you know davon

346
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:06,589
granny I see you sit next to her I was

347
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,000
like yeah I know granny what's up she

348
00:12:06,589 --> 00:12:10,730
was can you introduce me I'd love to get

349
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,399
a picture I go sure and before we could

350
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,699
take eight steps she got distracted and

351
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:18,169
we had that exact same conversation

352
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:20,809
three times that's funny before I

353
00:12:18,169 --> 00:12:23,299
actually focus long enough to get a

354
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:26,838
picture with granny at the judging area

355
00:12:23,299 --> 00:12:28,068
so they had a little area so if you paid

356
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:30,319
a certain amount of money or if you were

357
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:33,049
a VIP guest you got a judge's pass and

358
00:12:30,318 --> 00:12:34,309
with that judges pass you could go you

359
00:12:33,049 --> 00:12:36,289
could go look at the concentrates

360
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:38,000
without that but you weren't really you

361
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:39,679
could take a dad nobody was gonna slap

362
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
you if you weren't a judge there was

363
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:42,739
enough to share but we wanted to make

364
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,159
sure that the judges also had abs first

365
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:48,379
so that we got the judging was over like

366
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,629
I went through it like maybe half the

367
00:12:48,379 --> 00:12:52,370
line over the course of the event just

368
00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:54,289
they were getting rid of everything oh

369
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,310
yeah they wanted it time got a daddy we

370
00:12:54,289 --> 00:13:00,679
don't need stuff left over up there for

371
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:03,528
the pro there was a pro category and a

372
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:06,679
home grower category I nailed the

373
00:13:03,528 --> 00:13:09,049
winners in the I think I did him in the

374
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:10,250
backwards order I said this number

375
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:11,419
should win first place this number

376
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,708
should win second place and this number

377
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:15,139
should win third place and I think I got

378
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:17,958
him the exact backwards order one of

379
00:13:15,139 --> 00:13:19,339
them they opened this products thing so

380
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,869
I should describe the dabbing area more

381
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:21,710
that's where I was you go to the dabbing

382
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,440
area they've got lie

383
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,060
a cultivated synergy has like a bar area

384
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,950
it's not a bar with alcohol looks like

385
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:29,359
the kitchen bar like the island and the

386
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:30,500
bar where everybody gathers around in

387
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,539
the bar when you're partying it's where

388
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,950
everybody hangs out on but not the

389
00:13:32,539 --> 00:13:35,689
drinking bar it's an island I guess is

390
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:38,030
what that is so there's an island in the

391
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,500
middle off to the one side there and all

392
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:41,000
the concentrates were on there that had

393
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,590
barstools around that if you choose to

394
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,940
sit on a barstool most of us were just

395
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,410
standing up you'd bring your rig over

396
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,870
there and your torch however you choose

397
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:49,159
to dab the concentrates were there you

398
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:50,330
could dab it however you were most

399
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:52,189
comfortable with that way you could get

400
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,110
a proper judging my favorite is this dab

401
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:56,150
rig this torch this carb cap I know that

402
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:58,340
real well I know what to expect from a

403
00:13:56,149 --> 00:14:01,429
dab with this setup so I took that over

404
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:03,200
there there were concentrates of

405
00:14:01,429 --> 00:14:05,000
different qualities and textures and

406
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,900
appearances and consistencies with a

407
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,700
number on them and I mainly waited until

408
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,259
I could see that numbers 1 2 &amp; 3 were

409
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:14,360
available so that I knew I could burn

410
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:15,980
through 1 2 &amp; 3 pretty quick and get 1 2

411
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,539
&amp; 3 down and then I waited till I saw 4

412
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,860
or 5 &amp; 6 so I can get some judging

413
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:21,649
figured out not have to search for all

414
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:23,149
the numbers there were a couple I didn't

415
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,250
dabble honestly I skipped a couple of

416
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:28,220
nope I already know that I don't need to

417
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,629
try that and a lot of people say that

418
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,910
looks can be deceiving when it comes to

419
00:14:29,629 --> 00:14:33,889
a concentrate their word I

420
00:14:31,909 --> 00:14:35,360
there was no deception I knew I didn't

421
00:14:33,889 --> 00:14:37,100
need to dab that to know that the others

422
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,930
in the lineup were already better I

423
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,009
think that appearance is part of the the

424
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:41,389
decision when you're shopping at a

425
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:43,819
dispensary when you're looking for a car

426
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,980
looks make a big decision I didn't want

427
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:47,090
those so I dabbed quite a few of them I

428
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:48,470
made some notes I went hung out with

429
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,690
Miss Amy made sure the booth was cool

430
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:52,430
came back did some more dabs for the pro

431
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,140
category I'm pretty sure I knew which

432
00:14:52,429 --> 00:14:56,089
three were going to win top three but I

433
00:14:54,139 --> 00:14:58,519
got number one and number three flipped

434
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:00,080
I was correct for number two which eye I

435
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:01,399
knew wouldn't win number one but I wish

436
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:05,420
it would have cuz we'll talk about why

437
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:07,610
in a little bit for the the home grower

438
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:10,159
category I think I nailed that one

439
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,419
exactly I think but I'm not sure who won

440
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,240
second place because I can't find the

441
00:15:11,419 --> 00:15:16,549
list online so when you look at my phone

442
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,740
here everybody was clapping nobody was

443
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:20,929
making notes I was way in the back

444
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:24,350
because I had the booth my booth was as

445
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:26,179
far away from the event microphone as I

446
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:28,850
could have been yeah it was totally far

447
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:30,859
away from that so let's talk about the

448
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,360
dude grows Pro division winners I'm

449
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:35,278
gonna start from the bottom here third

450
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:38,039
place was Kenny Jones from dad logic

451
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,740
second place I predicted this one would

452
00:15:38,039 --> 00:15:42,328
be in the top three this was one of my

453
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,068
favorites I was talking about this a

454
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:45,208
moment ago and I cut myself off I was

455
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:48,409
taking the dabs and I opened this one

456
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:50,638
jar and as soon as I opened it I went oh

457
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:53,188
it felt it smelled like home

458
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:56,250
it felt so familiar I was like I know

459
00:15:53,188 --> 00:15:57,778
this one and I took a dab out of it and

460
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:59,458
as soon as the dabber hit the

461
00:15:57,778 --> 00:15:59,938
concentrate I was like oh I know what

462
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,679
that is

463
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:03,208
like he just cracked open the aroma and

464
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,500
the aroma climbed up in my nose and my

465
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,938
mouth watered a little bit and I was

466
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,289
like oh I don't even need to dad this I

467
00:16:05,938 --> 00:16:08,039
already know what this is of course I

468
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:11,219
took the dad

469
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:12,750
number two was Clementine from our

470
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,879
friends at apothecary farms they won

471
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:16,769
second place that [ __ ] was delicious in

472
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:18,659
my opinion that should have been number

473
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:21,028
one but I think consistency and

474
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:23,338
appearance are a lot of what made the

475
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:27,120
number one winner number one number one

476
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:31,589
was mimosa from Nomad extracts it tasted

477
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,850
that again the Clementine is there yeah

478
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:34,620
there booth was really they were right

479
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,230
next to us there booth was packed and it

480
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,850
was really nice I think the main

481
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,659
difference between the Clementine and

482
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,278
that mimosa

483
00:16:39,659 --> 00:16:44,188
they both had that orange candy flavor

484
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,688
the Clementine is a batter and it looks

485
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:47,370
messy in the container

486
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:49,409
especially after multiple people have

487
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,328
dabbed out of it that mimosa was

488
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:53,429
beautiful diamonds and sauce it was such

489
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:54,479
a nice mixture and the diamonds were

490
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,188
just the right size

491
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,899
I feel if apothecary would have entered

492
00:16:56,188 --> 00:16:59,129
something a little chunkier they would

493
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,230
have had a better chance if they

494
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:02,639
would've entered clementine ambrosia it

495
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,828
probably could have taken it I'm glad

496
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,709
they are better though like batter's

497
00:17:04,828 --> 00:17:10,678
does it took second despite it did and I

498
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:12,600
it's it's that good I've got a jar that

499
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,309
I'm bad or sitting here on the table so

500
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,838
that's why it felt like it was home I've

501
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:18,088
been smoking a lot of bad stuff but

502
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,220
diamonds and sauce you take 15 dabs out

503
00:17:18,088 --> 00:17:21,750
of a jar diamonds and sauce you just got

504
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,669
diamonds and sauce exactly the same

505
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:26,640
thing was batter and it it's like the

506
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:27,870
the little burnt parts left over when

507
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,250
you're making pancakes you know what I

508
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:32,129
mean it looks like a baby food jar that

509
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:33,359
you let your baby eat out of yes I no

510
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:35,460
offense to that batter that's just what

511
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,699
happens to it so just to recap third

512
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:40,769
place cami Jones second place what was

513
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:42,419
it Jimmy Johnson Jabba logic second

514
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,730
place come in time from apothecary first

515
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:46,110
place mimosa from Nomad extracts big

516
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,860
shout out to everybody that one in the

517
00:17:46,109 --> 00:17:51,409
the what is it pro division

518
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:53,509
everything all the boots that were set

519
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:55,009
up all of those were everything I tried

520
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:57,440
from a booth was pretty nice so that was

521
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:59,179
acceptable I had two different booths

522
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,690
had rosin that I really liked and I

523
00:17:59,179 --> 00:18:04,759
don't like rosin one of the one of the

524
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:06,650
one of my favorites that I was voting

525
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:08,390
for would probably have been a rose and

526
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:10,070
if I got to pick my top five favorite I

527
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,009
think one of them was rosin it was gassy

528
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:14,990
and kind of Kimmy flavored in thee so

529
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:16,879
let's talk about the home grower area I

530
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:18,740
don't have the list because I can't find

531
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,169
it post it on any social media anywhere

532
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,429
I do know that number three I don't know

533
00:18:21,169 --> 00:18:23,780
the person's name I can't think of it

534
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:25,190
off the top of my head I met the kid

535
00:18:23,779 --> 00:18:27,259
he's a great person he's a good grower

536
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,308
super enthusiastic he's one of those

537
00:18:27,259 --> 00:18:30,140
young dudes it's like what's up bro

538
00:18:28,308 --> 00:18:31,789
check out what I grew what I entered he

539
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:33,380
entered I've got a nice little portion

540
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:35,089
of it I'm pointing over there like Mike

541
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,710
can see where it is yeah there's some

542
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:39,529
golden ghosts shatter over there

543
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,900
that golden goat was very beautiful that

544
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:43,308
one third place it tastes good I took a

545
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,809
big fat I knew what that was when I

546
00:18:43,308 --> 00:18:47,359
unfolded the parchment I was a classic

547
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:49,548
golden go I took a big fat dab of that

548
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:51,139
one it tasted so golden goat he did a

549
00:18:49,548 --> 00:18:53,150
really perfect job on that one and

550
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,410
shattered that later it shattered bro

551
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:55,429
and I would smoke it right now if you

552
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,169
put some of it in front of me I would

553
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:58,548
smoke that shatter and I don't smoke a

554
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:01,370
lot of chatter so third place was

555
00:18:58,548 --> 00:19:03,200
shatter second place I apologize I don't

556
00:19:01,369 --> 00:19:05,928
remember don't know don't recall who

557
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,279
that was somebody will post a comment on

558
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:08,840
the YouTube channel somebody will tell

559
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,569
us whose second place was and then I'll

560
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:14,329
give you an update on the next episode

561
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:15,558
first place was dialed in terpenes if

562
00:19:14,329 --> 00:19:17,389
you guys have been watching the dude

563
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:19,308
grows show podcast

564
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:21,980
dialed in terpenes was recently on that

565
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:23,509
show he was walking around the event

566
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,759
with much confidence and there was a

567
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:27,470
reason why because his product crushed

568
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,929
it he took first place he's got a dude

569
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:31,460
gross concentration cut bell so big

570
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:33,290
shout-out to everybody I apologize again

571
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,400
for not having the top three I think

572
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:36,079
that's like one real piece of

573
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,610
constructive criticism we could put out

574
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,019
there for the event is afterwards

575
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:41,959
through a better job post in the winter

576
00:19:39,019 --> 00:19:44,629
yeah stream it live also would have been

577
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:46,789
another thing but dude um there were so

578
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,900
many dad's taken and so much cannabis

579
00:19:46,789 --> 00:19:53,899
consumed that we're lucky we remember to

580
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:56,630
do the award ceremony because people

581
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,910

582
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:00,770
stony event I'm looking at the dude

583
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:02,900

584
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:05,329
Instagram right now so that we can see

585
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,950
yeah they haven't posted any updates yet

586
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,289
so that would be my advice to them all

587
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,490
we ask for is some winners posted to

588

get out for several hours I mean it's

705
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,638
not easy when there's a two-hour drive

706

shortest person there and you're pretty

739
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:19,089

00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,019
[ __ ] greatest gift so thank you

811
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,240
brother I hope you hear this big shout

812
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:42,869
out from one deadhead to another hey now

813
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:46,680
I appreciate that but that cultivated

814
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:51,599
synergy that's honestly if the if the

815
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:53,400
event gets 30% more popular 30% more

816
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:56,730
attendance it's not gonna fit

817
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:58,290
I think the max capacity with the part

818
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,730
there's more of the venue we can open

819
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:01,079
okay we didn't open the whole place

820
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,329
there are parts that were sealed off

821
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:04,859
this engravable space yeah we if you can

822
00:28:03,329 --> 00:28:06,869
pay for more of the building we didn't

823
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:08,819
pay for more of it apparently which was

824
00:28:06,869 --> 00:28:11,429
fine we wanted to keep it right around

825
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:13,679
where we did I think that section of the

826
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:15,690
building I think there were 300

827
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:17,820
approximately in that area it can hold

828
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:19,680
350 before we have to open more of the

829
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:21,659
building so when it was it was

830
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:24,060
comfortable - it wasn't overcrowded it

831
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,800
wasn't hot there was space to move

832
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:27,509
around there was space to set your stuff

833
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,460
down for a minute and sit down and drink

834
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:32,160
some water

835
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:35,490
it's setup it kind of looks like it'd be

836
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:38,190
a spot for like an obnoxious corporate

837
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:40,920
meeting there's a kitchen there where

838
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:42,870
you could like legit make a full meal

839
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:46,350
all the the kitchen implements were

840
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:48,149
there to use a dishwasher fridge the

841
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:51,449
whole getup there's like a living room

842
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:53,790
space with a bunch of comfy chairs and

843
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:56,009
couches and some tables and then there

844
00:28:53,789 --> 00:28:57,029
was like just open space with a nice

845
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:59,049
floor for all the

846
00:28:57,029 --> 00:29:00,789
really nice spot for this we should

847
00:28:59,049 --> 00:29:03,159
mention that gorgeous artwork on the

848
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:04,779
walls as well beautiful artwork well

849
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,009
well-maintained artwork one thing I was

850
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:08,289
gonna say when you said they could host

851
00:29:06,009 --> 00:29:10,509
boring obnoxious meetings there they do

852
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:12,129
that that place holds events like a

853
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:13,990
couple of weeks ago maybe a week ago

854
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:15,520
knows two weeks ago they had the home

855
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:18,039
draw risk up which was the same type of

856
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,809
event like we had then the weekend after

857
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:21,539
that it was the Colorado Department of

858
00:29:19,809 --> 00:29:24,669
Agriculture and meed

859
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:26,680
sort of a symposium of some sort where

860
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,000
there was absolutely no consumption

861
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,830
that's where the suits and all the tied

862
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,150
folks were hanging out and then the next

863
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:33,399
week they've got has been assumed

864
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,860
innocent right well that's also they do

865
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,330
budtender nights there they do industry

866
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:38,709
night there they'll do a Scentsy night

867
00:29:37,329 --> 00:29:41,139
there quite often so it's a really cool

868
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,630
place a really really nice space there's

869
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:46,120

870
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:48,130
venue yet there's a young lady there

871
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,929

872
