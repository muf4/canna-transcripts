a fat bong rip however you like to

46
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:18,629
consume your cannabis I hope you were

47
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:20,159
doing it

48
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:21,629
it's kind of weird without the cannabis

49
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,219
cup here in Denver this year everybody

50
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,389
spread out I don't know where the party

51
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:26,310
is I don't know where everybody's going

52
00:02:24,389 --> 00:02:28,139
to be but I know where I am going to be

53
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:29,400
that's right I will be at the secret

54
00:02:28,139 --> 00:02:30,929
stash if you want to learn more about

55
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,810
the secret stash hosted by my friend

56
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,519
Adam Hill I also heard a rumor DJ jokey

57
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,349
would be deejaying the event make sure

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,719
you check out secret stash Colorado on

59
00:02:37,349 --> 00:02:42,030
Instagram I cannot do anything to get

60
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,919
you tickets I was lucky enough to get

61
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,259
myself one ticket because of course I am

62
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:48,509
family I've got one for myself that's

63
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:50,539
all I've got I apologize I cannot help

64
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:53,099
you get in I can't do anything for you

65
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,719
figure out how to find their Instagram

66
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:57,449
and then there are instructions on their

67
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,159
Instagram on how to try to get yourself

68
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:01,500
into the event by the time this airs it

69
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:03,419
may be full so good luck hope to see it

70
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,729
there I want to talk about something

71
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:07,979
that I saw on the Cannabis just recently

72
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:11,219
this is a little bit related to the

73
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:12,539
cannabis cup not being here in Denver it

74
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:14,189
looks like a lot of people kind of back

75
00:03:12,539 --> 00:03:16,108
down on coming to Colorado without the

76
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:18,150
giant canvas Cup but I'm going to read

77
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:19,859
an article from the cannabis but the

78
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,049
headline goes like this Cypress Hills

79
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,530
cannabis cup concert just moved to a

80
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:26,840
much smaller venue

81
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,699
the sub-headline says I think that's

82
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,680
called the byline that says fewer people

83
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:33,318
will be getting insane in the brain for

84
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,120
4:20 this week then this article is by

85
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:37,189
Ricardo Baca of course from the cannabis

86
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,020
stand it says and the hits to the

87
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:40,699
cannabis cup in Colorado keep coming

88
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,800
first the US cannabis cup got booted

89
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,000
from its Denver adjacent home then it's

90
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,890
planned to stage a cup in southern

91
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,479
Colorado fell apart then High Times

92
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:49,729
magazines largest event moved from

93
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,789
Colorado for a greener more lenient home

94
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:55,340
in Southern California and now the cups

95
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:57,199
alone Colorado event high time sponsored

96
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:59,479
concert with Cypress Hill George Clinton

97
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,429
and others was a cannabis cup award show

98
00:03:59,479 --> 00:04:03,679
tagged on is moving to a much smaller

99
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:06,680
venue less than a week before Showtime

100
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,989
and even with excuse me let me try that

101
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,580
sense again and even with the move to

102
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,939
the smaller venue tickets are still

103
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,830
available instead of playing the 6500

104
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,988
capacity first Bank Center in Broomfield

105
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,478
the Cypress Hill concert and High Times

106
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:22,728
award show is moving to the 1,700

107
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,009
capacity Ogden Theatre in Denver

108
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:26,629
according to promoter AEG Live all

109
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:28,610
tickets for the first Bank Center are

110
00:04:26,629 --> 00:04:30,949
good for the Ogden and a limited number

111
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,860
of tickets remain and are on sale now

112
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:36,289
according to a media release the tickets

113
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:38,600

Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic Action

115
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,770
Bronson and chronics you guys you've

116
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,538
heard chronics on this podcast I might

117
00:04:42,769 --> 00:04:46,038
write it down to end of the show with

118
00:04:44,538 --> 00:04:46,788
chronics I'm gonna put a little note on

119
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,288
myself there we go

120
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,490
I'll probably in the podcast with

121
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,189
chronics it's well my favorite rate

122
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,530
reggae artists tronics with two x's at

123
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:57,139
the end make sure you check that out

124
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:58,429
great artists I wasn't gonna go to this

125
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,959
show you guys because it was at the

126
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:02,269
First Bank Center it's kind of a big

127
00:04:59,959 --> 00:05:03,529
event it's kind of a big venue unless

128
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,939
you're up in the front and those big

129
00:05:03,529 --> 00:05:06,649
venues it's just a party and you don't

130
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:09,439
even really get to see the concert the

131
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:11,329
artist I want to see is the least known

132
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,490
artist on the bill so he's going to play

133
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:16,159
first he'll probably get like 30 minutes

134
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,889
to play but in a small venue like that

135
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,450
it might be worth it for me to go when

136
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,829
you're 65 and you got dreadlocks down to

137
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:23,029
your ass and a reggae band starts

138
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:24,379
playing and you know all the words and

139
00:05:23,029 --> 00:05:26,059
you walk from the front people move the

140
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:28,009
[ __ ] out of your way so I just go right

141
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,959
up front checkout chronics and then I'd

142
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:31,219
be gone by the time I might check out

143
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:33,589
Action Bronson in Parliament Funkadelic

144
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,240
be fun but the ID stick around and see

145
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:36,319
the rest of it if I paid 65 for a ticket

146
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,689
but I just want to go see chronic see

147
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,939
guys it'd be a great time in that little

148
00:05:37,689 --> 00:05:42,159
club I'm gonna continue with this

149
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:44,619
article here it says so why didn't the

150
00:05:42,158 --> 00:05:46,298
event sell surely the lack of a company

151
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:47,979
cannabis cup Expo didn't help ticket

152
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:49,988
sales and with Snoop Dogg playing

153
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:52,959
fillers dream Wiz Khalifa and Lil Wayne

154
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:54,609
playing the 4/20 rally and Method Man

155
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,278
and Redman playing Red Rocks all in the

156
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,979
same week competition is no doubt fierce

157
00:05:57,278 --> 00:06:02,558
is this venue downsizing indicative of

158
00:05:59,978 --> 00:06:04,868
the 4/20 to come it's too early to say

159
00:06:02,559 --> 00:06:07,509
but Colorado will surely see fewer

160
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:10,599
cannabis tourists this 4/20 because of

161
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:11,979
the cups move West that is absolutely

162
00:06:10,598 --> 00:06:13,658
true a lot of my friends that normally

163
00:06:11,978 --> 00:06:15,368
would come out to Colorado for the 4/20

164
00:06:13,658 --> 00:06:17,949
weekend from California from Oregon from

165
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:19,329
Washington from Michigan from all over

166
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:21,278
the damn place from North Carolina

167
00:06:19,329 --> 00:06:22,749
they're not coming out because there's

168
00:06:21,278 --> 00:06:24,158
no cannabis cup this year there are a

169
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:27,189
lot of vendors that I'd like to hang out

170
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:28,658
with that probably I will not see this

171
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:30,550
year because we usually bump into each

172
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:32,800
other either at the Cannabis Cup or age

173
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,478
so unless they're at age in the winter

174
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,088
or the fall time I will not see them

175
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:40,658

educated everybody that shows up at all

178
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,038
the events there's one group in my head

179
00:06:43,809 --> 00:06:47,379
that I'm thinking of that I cannot think

180
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:49,238
of Johnny being the no GU crew how did I

181
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,709

183
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:54,429

184

185
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:58,208
to see you Happ can't Jules

186
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:59,948
all kinds of folks that I'm not gonna

187
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:02,588
get to see because there's no cannabis

188
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:04,239
cup it kind of sucks uh I feel like I'm

189
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,439
just ranting and screaming about not

190
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:06,878
getting a cannabis cup I feel like a

191
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,679
little [ __ ] suddenly oh quit whining

192
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,789
about that of this culture you guys it

193
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,859
sounds like a lot of fun they've moved

194
00:07:09,788 --> 00:07:13,209
it to this small venue but they did put

195
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,369
out a press release and it says you

196
00:07:13,209 --> 00:07:17,800
cannot medicate in this facility so

197
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:19,389
there will be no ganja smoking that's

198
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,489
what they say they always say that kind

199
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:23,110
of [ __ ] at these events but this video

200
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:25,448
is tiny and they can see you from all

201
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:26,800
angles so I don't know what they're

202
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,749
gonna do if one person starts puffing

203
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,038
and then two people start and then the

204
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:32,289
whole place is smoking they can't kick

205
00:07:30,038 --> 00:07:33,519
everybody out but at the same time you

206
00:07:32,288 --> 00:07:35,228
never know what they're gonna try to do

207
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,278
they're gonna say no smoking they'll

208
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,558
probably just let you do in there anyway

209
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:40,088
oh sorry I'm burping the wall I'm

210
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:42,969
recording a podcast shout out to Dr

211
00:07:40,088 --> 00:07:45,368

212
00:07:42,968 --> 00:07:46,959
all right you guys that was my my news

213
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:48,309
article I'm not gonna read any more news

214
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:49,300
in this episode I'll go ahead and close

215
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:51,640
that web browser

216
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:55,060
and we will go ahead and focus on some

217
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:57,990
emails I did an episode about listener

218
00:07:55,060 --> 00:08:00,280
emails and that spawned more emails

219
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:01,870
somebody sent me a message about a

220
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:03,939
probiotic I mentioned that I like to

221
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:05,649
consume probiotics I like kombucha and

222
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,600
fermented products I think they're good

223
00:08:05,649 --> 00:08:09,129
for digestion I have some stomach

224
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,689
problems which is part of why I have a

225
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:13,000
medical marijuana recommendation it'll

226
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:14,259
talk a lot about that I don't think

227
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,389
anybody really wants to hear about my

228
00:08:14,259 --> 00:08:17,709
medical conditions but my stomach is

229
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,269
messed up it's wrecked I like to take

230
00:08:17,709 --> 00:08:20,649
probiotics it makes me feel like my food

231
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:22,930
digests better it makes me feel like my

232
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:24,429
body's better I think your gut health

233
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,810
has a lot to do with your mental health

234
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,939
and your physical health so it all

235
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,709
starts in the gut so probiotics and good

236
00:08:27,939 --> 00:08:32,110
food one of our listeners sent me an

237
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:33,970
email asking about a specific probiotic

238
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:36,070
and to tell you the truth I lost the

239
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:39,279
message I cannot find where that message

240
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,440
came in I can't find it on the Facebook

241
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,169
pages the Instagram I can't find it in

242
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,550
any of my emails you asked if I had

243
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:47,110
heard about a product or if I am

244
00:08:45,549 --> 00:08:49,269
familiar with the product honestly I've

245
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,159
never heard that product I intended to

246
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:52,629
save the message you sent and go and

247
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:53,829
research that product and tell you what

248
00:08:52,629 --> 00:08:54,820
I thought about it but honestly I don't

249
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:58,120
know what happened to the damn message

250
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,610
so if you sent me that message let's do

251
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,200
this easier send me it again on an email

252
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:05,379
I grow from your heart at hotmail.com

253
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,120
that way I'll find it and I will read

254
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,009
your email again and I will research

255
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,379
that product and I do apologize for

256
00:09:09,009 --> 00:09:13,149
losing the damn email I drove me crazy I

257
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:14,590
spent about two hours just searching for

258
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,480
that email seriously not all at one time

259
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,860
but I put about two hours into looking

260
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,600
for that thing probably and I can't find

261
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,750
the message so I apologize send it again

262
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,360
I will answer all right our next email

263
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:27,700
comes from I'm opening the message right

264
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,960
now this message came from a friend of

265
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,950
ours I'm not sure if he wants me to say

266
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,300
his name so I'm not gonna but it says

267
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:36,009
the show and I gotta say I'm a huge fan

268
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:37,359
I'm very thankful for the wealth of

269
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:39,220
information you provided all the

270
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,480
knowledgeable guests you bring on I am

271
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,769
listening from another state at the

272
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,269
moment but have plans on moving to

273
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:46,059
Colorado soon to get involved in the

274
00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:48,309
industry any way I can I listen to the

275
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:49,689
episode about the meed badges and I just

276
00:09:48,309 --> 00:09:51,849
had a few more questions if you have

277
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,130
your med badge does that mean you can go

278
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:56,200
into a medical dispensary as a customer

279
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,909
to buy products as well or is that a

280
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,860
different car I hope that makes sense

281
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:01,269
but think again thanks again for

282
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,379
everything and I look forward to meeting

283
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,230
you one

284
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:07,299
day I look forward to meeting you too I

285
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,070
hope you get to take some fat dabs hope

286
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:10,959
we smoke some flowers together I would

287
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:12,879
like to see what kind of flowers you are

288
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,200
getting in your location and I'll show

289
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,330
you what kind of flowers we've got here

290
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,400
and we can smoke down together you're a

291
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:19,750
new listener I encourage you to go back

292
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,029
and listen to a few of the older

293
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,490
episodes if you're a new listener listen

294
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:26,620
to I think it's fifty fifty five and

295
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:28,570
there's an episode about scheduling your

296
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:29,919
growth scheduling a perpetual crow

297
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,170
there's episodes about building your

298
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,059
garden I strongly recommend listening to

299
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:37,089
some of those more educational in-depth

300
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:38,529
informative episodes um what else did

301
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,610
you say here you're very thankful well

302
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:41,350
you're very welcome

303
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:45,970
definitely very welcome your main

304
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:48,250
question is the meed badge it doesn't

305
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,230
work like a colorado red card or a

306
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,700
medical marijuana recommendation the red

307
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:55,000
cards are now purple which is a drastic

308
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,490
change anyway no the main answer is no

309
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,259
the Colorado meed badge does not work

310
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,539
the same as your Colorado Medical

311
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:03,759
Marijuana recommendation you cannot shop

312
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:05,649
in a medical marijuana facility just

313
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:09,069
because your badge it does not work like

314
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,899
that um your badge we'll get you some

315
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:12,700
discounts and other dispensaries if you

316
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:15,069
shop at a dispensary it also gets you

317
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,900
into some of the smoke lounges for free

318
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,760
I know that if I wear my badge to the

319
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:20,559
can of canyon Camile does not charge me

320
00:11:18,759 --> 00:11:21,939
to get in Camille has never charged me

321
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,259
no one's ever charged me to get into the

322
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,210
candy candy because they do advertising

323
00:11:23,259 --> 00:11:27,759
and I show love to the community but if

324
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,320
you have an Emmy D badge they will not

325
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,029
charge you to get into the candy canyon

326
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,800
is one of those people would pay $5 at

327
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:34,449
the door so there are some perks of

328
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,609
having the badge just some industry

329
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,590
perks and friendly things that come but

330
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:40,360
it does not work as a medical marijuana

331
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,980
recommendation

332
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:43,419
to get a medical marijuana

333
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,009
recommendation to get into a medical

334
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:47,319
marijuana facility you do need to see a

335
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:50,439
doctor there's no doctor involved in the

336
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:52,390
meed paperwork and questionnaire so I

337
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,620
hope that answers your question one

338
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,019
thing I will mention if you do have a

339
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:59,379
Colorado medical marijuana card you can

340
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:01,269
use that card in Las Vegas in the state

341
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:03,399
of Nevada Nevada has medical marijuana

342
00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:05,078
and they do a reciprocal program where

343
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:06,789
other states cards work there so if

344
00:12:05,078 --> 00:12:08,109
you're a tourist and you are in Las

345
00:12:06,789 --> 00:12:10,149
Vegas or if you're in the state of

346
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:11,680
Nevada before you go to the bunny ranch

347
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:14,379
you can stop and grab yourself some

348
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:16,120
ganja so big up to Nevada for being a

349
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:17,980
reciprocating state on the medical

350
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,350
marijuana recommendation cards that is

351
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,149
super cool so I hope that answered your

352
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,040
question I appreciate the email please

353
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:27,549
send me more questions I do appreciate

354
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:29,949
the listener interaction alright I got

355
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:31,929
another email this is a Facebook message

356
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:35,170
from a friend of ours and he asked me

357
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:37,328
basically what stops people or is it

358
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:39,610
possible for somebody to buy a package

359
00:12:37,328 --> 00:12:41,859
of seeds and grow some plants out of it

360
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,079
and then call those plants something

361
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,879
else and then enter cannabis cups or

362
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:47,649
other competitions with something that

363
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:48,820
they claim is something babe rad but is

364
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:51,399
actually something that they have

365
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:53,440
purchased from a seed bank or they got a

366
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:55,419
clone from somebody and the answer to

367
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,779
that is nothing is stopping that other

368
00:12:55,419 --> 00:13:01,629
than our community and people's morals

369
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:03,429
but honestly if I sold you seeds of any

370
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:04,990
strain that I bred you could take them

371
00:13:03,429 --> 00:13:06,819
home you could grow them you could find

372
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,320
the keeper you could wait three or four

373
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,820
months until everybody forgot that you

374
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,290
had that and you could say hey look what

375
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,660
I created you could name it your

376
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:14,919
whatever I've got Arrowhead water

377
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:16,269
bottles in front of me so I'm gonna see

378
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,099
you could see you bread your Arrowhead

379
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:19,448
and you can call it this Arrowhead and

380
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,759
you could enter it into cannabis cups

381
00:13:19,448 --> 00:13:24,639
and you're gonna fool a lot of people

382
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,559
but you won't fool the people that are

383
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,299
really into the industry that know what

384
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,278
strain is what strain there are guys

385
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:31,599
when we go to cannabis cups you can

386
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:33,159
smoke a flower

387
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
somebody will pass you a joint and a lot

388
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,490
of these guys will say oh is that

389
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,649
Aaron's og cush that he grew over there

390
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:40,570
at the clinic and people know what these

391
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:42,519
flowers taste like look like smell like

392
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:44,170
we're catching on all the stuff that

393
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:47,679
stands out there are very few things

394
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:49,479
that stand out enough to be Cup winners

395
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:50,979
and so when we smoke these things we

396
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,289
notice them we remember the flavor

397
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,459
remember the high then we smoked it

398
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:55,659
again it's famille

399
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:57,669
so if you try to pass it off as

400
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,480
something else somebody in the circle is

401
00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:01,448
gonna notice

402
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,949
but honestly 90% of the people in the

403
00:14:01,448 --> 00:14:05,198
world would be full they will believe

404
00:14:02,948 --> 00:14:07,179
you but the only thing stopping you from

405
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,729
doing it is having some morals and not

406
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:11,679
being a cannabis dick I don't remember

407
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:14,649
the year exactly but I do remember that

408
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:17,138
several years back there was a person

409
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:18,399
who bought a bunch of cannabis I don't

410
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:20,528
remember where he purchased the cannabis

411
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,539
I think he bought it from a coffee shop

412
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:24,639
in Amsterdam or from a grower in

413
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:26,828
Amsterdam in Holland and he entered it

414
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,889
into the cannabis cup in Amsterdam the

415
00:14:26,828 --> 00:14:32,500
original cannabis cup and he walked

416
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:34,688
around and persuaded people at the cup

417
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,278
to vote for him as the best they kind of

418
00:14:34,688 --> 00:14:38,198
bought votes from people it wasn't a

419
00:14:36,278 --> 00:14:40,958
legitimately one cannabis cup but these

420
00:14:38,198 --> 00:14:43,568
guys want a cup they kind of stole a cup

421
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,549
from DNA genetics by buying another

422
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:47,139
professional growers flowers and putting

423
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:49,419
their name on it and marketing it as

424
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:51,068
their name to create their new seed

425
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:54,159
company to make hype on their seed

426
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:55,628
company but a lot of the people most of

427
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,039
the folks in Amsterdam knew what it was

428
00:14:55,629 --> 00:14:58,899
the people that were voting for them

429
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:00,698
were mostly tourists and people that

430
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,799
were not really familiar with the weed

431
00:15:00,698 --> 00:15:04,328
game so all the people they all the

432
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,740
local Amsterdam had smoked it and they

433
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:07,539
were like hey this is whatever's haze

434
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,009
they knew whose haze it was they knew

435
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:11,289
exactly but these guys called it

436
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:12,669
ouki kabuki and they [ __ ] won account

437
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:15,578
of this Cup by stealing a strain

438
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:17,318
renaming it and entering it into the cup

439
00:15:15,578 --> 00:15:19,059
and then persuading other people to vote

440
00:15:17,318 --> 00:15:21,219
for it by kind of buying votes by giving

441
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:23,469
them weed by talking to them by kissing

442
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:25,449
their asses there's actually kind of a

443
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,769

453
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,539
culminated in the 20th cannabis cup

454
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,549
where big apple seeds from Brooklyn New

455
00:15:46,539 --> 00:15:50,649
York want a blind taste test against DNA

456
00:15:48,549 --> 00:15:52,659
seeds that was judged by Robert

457
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,000
O'Connell Clark it was later revealed in

458
00:15:52,659 --> 00:15:56,799
high times at dock and Dom the owners of

459
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,289
big apple seeds were actors and their

460
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,448
entry ouki kabuki was actually Neville's

461
00:15:59,289 --> 00:16:05,528
Hays purchased in Amsterdam from a pot

462
00:16:01,448 --> 00:16:08,259
broker with a good nose for good weed so

463
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:10,870
that was posted up on icy mag from a

464
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:12,399
poster calls himself Saluki he looks

465
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:14,919
like he's well known on this place here

466
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,149
so I shout out just read part of your

467
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:17,409
post you don't even know who I am I

468
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:19,179
don't know who you are but you just got

469
00:16:17,409 --> 00:16:21,039
a shout out so that is the legend of

470
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,359
houki kabuki and how that went there are

471
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,500
a lot of rumors on how that went down

472
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,699
that's just what I found on this one

473
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,889
form kind of brings back a lot of

474
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:28,689
memories so the original question was

475
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:31,120
can somebody steal a strain and rename

476
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,829
it yes they absolutely can in this

477
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,509
example these people didn't even grow it

478
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:35,919
they bought it and then entered it into

479
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:37,360
the cannabis cup and it was Neville's

480
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,469
haze which is always gonna win that's

481
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,959
one of the best strains on the planet

482

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,829
Sunday 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. they are

492
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,129
currently only a medical cannabis

493
00:17:02,828 --> 00:17:07,838
facility in the future they will have a

494
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,730
recreational side of the building so we

495
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,789
will be able to serve I read genetics

496
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:14,679
products to the entire recreational

497
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:15,789
market that is coming soon stay tuned

498
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:17,500
for that so big shout out to our friends

499
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:21,279

500
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,740
their Instagram it is nugs dot 303 shout

501
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,599
out to the grimy Gatsby alright let's

502
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,910
get on with the show I've got another

503
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:30,819
email from a listener this one is a

504
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:33,130
question about seed pack labeling and

505
00:17:30,819 --> 00:17:35,109
flowering times and when you're looking

506
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,270
at seed packs online you look at a

507
00:17:35,109 --> 00:17:40,479
package and it will say flowering time

508
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:40,960
usually 56 to 63 days is what most

509
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,349
package

510
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,308
they'll say symbols say 60 to 70 days

511
00:17:43,349 --> 00:17:47,439
hopefully they're writing the truth on

512
00:17:45,308 --> 00:17:49,538
there but usually it's 8 to 9 weeks and

513
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,259
I'll indicate that by the number of days

514
00:17:49,538 --> 00:17:55,058
now what that number is is the flowering

515
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:56,679
time unless you've got Auto flowering

516
00:17:55,058 --> 00:17:58,690
plants if you've got Auto flower plants

517
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:02,140
this does not apply but if you've got

518
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:05,019
regular photo period plants this is what

519
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,090
that number means when a breeder labels

520
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:09,940
his package of seeds and it says that

521
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:13,269
this plant takes whatever 8 to 9 weeks

522
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,830
or 56 to 63 days to finish that is the

523
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:17,048
flowering time that's how long that

524
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:19,538
plant is going to take to reach full

525
00:18:17,048 --> 00:18:22,450
maturity from the time you initiate the

526
00:18:19,538 --> 00:18:24,669
flowering period and that is when the

527
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:27,038
vary from the very first day you turn

528
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:29,980
the that timer to 1212 when the lights

529
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:33,609
go from 12 hours on to 12 hours off that

530
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,259
is now day 1 of that phase that 9 week

531
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:37,449
period that's written on the package has

532
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:40,000
nothing to do with your veg cycle you

533
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:41,649
can veg those plants you can sprout them

534
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,450
as seedlings you can get them like 2

535
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:45,759
inches tall and then you can flower them

536
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:48,880
if you want to so that could be 20 days

537
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,798
or you can sprout them you can veg them

538
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,299
for 12 weeks and take a million clones

539
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,619
and then flower I don't know what you're

540
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,509
gonna do with the plants the breeder

541
00:18:53,619 --> 00:18:56,469
doesn't know either you're the only one

542
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,679
that knows what you're gonna do with

543
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,200
that

544
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,360
so the veg time is as long as you want

545
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,278
it to be okay the flowering time is what

546
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,709
is indicated on the package and it

547
00:19:03,278 --> 00:19:08,470
begins the day you turn those lights to

548
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:11,079
1212 so if that breeder Pak says that

549
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,909
their plants are going to take 56 to 63

550
00:19:11,079 --> 00:19:15,519
days I usually recommend going the full

551
00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:17,200
63 days unless it's completely obvious

552
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,849
that that plant is going to be done

553
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,409
earlier because of course some

554
00:19:18,849 --> 00:19:21,939
phenotypes are going to finish sooner

555
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,340
some are gonna finish a little bit later

556
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,750
I like to push them I like to see what

557
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:27,639
they're going to do sometimes a plant

558
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,140
won't start putting on its bulk until

559
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,759
the last couple of weeks you might be

560
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,200
cutting yourself out of some weight you

561
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,028
might be cutting yourself out of potency

562
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,890
sometimes those plants will just throw

563
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:37,808
on a whole nother layer of trichomes

564
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:39,130
right at the end you never know what you

565
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:41,139
might be missing if you cut down too

566
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,850
early so if the package says that it

567
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,830
could go nine weeks let it go nine full

568
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:46,750
weeks on the first run and then

569
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,548
hopefully you've got clones so now you

570
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,929
get to pick your favorite phenotype out

571
00:19:48,548 --> 00:19:51,819
of that seed pack you get to run it

572
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,679
again and then you get to dial in

573
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:54,178
exactly how many days to flower that

574
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,190
plan

575
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:57,809
for sometimes your first run with the

576
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,058
plant is just an experiment you got to

577
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:02,158
see what its gonna do so that's my take

578
00:20:00,058 --> 00:20:04,408
on that the time indicator on the pack

579
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,850
is how long the plant will flower so

580
00:20:04,409 --> 00:20:07,679
keep that in mind when you're purchasing

581
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:09,628
your seeds if you're looking for a

582
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,610
reputable seed vendor in the United

583
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:16,230
States I would recommend the dank team

584
00:20:11,609 --> 00:20:18,240
comm so da NK te am calm the dank team

585
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,730
calm let them know Rasta Jeff sent you

586
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,368
they've got things from gage green

587
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,200
genetics sour seeds mile hike an

588
00:20:23,368 --> 00:20:27,388
adventure they got a lot of great stuff

589
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,919
on there they may even have some I read

590
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:31,648
genetics I'm not sure what's available

591
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,320
you'll have to go and take a look for

592
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:37,469
yourself so let's move on to another

593
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:39,418
question this question actually came

594
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:41,819
from a friend of mine shoutout to Lowe's

595
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:43,710
I hope you're listening to this there's

596
00:20:41,819 --> 00:20:45,868
a cultivar there is a clone there's a

597
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:49,019
varietal there is a stream there's a

598
00:20:45,868 --> 00:20:52,259
plant that goes around our region that

599
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:55,259
is a Sour Diesel clone and what it has

600
00:20:52,259 --> 00:20:58,169
grown properly you cannot keep it in a

601
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:01,019
baggie and a jar you can't put it in a

602
00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:03,269
baggie inside of a jar you can't hide

603
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,490
this weed from anybody if you put it in

604
00:21:03,269 --> 00:21:08,009
a baggie in a jar and in your car you

605
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:10,710
can smell this Sour Diesel outside of

606
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:14,460
the car this [ __ ] is potent this is some

607
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:16,429
super loud weed this [ __ ] is crazy but

608
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:19,740
when I give it to a lot of my friends

609
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:22,019
they cannot grow it I myself cannot grow

610
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,399
this string worth a [ __ ] I know three or

611
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,679
four people that grow this strain

612
00:21:23,398 --> 00:21:27,569
[ __ ] amazingly it comes out

613
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,369
beautifully the calyx is swell up it's

614
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:32,908
covered and resin it gets that gassy

615
00:21:29,368 --> 00:21:35,999
fuel funk smell to it so me being the

616
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:37,830
inquisitive guy that I am ah I know a

617
00:21:35,999 --> 00:21:39,690
few guys that grow it so I asked them I

618
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:42,058
was like hey how do you grow that Sour

619
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,070
Diesel and all three of the people that

620
00:21:42,058 --> 00:21:46,769
grow it successfully have told me that

621
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:50,240
it grows in some type of a hydroponic

622
00:21:46,769 --> 00:21:52,549
system so what that leads me to think

623
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,950
these guys myself included that are

624
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:58,669
trying to grow this cultivar this clone

625
00:21:54,950 --> 00:22:01,100
is varietal this plant this strain in a

626
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:03,620
soil or soilless mix we're not gonna

627
00:22:01,099 --> 00:22:05,539
have much success because this plant was

628
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:08,599
probably phenyl hunted from a pack of

629
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:11,269
seeds by somebody that grows in hydro

630
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:13,730
this plant was selected for a hydroponic

631
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:15,558
system I don't think anybody growing it

632
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,970
and I this could be wrong but I don't

633
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:19,730
think most of the people growing it in

634
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,980
soil are ever going to bring out that

635
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:24,380
flavor and aroma that my friends in the

636
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:26,929
hydroponic system are getting because I

637
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,230
feel like some plants like hydro and

638
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,850
some plants like soil and this is a

639
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:34,940
perfect example of phenotypical

640
00:22:31,849 --> 00:22:37,129
expression the grower that found this

641
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,320
plant probably grows hydro so he thought

642
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,460
look at this amazing plant that I've got

643
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,349
and then he gave it to all of us soil

644
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:45,679
growers and we're just frustrated

645
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:47,959
we're so angry so that is my opinion I

646
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,160
think that some strains and I keep

647
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:50,990
saying all these different words and

648
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,190
they're known as different things in

649
00:22:50,990 --> 00:22:53,329
different circles people will call them

650
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:56,058
for riot tools and you'll hear a

651
00:22:53,329 --> 00:22:58,339
cultivar also I'll say strains or clones

652
00:22:56,058 --> 00:23:01,069
some strains or clones or plants are

653
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:02,629
just not simply going to work in a day

654
00:23:01,069 --> 00:23:04,819
and I'm sure that if I you took one of

655
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:07,370
my soil plants and you tried to grow

656
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:09,259
that in a hydroponic system you may not

657
00:23:07,369 --> 00:23:11,329
have as stellar results as you would

658
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:12,650
have in soil it's just some plants are

659
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:14,480
going to like something so that's my

660
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,890
opinion that's what I think is going on

661
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,960
with that plant so shout out to Lowe's

662
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:19,340
for asking me that I kind of told him

663
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,840
the same thing and he scratched his head

664
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:23,619
and looked at me like I was a genius I

665
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:25,519
thought I would share that with you guys

666
00:23:23,619 --> 00:23:27,139
all right I feel like that's enough

667

cannabis use during pregnancy honestly I

765
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:52,869
low-key 4/20 I had the day off but I

766
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:57,100
also don't have childcare that day so I

767
00:32:52,869 --> 00:33:06,629
hung out with the kid in town and picked

768
00:32:57,099 --> 00:33:06,629
up a hi we are able to take good care of

769
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,000
[Music]

770
00:33:28,349 --> 00:33:34,839
we've got a beautiful rig from our

771
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:40,660
friends at Bear Mountain studios kids

772
00:33:34,839 --> 00:34:29,349
kids couple years ago kids with the kid

773
00:33:40,660 --> 00:34:32,260
on a girl's mom was in town support

774
00:34:29,349 --> 00:34:36,009
cannabis even if they don't do yeah and

775
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:38,200
then I sponsored the 5280 showcase which

776
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:40,919
was really cool from what I heard it

777
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:44,049
went on pretty long from like for the

778
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:47,019
midnight and I caught it towards the end

779
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:50,099
of it I showed up at 8:00 where was that

780
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:50,099
[Music]

781
00:34:50,219 --> 00:34:55,928
yes and it was cool how they handle that

782
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:57,699
because they had two buses outside where

783
00:34:55,929 --> 00:35:00,639
any dabbing or smoking or any

784
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:02,649
consumption was done so though obviously

785
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,900
we can do anything you know in the hotel

786
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:06,490
right they had made space an icon for

787
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,320
people that were getting medicated and

788
00:35:06,489 --> 00:35:09,879
they weren't [ __ ] with it all night

789
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,200
which is really give a shout-out to Adam

790
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,099
Dunn and his crew they were the first

791
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:16,989
people I ever saw who's rented buses to

792
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:18,339
party they had tour buses for bands and

793
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,929
we parked them outside of the Fox or the

794
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,370
oriental theater one night and they're

795
00:35:19,929 --> 00:35:24,940
like you can't medicate in here but this

796
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:32,589
is a VIP bus wink wink that's private

797
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:35,470
property exactly a lot of people showed

798
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:37,900
up a lot of friendly faces super fun

799
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:41,019
after that one to see some good friends

800
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:45,730

801

but I actually know a guy that works at

810
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:17,810
a pizza place who said that the owner of

811
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:19,430
his pizza place almost had to close the

812
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:21,469
business because they weren't surviving

813
00:36:19,429 --> 00:36:23,509
here in Pueblo one that cannabis was

814
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:24,709
legalized and now their business is

815
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:26,840
thriving and they're opening more

816
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:32,570
locations so shout out to cannabis and

817
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:34,789
pizza for weed yeah so you've been all

818
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,050

821
00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:40,909
of fun I think a lot of good [ __ ] comes

822
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:42,679
out in these random conversations you've

823
00:36:40,909 --> 00:36:51,409
been all over the place where do you

824
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:53,599
find smokes the most herb okay so I'll

825
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:54,980
say this California is interesting

826
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,719
because you know I was in the Bay and

827
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,550
northern Cali and you know it's very

828
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,919
cannabis friendly up there as far as the

829
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:05,060
cities go lifestyle culture it's very

830
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,680
cannabis integrated you know but as of

831
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:08,360
lately

832
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:12,679
Colorado within the last year I feel is

833
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:19,660
really stepped their [ __ ] up you know so

834
00:37:12,679 --> 00:37:22,159
yeah and I want to say so many [ __ ]

835
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:25,129
people that blow it down heavy down here

836
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:27,739
yeah between Denver and Pueblo there's a

837
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:30,079
lot of heavy heads let me reiterate that

838
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:32,419
from the mountains up north to Pueblo

839
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,799
there's a lot of really heavy heads so I

840
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:36,349
still think that people in Colorado

841
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,450
really throw it down you know and it

842
00:37:36,349 --> 00:37:40,460
just it's time for the city in our

843
00:37:38,449 --> 00:37:42,169
culture to catch up with it you know

844
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:44,840
right yeah so shout out to Colorado

845
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:47,900
merrily you smoke a lot of herb yeah you

846
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:49,700

Washington I mean all these places are

849
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,929
different and stuff but Colorado is

850
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,000
still the bedrock you know people always

851
00:37:56,929 --> 00:38:00,859
look to us regardless of whether we want

852
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,989
to admit it or not it's just about you

853
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,170
know you can accept that it's not about

854
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,939
wearing a badge

855
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:08,760

drive that night but there was a lot of

863
00:38:22,798 --> 00:38:28,139
enforcement absolutely which luckily I

864
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:29,970

869
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,899
anything they just got pulled over and

870
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,979

those warlock pennies they just went to

883
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:22,889
Japan and the [ __ ] collabs that they

884
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:24,630
did with Team Japan the Aquarius the

885
00:39:22,889 --> 00:39:28,940
Jesus dude all the dot work and all that

886
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:31,798
I just blew my mind like literally like

887
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,750
there was one bird with like a Mandela

888
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:36,869
dot work on the stomach and it was just

889
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:38,338
like the the detail is insane he could

890
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:40,140
have gotten lost in it you know like

891
00:39:38,338 --> 00:39:43,048
it's one of those pieces that I probably

892
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:45,838
wouldn't even use but do you know what

893
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:49,119
the price tag was at 15 K on it yes

894
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:51,639
definitely yeah we talked team Japan and

895
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:56,528
and I think um you know it's it's gonna

896
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:58,210
be crazy but holy [ __ ] yeah absolutely

897
00:39:56,528 --> 00:40:00,239

898
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:03,789
there too

899
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:09,368
[ __ ] John tailor-made made like this

900
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:13,900

902
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,690
know he's he's very stuff and stuff and

903
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:22,390
you can see it in his glass work because

904
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:26,318
this detail to the piece is incredible

905
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:28,538
and I did it with Pogo glass whoo he's a

906
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:30,608
great friend too and that guy kills him

907
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:33,130
in his own regard there's yeah lunch box

908
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:36,788
mechanic Matt Pinter he was there doing

909
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,710
his thing yeah there's a lot of [ __ ]

910
00:40:36,789 --> 00:40:40,569
there I got there pretty late and it was

911
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,909
mostly about just seeing people you know

912
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:45,579
cuz I hadn't gone into Denver almost you

913
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:47,199
know two three months on any event like

914
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:49,390
that so it was nice just catching up

915
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:51,548
with all friendly faces from came into

916
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:53,710
Denver that's the fun of course

917
00:40:51,548 --> 00:40:55,809
absolutely and the art was just you know

918
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:58,150
a bonus it was weird not having a

919
00:40:55,809 --> 00:41:00,220
cannabis cup usually where I see

920
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,139
everybody I want to say as much [ __ ] as

921
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:03,488
people talked about the cup or whatever

922
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:05,288
they you know whatever cripes they have

923
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:07,150
against you know the competition side of

924
00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:11,380
it or whatever it is you can definitely

925
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:13,329
feel the mist presence of that event

926
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:14,559
absolutely it may people had their

927
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:16,239
opinions about it and whatever you

928
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,460
thought of it it was just a great place

929
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,470
to meet up with everybody I would see

930
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,048
everybody from Addison to Maura to

931
00:41:20,469 --> 00:41:24,608
kabuki Jade Fox to just my random local

932
00:41:23,048 --> 00:41:27,179
friends there and we would all get along

933
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:29,108
and hang out up dab with Danny Danko uh

934
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:30,730
everybody we just hang out it would be

935
00:41:29,108 --> 00:41:32,230
such a good time and there's nowhere

936
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,650
else you can go and see that many people

937
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:37,329
no no not at the same place and though

938
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:39,130
it's cool because now we you know I

939
00:41:37,329 --> 00:41:40,839

00:51:37,789 --> 00:51:42,568
Colorado cup was rated and I've actually

got a copy of the search warrant my

1178
00:51:42,568 --> 00:51:44,699
phone if we wanted to read it but I

1179
00:51:43,710 --> 00:51:46,920
don't know I don't know if we should

1180
00:51:44,699 --> 00:51:48,088
delve into that well that might be

1181
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,530
interesting actually

1182
00:51:48,088 --> 00:51:51,659
they claim to have found some drugs

1183
00:51:49,530 --> 00:51:52,950
actually oh really and the DJ booth they

1184
00:51:51,659 --> 00:51:56,190
claimed there was some drugs in the DJ

1185
00:51:52,949 --> 00:52:02,730
booth no [ __ ] but also the DJ booth was

1186
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:03,990
the only room without a camera but so

1187
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:05,818
there was an event at a place called

1188
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:07,139
Riggs R Us and it was the Colorado Cup

1189
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:08,429
and it was an event similar to a

1190
00:52:07,139 --> 00:52:10,440
cannabis cup where people enter their

1191
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:12,568
strains of cannabis extracts edibles and

1192
00:52:10,440 --> 00:52:15,960
cannabis wares and whatnots and people

1193
00:52:12,568 --> 00:52:18,389
judge them they decided a winner on 4/20

1194
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,608
at 3:00 p.m. the Denver City police came

1195
00:52:18,389 --> 00:52:22,588
in with bandanas on their faces and

1196
00:52:20,608 --> 00:52:23,969
shotguns in their hands kicked in the

1197
00:52:22,588 --> 00:52:26,130
front doors and started yelling get out

1198
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:27,209
get out get out and half of the people

1199
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,619
that were in there thought the place was

1200
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,849
getting robbed because they did not

1201
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:31,230
announce it they were police until

1202
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:33,298
everybody left and everybody was on the

1203
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:36,088
ground then a uniformed officer walked

1204
00:52:33,298 --> 00:52:37,650
in and delivered a search warrant yeah

1205
00:52:36,088 --> 00:52:38,639
after everything was all yeah so

1206
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,200
everybody thought the place was getting

1207
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:42,719
[ __ ] robbed I had a friend who was

1208
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:45,088
there she sent me a bunch of stuff she

1209
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:47,578
sent me a video from the place the cops

1210
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:50,548
that first one in just looked like thugs

1211
00:52:47,579 --> 00:52:52,230
in Dickies and combat boots and bandanas

1212
00:52:50,548 --> 00:52:54,239
and they were followed by armed cops who

1213
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:56,400
were then followed by like riot cops I

1214
00:52:54,239 --> 00:53:00,209
just to come shut down any illegal

1215
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,940
smudge of peaceful [ __ ] starters yeah

1216
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:04,858
exactly they needed riot gear how much

1217
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:07,170
of our tax money was that a lot and

1218
00:53:04,858 --> 00:53:08,789
actually sounds like 60 grand from what

1219
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:12,000
you just said there were several

1220
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:13,588
MacBooks being used for data entry for

1221
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,150
the cup that was happening again these

1222
00:53:13,588 --> 00:53:16,349
cops poured bottled water all over the

1223
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,349
back books are you [ __ ] serious

1224
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:21,079
bottles of water over the back books

1225
00:53:18,349 --> 00:53:27,109
yeah for no reason destruction allegedly

1226
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:30,380
I was not there on the street

1227
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:33,338
yeah and Denver PD it doesn't have the

1228
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:36,019
cleanest record for how they deal with

1229
00:53:33,338 --> 00:53:37,880
public affairs do we want to read any of

1230
00:53:36,018 --> 00:53:40,038
it I could read you absolutely because

1231
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:41,630
38 charges filed against these folks I

1232
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:44,089
can go find the message so while you

1233
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:47,419
find the message I'll delve into AJ

1234
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:49,699
Cashman a little bit so here's the thing

1235
00:53:47,418 --> 00:53:51,618
with AJ and I'm not one to talk [ __ ] or

1236
00:53:49,699 --> 00:53:54,259
say anything I love anyone but I'll tell

1237
00:53:51,619 --> 00:53:56,689
you my first experience with him back

1238
00:53:54,259 --> 00:54:03,048
last year do you remember the Gypsy Jean

1239
00:53:56,688 --> 00:54:05,568
dress it was a huge joke maybe they got

1240
00:54:03,048 --> 00:54:07,548
stooped to come in to do whatever he did

1241
00:54:05,568 --> 00:54:12,139
for a few minutes half the artists to

1242
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:14,329
show up the company running it lied

1243
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:16,548
about ticket sales a lot of vendors got

1244
00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:20,479
[ __ ] some people buy $40,000 booths

1245
00:54:16,548 --> 00:54:22,309
and recoup nothing on top of that it was

1246
00:54:20,478 --> 00:54:24,438
like a three-day event and on the second

1247
00:54:22,309 --> 00:54:27,140
day a lot of these people's stuff got

1248
00:54:24,438 --> 00:54:29,058
broken into and the guys that came in to

1249
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:30,768
promote the event and help build it at

1250
00:54:29,059 --> 00:54:31,579
all left and left everything high and

1251
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:35,298
dry

1252
00:54:31,579 --> 00:54:38,859
so AJ's role in this was they seeked him

1253
00:54:35,298 --> 00:54:38,858
out to do the

1254
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:46,659
judging portion of the edible

1255
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:48,460
competition and concentrate competition

1256
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:52,089
and what ended up happening was he took

1257
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:55,150
like 17 grams or 14 I camera it was over

1258
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:57,579
half an ounce of concentrated from us

1259
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:59,650
and told us that no dispensaries would

1260
00:54:57,579 --> 00:55:01,360
be entering and that it would just be in

1261
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:02,860
an independent thing and I said sure why

1262
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,059
not me my roommate at the time got some

1263
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:10,660
flour we ran it over the case was and

1264
00:55:06,059 --> 00:55:12,639
you know it was okay but [ __ ] over the

1265
00:55:10,659 --> 00:55:14,920
name of them the clinic or someone who

1266
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:18,219
had just gone wreck came in and bought

1267
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:20,950
[ __ ] out position turned in Category

1268
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:24,489
actually for every category and just

1269
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:27,099
kind of avoided everything he said so on

1270
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:29,259
top of that we found out that my and she

1271
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:31,029
was never judged and this is a year ago

1272
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:34,900
so let's flash forward to Colorado Cup

1273
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:37,000
Steve Dafina and his flower entry he had

1274
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:38,530
two entries his cheese quake which I can

1275
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,239
personally say as an extractor as a

1276
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:42,730
grower as a breeder you know he does

1277
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:45,699
great [ __ ] work I loved you extracted

1278
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:50,800
at Luvdisc wishes super chirpy material

1279
00:55:45,699 --> 00:55:53,049
I loved it he also entered your heart of

1280
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:56,190
cold heart of gold which is a golden go

1281
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:58,870
across all the grateful dog yes very

1282
00:55:56,190 --> 00:56:03,820
sativa dominant cross you would so yeah

1283
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:06,159
okay so in the whole scheme of things

1284
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,110
you know what the hugest said they got

1285
00:56:06,159 --> 00:56:10,569
raided

1286
00:56:07,110 --> 00:56:12,099
Steve almost losses you know possessions

1287
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:13,930
or whatever the case was because that

1288
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:15,639
whole thing he ended up getting in and

1289
00:56:13,929 --> 00:56:17,500
they're giving him [ __ ] or whatever the

1290
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:18,849
case was but he didn't find out till a

1291
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,239
few days later after they announced that

1292
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:24,639
the winnings that his entries weren't

1293
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:26,649
even judged but you know as typical is

1294
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:29,559
something that AJ would do that let's

1295
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:31,210
rewind a little bit again he would do

1296
00:56:29,559 --> 00:56:33,369
these things and promote these events

1297
00:56:31,210 --> 00:56:35,019
called canter raves and whatever the

1298
00:56:33,369 --> 00:56:36,849
case was I wasn't really around for them

1299
00:56:35,019 --> 00:56:38,380
I've just only heard and it's the same

1300
00:56:36,849 --> 00:56:40,029
sim another thing he wouldn't get

1301
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:41,869
permits for anything the cops would

1302
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:43,550
constantly come to the events

1303
00:56:41,869 --> 00:56:46,339
the vendors would get [ __ ] because he

1304
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:49,490
would collect money he was charging more

1305
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:52,370
money for what he was like oh if you

1306
00:56:49,489 --> 00:56:54,500
want your entry tested $40 what that

1307
00:56:52,369 --> 00:56:59,029
actually costs is 25 so he was actually

1308
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:00,889
skimming off the top of every entry that

1309
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:04,190
you know that was made on top of what he

1310
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:06,409
was getting so it's kind of like you

1311
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:09,380
know I can understand why someone would

1312
00:57:06,409 --> 00:57:12,049
be upset Steve our good friend Steve was

1313
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:16,579
not too happy when he heard that you

1314
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:19,430
know and it was verified and I just feel

1315
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:21,469
like one people with that kind of

1316
00:57:19,429 --> 00:57:23,269
tracker she's just not do events I have

1317
00:57:21,469 --> 00:57:26,029
nothing good to say about a Jay dude I

1318
00:57:23,269 --> 00:57:27,739
got smoke with you whatever but I can't

1319
00:57:26,030 --> 00:57:29,120
say the same for Steve or some of the

1320
00:57:27,739 --> 00:57:32,959
other competitors is she kind of [ __ ]

1321
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:35,299
over so that being said being Steve been

1322
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,010
talking about authenticity and

1323
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:39,350
competition and trying to do something

1324
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:42,020
more towards that but that was a huge

1325
00:57:39,349 --> 00:57:47,480
bust on their part of the competition

1326
00:57:42,019 --> 00:57:49,369
and you know yeah I wish it hadn't gone

1327
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:51,710
that way when people told me about the

1328
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:53,509
Colorado Cup I asked who was throwing in

1329
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:56,360
when I heard who it was I kind of had to

1330
00:57:53,510 --> 00:57:58,610
pull from it knowing that one the cops

1331
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,230
really had to get involved her to my

1332
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:01,700
entry he's going to be taken and you

1333
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:03,519
know he could just go to patients if

1334
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:06,079
that's the case you know like why bother

1335
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:08,030
so that reminds me that I did not do a

1336
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:17,230
shout out to the venue where we held the

1337
00:58:08,030 --> 00:58:21,470
secret so big shout out to the venue is

1338
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:22,610
[ __ ] that place dude yeah word on the

1339
00:58:21,469 --> 00:58:24,980
street is we're doing secret session

1340
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:27,170
again in May and there is a good chance

1341
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:30,800
that Rasta Jeff will be the co-host

1342
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:32,630
because in June and July I will be the

1343
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,490
host of the secret session things go our

1344
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:35,840
way cool I might not be supposed to say

1345
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:37,459
that so only listeners can know that

1346
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,130
[ __ ] don't tell anybody you guys yeah

cut off the show everything is cool Mike

1392
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,369

ride not an emergency shot to my

1394

all right so we were cutting in the

1397
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:58,440
middle of slandering AJ hashman yeah

1398
01:00:56,579 --> 01:00:59,880
well not really I was expressing my

1399
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:01,500
views which had nothing to do with you

1400
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:03,329
by the way thank you for letting me

1401
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:06,030
express them but I am addressing them on

1402
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:08,670
the behalf of my friend Steve who really

1403
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:10,350
feels like he got shafted and it's just

1404
01:01:08,670 --> 01:01:12,090
unfortunate you know because I tried to

1405
01:01:10,349 --> 01:01:13,529
warn him and him being a good person

1406
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:17,180
tried to give him the benefit of the

1407
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:17,180
doubt and hey it's like

1408
01:01:17,659 --> 01:01:23,298
it's like chlamydia you learn a lesson

1409
01:01:19,849 --> 01:01:25,009
once with that [ __ ] and AJ is just kind

1410
01:01:23,298 --> 01:01:27,170
of like dealing with him in a business

1411
01:01:25,009 --> 01:01:28,579

whatnot she's onto the idea of medical

1451
01:02:59,088 --> 01:03:05,028
marijuana but has it in her mind that

1452
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:07,098
the CBD available in Texas will not help

1453
01:03:05,028 --> 01:03:09,559
and this person is sure that they won't

1454
01:03:07,099 --> 01:03:12,318
if we could please lay some knowledge on

1455
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:15,079
this listener about this there's a whole

1456
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:17,210
family that would appreciate it first of

1457
01:03:15,079 --> 01:03:20,048
all I'm gonna be a grammar nazi let's

1458
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:23,539
let's correct the world here with CBDs

1459
01:03:20,048 --> 01:03:25,730
let's just start saying CBD CA DS is not

1460
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:28,579
pluralized the same way that we don't

1461
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:31,190
paralyze th C's right you know it's just

1462
01:03:28,579 --> 01:03:35,240
we don't do it and we or water

1463
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:37,280
yeah waters yeah do don't say all the

1464
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:41,179
waters out of this glass it's yeah it's

1465
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:43,310
CBD this is for everybody yeah and also

1466
01:03:41,179 --> 01:03:45,079
since I'm on this it's not strands it is

1467
01:03:43,309 --> 01:03:47,210
strains strands her hair strains or

1468
01:03:45,079 --> 01:03:49,909
canvas if you get specific you could say

1469
01:03:47,210 --> 01:04:03,710
cultivar or varietal but let's just not

1470
01:03:49,909 --> 01:04:07,609
say [ __ ] this guy and also since

1471
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:09,559
we're making jokes about this I I'm

1472
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:11,780
sorry your mother-in-law has Parkinson's

1473
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:13,519
that is terrible to hear about and Fox

1474
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:16,100
is the guy here it is great at helping

1475
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:17,630
with this type of stuff so first he

1476
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:19,549
wants to know if we can recommend a

1477
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:23,960
stream that would help with Parkinson's

1478
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:26,420
okay so there's a few options if she's

1479
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,010
okay with the cannabis and there's a few

1480
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:29,840
one-to-one options that we can go with

1481
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:33,070
that would be wonderful

1482
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:37,250
you know Tora Bora being one of them

1483
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:39,590
Taurus Harlequin which I think comes in

1484
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:41,539
at a three to one or two the one and

1485
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:45,800
certain certain cases seven to one

1486
01:04:41,539 --> 01:04:47,659
another great strain if she's coming

1487
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:50,750
around or slowly coming around to the

1488
01:04:47,659 --> 01:04:53,210
idea of medical cannabis I would say

1489
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:56,329
start off with the higher CBD strains to

1490
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:58,880
you know higher ratio both CBD THC auto

1491
01:04:56,329 --> 01:05:01,579
from Centennial C oh that that's a great

1492
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,349
example so obviously the you're in Texas

1493
01:05:01,579 --> 01:05:06,590
so your options are very limited and

1494
01:05:03,349 --> 01:05:09,139
unless you can get a specific cut of

1495
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:11,269
this you know of what I'm talking about

1496
01:05:09,139 --> 01:05:13,250
on the ACDC set at least you're gonna

1497
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:14,599
have to go with something like the auto

1498
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:16,820
but from what I understand it's like one

1499
01:05:14,599 --> 01:05:19,250
hundred and twenty to one so and it's

1500
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:20,990
keep saying I'm sorry he keeps saying

1501
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:23,119
one hundred and twenty to one or two to

1502
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:25,489
one we're talking about THC to CBD

1503
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,309
ratios and we're trying to find a higher

1504
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:30,589
CBD ratio for you is what we need yes so

1505
01:05:28,309 --> 01:05:32,329
that she's not gonna get the killer head

1506
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:33,800
but she's not gonna be high and giggly

1507
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:36,799
she's actually gonna get the medicinal

1508
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:39,140
benefits from the cannabis because it's

1509
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,420
higher in CBD than th there's more to

1510
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:43,429
clear that up you keep how many people

1511
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:44,460
understand the ratio absolutely thank

1512
01:05:43,429 --> 01:05:47,129
you for refer

1513
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,750
for I try not to go past people you know

1514
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:50,640
you're fine that's great because I

1515
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:53,550
forget to elaborate on that sometimes

1516
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:55,379
I'm not the best at that so yeah that

1517
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:57,269
being said and like you said Centennial

1518
01:05:55,380 --> 01:06:02,010
seeds odd it would be great

1519
01:05:57,269 --> 01:06:04,340
I think CBD crew is another you know

1520
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:08,070
seed company that would be able to help

1521
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:09,960
booms farm also has some strains that

1522
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:12,630
are you know like I said you you know

1523
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:14,360
you can tell them what your situation is

1524
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:17,519
where you are and they'll be able to

1525
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:19,140
help you with their strain list and give

1526
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,179
you something that you know will but

1527
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:23,519
keep you you know in the legal

1528
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:25,349
boundaries of what you need but just

1529
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,849
let's say with the ATO the others are

1530
01:06:25,349 --> 01:06:30,469
great to start off with and let's just

1531
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:34,529
say the one so CBD is in your attractant

1532
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:37,980
there's been a few cases done on the

1533
01:06:34,530 --> 01:06:41,580
effects of CBD on Parkinson's and it

1534
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:44,579
absolutely helps with the confusion it

1535
01:06:41,579 --> 01:06:48,569
helps with the tremors it helps with a

1536
01:06:44,579 --> 01:06:50,759
lot of the symptoms that you see usually

1537
01:06:48,570 --> 01:06:54,150
with that disease or anything you know

1538
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:57,750
and related to that condition so yes

1539
01:06:54,150 --> 01:07:02,160
obviously it's a huge help tinters you

1540
01:06:57,750 --> 01:07:03,750
know sublingual dosing and depending on

1541
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:08,699
what the case is is usually you know

1542
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:12,059
will be the quickest there are CBD ready

1543
01:07:08,699 --> 01:07:15,149
products that can also you know that you

1544
01:07:12,059 --> 01:07:16,739
can get I'm sorry that the company's

1545
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:19,320
eluding me at this point you know

1546
01:07:16,739 --> 01:07:21,209
because I don't I just can't think of it

1547
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,250
to mine but there are those products

1548
01:07:21,210 --> 01:07:25,050
available if you know if you need

1549
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:27,510
something quicker than just growing what

1550
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:29,820
will help her part of his question was

1551
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:32,370
that he does not believe that the CBD

1552
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:34,440
products available in Texas will be of

1553
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:35,429
much use and I asked him more questions

1554
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:37,320
about this we had a little short

1555
01:07:35,429 --> 01:07:39,750
conversation on messenger on the

1556
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,160
Instagram messenger here um I asked him

1557
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:43,980
he said he doesn't feel like the CBD

1558
01:07:41,159 --> 01:07:45,629
available there in Texas will help and

1559
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,860
he's sure that they won't and then he

1560
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:48,390
asked me how I felt about that and I

1561
01:07:46,860 --> 01:07:49,470
asked why he doesn't feel like the CBD

1562
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:51,869
there will he'll have it the same

1563
01:07:49,469 --> 01:07:53,789
question he said that he doesn't believe

1564
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:56,789
it's going to be CBD oil which we've

1565
01:07:53,789 --> 01:07:59,699
seen a lot and it ends up just being

1566
01:07:56,789 --> 01:08:04,500
percent cotton oil there just be more

1567
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:06,659
specific then I'll start off by giving

1568
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:11,059
out my email you know let's go out and I

1569

verified hemp oil so you know growers

1573
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:26,159
farmers extractors I also know a few

1574
01:08:24,149 --> 01:08:27,960
slew of companies that already make 50

1575
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,720
state ready CBD products that are

1576
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:32,159
legitimate they're backed up by testing

1577
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:34,829
they you know will have testing for

1578
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:37,559
everything from potency pesticides to

1579
01:08:34,829 --> 01:08:43,199
mildew and have met heavy metals and you

1580
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:45,000
know an infused product so yeah I'm so

1581
01:08:43,199 --> 01:08:47,399

1586
01:08:56,850 --> 01:08:59,640
address again so that you guys don't

1587
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:02,160
have to rewind the show I'll put all

1588
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,750
this stuff in the show notes so that you

1589
01:09:02,159 --> 01:09:05,039
guys can easily go and find that I'll

1590
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:07,920
leave some links there in the show notes

1591
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:10,289
for you that would be probably the most

1592
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,600
helpful thing that I can do is this CBD

1593
01:09:10,289 --> 01:09:14,310
legal in Texas the CBD product you're

1594
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:17,490
talking about oh yeah absolutely

1595
01:09:14,310 --> 01:09:19,080
okay you know I was working with Halo

1596
01:09:17,489 --> 01:09:21,449
labs for a while which then they were

1597
01:09:19,079 --> 01:09:23,068
doing an isolate that was we were

1598
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:27,389
getting back on ninety nine point five

1599
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:29,940
five seven percent and I infused a lot

1600
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:31,619
of the DC legal products with a lot of

1601
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:34,009
those hard candies and lollipops that I

1602
01:09:31,619 --> 01:09:36,479
made with 50 state legal and you know I

1603
01:09:34,010 --> 01:09:38,130
sent those after free to a lot of people

1604
01:09:36,479 --> 01:09:40,588
because they were skeptical about that

1605
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:42,779
and you know just to get an idea some

1606
01:09:40,588 --> 01:09:45,180
people obviously we support whole plant

1607
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:47,789
cannabis I mean you know both is best

1608
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:49,680
the whole plant is best but if you're in

1609
01:09:47,789 --> 01:09:52,409
a situation I have a condition where

1610
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:54,780
it's more neurologically tied than

1611
01:09:52,409 --> 01:09:56,399
higher concentrations of CBD is where

1612
01:09:54,779 --> 01:09:58,229
you want to be and so you know

1613
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:59,250

1651
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:47,580
product worth of [ __ ] in your opinion

1652
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:48,960
absolutely not you know actually I'll

1653
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:51,059

1655
01:11:51,060 --> 01:11:56,330
through my friend Nate and then we

1656
01:11:52,409 --> 01:12:00,109
should do another podcast about that

1657
01:11:56,329 --> 01:12:00,109
bottle to do it on the podcast

1658
01:12:00,559 --> 01:12:06,650
absolutely I'm sure Nate would love to

1659
01:12:02,779 --> 01:12:09,559
do it for me of course yeah definitely

1660
01:12:06,649 --> 01:12:12,019
yeah I think that they're the biggest

1661
01:12:09,559 --> 01:12:14,570
charlatans of all so you definitely have

1662
01:12:12,020 --> 01:12:17,300
to be careful just you know a little bit

1663
01:12:14,569 --> 01:12:20,538
of research goes a long way you can also

1664
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:23,270
look into halo labs out of Arizona

1665
01:12:20,538 --> 01:12:24,618
they are big wholesalers that well and

1666
01:12:23,270 --> 01:12:27,440
they you know work with other companies

1667
01:12:24,618 --> 01:12:30,130
to completely revamp products under what

1668
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:33,229
they do that they're allowed in Arizona

1669
01:12:30,130 --> 01:12:35,150
so yeah and like I said I'm a completely

1670
01:12:33,229 --> 01:12:37,279
an open source you know Jeff can you

1671

acquire a product from them I can't tell

1689
01:13:18,349 --> 01:13:20,690
you what they can do I'm just

1690
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:23,630
recommending them I know they're very

1691
01:13:20,689 --> 01:13:26,029
knowledgeable good hard to close great

1692
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:27,618
folks um something I should mention if

1693
01:13:26,029 --> 01:13:30,800
you're going to consume cannabis for

1694
01:13:27,618 --> 01:13:33,019
your Parkinson's don't only focus on the

1695
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:35,239
CBD for the healing I would recommend

1696
01:13:33,020 --> 01:13:37,880
something a light sativa like a jelly

1697
01:13:35,238 --> 01:13:40,669
bean yeah or @anjghie because you need I

1698
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,828
think the sativa the THC and the sativa

1699
01:13:40,670 --> 01:13:44,719
is good to help treatment but at the

1700
01:13:42,828 --> 01:13:46,549
same time that's gonna put you the

1701
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,349
patient in a better mood it's gonna uh

1702
01:13:46,550 --> 01:13:49,489
flip up lift your spirits a little bit

1703
01:13:48,349 --> 01:13:50,659
it's gonna make you a little more social

1704
01:13:49,488 --> 01:13:53,089
it's gonna put a smile on your face

1705
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:54,618
that's a huge part of healing people is

1706
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:56,659
keeping them happy and keeping a smile

1707
01:13:54,618 --> 01:13:59,089
on their face absolutely your mood is

1708
01:13:56,658 --> 01:14:00,210
everything especially in recovery and

1709
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:03,730
healing

1710
01:14:00,210 --> 01:14:06,010
so strains that have you know known

1711
01:14:03,729 --> 01:14:11,109
properties of uplifting you know mood

1712
01:14:06,010 --> 01:14:14,170
and you know anti-anxiety Julie being a

1713
01:14:11,109 --> 01:14:15,759
screen for me Dairy Queen okay a lot of

1714
01:14:14,170 --> 01:14:17,859
the Queen's kind of do that that I don't

1715
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:30,250
find them as racy I find them a smooth

1716
01:14:17,859 --> 01:14:33,939
creamy relaxing alright variety of

1717
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:35,050
things so I think that's awesome that

1718
01:14:33,939 --> 01:14:36,909
things like that are available when

1719
01:14:35,050 --> 01:14:39,250
you're right you know doctor just focus

1720
01:14:36,909 --> 01:14:45,250
on the CBD only side of things low the

1721
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:47,680
Colorado flow is a very blue berry you

1722
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:49,779
know it's not the most knock you down

1723
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:53,640
strain but the smoke is incredibly

1724
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:53,639
enjoyable as well

1725
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:02,289
he's been breathing for longer than most

1726
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:04,750
of us have been thinking about campus

1727
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:06,970
yes or had any inclination of wanting to

1728
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:12,010
work with a true breeder true breeder

1729
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:13,840
alright so you mentioned a teacher we

1730
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:16,780
were talking about teacher and dosage on

1731
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:21,310
another episode what do you recommend

1732
01:15:16,779 --> 01:15:25,149
for dosage on a teacher say somebody has

1733
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:27,250
cancer or maybe I don't even want to

1734
01:15:25,149 --> 01:15:33,129
diagnose anybody with another condition

1735
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:35,319
but cancer it's different you know if

1736
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:36,970
it's more focused on the near logical

1737
01:15:35,319 --> 01:15:39,340
condition and that's a higher dose of

1738
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:41,740
CBD and if it's th the only or whether

1739
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:44,380
they're getting delta-9 or all factors

1740
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:46,979
and how it's going to go but so cancer

1741
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:51,579
we're gonna go the other way around

1742
01:15:46,979 --> 01:15:53,079
obviously treatment that with guidelines

1743
01:15:51,579 --> 01:15:54,880
that we followed as through you know

1744
01:15:53,079 --> 01:15:57,789
rick simpson though i don't use his

1745
01:15:54,880 --> 01:16:00,810
extraction methods of you know gram a

1746
01:15:57,789 --> 01:16:00,810
day for 90 days

1747
01:16:01,329 --> 01:16:09,529
and doing that you know when I say that

1748
01:16:05,449 --> 01:16:11,119
THC high oil and when I say a gram a day

1749
01:16:09,529 --> 01:16:14,179
it's really more like a thousand

1750
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:18,380
milligrams a day and obviously you know

1751
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:20,869
a gram isn't a thousand milligrams so

1752
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:23,060
that's something that we you know not

1753
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:24,559
enough gets focused on so in the short

1754
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:27,100
of it let's on say every day let's say a

1755
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:29,510
thousand milligrams a day for 90 days

1756
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:34,010
that's gonna make people feel like [ __ ]

1757
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:35,630
also yeah there's you know they're

1758
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:37,550
usually you know the way you would start

1759
01:16:35,630 --> 01:16:39,170
you know because people been consuming

1760
01:16:37,550 --> 01:16:41,750
this oil raw for so long they would

1761
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:44,270
start with like little pea-sized bits

1762
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:46,539
and that would [ __ ] them up and they've

1763
01:16:44,270 --> 01:16:50,380
kind of worked their way up

1764
01:16:46,539 --> 01:16:52,519
you know trying to work with different

1765
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:55,400
extraction methods and non-solvent

1766
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:57,950
techniques and trying to you know gain

1767
01:16:55,399 --> 01:17:02,779
the same uptake you know in the amount

1768
01:16:57,949 --> 01:17:05,269
but not feeling so sluggish or more

1769
01:17:02,779 --> 01:17:08,179
importantly some of similar bodies can't

1770
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:10,550
process that oil either way that we

1771
01:17:08,180 --> 01:17:12,950
should right yeah and it's better left

1772
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:15,440
as a topical for a melanoma so at that

1773
01:17:12,949 --> 01:17:17,720
point if our bodies can't process it or

1774
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:19,759
if you know if we have compromised

1775
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:21,740
digestive problems you know require be

1776
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,360
Crohn's colitis whatever the case is

1777
01:17:21,739 --> 01:17:25,909
throw that [ __ ] out the door you need

1778
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:30,279
something that isn't going harm your gut

1779
01:17:25,909 --> 01:17:30,279
you know that because because of how

1780
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:37,170
the extraction right that leaves it a

1781
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:39,180
little it's a little harsh you know gee

1782
01:17:37,170 --> 01:17:40,890
there's a little burn to it regardless

1783
01:17:39,180 --> 01:17:43,320
of how clean it is a lot of people

1784
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:44,910
aren't using grape ethanol most people

1785
01:17:43,319 --> 01:17:46,590
are using Everclear because that's

1786
01:17:44,909 --> 01:17:47,699
what's available to them so there's a

1787
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:50,730
lot of those things that come into

1788
01:17:47,699 --> 01:17:53,550
account you know so we try not to deal

1789
01:17:50,729 --> 01:17:55,709
with that at all you know if you've seen

1790
01:17:53,550 --> 01:17:58,440
me I'm focusing more on the non-solvent

1791
01:17:55,710 --> 01:18:00,659
part of that and trying to focus and you

1792
01:17:58,439 --> 01:18:02,789
know d winterize rosin and start doing

1793
01:18:00,659 --> 01:18:06,439
things of that sort and seeing what we

1794
01:18:02,789 --> 01:18:09,269
can do without having to use alcohol

1795
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:13,259
butane or solvent yeah you know and keep

1796
01:18:09,270 --> 01:18:16,980
it organic a friend of ours is starting

1797
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:19,650
a vineyard you know with some grapes and

1798
01:18:16,979 --> 01:18:21,829
we're gonna be doing a little you know

1799
01:18:19,649 --> 01:18:26,039
little project we'll be making our own

1800
01:18:21,829 --> 01:18:28,019
grape ethanol yeah so you know we're

1801
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:31,489
trying to make this all in

1802
01:18:28,020 --> 01:18:34,830
you know Pablo nonetheless so it's all a

1803
01:18:31,489 --> 01:18:36,599
Colorado organic entity so the people

1804
01:18:34,829 --> 01:18:40,859
that talk crap about Pueblo we're doing

1805
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:42,090
some things to come down and be part of

1806
01:18:40,859 --> 01:18:44,519
you know there's already a lot of great

1807
01:18:42,090 --> 01:18:46,409
people could caregivers get breeders

1808
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:49,200
doing their things so yeah definitely

1809
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:51,930
public on it so for cancer you'd

1810
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:54,929
basically recommend 1000 milligrams of

1811
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:56,850
THC per day to try to fight the cancer

1812
01:18:54,930 --> 01:18:59,039
and you do that for at least 90 days

1813
01:18:56,850 --> 01:19:02,670
yeah I mean you know I know that sounds

1814
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:04,170
intense and so I'll say this if it's for

1815
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:07,859
our loved ones or whatever the case is

1816
01:19:04,170 --> 01:19:10,920
taking it via suppository we'll bypass

1817
01:19:07,859 --> 01:19:14,339
that feeling of you eating you know a

1818
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:17,130
gram plus a day our bodies will still

1819
01:19:14,340 --> 01:19:19,699
take it and absorb it and we'll get all

1820
01:19:17,130 --> 01:19:23,039
the cancer killing qualities of the THC

1821
01:19:19,699 --> 01:19:24,779
without that effect of it going through

1822
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:26,729
our digestive system and then into our

1823
01:19:24,779 --> 01:19:29,699
bloodstream you know you'll probably get

1824
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:32,099
more of it yeah and you get it absorbed

1825
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:34,050
quicker okay without it it's pretty

1826
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,100
amazing how that works you know and

1827
01:19:34,050 --> 01:19:38,349
we're not talking about just putting

1828
01:19:35,100 --> 01:19:39,820
some hash or buds in your but you guys

1829
01:19:38,349 --> 01:19:41,560
now it's got to be activated it's

1830
01:19:39,819 --> 01:19:43,719
probably some hash oil with some coconut

1831
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:45,550
oil inside of a pill oh yeah special

1832
01:19:43,719 --> 01:19:47,739
pill and then you have to obviously know

1833
01:19:45,550 --> 01:19:50,560
where you're placing it so it goes into

1834
01:19:47,738 --> 01:19:53,289
your tract and so on and so forth and I

1835
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,969
don't know too specific but you know if

1836
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:57,760
you guys are curious about that again

1837
01:19:54,969 --> 01:19:59,859
you know ask me I'm more than happy to

1838
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,770
go into that if you want to do an

1839
01:19:59,859 --> 01:20:05,529
episode on gastrointestinal you know

1840
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:08,619
side effects and things with CBD we can

1841
01:20:05,529 --> 01:20:10,118
totally do that but this guy lives like

1842
01:20:08,618 --> 01:20:14,738
15 minutes away from me now you guys

1843
01:20:10,118 --> 01:20:16,809
will be questions yeah definitely I'm

1844
01:20:14,738 --> 01:20:19,328
more than happy to you know help in any

1845
01:20:16,810 --> 01:20:22,570
way I can but yeah at least a thousand

1846
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:24,429
grams a day obviously a lot of people

1847
01:20:22,569 --> 01:20:26,880
don't have that advantage of knowing

1848
01:20:24,429 --> 01:20:29,170
someone who can make the suppositories

1849
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,849
maybe that's something I can work on in

1850
01:20:29,170 --> 01:20:33,250
the future and try to just you know

1851
01:20:30,849 --> 01:20:35,529
create you know put something out there

1852
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:39,368
is a little you know formula for people

1853
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:41,649
to follow but in the meanwhile if you

1854
01:20:39,368 --> 01:20:44,500
can find on the same level there are

1855
01:20:41,649 --> 01:20:46,448
people who make 10,000 milligram cancers

1856
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:49,029
where every dropper is like 400

1857
01:20:46,448 --> 01:20:50,769
milligrams you know if you happen to be

1858
01:20:49,029 --> 01:20:54,988
in Colorado or medical state it's gonna

1859
01:20:50,770 --> 01:20:57,310
be much easier to find these if not

1860
01:20:54,988 --> 01:21:00,759
again you know trying to find the

1861
01:20:57,310 --> 01:21:03,610
material and create that you know that

1862
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:07,270
medicine is essential you know you're

1863
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:10,598
gonna have to basically get your math

1864
01:21:07,270 --> 01:21:12,159
right and it breaks my heart just

1865
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,840
speaking you know about that to other

1866
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:16,149
people knowing that they're in states

1867
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,500
where they can't get their oil tested so

1868
01:21:16,149 --> 01:21:21,399
they can't get the math right on what

1869
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:23,738
the dosage really is and so there's a

1870
01:21:21,399 --> 01:21:25,539
guessing game of if they're lucky enough

1871
01:21:23,738 --> 01:21:27,459
to have the material to make the oil the

1872
01:21:25,539 --> 01:21:28,868
way they need to how the [ __ ] are they

1873
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:30,380
gonna dose it or how the [ __ ] are they

1874
01:21:28,868 --> 01:21:32,809
can accurately like

1875
01:21:30,380 --> 01:21:38,690
and it just upsets me you know for them

1876
01:21:32,810 --> 01:21:40,160
as patients but nevertheless you know

1877
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:42,139
where there's the wool there's a way you

1878
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:43,779
know and lives are more important than

1879
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:47,660
laws in my opinion

1880
01:21:43,779 --> 01:21:50,119
hashtag lives over laws yeah so people

1881
01:21:47,659 --> 01:21:53,019
you know people listening that are you

1882
01:21:50,119 --> 01:21:55,840
know curious about that you know I don't

1883
01:21:53,020 --> 01:22:00,020
support anything that would ever

1884
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:02,420
jeopardize your freedom but if you're

1885
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:03,920
trying to help someone you love that I

1886
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:06,890
will happily share whatever information

1887
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,600
I can you know Fox is here to teach you

1888
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:10,730
will sit down with each and every one of

1889
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:13,670
you and teach you what he knows if

1890
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:15,469
that's what's needed pretty much so we

1891
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:17,149
talked about something with cancer what

1892
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:18,890
about if you've just got like I've got

1893
01:22:17,149 --> 01:22:27,019
some knee inflammation I work hard my

1894
01:22:18,890 --> 01:22:29,750
body you know at this age what would you

1895
01:22:27,020 --> 01:22:34,130
recommend teacher wise for a guy in my

1896
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:35,750
condition um honestly like one the ones

1897
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:39,289
are the way to go like one to one so

1898
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:41,569
when you get off of work and a high CBD

1899
01:22:39,289 --> 01:22:44,449
low THC you know if you need to take it

1900
01:22:41,569 --> 01:22:46,880
throughout the day you know it it'll

1901
01:22:44,449 --> 01:22:48,409
prevent any inflammation if it's towards

1902
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:52,000
the end of the day it'll help bring

1903
01:22:48,409 --> 01:22:54,590
anything down that you have it'll help

1904
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,689
relax your muscles so if you're stiff

1905
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:58,010
you know you you know you won't have

1906
01:22:56,689 --> 01:23:00,619
that stiffness

1907
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:03,590
I think CBD is a great way to start in

1908
01:23:00,619 --> 01:23:05,930
the morning especially do you juice or

1909
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:08,600
do you you know are you like crap lately

1910
01:23:05,930 --> 01:23:10,760
honest truth a vegetarian that eats like

1911
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:23,220
crap that's okay it's all you're my

1912
01:23:10,760 --> 01:23:26,279
favorite that's good

1913
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:26,279
[Music]

1914
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:30,719
shoot at Toy Fair and that's all right I

1915
01:23:28,649 --> 01:23:34,378
can reroute us do you recommend

1916
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:36,899
utilizing reclaim in teacher or edible

1917
01:23:34,378 --> 01:23:39,418
form okay so yeah let's be honest you

1918
01:23:36,899 --> 01:23:41,280
know if you I would suggest if you you

1919
01:23:39,418 --> 01:23:43,469
know medicating or whatever you

1920
01:23:41,279 --> 01:23:44,868
dropdowns are essential for collecting

1921
01:23:43,469 --> 01:23:47,668
reclaim because you don't want to

1922
01:23:44,868 --> 01:23:49,918
collect some reclaim that's had water

1923
01:23:47,668 --> 01:23:54,479
through it and have to miss the whole

1924
01:23:49,918 --> 01:23:56,038
process but anyways yes it's been proven

1925
01:23:54,479 --> 01:24:01,590
that you know I've seen reclaim test

1926
01:23:56,038 --> 01:24:03,748
high as 63 percent you know THC it's not

1927
01:24:01,590 --> 01:24:06,208
fully activated but at that point it

1928
01:24:03,748 --> 01:24:09,228
pretty you know recollecting it and

1929
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:11,698
putting into container and then you know

1930
01:24:09,229 --> 01:24:13,378
activating it for a bit longer well I

1931
01:24:11,698 --> 01:24:16,018
mean they create it's great food good

1932
01:24:13,378 --> 01:24:18,418
you know clean it up properly make sure

1933
01:24:16,019 --> 01:24:21,958
all the moistures out of it you know add

1934
01:24:18,418 --> 01:24:23,628
your oil carrier you know you're a fat

1935
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:26,099
carrier whatever you want caught and

1936
01:24:23,628 --> 01:24:27,538
you're good to go on your edibles you

1937
01:24:26,099 --> 01:24:29,399
know or your capsules for that matter

1938
01:24:27,538 --> 01:24:31,559
you keep talking about activating can

1939
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:34,530
you teach us about decarboxylation and

1940
01:24:31,559 --> 01:24:37,918
activations okay so decarboxylation d

1941
01:24:34,529 --> 01:24:41,099
carving your oil so depending on whether

1942
01:24:37,918 --> 01:24:42,538
you're doing for CBD t a man is gonna be

1943
01:24:41,099 --> 01:24:47,578
pissed that's pesetas scholar with her

1944
01:24:42,538 --> 01:24:50,759
like a month ago alright so when your d

1945
01:24:47,578 --> 01:24:52,918
carbon for certain oils you candy carb

1946
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:57,208
for a more sedative oil you know like

1947
01:24:52,918 --> 01:25:00,179
you can convert CBD or THC oil onto cbn

1948
01:24:57,208 --> 01:25:02,188
and it's just like it's beyond sedative

1949
01:25:00,179 --> 01:25:04,469
i mean it's beyond indica plus you know

1950
01:25:02,189 --> 01:25:07,429
so it's like sleepy time for sure okay

1951
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:11,128
like sleepy time tea time to do you know

1952
01:25:07,429 --> 01:25:13,050
which is great or you know you can do

1953
01:25:11,128 --> 01:25:16,979
shorter d curve x at different

1954
01:25:13,050 --> 01:25:19,019
temperatures to stay within that not

1955
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:23,399
break that acid barrier so when you

1956
01:25:19,019 --> 01:25:26,789
decarboxylate something there's in oil d

1957
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:28,919
carboxylic acid which accounts for a

1958
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:30,898
certain percentage so when you do that

1959
01:25:28,918 --> 01:25:32,010
you're gonna obtain a loss it's like

1960
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:32,680
when it's cool you're not going to

1961
01:25:32,010 --> 01:25:34,539
notice it

1962
01:25:32,680 --> 01:25:36,760
but you need to know like you know when

1963
01:25:34,539 --> 01:25:39,069
you see the bubbles coming up out of

1964
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:41,699
your oil and stuff that's D carbolic

1965
01:25:39,069 --> 01:25:45,729
acid you know coming up and you know

1966
01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:48,039
leaving you know the oil so that you you

1967
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:51,279
know a lot of people assume that that

1968
01:25:48,039 --> 01:25:53,140
it's solvent or something you know

1969
01:25:51,279 --> 01:25:54,670
arises but if you started with clean oil

1970
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:58,360
that's not the case if you've already

1971
01:25:54,670 --> 01:26:00,909
got that there's no solvent like you

1972
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:03,250
know depending on the situation and then

1973
01:26:00,909 --> 01:26:05,739
I'm actually was starts decarboxylated

1974
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:07,329
all the solvent list stuff so I've never

1975
01:26:05,739 --> 01:26:09,639
really done a lot of that except you

1976
01:26:07,329 --> 01:26:13,000
know focused on butane extractions

1977
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:14,289
mostly or isolate concentrates so it'll

1978
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,819
be interesting to see I don't think you

1979
01:26:14,289 --> 01:26:19,210
should be too different with the rosin

1980
01:26:15,819 --> 01:26:21,219
but yes wouldn't you think the rosin has

1981
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:22,689
kind of already activated a little since

1982
01:26:21,220 --> 01:26:25,240
it's been through so much heat see

1983
01:26:22,689 --> 01:26:27,129
that's the thing I'm taking you know

1984
01:26:25,239 --> 01:26:28,599
half grams from all these different

1985
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:30,329
presses and I want to get them tested

1986
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:32,829
for that reason but from what I've seen

1987
01:26:30,329 --> 01:26:36,100
even from like soil ground stuff and

1988
01:26:32,829 --> 01:26:38,289
other people I haven't seen it's not

1989
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:41,350
fully activated okay even the chips come

1990
01:26:38,289 --> 01:26:43,420
in at like fit like that raw reclaim the

1991
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:46,180
rosin ships are coming in at like 30 to

1992
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:49,480
50 percent you know you can do an ISO

1993
01:26:46,180 --> 01:26:51,490
soak or even better what I would do

1994
01:26:49,479 --> 01:26:53,289
personally if you guys to the rosin you

1995
01:26:51,489 --> 01:26:55,599
guys are big collectors is to

1996
01:26:53,289 --> 01:26:57,729
cannabutter with your rosin chips you

1997
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:59,320
know because that's do you gonna you can

1998
01:26:57,729 --> 01:27:01,959
break it all down almost like a mulch

1999
01:26:59,319 --> 01:27:03,609
and just you know double up on your

2000
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:06,970
cheesecloth and your filtering you know

2001
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:08,710
if you're OCD like me and it'll make

2002
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:10,960
some great butter for edibles like

2003
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:12,819
hands-down announced tonight real good

2004
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:16,739
body I use it all

2005
01:27:12,819 --> 01:27:20,439
no absolutely I'm a total fan of an

2006
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:22,119
advocate of using the whole plant that's

2007
01:27:20,439 --> 01:27:24,789
why we're actually growing some of them

2008
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:27,219
with just water straight water no needs

2009
01:27:24,789 --> 01:27:29,590
so that we can juice those

2010
01:27:27,219 --> 01:27:37,829
this couple of sweets you know and we

2011
01:27:29,590 --> 01:27:42,210
can say like no animal by-products at

2012
01:27:37,829 --> 01:27:44,738
I'm going to pull something up so that

2013
01:27:42,210 --> 01:27:47,409
you can get a little specific with the

2014
01:27:44,738 --> 01:27:48,339
decarboxylation like it we're gonna

2015
01:27:47,409 --> 01:27:49,719
learn a whole bunch of stuff here you

2016
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:51,219
guys be patient while he searches he's

2017
01:27:49,719 --> 01:27:53,198
got a little bit of information to pull

2018
01:27:51,219 --> 01:27:54,609
up for us so you guys can use your

2019
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:57,159
reclaim and he mentioned using a drop

2020
01:27:54,609 --> 01:27:58,988
down we often forget that some of our

2021
01:27:57,159 --> 01:28:00,340
friends are not dabbers they don't dad

2022
01:27:58,988 --> 01:28:01,689
daily and they might be in other states

2023
01:28:00,340 --> 01:28:05,319
for the toilets flush the wrong way and

2024
01:28:01,689 --> 01:28:06,429
the weed grows upside down yeah our

2025
01:28:05,319 --> 01:28:07,869
Australian friends I might have said

2026
01:28:06,430 --> 01:28:10,449
States to and he's in another country

2027
01:28:07,869 --> 01:28:12,340
that's not a state that's really had

2028
01:28:10,448 --> 01:28:14,589
states like I stupidly thought it was

2029
01:28:12,340 --> 01:28:22,989
just Australian all of us yeah there's

2030
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:25,029
like no parts of a drop-down we'll go on

2031
01:28:22,988 --> 01:28:26,709
you're normally where the nail would go

2032
01:28:25,029 --> 01:28:29,590
you put a drop down in there it's a

2033
01:28:26,710 --> 01:28:31,840
piece of glass it comes out where the

2034
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:33,880
nail would go and it angles down and

2035
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:35,739
then it angles back up to where your

2036
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,270
nail or your email could go on it and it

2037
01:28:35,738 --> 01:28:39,698
just puts the nail a couple inches away

2038
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:41,739
from your face and it also makes a nice

2039
01:28:39,698 --> 01:28:43,839
place to catch the reclaim oil so that

2040
01:28:41,738 --> 01:28:45,039
it doesn't end up in your rig water so

2041
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:46,590
that's what a drop down is when he was

2042
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:48,550
talking about a drop down earlier

2043
01:28:46,590 --> 01:28:50,619
shout-out to my friend Rasta said in

2044
01:28:48,550 --> 01:28:54,100
Australia thanks for the support it was

2045
01:28:50,619 --> 01:28:55,329
good seeing you on Facebook live fox is

2046
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:58,750
diligently searching for this

2047
01:28:55,329 --> 01:29:05,760
information here okay so we're gonna

2048
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:09,760
talk a tea tea so boiling point

2049
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:10,930
dirty tea would be 15 degrees Fahrenheit

2050
01:29:09,760 --> 01:29:13,930
and that's what that that would start to

2051
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:17,739
boil off okay so and that's when it

2052
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:19,100
starts to convert yes and now converted

2053
01:29:17,738 --> 01:29:21,679
to

2054
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:23,750
if there's any CBD to convert to that's

2055
01:29:21,680 --> 01:29:27,310
what I work work but let's go back to

2056
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:32,449
the THC so you would want to be between

2057
01:29:27,310 --> 01:29:36,050
290 and 310 degrees Fahrenheit 290 and

2058
01:29:32,449 --> 01:29:41,779
310 yeah because that's between the CBCA

2059
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:44,480
and THC barrier CBCA is another compound

2060
01:29:41,779 --> 01:29:46,309
we can that's a whole nother three-hour

2061
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:48,829
conversation but we can get into that so

2062
01:29:46,310 --> 01:29:50,630
we'll have that one yeah that's fun but

2063
01:29:48,829 --> 01:29:52,609
such as dark talk to me but anyways

2064
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:55,130
getting back to that so that will

2065
01:29:52,609 --> 01:29:58,069
activate your Delta 9 which is obviously

2066
01:29:55,130 --> 01:30:00,289
your Bobby wood it's also an

2067
01:29:58,069 --> 01:30:02,630
anti-inflammatory appetite stimulant

2068
01:30:00,289 --> 01:30:05,449
antiemetic anti profile Erick and

2069
01:30:02,630 --> 01:30:08,699
antioxidant on top of you know all the

2070
01:30:05,449 --> 01:30:10,340
wonderful things that does with cancer

2071
01:30:08,699 --> 01:30:15,109
[Music]

2072
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:17,930
that being said depending on how long

2073
01:30:15,109 --> 01:30:20,149
you go on the D carb you can over you

2074
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:23,240
know you can burn your oil so you have

2075
01:30:20,149 --> 01:30:27,349
to be careful of that you know going for

2076
01:30:23,239 --> 01:30:30,800
the longer D carbs but I've G carb boils

2077
01:30:27,350 --> 01:30:32,660
for you know three hours six hours eight

2078
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,250
hours just to see just to get that C

2079
01:30:32,659 --> 01:30:37,189
word at the Senate Senate of effect

2080
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:39,289
comes out where the burnout you know

2081
01:30:37,189 --> 01:30:40,489
we're really warm by burning things out

2082
01:30:39,289 --> 01:30:44,800
you know

2083
01:30:40,489 --> 01:30:47,689
and I you know you can decarbonise a

2084
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,699
ninety minutes you know and but honestly

2085
01:30:47,689 --> 01:30:52,129
I would say 180 minutes is you know a

2086
01:30:49,699 --> 01:30:56,720
good starting point I really like to

2087
01:30:52,130 --> 01:30:58,550
look at it every every [ __ ] every 45 to

2088
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,740
60 minutes to see how it's doing

2089
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:02,150
you know because every oil that you

2090
01:31:00,739 --> 01:31:03,769
start with is different it's not gonna

2091
01:31:02,149 --> 01:31:06,559
be my whole you're using I'm not gonna

2092
01:31:03,770 --> 01:31:09,530
be using your oil so I'll tell you these

2093
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:10,610
you know times and mindsets but just

2094
01:31:09,529 --> 01:31:14,059
keep in mind and keep an eye on

2095
01:31:10,609 --> 01:31:16,519
everything and once all the D carbolic

2096
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:19,789
acid I hope I'm saying that right sorry

2097
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:21,830
from that little medicated you know

2098
01:31:19,789 --> 01:31:25,840
comes out of the oil and what you're

2099
01:31:21,829 --> 01:31:28,489
left with is you know this D carved

2100
01:31:25,840 --> 01:31:30,230
goodness that is fully activated you

2101
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:31,849
know and depending on what temperature

2102
01:31:30,229 --> 01:31:34,669
points that you're hitting you're either

2103
01:31:31,850 --> 01:31:40,610
activating first CBD you're activating

2104
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:42,230
for terpene rich activated oil it all

2105
01:31:40,609 --> 01:31:43,880
depends you know it's like you can just

2106
01:31:42,229 --> 01:31:45,739
play around here temperatures and have a

2107
01:31:43,880 --> 01:31:47,900
completely different product depending

2108
01:31:45,739 --> 01:31:49,849
on what you do how is what so if I had

2109
01:31:47,899 --> 01:31:51,619
some replay if I had my drop-down I had

2110
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:53,320
some reclaim and I had collected a

2111
01:31:51,619 --> 01:31:56,630
substantial amount now I want to

2112
01:31:53,319 --> 01:31:57,949
activate it 2d carbon and I want to get

2113
01:31:56,630 --> 01:32:00,470
it to this temperature how do I do that

2114
01:31:57,949 --> 01:32:02,630
do I just put it in a pyrex dish and

2115
01:32:00,470 --> 01:32:05,930
maybe throw in the oven is there a tech

2116
01:32:02,630 --> 01:32:09,350
to this yeah okay to make it really easy

2117
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:12,170
and just like you can call it low tech

2118
01:32:09,350 --> 01:32:14,690
or whatever so get yourself to Target or

2119
01:32:12,170 --> 01:32:16,699
Walmart or with every year you know I

2120
01:32:14,689 --> 01:32:19,039
don't care who you go to but any place

2121
01:32:16,699 --> 01:32:20,948
that sells Pyrex and try to find small

2122
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:22,510
like

2123
01:32:20,948 --> 01:32:28,589
[ __ ] I don't even know what kind of

2124
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:31,539
little bullet is like a little Pyrex

2125
01:32:28,590 --> 01:32:33,310
little salsa Bowl yeah yeah like like

2126
01:32:31,539 --> 01:32:35,649
like a little pampered chef yeah exactly

2127
01:32:33,310 --> 01:32:37,810
you know some in a few different sizes

2128
01:32:35,649 --> 01:32:39,429
try to get a small one if you can cuz

2129
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:43,570
you know it's just make it easier and

2130
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:46,329
then you can take your drop down when

2131
01:32:43,569 --> 01:32:49,299
it's full or gunked up and take a torch

2132
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:52,090
to it and when I mean that very you know

2133
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:54,390
gently just torch it a little bit until

2134
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:57,449
you can see the oil moving

2135
01:32:54,390 --> 01:33:00,660
excuse me and then you can pour all the

2136
01:32:57,449 --> 01:33:06,899
oil into a little ramekin cup or

2137
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:08,460
whatever yeah the Pyrex ramekin and yeah

2138
01:33:06,899 --> 01:33:11,069
after that you know after you've got

2139
01:33:08,460 --> 01:33:13,170
that all poured in you know be very

2140
01:33:11,069 --> 01:33:15,479
careful not to be no crack your

2141
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:18,029
drop-down you know there's easier ways

2142
01:33:15,479 --> 01:33:21,479
to do you can put the job down in the

2143
01:33:18,029 --> 01:33:23,399
oven and let it get you know warm and

2144
01:33:21,479 --> 01:33:25,739
pour it out or whatever but don't try

2145
01:33:23,399 --> 01:33:27,239
this at home yeah yeah this way just

2146
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:29,069
kind of works a little bit easier you

2147
01:33:27,239 --> 01:33:32,159
know just taking a light little flame to

2148
01:33:29,069 --> 01:33:33,779
it watching the oil move it'll all dump

2149
01:33:32,159 --> 01:33:37,380
out and then you can start getting to

2150
01:33:33,779 --> 01:33:40,289
work on that yeah after you do carpet

2151
01:33:37,380 --> 01:33:42,539
you can you know add your carrier oil I

2152
01:33:40,289 --> 01:33:45,149
always like to so once we've got it into

2153
01:33:42,539 --> 01:33:47,220
the Petri are the the ramekin yeah

2154
01:33:45,149 --> 01:33:49,589
now what do we do with it okay now

2155
01:33:47,220 --> 01:33:51,360
you've got it in there you set your

2156
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:53,550
temperature depending on what you need

2157
01:33:51,359 --> 01:33:56,399
you can actually if you guys want to

2158
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:59,820
learn something you can Google cannabis

2159
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:02,159
activation chart and you'll see a bunch

2160
01:33:59,819 --> 01:34:05,039
of different pictures and graphs and

2161
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:06,689
it'll kind of give you an idea of you

2162
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:08,130
know where you want to go most people

2163
01:34:06,689 --> 01:34:11,489
like I said are just activating you know

2164
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:14,850
for the THC and that's great so you know

2165
01:34:11,489 --> 01:34:16,769
like I said so let's say an even 300 180

2166
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:19,079
minutes you know just pop at the oven

2167
01:34:16,770 --> 01:34:22,440
yeah pop it in the oven

2168
01:34:19,079 --> 01:34:24,449
let's do its thing some people like to

2169
01:34:22,439 --> 01:34:25,289
add the carrier oil before they D carve

2170
01:34:24,449 --> 01:34:30,059
it

2171
01:34:25,289 --> 01:34:31,500
I like to decarbonize my carrier oil to

2172
01:34:30,060 --> 01:34:35,039
it you know whether it's gonna be off

2173
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:37,770
kado coconut grapeseed flinch you know

2174
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:40,069
whatever grapeseed oils and some flowers

2175
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:42,270
you know there's a bunch they each

2176
01:34:40,069 --> 01:34:43,529
depending on the patient whatever the

2177
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,460
hell that are the right to you but all

2178
01:34:43,529 --> 01:34:47,519
right there's there's something

2179
01:34:44,460 --> 01:34:51,029
thankfully guaranteed a fat that your

2180
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:52,980
body can take yeah so needless to say

2181
01:34:51,029 --> 01:34:55,559
you know there's ways around whatever

2182
01:34:52,979 --> 01:34:58,459
but yeah so you put it in the oven you

2183
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:00,710
know you set your time you check on it

2184
01:34:58,460 --> 01:35:02,229
once it's ready you know you

2185
01:35:00,710 --> 01:35:05,708
[Music]

2186
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:10,599
oh and let's back up a little bit before

2187
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:12,998
the oven wait out no how much did you

2188
01:35:10,599 --> 01:35:15,760
worry what that makes it super easy so

2189
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:17,679
you're working with seven grams three

2190
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:19,449
grams or whatever you know how much

2191
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,190
coconut oil you're gonna put it you want

2192
01:35:19,448 --> 01:35:24,098
to weigh that out too that will make it

2193
01:35:21,189 --> 01:35:27,248
a lot easier okay have a weight specific

2194
01:35:24,099 --> 01:35:29,440
ratio that you can work with sometimes I

2195
01:35:27,248 --> 01:35:32,469
go really low you know like one gram to

2196
01:35:29,439 --> 01:35:35,638
seven grams you know amber or less you

2197
01:35:32,469 --> 01:35:38,198
know just to kind of get it to this

2198
01:35:35,639 --> 01:35:41,219
wonderful you know all for consistency

2199
01:35:38,198 --> 01:35:46,359
depending on what we're doing you know

2200
01:35:41,219 --> 01:35:47,408
that being said once that's added once

2201
01:35:46,359 --> 01:35:49,118
once you have your numbers and

2202
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:51,129
everything's weighed do everything we

2203
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:54,368
talked about set it said them in your

2204
01:35:51,130 --> 01:35:56,529
petri dish or your ramekin cup put it in

2205
01:35:54,368 --> 01:36:00,399
the oven D carbon for X amount of time

2206
01:35:56,529 --> 01:36:03,578
add your oil make sure that you know

2207
01:36:00,399 --> 01:36:04,839
it's it's bonded that the sat separated

2208
01:36:03,578 --> 01:36:07,569
you can put it back in the oven for just

2209
01:36:04,840 --> 01:36:10,208
a little while and then you know follow

2210
01:36:07,569 --> 01:36:12,849
the recipe of what to whatever you're

2211
01:36:10,208 --> 01:36:14,679
trying to do capsules if you're trying

2212
01:36:12,849 --> 01:36:17,019
to you know keep the oil you can pull it

2213
01:36:14,679 --> 01:36:19,208
the syringe you know and keep it you

2214
01:36:17,019 --> 01:36:21,119
know keep it ready for until you need it

2215
01:36:19,208 --> 01:36:23,738
or you know whatever you're trying to do

2216
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:27,759
nice those syringes are sketchy looking

2217
01:36:23,738 --> 01:36:29,078
yeah but sometimes that's the best way

2218
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:30,610
that you can apply it to whatever you're

2219
01:36:29,078 --> 01:36:32,799
doing yeah or something you know the

2220

01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:27,460
had on cannabis and pregnancy and

2244
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:28,929
honestly as a STONER dude I really

2245
01:37:27,460 --> 01:37:30,699
haven't thought too much about cannabis

2246
01:37:28,930 --> 01:37:31,840
and pregnancy I don't feel that that's a

2247
01:37:30,699 --> 01:37:33,639
lot of my business

2248
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:35,350
I shouldn't be preaching anything about

2249
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:39,400
that but do you have an opinion on it

2250
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:47,079
yeah I do and first of all let me start

2251
01:37:39,399 --> 01:37:48,639
by saying I'm not one to say [ __ ] but

2252
01:37:47,079 --> 01:37:51,760
I'll tell you my experience with it so

2253
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:54,660
my ex-wife my child

2254
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:57,220
[Music]

2255
01:37:54,659 --> 01:37:58,899
just she wasn't able to work she was

2256
01:37:57,220 --> 01:38:00,699
able to work at her job and she was a

2257
01:37:58,899 --> 01:38:03,250
painter at the time

2258
01:38:00,699 --> 01:38:05,679
it was it was really affecting her what

2259
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:07,840
helped you know was some cannabis in the

2260
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:11,920
morning you know this is we weren't this

2261
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:14,020
is this is back Oh way back yeah eight

2262
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:17,350
nine years ago you know I was 10 years

2263
01:38:14,020 --> 01:38:19,270
ago so people weren't up on the clean

2264
01:38:17,350 --> 01:38:20,829
oil game the way that we are for the

2265
01:38:19,270 --> 01:38:23,200
most part you know Miami what if the

2266
01:38:20,829 --> 01:38:25,390
case is lucky to get good fire whatever

2267
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:28,769
the case is and that's what it was

2268
01:38:25,390 --> 01:38:30,940
so at first it kind of made me

2269
01:38:28,770 --> 01:38:35,050
interesting to think you know how it

2270
01:38:30,939 --> 01:38:36,759
affect our child but seeing you know my

2271
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:38,980
partner in pain and not being able to

2272
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,210
work or literally I'd be able to stand

2273
01:38:38,979 --> 01:38:41,409
up shaker she would have to run a

2274
01:38:40,210 --> 01:38:43,270
bathroom and throw up

2275
01:38:41,409 --> 01:38:45,099
cannabis is what helped you know like

2276
01:38:43,270 --> 01:38:47,170
literally just a single puff or two

2277
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:49,210
would hold her over for six to eight

2278
01:38:47,170 --> 01:38:51,909
hours you know it was awesome it was not

2279
01:38:49,210 --> 01:38:54,670
like a heavy you know doshas knee it was

2280
01:38:51,909 --> 01:38:57,579
really even back then and made it help

2281
01:38:54,670 --> 01:38:59,380
me see medical attributes that we

2282
01:38:57,579 --> 01:39:05,010
weren't seeing you know beyond getting

2283
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:09,270
high so my opinion on it is ladies I

2284
01:39:05,010 --> 01:39:09,270
when it comes to the dabbing you know

2285
01:39:11,489 --> 01:39:16,260
say that I approve of anything made with

2286
01:39:13,710 --> 01:39:20,609
solvents because we've yet to see these

2287
01:39:16,260 --> 01:39:22,619
effects on infants and I mean as adults

2288
01:39:20,609 --> 01:39:24,960
you know we we did we do them and you

2289
01:39:22,619 --> 01:39:26,939
know regardless of whether it's clean to

2290
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:28,890
the states and ERDs and i mean you know

2291
01:39:26,939 --> 01:39:33,059
you've seen the resident me with love

2292
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:35,280
you know i love live resident and body

2293
01:39:33,060 --> 01:39:36,960
verses that few ounce fetus yeah

2294
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:39,479
affected completely different thinking

2295
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:41,520
residual solvent absolutely so when it

2296
01:39:39,479 --> 01:39:43,589
comes to that you we can talk dry sift

2297
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:46,110
bubble and at the same time you know

2298
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:48,449
unless that bubble hash or the full

2299
01:39:46,109 --> 01:39:52,369
melts has been microbially tested or

2300
01:39:48,449 --> 01:39:55,260
anything like you know you have to be

2301
01:39:52,369 --> 01:39:57,720
beyond anal about your meds you know and

2302
01:39:55,260 --> 01:40:01,470
i can't stress that enough you know so

2303
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:03,060
so if we had some clean Rasta jeff grown

2304
01:40:01,470 --> 01:40:04,470
medicine that you know it was clean it

2305
01:40:03,060 --> 01:40:05,700
wasn't sprayed with anything funky it

2306
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:07,949
was drawn with love with organic

2307
01:40:05,699 --> 01:40:10,859
nutrients and then i harvested it and i

2308
01:40:07,949 --> 01:40:11,970
passed it off to Fox and Fox made some

2309
01:40:10,859 --> 01:40:14,159
clean but we'll just stick with the

2310
01:40:11,970 --> 01:40:16,800
flower yeah at that point would you

2311
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:19,559
approve of pregnant mom smoking a little

2312
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:23,640
flower yeah yeah of course and you know

2313
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:26,390
my ex girlfriend got pregnant and you

2314
01:40:23,640 --> 01:40:28,980
this is after we got separated and it

2315
01:40:26,390 --> 01:40:32,630
tear me up because she was a hard court

2316
01:40:28,979 --> 01:40:35,129
diver and I'm like but at the same time

2317
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:37,230
she's a medical patient or in regard to

2318
01:40:35,130 --> 01:40:39,630
cancer survivor and she's hearing and

2319
01:40:37,229 --> 01:40:43,559
having her second child Who am I to say

2320
01:40:39,630 --> 01:40:45,890
because I'm not sure you know that's the

2321
01:40:43,560 --> 01:40:48,360
other thing too that with my opinion so

2322
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:50,280
and she ended up having a beautiful

2323
01:40:48,359 --> 01:40:52,799
little girl like just the

2324
01:40:50,279 --> 01:40:55,559
picture-perfect you know picture of it

2325
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:58,770
of a little beautiful trial and can't

2326
01:40:55,560 --> 01:41:01,260
say [ __ ] same with my daughter I ended

2327
01:40:58,770 --> 01:41:03,840
up with a gorgeous little girl I'm super

2328
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:07,140
grateful and like nothing in my little

2329
01:41:03,840 --> 01:41:08,789
kids brightest [ __ ] you know I'm super

2330
01:41:07,140 --> 01:41:10,350
blessed to have a little smartass

2331
01:41:08,789 --> 01:41:12,119
knucklehead on my hands I've got a

2332
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:13,170
smartass twelve-year-old daughter as

2333
01:41:12,119 --> 01:41:15,569
well

2334
01:41:13,170 --> 01:41:18,359
her mob didn't consume much cannabis

2335
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:20,460
during pregnancy because her claim was

2336
01:41:18,359 --> 01:41:23,130
that when she inhaled smoke she's

2337
01:41:20,460 --> 01:41:24,480
depriving the fetus of oxygen so that

2338
01:41:23,130 --> 01:41:26,279
was why she didn't want to smoke but she

2339
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:28,199
did have a little bit of a edible if I

2340
01:41:26,279 --> 01:41:29,609
remember one time well you know there's

2341
01:41:28,199 --> 01:41:31,349
been like posts and stuff I've been

2342
01:41:29,609 --> 01:41:32,909
seeing I follow some of these mom groups

2343
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:35,100
and stuff because of the CBD stuff

2344
01:41:32,909 --> 01:41:37,199
obviously and there's obviously a lot of

2345
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:40,560
post about the pregnancy and smoking and

2346
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:43,649
fetuses don't they're in the womb you

2347
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:48,060
know their lungs are developing they're

2348
01:41:43,649 --> 01:41:56,789
not taking in oxygen from the from the

2349
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:59,190
air outside they're taking that's that's

2350
01:41:56,789 --> 01:42:02,250
been proven so there goes that to the

2351
01:41:59,189 --> 01:42:03,989
debate and I just think with everything

2352
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:05,789
that we've been lied to about cannabis

2353
01:42:03,989 --> 01:42:07,590
as well you know like you know what's

2354
01:42:05,789 --> 01:42:11,399
upon a time Philip Morris it was okay

2355
01:42:07,590 --> 01:42:13,440
for you to have smoke you know that

2356
01:42:11,399 --> 01:42:15,479
regard I'd love for there to be some

2357
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:18,089
research done on it you know I would

2358
01:42:15,479 --> 01:42:19,889
never in my opinion would I ever turn

2359
01:42:18,090 --> 01:42:22,860
away a patient that was pregnant because

2360
01:42:19,890 --> 01:42:24,780
from me because of my opinion now I

2361
01:42:22,859 --> 01:42:26,880
would totally do everything I can to

2362
01:42:24,779 --> 01:42:29,099
offer them the cleanest meds to dab or

2363
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:32,810
smoke or you know preferably vaporize

2364
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:36,030
you know just me personally I would just

2365
01:42:32,810 --> 01:42:38,580
go out of the way to suggest the

2366
01:42:36,029 --> 01:42:41,909
cleanest forms of medication edibles

2367
01:42:38,579 --> 01:42:45,300
tinctures vaporization you know that you

2368
01:42:41,909 --> 01:42:46,800
can provide I like your approach let the

2369
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:48,239
women do what women feel like they

2370
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:51,570
should do because we're not women nor

2371
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:55,289
doctors yeah so to my listener who asked

2372
01:42:51,569 --> 01:42:57,659
what we feel about it I'm trying to find

2373
01:42:55,289 --> 01:42:59,010
some information on it there's not all

2374
01:42:57,659 --> 01:43:01,380
the information is conflicting there's

2375
01:42:59,010 --> 01:43:03,360
no real studies there are hearsay

2376
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:05,460
studies I think but I don't think

2377
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:06,960
there's any like actual this lady smoked

2378
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:08,550
all nine months of her pregnancy and

2379
01:43:06,960 --> 01:43:10,710
this lady didn't hear his baby a and

2380
01:43:08,550 --> 01:43:13,380
baby B I haven't seen that yet well

2381
01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:15,989
there's been a study done about testing

2382
01:43:13,380 --> 01:43:17,940
breast milk and they took the breast

2383
01:43:15,989 --> 01:43:19,859
milk of women who never [ __ ] smoked

2384
01:43:17,939 --> 01:43:21,960
cannabis in their damn lives let alone

2385
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:24,239
in the generation like where your head

2386
01:43:21,960 --> 01:43:29,420
and they found natural cannabinoids in

2387
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:32,340
breast milk so here's my theory you know

2388
01:43:29,420 --> 01:43:34,470
there's people that don't need to smoke

2389
01:43:32,340 --> 01:43:36,600
cannabis or don't have a big involvement

2390
01:43:34,470 --> 01:43:38,880
with it and then I look at them like

2391
01:43:36,600 --> 01:43:40,770
health wise and they seem to have a

2392
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:43,680
healthy endocannabinoid system that's

2393
01:43:40,770 --> 01:43:45,270
self-regulating there's no problem you

2394
01:43:43,680 --> 01:43:47,369
know whatever the case is that's

2395
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:50,520
obviously not the case of some of us you

2396
01:43:47,369 --> 01:43:52,619
know as we need to regulate whatever

2397
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:53,850
whether we need to work or the we need

2398
01:43:52,619 --> 01:43:55,859
to relax whether we need to calm down

2399
01:43:53,850 --> 01:43:59,090
and we do it with this beautiful plant

2400
01:43:55,859 --> 01:44:01,859
because our body's inability and

2401
01:43:59,090 --> 01:44:06,119
deficiency of natural reoccurring

2402
01:44:01,859 --> 01:44:08,369
cannabinoids that's a whole other

2403
01:44:06,119 --> 01:44:09,390
[ __ ] conversation but back to my

2404
01:44:08,369 --> 01:44:10,680
point

2405
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:14,010
so there's natural cannabinoids in

2406
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:16,369
breast milk a can or heard to when

2407
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:19,710
you're doing having clean medicine to

2408
01:44:16,369 --> 01:44:22,590
enrich and nourish your natural you know

2409
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:24,899
milk to give your offspring if it's only

2410
01:44:22,590 --> 01:44:27,449
building and helping them have better

2411
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:30,079
antibodies and helping them build better

2412
01:44:27,449 --> 01:44:32,609
you know immune systems and whatnot and

2413
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:36,840
also giving them a better chance of not

2414
01:44:32,609 --> 01:44:39,899
having deficiencies in those senses so

2415
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:41,909
yeah again I'm all for more study yeah

2416
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:43,379
of that you know the main point of life

2417
01:44:41,909 --> 01:44:45,389
is to survive so I think once that

2418
01:44:43,380 --> 01:44:46,859
child's born it will consume that breast

2419
01:44:45,390 --> 01:44:48,390
milk that breast milk has can have a

2420
01:44:46,859 --> 01:44:49,649
noise in it what happens when you

2421
01:44:48,390 --> 01:44:51,150
consume a lot of cannabinoids you get

2422
01:44:49,649 --> 01:44:52,019
hungrier right yeah so what are you

2423
01:44:51,149 --> 01:44:53,549
gonna want to do you're gonna want to

2424
01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:55,950
consume more breast milk what are you

2425
01:44:53,550 --> 01:44:57,750
gonna do grow stronger yet stronger then

2426
01:44:55,949 --> 01:45:00,599
what's it gonna want or breast milk yeah

2427
01:44:57,750 --> 01:45:01,680
yeah so hopefully she'll be on TV but

2428
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:04,079
hey great for the baby

2429
01:45:01,680 --> 01:45:05,640
hey yeah well so there's my two cents on

2430
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:07,439
that I'm sorry if it's like a little

2431
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:09,630
awkward about it but you know like your

2432
01:45:07,439 --> 01:45:11,939
approach thank you you know I you know

2433
01:45:09,630 --> 01:45:13,650
I'd love to see more research done I'd

2434
01:45:11,939 --> 01:45:16,679
love to see here's what I'd love to see

2435
01:45:13,649 --> 01:45:20,239
I'd love to see more moms justifying the

2436
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:20,240
science of it and being more

2437
01:45:20,630 --> 01:45:28,739
explaining explaining the situation

2438
01:45:23,010 --> 01:45:30,539
better as opposed to just like taking a

2439
01:45:28,738 --> 01:45:32,819
picture of their kid out in their kids

2440
01:45:30,538 --> 01:45:34,198
mouth and like saying that they're you

2441
01:45:32,819 --> 01:45:35,880
know opposing something like do you no

2442
01:45:34,198 --> 01:45:37,589
one cares we're beyond that let's get to

2443
01:45:35,880 --> 01:45:39,090
you know and I'm talking about cannabis

2444
01:45:37,590 --> 01:45:41,819
pops not just moms in general you know

2445
01:45:39,090 --> 01:45:51,389
like I get it and don't care like three

2446
01:45:41,819 --> 01:45:53,819
two titty whatever anyways people that

2447
01:45:51,389 --> 01:45:56,190
are afraid of cannabis exactly do you

2448
01:45:53,819 --> 01:45:58,710
know all four women doing that with

2449
01:45:56,189 --> 01:46:00,658
cannabis you know and like I said

2450
01:45:58,710 --> 01:46:03,328
there's joked insures [ __ ]

2451
01:46:00,658 --> 01:46:05,279
transdermal uh I'd have a mom that used

2452
01:46:03,328 --> 01:46:07,198
like natural hemp products to not get

2453
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:09,389
any [ __ ] stretch marks and she blew

2454
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:11,189
up like a damn whale and didn't stretch

2455
01:46:09,389 --> 01:46:15,230
your [ __ ] skin at once I'm sorry to

2456
01:46:11,189 --> 01:46:18,118
be blunt about it not use her name but

2457
01:46:15,229 --> 01:46:20,129
yeah and but just saying you know even

2458
01:46:18,118 --> 01:46:22,529
on a hip on a hemp CBD scale you can

2459
01:46:20,130 --> 01:46:24,900
just help your skin again the a Kenobi

2460
01:46:22,529 --> 01:46:27,359
of oral pregnancy so why not you want to

2461
01:46:24,899 --> 01:46:28,649
be comfortable you know you want you

2462
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:32,248
don't want to be stressed at all at that

2463
01:46:28,649 --> 01:46:33,808
time so if cannabis to CBD products you

2464
01:46:32,248 --> 01:46:36,300
know can help you do that and they can

2465
01:46:33,809 --> 01:46:38,219
you know I think that's a lot better

2466
01:46:36,300 --> 01:46:41,420
than I don't really know the science of

2467
01:46:38,219 --> 01:46:44,578
prenatal drugs but they make me a little

2468
01:46:41,420 --> 01:46:46,559
yeah with all the vaccinations and all

2469
01:46:44,578 --> 01:46:48,179
the crazy [ __ ] that we have going on

2470
01:46:46,559 --> 01:46:50,429
with autism and other things like that

2471
01:46:48,179 --> 01:46:53,248
it just makes me curious and nervous so

2472
01:46:50,429 --> 01:46:55,408
you know go cannabis go cannabis that is

2473
01:46:53,248 --> 01:46:56,340

and then also I'm gonna just done a

2497
01:47:46,850 --> 01:47:53,570
really quick note I'm gonna be in house

2498
01:47:50,329 --> 01:47:56,449
working with a new company called Athena

2499
01:47:53,569 --> 01:48:01,219
green and it's another breeder that's

2500
01:47:56,449 --> 01:48:03,439
focused on medical strains focusing on

2501
01:48:01,220 --> 01:48:05,570
clusters in migraine headaches Crohn's

2502
01:48:03,439 --> 01:48:07,789
and then I'm working together with the

2503
01:48:05,569 --> 01:48:13,090
stuff I'm doing with my CBD in similar

2504
01:48:07,789 --> 01:48:17,409
regards to help create better medicinal

2505
01:48:13,090 --> 01:48:20,180
attributed strains with good Terps

2506
01:48:17,409 --> 01:48:22,430
just very very simple goal you know so

2507
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:24,560
it's hard to get that good medicine and

2508
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:26,840
good tasting medicine in the same regard

2509
01:48:24,560 --> 01:48:28,220
so that's our goal for the years and

2510
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:35,539
I'll obviously be talking with you about

2511

2631
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:40,119
cuz you're going a little too fast and

2632

my only answer was yes sir cuz I knew I

2633
01:55:40,119 --> 01:55:43,720

yes sir they said can I see your license

2635

2636

2637
01:55:46,329 --> 01:55:50,949
and organized I was like here you go sir

2638
01:55:47,859 --> 01:55:53,349
and he said uh do you have any marijuana

2639
01:55:50,949 --> 01:55:54,789
in the vehicle and I hesitated for a

2640
01:55:53,350 --> 01:55:57,340
minute and I wasn't gonna lie to him I

2641
01:55:54,789 --> 01:55:58,810
was thinking I looked at my backpack and

2642
01:55:57,340 --> 01:56:00,850
I looked to my center console on my car

2643
01:55:58,810 --> 01:56:02,110
then I looked toward the backseat to see

2644
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:03,850
where all my bags were and see what I

2645
01:56:02,109 --> 01:56:05,139
had with me and I looked him straight in

2646
01:56:03,850 --> 01:56:06,940
the face and I said there might be some

2647
01:56:05,140 --> 01:56:08,289
weed in here sir and he kind of looked

2648
01:56:06,939 --> 01:56:10,059
at me weird and I said but I've got a

2649
01:56:08,289 --> 01:56:12,819
medical marijuana card and I assure you

2650
01:56:10,060 --> 01:56:13,930

2651
01:56:12,819 --> 01:56:16,750

2652
01:56:13,930 --> 01:56:19,480

2653
01:56:16,750 --> 01:56:21,579
in there and I said oh and I had my uh

2654
01:56:19,479 --> 01:56:22,809
when you work in a in a legal facility

2655
01:56:21,579 --> 01:56:24,729
here in Colorado you've got to wear a

2656
01:56:22,810 --> 01:56:25,990
badge and happen to have it on me so I

2657
01:56:24,729 --> 01:56:27,549
just showed him my badge real quick I

2658
01:56:25,989 --> 01:56:29,920

2668
01:56:46,329 --> 01:56:49,119
license I'm not wanted or anything I'm

2669
01:56:47,800 --> 01:56:50,770
legit so I just sat there and waited

2670
01:56:49,119 --> 01:56:53,380
actually took a snapchat so if you want

2671
01:56:50,770 --> 01:56:54,910

2672
01:56:53,380 --> 01:56:56,800
snapchat on Facebook there's a picture

2673
01:56:54,909 --> 01:56:58,269
of me being pulled over by this cop so

2674
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,409
he goes and he runs my license he does

2675
01:56:58,270 --> 01:57:00,880
what he's gonna do he's actually pretty

2676
01:56:59,409 --> 01:57:02,470
quick about it a couple times I've been

2677
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:03,609
pulled over and they make you just

2678
01:57:02,470 --> 01:57:04,869
[ __ ] sit there all day make sure

2679
01:57:03,609 --> 01:57:06,849
you're late for work but this guy was

2680
01:57:04,869 --> 01:57:08,800
pretty quick he went he wrote me a

2681
01:57:06,850 --> 01:57:11,200
warning he did not write me a speeding

2682
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:13,449
ticket he wrote me a an official warning

2683
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:15,340
and he told me to send it on the dash to

2684
01:57:13,449 --> 01:57:16,659
remind me to quit speeding so I did that

2685
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:18,369
I've got the warning sitting up on the

2686
01:57:16,659 --> 01:57:19,689
dash so that every time I start to

2687
01:57:18,369 --> 01:57:21,489
getting the left lane to pass somebody

2688
01:57:19,689 --> 01:57:22,719
it reminds me of hey you're gonna get a

2689
01:57:21,489 --> 01:57:25,179
ticket next time because that cop is

2690
01:57:22,720 --> 01:57:26,230
really cool to you last time so I've got

2691
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:27,340
a warning sitting up there I want to

2692
01:57:26,229 --> 01:57:29,319
give a huge shout out to this state

2693
01:57:27,340 --> 01:57:30,909
trooper I'm not gonna say his name but

2694
01:57:29,319 --> 01:57:33,159
shout out to the state trooper he did

2695
01:57:30,909 --> 01:57:35,050
not harass me when I completely wreaked

2696
01:57:33,159 --> 01:57:37,359
of cannabis he did not write me a ticket

2697
01:57:35,050 --> 01:57:39,610
when I was obviously blatantly speeding

2698
01:57:37,359 --> 01:57:39,969
so a big shout out to the Colorado State

2699
01:57:39,609 --> 01:57:41,920
Patrol

2700
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:43,480
I appreciate it you did not [ __ ] my day

2701
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:45,220
up you did not [ __ ] my life up things

2702
01:57:43,479 --> 01:57:46,209
could have gone very differently as

2703
01:57:45,220 --> 01:57:48,369
we've learned with my friend John

2704
01:57:46,210 --> 01:57:49,869
Randall's jr. so a big shout out to the

2705
01:57:48,369 --> 01:57:51,279
State Patrol big shot at the jah

2706
01:57:49,869 --> 01:57:53,949
rastafari for keep a nice straight

2707
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:55,269
through that yeah so you guys it's all

2708
01:57:53,949 --> 01:57:56,439
about how you handled the police if

2709
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:58,210
you're in Colorado and you get pulled

2710
01:57:56,439 --> 01:57:58,809
over and they ask if you've got cannabis

2711
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:01,239
in the car

2712
01:57:58,810 --> 01:58:02,170
just admit it because lying to the cops

2713
01:58:01,239 --> 01:58:04,389
is illegal

2714
01:58:02,170 --> 01:58:06,130
having cannabis in Colorado is not

2715
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:07,660
illegal if you're gonna lie to him about

2716
01:58:06,130 --> 01:58:09,250
having weed he's not gonna trust you

2717
01:58:07,659 --> 01:58:10,599
he's gonna think you're hiding some [ __ ]

2718
01:58:09,250 --> 01:58:12,909

2757
01:59:24,310 --> 01:59:29,380

2762
01:59:35,409 --> 01:59:38,500
don't know when they'll put them on sale

2763
01:59:36,939 --> 01:59:40,089
I don't know if they'll even make it to

2764
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:41,800
the website they may have people wind up

2765
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:44,050
on a waiting list already I don't know

2766
01:59:41,800 --> 01:59:45,789
but I do know as soon as as soon as they

2767
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:47,949
get those seeds they sell out quickly so

2768
01:59:45,789 --> 01:59:50,500

2794
02:00:43,600 --> 02:00:49,690
message okay all right so this message

2795
02:00:47,380 --> 02:00:52,029
comes from a friend on the Grove from

2796
02:00:49,689 --> 02:00:53,559
your heart podcast Facebook page this is

2797
02:00:52,029 --> 02:00:55,719
from our friend Elizabeth and she says

2798
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:57,550
quick question I'm growing a few a few

2799
02:00:55,720 --> 02:00:59,350
plants from seed and I was wondering if

2800
02:00:57,550 --> 02:01:01,779
when I take a cutting to flower for

2801
02:00:59,350 --> 02:01:03,730
determining sex if I should flower the

2802
02:01:01,779 --> 02:01:05,079
clone or the rooted seedling I could

2803
02:01:03,729 --> 02:01:07,089
swear that I heard you say it was better

2804
02:01:05,079 --> 02:01:11,050
to flower the rooted seedling then I

2805
02:01:07,090 --> 02:01:14,319
remember that correctly um there is not

2806
02:01:11,050 --> 02:01:18,489
a rule to this this is kind of personal

2807
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:19,899
preference if so what let me back up and

2808
02:01:18,489 --> 02:01:21,489
tell you basically what this person's

2809
02:01:19,899 --> 02:01:22,750
asking just to be more clear in case you

2810
02:01:21,489 --> 02:01:24,609
guys aren't caught up to what this the

2811
02:01:22,750 --> 02:01:27,130
question here is when you grow a plant

2812
02:01:24,609 --> 02:01:28,630
from seed you don't know if that plant

2813
02:01:27,130 --> 02:01:30,550
is a male or a female unless of course

2814
02:01:28,630 --> 02:01:32,619
it came from feminized seeds so if you

2815
02:01:30,550 --> 02:01:35,260
grow a regular seat it's got a 50/50

2816
02:01:32,619 --> 02:01:37,239
chance of being a male or a female you

2817
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:40,329
don't want to waste a lot of time space

2818
02:01:37,239 --> 02:01:41,949
energy nutrients and water on a plant

2819
02:01:40,329 --> 02:01:43,779
that you don't need so unless you're

2820
02:01:41,949 --> 02:01:48,189
breeding you need to eliminate your male

2821
02:01:43,779 --> 02:01:50,319
plants so once your seed plant gets

2822
02:01:48,189 --> 02:01:52,539
large enough I recommend taking a clone

2823
02:01:50,319 --> 02:01:55,689
from it let that clone establish healthy

2824
02:01:52,539 --> 02:01:58,359
roots now you need to flower either the

2825
02:01:55,689 --> 02:02:00,789
original plant from seed or that clone

2826
02:01:58,359 --> 02:02:01,988
to determine if that plant is a male or

2827
02:02:00,789 --> 02:02:03,850
a female

2828
02:02:01,988 --> 02:02:06,009
it's really up to you if you want to

2829
02:02:03,850 --> 02:02:08,500
flower out the plant that came from seed

2830
02:02:06,010 --> 02:02:10,930
or if you want to flower the clone there

2831
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:14,079
are advantages and disadvantages to both

2832
02:02:10,930 --> 02:02:16,000
sides if you've got that plant that came

2833
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:18,340
from seed and it's big enough to take a

2834
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:21,069
clone once that clone is rooted and you

2835
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:23,020
know you've got a copy of it you're safe

2836
02:02:21,069 --> 02:02:25,359
to flower out that seed plant the

2837
02:02:23,020 --> 02:02:27,190
original plant from seed because now

2838
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:28,869
you've got a backup in the clone room in

2839
02:02:27,189 --> 02:02:30,609
the mom room whatever in the bedroom

2840
02:02:28,869 --> 02:02:31,930
you've got a backup of that plant over

2841
02:02:30,609 --> 02:02:33,819
there and you've already got a plant

2842
02:02:31,930 --> 02:02:35,170
that's established and that's large and

2843
02:02:33,819 --> 02:02:37,000
that's healthy and is ready to flower

2844
02:02:35,170 --> 02:02:39,219
and ready to throw out some buds for you

2845
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,409
so you can always flower out that seed

2846
02:02:39,219 --> 02:02:43,060
plant the advantage to that is it's

2847
02:02:41,409 --> 02:02:45,699
already there it's ready to go

2848
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:47,200
you've got it a big healthy plant some

2849
02:02:45,699 --> 02:02:49,960
people really like to keep that original

2850
02:02:47,199 --> 02:02:51,399
seeded plant from seed around as their

2851
02:02:49,960 --> 02:02:53,260
mother they like to keep that one

2852
02:02:51,399 --> 02:02:54,909
because it was the original and they

2853
02:02:53,260 --> 02:02:56,890
feel like it's got more vigour and it's

2854
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:58,539
got more strength to it but I feel like

2855
02:02:56,890 --> 02:03:00,730
if you take a clone and you do it

2856
02:02:58,539 --> 02:03:03,250
properly and that clone is cared for and

2857
02:03:00,729 --> 02:03:05,049
the mother plant the donor plant was

2858
02:03:03,250 --> 02:03:06,699
healthy when the clone was taken I feel

2859
02:03:05,050 --> 02:03:09,340
like the clone and that seed plant are

2860
02:03:06,699 --> 02:03:10,869
going to be the same thing so you can

2861
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:12,940
take your clone you can let your clone

2862
02:03:10,869 --> 02:03:14,979
root you can get your clone into soil

2863
02:03:12,939 --> 02:03:16,569
and get it into a good pot get some

2864
02:03:14,979 --> 02:03:18,459
roots established you can do it in a cup

2865
02:03:16,569 --> 02:03:21,130
I've done this in cups I've ran phenyl

2866
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:23,020
hunts from cups before I've done plenty

2867
02:03:21,130 --> 02:03:25,210
of plant sexting while plant while

2868
02:03:23,020 --> 02:03:27,040
clones were just in little tiny cups so

2869
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:28,600
you can take your clone and you can

2870
02:03:27,039 --> 02:03:30,310
either pot it into a larger pot if you

2871
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:31,719
want or you can leave it in the cup and

2872
02:03:30,310 --> 02:03:33,730
put it in the flower room and put it in

2873
02:03:31,719 --> 02:03:36,130
the flower change the lights to 12 12

2874
02:03:33,729 --> 02:03:37,779
and of course within 7 to 10 days you're

2875
02:03:36,130 --> 02:03:40,180
gonna see if that plant is a male or a

2876
02:03:37,779 --> 02:03:42,969
female now one of the main advantages to

2877
02:03:40,180 --> 02:03:45,550
keeping your clones and cups and using

2878
02:03:42,969 --> 02:03:48,340
the cup method to do a sexing round is

2879
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:50,260
that it takes way less space to run a

2880
02:03:48,340 --> 02:03:52,119
whole bunch of cups than it would run a

2881
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:54,640
bunch of potted plants so if you're

2882
02:03:52,119 --> 02:03:57,430
doing a large Fino hunt of like maybe 25

2883
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:59,440
to 50 plants it's much easier to have 25

2884
02:03:57,430 --> 02:04:01,450
to 50 cups underneath the light with

2885
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:03,399
little tiny clones in there just waiting

2886
02:04:01,449 --> 02:04:05,199
to show you sex and that way you didn't

2887
02:04:03,399 --> 02:04:06,609
waste time drawing large plants and then

2888
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:08,439
you drew out a male that was a waste of

2889
02:04:06,609 --> 02:04:10,839
time so that's the advantage to do in

2890
02:04:08,439 --> 02:04:12,129
the cups it's one of the advantages it's

2891
02:04:10,840 --> 02:04:13,750
up to you whichever you want to do

2892
02:04:12,130 --> 02:04:15,179
really if you want to take it always

2893
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:17,069
take a clone so grow that

2894
02:04:15,179 --> 02:04:19,050
plant from seed take a clone get the

2895
02:04:17,069 --> 02:04:20,880
clone rooted and then it's up to you if

2896
02:04:19,050 --> 02:04:23,099
you want to run that clone as your

2897
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:24,748
flowering plant to determine sex go for

2898
02:04:23,099 --> 02:04:26,909
it if you want to run that seed as your

2899
02:04:24,748 --> 02:04:29,158
flowering plant to determine sex go for

2900
02:04:26,908 --> 02:04:31,799
it as long as you keep one of them back

2901
02:04:29,158 --> 02:04:32,969
to have in the future if you run that

2902
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:35,279
clone you've already got a big mother

2903
02:04:32,969 --> 02:04:37,078
plant waiting to give you more clones if

2904
02:04:35,279 --> 02:04:39,118
you run the mother plant that came from

2905
02:04:37,078 --> 02:04:41,488
seed you've already got a big bushy

2906
02:04:39,118 --> 02:04:43,978
plant there are advantages in a

2907
02:04:41,488 --> 02:04:45,779
production facility what I do is I plant

2908
02:04:43,979 --> 02:04:48,239
the seed I let the seed grow I take the

2909
02:04:45,779 --> 02:04:50,429
clone as soon as that clone shows me

2910
02:04:48,238 --> 02:04:53,098
roots I throw that clone into a pot and

2911
02:04:50,429 --> 02:04:54,868
then I actually flour out the original

2912
02:04:53,099 --> 02:04:56,969
plant from seed because it's already big

2913
02:04:54,868 --> 02:04:58,589
enough it's ready to go and honestly in

2914
02:04:56,969 --> 02:05:01,019
a commercial production facility I don't

2915
02:04:58,590 --> 02:05:03,269
have a lot of time in space for extra

2916
02:05:01,019 --> 02:05:05,130
plants sitting around and I don't want

2917
02:05:03,269 --> 02:05:06,719
to waste my plant count because we are

2918
02:05:05,130 --> 02:05:08,038
based on a plant count because we are a

2919
02:05:06,719 --> 02:05:10,529
medical facility we're allowed to have

2920
02:05:08,038 --> 02:05:11,998
so many plants so since I've already got

2921
02:05:10,529 --> 02:05:14,368
a plant that's large enough to flower I

2922
02:05:11,998 --> 02:05:16,139
go ahead and flower that plant out to

2923
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:18,478
find out what I've got if I find out

2924
02:05:16,139 --> 02:05:20,159
that I've got a male usually I go throw

2925
02:05:18,479 --> 02:05:21,630
that I cut that male down take it out of

2926
02:05:20,158 --> 02:05:24,238
computer system and then I go and take

2927
02:05:21,630 --> 02:05:26,130
down every clone also that I have made

2928
02:05:24,238 --> 02:05:27,598
of that male plant and we eliminate

2929
02:05:26,130 --> 02:05:28,949
those as well

2930
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:31,949
so that we don't have any males sitting

2931
02:05:28,948 --> 02:05:35,098
around and that is how mainly how we

2932
02:05:31,948 --> 02:05:36,388
work on sexing our plants there is

2933
02:05:35,099 --> 02:05:38,159
another method this kind of helps me

2934
02:05:36,389 --> 02:05:40,979
segue into something else I wanted to

2935
02:05:38,158 --> 02:05:43,768
talk about which is revenge another

2936
02:05:40,979 --> 02:05:45,260
thing that you can do I do not use this

2937
02:05:43,769 --> 02:05:47,458
method I know plenty of people that do

2938
02:05:45,260 --> 02:05:50,248
for me this seems a little bit harsh to

2939
02:05:47,458 --> 02:05:51,538
my plants what some people do you can

2940
02:05:50,248 --> 02:05:53,788
take a plant and put it into your

2941
02:05:51,538 --> 02:05:56,279
flowering room for seven to ten days

2942
02:05:53,788 --> 02:05:58,649
just long enough to show you sex usually

2943
02:05:56,279 --> 02:06:00,238
I think I can spot a male more early

2944
02:05:58,649 --> 02:06:01,138
than I can a female because I've been

2945
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:03,268
doing it for so long

2946
02:06:01,139 --> 02:06:05,489
I think the male's try to show you sex a

2947
02:06:03,269 --> 02:06:07,349
little bit sooner so take your plants

2948
02:06:05,488 --> 02:06:09,359
put them in the flowering room let them

2949
02:06:07,349 --> 02:06:11,699
start showing you sex as soon as you are

2950
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:13,288
sure of the sex take them out of the

2951
02:06:11,698 --> 02:06:15,748
flowering room put them back in the

2952
02:06:13,288 --> 02:06:17,938
bedroom under to uh under 24 hours of

2953
02:06:15,748 --> 02:06:19,380
light and they will go back into veg for

2954
02:06:17,939 --> 02:06:22,079
you it may take them a couple of weeks

2955
02:06:19,380 --> 02:06:24,569
but they will go back into veg so what

2956
02:06:22,078 --> 02:06:26,488
some people do they plant a seed

2957
02:06:24,569 --> 02:06:28,679
they let the seed grow until it's you

2958
02:06:26,488 --> 02:06:29,129
know decent-sized right when you put

2959
02:06:28,679 --> 02:06:31,260
that seed

2960
02:06:29,130 --> 02:06:32,850
dear three gallon pot let it get routed

2961
02:06:31,260 --> 02:06:34,289
and then move it to the flour room and

2962
02:06:32,850 --> 02:06:35,820
then they just leave it there for a few

2963
02:06:34,289 --> 02:06:37,890
days and now they've got a little plant

2964
02:06:35,819 --> 02:06:39,449
that's starting to show sex and then as

2965
02:06:37,890 --> 02:06:40,020
soon as it shows sex they put it back in

2966
02:06:39,449 --> 02:06:42,090
the bedroom

2967
02:06:40,020 --> 02:06:43,950
if it's a female they put it back into

2968
02:06:42,090 --> 02:06:46,020
the bedroom and grow it up to the bigger

2969
02:06:43,949 --> 02:06:47,760
size that they want then take a clone

2970
02:06:46,020 --> 02:06:49,650
from it and then flower that plant out

2971
02:06:47,760 --> 02:06:52,170
now this sounds harsh but it does have

2972
02:06:49,649 --> 02:06:54,000
its advantages the main advantage here

2973
02:06:52,170 --> 02:06:56,100
is that you don't need to take any

2974
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,840
clones and you don't waste a lot of time

2975
02:06:56,100 --> 02:06:59,610
and space growing anything so you take

2976
02:06:57,840 --> 02:07:01,470
your plants and you put them into flower

2977
02:06:59,609 --> 02:07:03,689
and as soon as you see boys you throw

2978
02:07:01,470 --> 02:07:05,070
them away and then now you can just move

2979
02:07:03,689 --> 02:07:06,689
your plants right back into the bedroom

2980
02:07:05,069 --> 02:07:09,509
and just grow those females up to their

2981
02:07:06,689 --> 02:07:11,819
full size so you establish sex without

2982
02:07:09,510 --> 02:07:13,199
taking any clones and now you know what

2983
02:07:11,819 --> 02:07:14,699
you've got and you've eliminated your

2984
02:07:13,199 --> 02:07:16,489
boys so when it comes flower time you

2985
02:07:14,699 --> 02:07:18,869
know you're working with all girls I

2986
02:07:16,489 --> 02:07:20,550
highly recommend taking a clone from

2987
02:07:18,869 --> 02:07:22,890
everything so before you flower those

2988
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:24,510
plants please take a clone because you

2989
02:07:22,890 --> 02:07:25,740
might grow the most amazing cannabis

2990
02:07:24,510 --> 02:07:27,539
you've ever had and if you don't have a

2991
02:07:25,739 --> 02:07:30,539
clone from it you're going to kick

2992
02:07:27,539 --> 02:07:33,840
yourself in the ass Reve edging is also

2993
02:07:30,539 --> 02:07:36,300
used after harvest I have seen people

2994
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:38,909
finish a plant you take a plant that

2995
02:07:36,300 --> 02:07:41,520
takes nine weeks to flower you flower it

2996
02:07:38,909 --> 02:07:43,019
out for nine weeks you harvest most of

2997
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:45,500
it but you just leave one or two

2998
02:07:43,020 --> 02:07:48,180
branches on that plant and then put that

2999
02:07:45,500 --> 02:07:50,789
plant with one or two harvested plant

3000
02:07:48,180 --> 02:07:52,619
with one or two branches on it under 24

3001
02:07:50,789 --> 02:07:55,079
hours of light and it's gonna take

3002
02:07:52,619 --> 02:07:57,269
probably two months honestly before that

3003
02:07:55,079 --> 02:07:59,430
plant starts to grow back as a normal

3004
02:07:57,270 --> 02:08:01,650
vegging plant and if you didn't take a

3005
02:07:59,430 --> 02:08:04,440
clone this is your only way to rescue

3006
02:08:01,649 --> 02:08:06,329
your strain you take this sad looking

3007
02:08:04,439 --> 02:08:08,069
mostly harvested plant and you torture

3008
02:08:06,329 --> 02:08:10,380
it by putting it under a light for about

3009
02:08:08,069 --> 02:08:11,609
two months you want it under 24 hours of

3010
02:08:10,380 --> 02:08:13,619
light you want to feed it kind of a

3011
02:08:11,609 --> 02:08:15,929
heavy nitrogen diet that'll bring it

3012
02:08:13,619 --> 02:08:17,640
back around to the veg stage the leaves

3013
02:08:15,930 --> 02:08:19,140
are gonna start curling and looking like

3014
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:21,360
arthritis hands they're gonna be

3015
02:08:19,140 --> 02:08:23,700
spirally the plant is gonna be pissed

3016
02:08:21,359 --> 02:08:25,589
off for quite a while but as soon as you

3017
02:08:23,699 --> 02:08:27,389
see those normal leaves start coming out

3018
02:08:25,590 --> 02:08:29,340
your plant is going back into its normal

3019
02:08:27,390 --> 02:08:31,020
stage the hormones have started

3020
02:08:29,340 --> 02:08:32,250
reconverting back into the veg stage

3021
02:08:31,020 --> 02:08:33,990
it's starting to know what's going on

3022
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:36,300
with life again what I would recommend

3023
02:08:33,989 --> 02:08:37,800
at that point as soon as you have a

3024
02:08:36,300 --> 02:08:38,489
couple of healthy shoots that look

3025
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:41,130
normal

3026
02:08:38,489 --> 02:08:42,359
clone those and take those clones and

3027
02:08:41,130 --> 02:08:44,069
use those clones as

3028
02:08:42,359 --> 02:08:46,738
your plants and now you've got that

3029
02:08:44,069 --> 02:08:48,149
strain around again keep one clone and

3030
02:08:46,738 --> 02:08:50,009
flower out the other clones and now

3031
02:08:48,149 --> 02:08:52,079
you've got that strain forever I don't

3032
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:53,850
recommend that but if you do make the

3033
02:08:52,079 --> 02:08:55,019
mistake of not taking a clone and you

3034
02:08:53,850 --> 02:08:56,489
realize that this plant that you're

3035
02:08:55,020 --> 02:08:58,679
growing is going to be one of the most

3036
02:08:56,488 --> 02:09:01,709
amazing things you've ever seen reeve

3037
02:08:58,679 --> 02:09:03,510
edging is probably the only way to

3038
02:09:01,710 --> 02:09:05,310
rescue this strain other than a tissue

3039
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:07,020
culture and I am not prepared to teach

3040
02:09:05,310 --> 02:09:09,900
you how to do a tissue culture through a

3041
02:09:07,020 --> 02:09:11,460
podcast so Elizabeth I hope I answered

3042
02:09:09,899 --> 02:09:13,259
your question I know I did not give a

3043
02:09:11,460 --> 02:09:14,489
definitive answer I know I said that

3044
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:15,929
it's kind of up to you and your

3045
02:09:14,488 --> 02:09:17,638
environment and the way that you want to

3046
02:09:15,929 --> 02:09:19,529
do things but I hope I helped you out

3047
02:09:17,639 --> 02:09:22,829
and thanks for giving me the opportunity

3048
02:09:19,529 --> 02:09:26,698
to talk about how to sex your plants and

3049
02:09:22,829 --> 02:09:29,309
revé edging alright my next topic comes

3050
02:09:26,698 --> 02:09:32,399
from at the barefoot girl run Instagram

3051
02:09:29,310 --> 02:09:33,960
also known as will on Facebook will had

3052
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:36,359
no idea I was gonna talk about this will

3053
02:09:33,960 --> 02:09:39,210
posted a Facebook post today that simply

3054
02:09:36,359 --> 02:09:42,059
said stop smoking blunts in your grow

3055
02:09:39,210 --> 02:09:43,439
room and that is such a good post you

3056
02:09:42,060 --> 02:09:45,750
had no idea I was gonna talk about this

3057
02:09:43,439 --> 02:09:47,428
on the podcast today but I see people

3058
02:09:45,750 --> 02:09:49,198
posting pictures of themselves on

3059
02:09:47,429 --> 02:09:51,630
Facebook on Instagram and on snapchat

3060
02:09:49,198 --> 02:09:53,488
and they are smoking blunts smoking

3061
02:09:51,630 --> 02:09:56,039
Bulls and smoking dabs in the grow room

3062
02:09:53,488 --> 02:09:58,709
and I think it's a really bad idea I

3063
02:09:56,039 --> 02:10:01,319
think smoking a blunt in a grow room is

3064
02:09:58,710 --> 02:10:03,600
going to impart that blunt taste on your

3065
02:10:01,319 --> 02:10:05,698
growing buds before those buds are even

3066
02:10:03,600 --> 02:10:07,469
done they're already going to taste like

3067
02:10:05,698 --> 02:10:09,629
a dirty blonde trap I'm sorry you guys I

3068
02:10:07,469 --> 02:10:11,010
don't prefer the flavor of a blonde we

3069
02:10:09,630 --> 02:10:12,480
grow some of the best cannabis we can

3070
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:13,980
possibly grow on this planet and then

3071
02:10:12,479 --> 02:10:15,868
you wrap it up in a shitty-ass tobacco

3072
02:10:13,979 --> 02:10:18,329
leaf with some fake flavoring in it I

3073
02:10:15,868 --> 02:10:20,609
don't dig it I smoked it backward with

3074
02:10:18,329 --> 02:10:22,500
my buddy the other day not my thing I'm

3075
02:10:20,609 --> 02:10:24,359
not into the blunts but I feel that

3076
02:10:22,500 --> 02:10:25,829
blowing this blunt smoke on your plants

3077
02:10:24,359 --> 02:10:28,259
around your plants is gonna make your

3078
02:10:25,829 --> 02:10:30,029
plants taste like a dirty ass blunt but

3079
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:32,760
also here's what we'll had to say about

3080
02:10:30,029 --> 02:10:34,469
this will said tobacco smoke is very

3081
02:10:32,760 --> 02:10:36,090
thick and actually can suffocate your

3082
02:10:34,469 --> 02:10:38,010
plants stopping the photosynthesis

3083
02:10:36,090 --> 02:10:39,569
process because the plant will be too

3084
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:42,780
busy breathing and filtering the smoke

3085
02:10:39,569 --> 02:10:44,908
to take in co2 and then he also goes on

3086
02:10:42,779 --> 02:10:46,380
to say also blunts and most

3087
02:10:44,908 --> 02:10:47,969
over-the-counter tobacco products have a

3088
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:49,650
ton of chemicals in them that are bad

3089
02:10:47,969 --> 02:10:51,090
for your plants cigarette through the

3090
02:10:49,649 --> 02:10:52,769
main concern but blunts will begin to

3091
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:55,230
show harmful results if done regularly

3092
02:10:52,770 --> 02:10:55,860
and frequently really you shouldn't

3093
02:10:55,229 --> 02:10:57,809
smoke any

3094
02:10:55,859 --> 02:10:59,339
in your girl room I agree with that and

3095
02:10:57,810 --> 02:11:01,800
then he says but if you're going to it

3096
02:10:59,340 --> 02:11:04,619
should be a bowl the less carcinogens in

3097
02:11:01,800 --> 02:11:07,380
the air the healthier your plants will

3098
02:11:04,619 --> 02:11:09,779
be I think I agree with that will good

3099
02:11:07,380 --> 02:11:11,670
post great post you guys quit smoking in

3100
02:11:09,779 --> 02:11:13,079
your girl rooms you don't want to be in

3101
02:11:11,670 --> 02:11:14,220
the grow room giving your plants smoke

3102
02:11:13,079 --> 02:11:16,529
you want to be in the grow room giving

3103
02:11:14,220 --> 02:11:18,930
your plants love and co2 don't blow

3104
02:11:16,529 --> 02:11:20,130
smoke in there just keep the plants

3105
02:11:18,930 --> 02:11:21,840
clean you're gonna ruin the terpenes

3106
02:11:20,130 --> 02:11:24,390
it's all about the Terps nowadays and

3107
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:25,920
nobody wants tobacco Terps in their

3108
02:11:24,390 --> 02:11:27,390
cannabis maybe I'm wrong maybe somebody

3109
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:29,609
wants to backhoe trips in their cannabis

3110
02:11:27,390 --> 02:11:31,079
but 99% of the world doesn't want

3111
02:11:29,609 --> 02:11:33,059
tobacco turps in their cannabis and

3112
02:11:31,079 --> 02:11:35,369
nobody wants to backhoe turps and their

3113
02:11:33,060 --> 02:11:37,740
concentrates so stop smoking blunts in

3114
02:11:35,369 --> 02:11:40,289
your grow room stop smoking anything in

3115
02:11:37,739 --> 02:11:41,819
your grow room go outside go smoke

3116
02:11:40,289 --> 02:11:43,560
outside go to the candy candy and go

3117
02:11:41,819 --> 02:11:45,059
smoke at the candy canyon go smoke at

3118
02:11:43,560 --> 02:11:46,380
the dab table just don't smoke in the

3119
02:11:45,060 --> 02:11:48,450
grow room it's not good for your plants

3120
02:11:46,380 --> 02:11:50,310
and quit smoking cigarettes and tobacco

3121
02:11:48,449 --> 02:11:54,059
anyway let's just get down on cannabis

3122
02:11:50,310 --> 02:11:56,130
you guys organic cannabis all right I've

3123
02:11:54,060 --> 02:11:57,420
been talking for nearly 19 minutes so I

3124
02:11:56,130 --> 02:12:00,029
think it's time for me to press pause

3125
02:11:57,420 --> 02:12:03,480
take a drink take a fat dab and I will

3126
02:12:00,029 --> 02:12:05,729
be right back hang tight alright guys I

3127
02:12:03,479 --> 02:12:07,589
back it took a couple of got a nice

3128
02:12:05,729 --> 02:12:10,049
drink while I was taking a drink I was

3129
02:12:07,590 --> 02:12:13,260
drinking some kombucha some gt's

3130
02:12:10,050 --> 02:12:15,090
kombucha organic and raw original with

3131
02:12:13,260 --> 02:12:16,980
enzymes and probiotics and it reminded

3132
02:12:15,090 --> 02:12:19,680
me that a listener recently asked me a

3133
02:12:16,979 --> 02:12:21,209
question about probiotics he asked me if

3134
02:12:19,680 --> 02:12:24,210
I could recommend a brand he asked about

3135
02:12:21,210 --> 02:12:27,180
a specific brand honestly what I like is

3136
02:12:24,210 --> 02:12:29,880
the brand raw pro Briah probiotics you

3137
02:12:27,180 --> 02:12:32,820
can buy specific blends for men or women

3138
02:12:29,880 --> 02:12:34,020
or for older folks or for children so

3139
02:12:32,819 --> 02:12:36,299
I'm pretty sure that the person that

3140
02:12:34,020 --> 02:12:38,610
emailed me was a dude so I would

3141
02:12:36,300 --> 02:12:40,170
recommend the raw probiotics for men

3142
02:12:38,609 --> 02:12:42,750
that are available at most health food

3143
02:12:40,170 --> 02:12:44,399
stores those are the probiotics I would

3144
02:12:42,750 --> 02:12:47,069
support now let's talk more about

3145
02:12:44,399 --> 02:12:49,289
cannabis related stuff somebody recently

3146
02:12:47,069 --> 02:12:52,079
sent me a message asking me if I think

3147
02:12:49,289 --> 02:12:53,729
holding in your smoke gets you higher if

3148
02:12:52,079 --> 02:12:55,590
you take a dad if you take a bong rape

3149
02:12:53,729 --> 02:12:57,750
if you smoke a joint do you feel like

3150
02:12:55,590 --> 02:12:59,730
holding your head holding your smoke in

3151
02:12:57,750 --> 02:13:01,770
your lungs gives you a better buzz in my

3152
02:12:59,729 --> 02:13:02,849
opinion I'm going to say I am NOT a

3153
02:13:01,770 --> 02:13:04,740
doctor let me put that out there

3154
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:07,110
straight up I'm not a doctor this is my

3155
02:13:04,739 --> 02:13:09,250
stoner opinion I feel like when I take a

3156
02:13:07,109 --> 02:13:11,109
DAB I feel like

3157
02:13:09,250 --> 02:13:13,569
most of what I'm going to get goes into

3158
02:13:11,109 --> 02:13:15,460
my lungs pretty quickly within probably

3159
02:13:13,569 --> 02:13:17,500
three seconds at the most maybe five

3160
02:13:15,460 --> 02:13:20,050
seconds I have absorbed everything that

3161
02:13:17,500 --> 02:13:21,760
that dab is going to give me so I get it

3162
02:13:20,050 --> 02:13:24,600
in I let it sit for about a half a

3163
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:26,920
second maybe a second I pull in the dab

3164
02:13:24,600 --> 02:13:28,329
and then I blow it back out it's only in

3165
02:13:26,920 --> 02:13:29,770
me for just a brief second just so that

3166
02:13:28,329 --> 02:13:32,019
I can feel it in there then I push it

3167
02:13:29,770 --> 02:13:33,610
back out I feel like when you keep the

3168
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:35,860
smoke in your lungs is when it's going

3169
02:13:33,609 --> 02:13:37,420
to cause problems I feel like my lungs

3170
02:13:35,859 --> 02:13:39,339
absorb everything they're going to get

3171
02:13:37,420 --> 02:13:40,930
really quickly if I keep that smoke in

3172
02:13:39,340 --> 02:13:43,210
there I'm gonna start absorbing the tars

3173
02:13:40,930 --> 02:13:44,920
and the soot and the extra crap the

3174
02:13:43,210 --> 02:13:46,180
smoke is going to stick to my lungs and

3175
02:13:44,920 --> 02:13:48,190
I don't want that I want to get the

3176
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:51,190
cannabinoids I want the THC and with the

3177
02:13:48,189 --> 02:13:53,979
CBD the CBG I want the good medical

3178
02:13:51,189 --> 02:13:55,839
benefits nah the bad part of the smoke

3179
02:13:53,979 --> 02:13:58,869
so I think taking a big fat dab and

3180
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:59,949
holding it in you might not get higher I

3181
02:13:58,869 --> 02:14:02,500
think you're just getting a head rush

3182
02:13:59,949 --> 02:14:03,819
from lack of oxygen and you're just

3183
02:14:02,500 --> 02:14:05,800
feeling a rush because you're not giving

3184
02:14:03,819 --> 02:14:08,170
yourself any air and also I feel like

3185
02:14:05,800 --> 02:14:11,619
that pressure having your lungs inflated

3186
02:14:08,170 --> 02:14:12,819
like that is probably very strenuous on

3187
02:14:11,619 --> 02:14:14,710
your lungs you could probably hurt

3188
02:14:12,819 --> 02:14:16,719
yourself by doing that and then those

3189
02:14:14,710 --> 02:14:18,430
people that take in a big hit and they

3190
02:14:16,720 --> 02:14:21,190
cough and they try not to cough and hold

3191
02:14:18,430 --> 02:14:23,079
in the big hit you make this noise you

3192
02:14:21,189 --> 02:14:24,489
start doing that [ __ ] I really feel like

3193
02:14:23,079 --> 02:14:26,170
that's gonna blow something up in your

3194
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:27,399
body you're gonna rupture a lung and a

3195
02:14:26,170 --> 02:14:29,350
[ __ ] blow a blood vessel in your

3196
02:14:27,399 --> 02:14:31,029
brain I think you need to get the smoke

3197
02:14:29,350 --> 02:14:32,890
in and out I don't think smoke needs to

3198
02:14:31,029 --> 02:14:34,210
sit around in your lungs that is my my

3199
02:14:32,890 --> 02:14:35,590
opinion I don't think you get higher

3200
02:14:34,210 --> 02:14:37,029
from it I don't think you're going to

3201
02:14:35,590 --> 02:14:39,850
absorb more from it I think that's gonna

3202
02:14:37,029 --> 02:14:42,329
happen almost instantly I think you're

3203
02:14:39,850 --> 02:14:45,190
just putting it yourself at risk for

3204
02:14:42,329 --> 02:14:48,069
COPD or other lung problems in the

3205
02:14:45,189 --> 02:14:49,329
future I want to elaborate on this a

3206
02:14:48,069 --> 02:14:51,009
little bit one thing that I think

3207
02:14:49,329 --> 02:14:54,880
happens

3208
02:14:51,010 --> 02:14:56,500
I take ginormous dabs sometimes I like

3209
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:59,529
to take a big fat dad the other day I

3210
02:14:56,500 --> 02:15:01,899
took a two gram dab I didn't cough let

3211
02:14:59,529 --> 02:15:03,519
me be clear I'm not I'm not able to put

3212
02:15:01,899 --> 02:15:05,920
two grams on the nail and pull it all

3213
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:07,750
into my lungs in one draw because I just

3214
02:15:05,920 --> 02:15:10,210
can't get V I would have to put the nail

3215
02:15:07,750 --> 02:15:12,520
really hot to get it to burn or vaporize

3216
02:15:10,210 --> 02:15:14,319
that quickly so I am taking multiple

3217
02:15:12,520 --> 02:15:16,870
inhalations but I'm not taking a break

3218
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:19,239
I'm dropping two grams one and a half to

3219
02:15:16,869 --> 02:15:20,739
two grams of dabs on the nail just drop

3220
02:15:19,239 --> 02:15:22,019
it right on there you gotta kind of

3221
02:15:20,739 --> 02:15:24,000
slowly

3222
02:15:22,020 --> 02:15:26,040
stir it into the nail and let it melt

3223
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:28,229
into there and then carb cap it and just

3224
02:15:26,039 --> 02:15:30,239
start sucking on that rig pulling a big

3225
02:15:28,229 --> 02:15:31,679
fat hit blow it out pulling another rip

3226
02:15:30,239 --> 02:15:33,779
blow it out sometimes it'll take me

3227
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:36,510
three or four full inhalations a full

3228
02:15:33,779 --> 02:15:39,119
lung expand in and out of my lungs but

3229
02:15:36,510 --> 02:15:40,890
I'll smoke two grams and one dad I call

3230
02:15:39,119 --> 02:15:42,329
that one dad that is one dad I didn't

3231
02:15:40,890 --> 02:15:46,350
take a break or anything but it wasn't

3232
02:15:42,329 --> 02:15:49,649
all one rip I feel like I can feel the

3233
02:15:46,350 --> 02:15:51,870
hash coat my lungs and I feel like I'm

3234
02:15:49,649 --> 02:15:55,500
kind of giving myself a time-release

3235
02:15:51,869 --> 02:15:58,260
medicine I'm smoking so much hash in one

3236
02:15:55,500 --> 02:16:00,750
quick time period that I am coating my

3237
02:15:58,260 --> 02:16:02,280
lungs with enough oil to where my body

3238
02:16:00,750 --> 02:16:04,649
can't absorb it all at once but there's

3239
02:16:02,279 --> 02:16:06,599
nowhere for it to go so all this oil

3240
02:16:04,649 --> 02:16:09,210
kind of hangs out all this hash is just

3241
02:16:06,600 --> 02:16:11,400
hanging out stuck to my lung and has my

3242
02:16:09,210 --> 02:16:13,380
body can absorb it that hash is right

3243
02:16:11,399 --> 02:16:15,539
there so my lungs are just sucking up

3244
02:16:13,380 --> 02:16:17,340
that hash oil the whole time and I'm

3245
02:16:15,539 --> 02:16:19,140
just absorbing those cannabinoids and

3246
02:16:17,340 --> 02:16:20,460
absorbing those medicinal qualities so

3247
02:16:19,140 --> 02:16:22,800
I'm giving myself a time release

3248
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:24,359
medication by taking these ginormous

3249
02:16:22,800 --> 02:16:24,810
dabs that's something I think is

3250
02:16:24,359 --> 02:16:27,029
happening

3251
02:16:24,810 --> 02:16:29,520
I have no science to that but I feel

3252
02:16:27,029 --> 02:16:31,139
like I stay high I stay getting high I

3253
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:33,059
just keep getting higher and higher and

3254
02:16:31,140 --> 02:16:34,620
higher as it goes and I haven't

3255
02:16:33,058 --> 02:16:36,239
sometimes I won't have smoked for a full

3256
02:16:34,620 --> 02:16:40,170
hour and I'll still be fully medicated

3257
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:42,000
because I think that layer of dab that

3258
02:16:40,170 --> 02:16:44,069
is coated in my lungs it's just being

3259
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:46,260
absorbed by my body slowly and getting

3260
02:16:44,069 --> 02:16:48,029
into my bloodstream so that's my

3261
02:16:46,260 --> 02:16:49,950
elaboration I hope I answered your

3262
02:16:48,030 --> 02:16:51,659
question my opinion holding smoke is a

3263
02:16:49,950 --> 02:16:53,940
bad idea you don't need to hold it in

3264
02:16:51,659 --> 02:16:55,920
don't be cheap take another dab breathe

3265
02:16:53,940 --> 02:16:58,500
it in blow it out take another damn dab

3266
02:16:55,920 --> 02:17:00,840
I got another dab for you I think your

3267
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:02,610
lungs only get so much use before they

3268
02:17:00,840 --> 02:17:04,590
wear out I think you get so many inhales

3269
02:17:02,610 --> 02:17:07,319
and exhales of your lungs before they're

3270
02:17:04,590 --> 02:17:09,058
just gonna tire out so don't worry your

3271
02:17:07,319 --> 02:17:10,260
lungs out by holding in smoke just blow

3272
02:17:09,058 --> 02:17:10,739
it out get it out of there that's my

3273
02:17:10,260 --> 02:17:12,719
opinion

3274
02:17:10,739 --> 02:17:13,769
let's see I got a couple more things I

3275
02:17:12,718 --> 02:17:15,779
want to talk about and then we're going

3276
02:17:13,769 --> 02:17:18,030
to wrap up this podcast here's something

3277
02:17:15,780 --> 02:17:20,760
random you guys wear some protective

3278
02:17:18,030 --> 02:17:22,200
eyewear in your garden the lights are

3279
02:17:20,760 --> 02:17:23,670
bright if you're running more than four

3280
02:17:22,200 --> 02:17:25,079
maybe five or six lights in there you

3281
02:17:23,670 --> 02:17:27,719
need to get yourself some method seven

3282
02:17:25,079 --> 02:17:29,849
glasses and protect your eyes from the

3283
02:17:27,718 --> 02:17:32,159
lights also protect your skin if you're

3284
02:17:29,849 --> 02:17:33,630
in a room with 10 or more lights and

3285
02:17:32,159 --> 02:17:34,200
you're in there for more than a few

3286
02:17:33,629 --> 02:17:35,000
hours a day

3287
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:37,099
it's a

3288
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:38,750
idea to wear some sort of long sleeves

3289
02:17:37,099 --> 02:17:41,599
keep your head covered keep your eyes

3290
02:17:38,750 --> 02:17:43,729
covered it's just I believe that those

3291
02:17:41,599 --> 02:17:45,349
lights are not good for your skin the

3292
02:17:43,729 --> 02:17:46,968
Sun gives us cancer why won't these

3293
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:49,130
artificial lights give us some sort of

3294
02:17:46,968 --> 02:17:51,049
skin problems you guys are highly

3295
02:17:49,129 --> 02:17:52,699
recommend covering up your skin and your

3296
02:17:51,049 --> 02:17:56,000
eyes if you're in a grow room all day

3297
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:57,590
long I wear my method 7 glasses from the

3298
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,760
minute I walk into the grow room to the

3299
02:17:57,590 --> 02:18:00,950
minute I walk out I've got the method

3300
02:17:58,760 --> 02:18:02,269
sevens on I like to wear a long sleeve

3301
02:18:00,950 --> 02:18:03,769
shirt in the grow room it gets kind of

3302
02:18:02,269 --> 02:18:05,780
hot but it's still worth wearing a

3303
02:18:03,769 --> 02:18:07,610
long-sleeve shirt also here's something

3304
02:18:05,780 --> 02:18:09,139
really random when you're in the grow

3305
02:18:07,610 --> 02:18:10,639
room if you've got a bunch of sticks if

3306
02:18:09,138 --> 02:18:13,129
you're using sticks in there to support

3307
02:18:10,638 --> 02:18:14,869
your plants watch your eyes around those

3308
02:18:13,129 --> 02:18:16,819
sticks I saw somebody bend over the

3309
02:18:14,870 --> 02:18:18,079
other day to take care of a plant and if

3310
02:18:16,819 --> 02:18:19,549
he wasn't paying attention that stick

3311
02:18:18,079 --> 02:18:21,200
would have gone way far into his eye it

3312
02:18:19,549 --> 02:18:22,759
kind of poked his eye I didn't hurt him

3313
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:24,679
because he saw it coming

3314
02:18:22,760 --> 02:18:26,630
he saw it because it literally went into

3315
02:18:24,679 --> 02:18:28,670
his eye he was kneeling down put the

3316
02:18:26,629 --> 02:18:30,109
stick right into his eye didn't [ __ ] him

3317
02:18:28,670 --> 02:18:31,670
up he survived he'll be just fine

3318
02:18:30,110 --> 02:18:33,650
but I don't want that to happen to any

3319
02:18:31,670 --> 02:18:35,599
of my listeners or any of my friends so

3320
02:18:33,649 --> 02:18:37,638
be very aware of those sticks in your

3321
02:18:35,599 --> 02:18:40,030
grow room I don't use the sticks I use

3322
02:18:37,638 --> 02:18:42,768
my personal grow I like a tomato cage

3323
02:18:40,030 --> 02:18:44,480
and the commercial girl we like to use

3324
02:18:42,769 --> 02:18:45,710
the big trellis Nets of course I have

3325
02:18:44,479 --> 02:18:48,649
used the sticks before and I'll probably

3326
02:18:45,709 --> 02:18:50,058
use them again but that's not my

3327
02:18:48,649 --> 02:18:52,819
preferred method at this time but if you

3328
02:18:50,058 --> 02:18:55,489
were using them I do recommend that you

3329
02:18:52,819 --> 02:18:57,260
watch your eyes since I'm talking about

3330
02:18:55,489 --> 02:18:59,030
grow room safety here's another thing

3331
02:18:57,260 --> 02:19:01,340
you should think about you should have a

3332
02:18:59,030 --> 02:19:02,870
smoke detector inside of each grow room

3333
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:05,659
and you should also have a fire

3334
02:19:02,870 --> 02:19:07,340
extinguisher on the exterior of each

3335
02:19:05,659 --> 02:19:08,718
grow room don't put your fire

3336
02:19:07,340 --> 02:19:10,819
extinguisher inside the grow room

3337
02:19:08,718 --> 02:19:11,959
because if there is a problem in there

3338
02:19:10,819 --> 02:19:13,599
you don't want to have to kick down the

3339
02:19:11,959 --> 02:19:15,409
door go in there and get your fire

3340
02:19:13,599 --> 02:19:16,880
extinguisher and try to put the fire out

3341
02:19:15,409 --> 02:19:18,679
you want that fire extinguisher on the

3342
02:19:16,879 --> 02:19:20,000
outside by the door so that if

3343
02:19:18,679 --> 02:19:22,308
something's wrong and kick the door down

3344
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:25,399
spray the [ __ ] out of that fire solve

3345
02:19:22,308 --> 02:19:27,590
the problem so smoke detectors and fire

3346
02:19:25,399 --> 02:19:30,260
extinguishers are a big advantage for

3347
02:19:27,590 --> 02:19:31,880
your grow put that [ __ ] in there keep

3348
02:19:30,260 --> 02:19:33,590
yourself safe alright guys I think

3349
02:19:31,879 --> 02:19:35,479
that's all I've got for this podcast

3350
02:19:33,590 --> 02:19:37,219
pretty soon I've got Jesse coming back

3351
02:19:35,479 --> 02:19:38,989

3489
02:26:37,140 --> 02:26:41,470

3490
02:26:39,550 --> 02:26:44,050

3491

much love to Adam this music we're gonna

3493
02:26:48,101 --> 02:26:52,421
talk a little bit about let's see I've

3494
02:26:50,470 --> 02:26:54,189
been growing in Cocoa lately I've made

3495
02:26:52,421 --> 02:26:55,989
the switch I'd land a few pots at the

3496
02:26:54,190 --> 02:26:58,989
big grow with nothing but cocoa in there

3497
02:26:55,989 --> 02:27:00,280
and I am really liking it you guys it

3498
02:26:58,989 --> 02:27:01,841
seems like I'm watering a little bit

3499
02:27:00,280 --> 02:27:04,001
more frequently but one thing I've

3500
02:27:01,841 --> 02:27:06,550
noticed is that I cannot over water the

3501
02:27:04,001 --> 02:27:07,880
plants that are in the cocoa I've been

3502
02:27:06,550 --> 02:27:09,680
doing a couple of experiments I've got

3503
02:27:07,880 --> 02:27:11,870
one pot set aside from all the other

3504
02:27:09,681 --> 02:27:13,461
pots and when I water I give this one

3505
02:27:11,870 --> 02:27:15,770
pot double or triple what every other

3506
02:27:13,460 --> 02:27:17,570
plant gets and it does not ever show

3507
02:27:15,771 --> 02:27:19,521
signs of stress from being over watered

3508
02:27:17,570 --> 02:27:20,931
so that's something I like there are

3509
02:27:19,521 --> 02:27:22,251
some times when I know I'm not gonna get

3510
02:27:20,931 --> 02:27:24,261
back to the grow first thing in the

3511
02:27:22,251 --> 02:27:26,720
morning so I will just heavily heavily

3512
02:27:24,261 --> 02:27:28,671
water those plants and I felt like when

3513
02:27:26,720 --> 02:27:30,439
I was running soil sometimes I would

3514
02:27:28,671 --> 02:27:32,060
flood those plants so much that I could

3515
02:27:30,440 --> 02:27:33,801
see them getting droopy and being angry

3516
02:27:32,060 --> 02:27:35,810
from being over watered that never

3517
02:27:33,800 --> 02:27:37,911
happens with the cocoa so I'm able to

3518
02:27:35,810 --> 02:27:39,440
flood these plants and they don't get

3519
02:27:37,911 --> 02:27:41,451
pissed off from being over watered but

3520
02:27:39,440 --> 02:27:43,461
it does feel like my regular watering

3521
02:27:41,450 --> 02:27:45,170
schedule I need to hit them a little bit

3522
02:27:43,460 --> 02:27:46,280
more frequently I've had to increase the

3523
02:27:45,171 --> 02:27:47,990
amount of water that I give them because

3524
02:27:46,281 --> 02:27:50,331
they are drying out a little bit more

3525
02:27:47,990 --> 02:27:51,861
quickly one thing I've noticed with

3526
02:27:50,331 --> 02:27:54,411
cocoa one thing I should mention with

3527
02:27:51,861 --> 02:27:55,671
cocoa there are no nutrients in cocoa if

3528
02:27:54,411 --> 02:27:57,050
you're just using straight cocoa there's

3529
02:27:55,671 --> 02:27:58,281
nothing there to keep your plant going

3530
02:27:57,050 --> 02:28:00,710
so you're going to need to feed it

3531
02:27:58,281 --> 02:28:03,471
nutrients almost every watering I've

3532
02:28:00,710 --> 02:28:06,380
been giving it lots of nutrients and I

3533
02:28:03,470 --> 02:28:09,950
do about so I water the plants twice a

3534
02:28:06,380 --> 02:28:11,390
day I'll do nutrients nutrients that's

3535
02:28:09,950 --> 02:28:12,740
two waters in one day nutrients

3536
02:28:11,390 --> 02:28:14,270
nutrients the next day I'll go nutrients

3537
02:28:12,740 --> 02:28:15,979
nutrients and then I'll go nutrients and

3538
02:28:14,271 --> 02:28:17,121
then the watering before I leave on the

3539
02:28:15,979 --> 02:28:19,220
third day I usually just hit almost

3540
02:28:17,120 --> 02:28:20,960
clean water so they're getting a lot of

3541
02:28:19,220 --> 02:28:22,790
nutrients they don't look I don't see

3542
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:25,161
any deficiencies they don't see any /

3543
02:28:22,790 --> 02:28:27,411
nutrients they don't look mad from being

3544
02:28:25,161 --> 02:28:28,281
over watered I'm really liking the cocoa

3545
02:28:27,411 --> 02:28:30,140
you guys one thing I should mention

3546
02:28:28,281 --> 02:28:31,940
don't let your cocoa dry out once you

3547
02:28:30,140 --> 02:28:33,740
see the top layer of cocoa drying out

3548
02:28:31,940 --> 02:28:35,149
that's when you're in danger of your

3549
02:28:33,740 --> 02:28:37,431
plant sealing a little bit to dry it

3550
02:28:35,149 --> 02:28:39,200
happens very quickly on cocoa the

3551
02:28:37,431 --> 02:28:40,611
timeframe when you walk in to a soil

3552
02:28:39,200 --> 02:28:42,080
grow and you see your plants drooping

3553
02:28:40,611 --> 02:28:43,791
they're kind of starting to get pissed

3554
02:28:42,081 --> 02:28:45,050
off if they're drooping in cocoa they're

3555
02:28:43,790 --> 02:28:46,399
[ __ ] angry that's one thing I've

3556
02:28:45,050 --> 02:28:47,899
noticed I've been doing some experiments

3557
02:28:46,399 --> 02:28:49,700
I'm learning so that you guys don't have

3558
02:28:47,899 --> 02:28:51,440
to kill plants to learn I've got more

3559
02:28:49,700 --> 02:28:53,660
access I've got more space so we're

3560
02:28:51,440 --> 02:28:55,820
learning with cocoa I really do like it

3561
02:28:53,661 --> 02:28:58,479
this kind of segues into something else

3562
02:28:55,820 --> 02:28:58,479
I want to talk about

3563
02:28:58,590 --> 02:29:02,100
over-watering I see a lot of people and

3564
02:29:00,510 --> 02:29:03,389
a lot of grows over watering their

3565
02:29:02,100 --> 02:29:06,300
plants and they are wondering why the

3566
02:29:03,389 --> 02:29:08,398
growth of their plant is stunted there

3567
02:29:06,299 --> 02:29:10,170
is something that happens when the soil

3568
02:29:08,398 --> 02:29:11,670
starts to dry out a little bit or when

3569
02:29:10,170 --> 02:29:14,549
you're medium starts to dry out a bit

3570
02:29:11,670 --> 02:29:17,129
the moisture to oxygen ratio in there

3571
02:29:14,549 --> 02:29:18,779
really makes your roots want to grow it

3572
02:29:17,129 --> 02:29:20,188
really makes your roots want to eat so

3573
02:29:18,780 --> 02:29:21,899
they start searching for nutrients they

3574
02:29:20,189 --> 02:29:24,510
start growing a little bit this really

3575
02:29:21,898 --> 02:29:26,849
makes your plants get active I have

3576
02:29:24,510 --> 02:29:29,069
noticed that when I used to run clones

3577
02:29:26,850 --> 02:29:30,659
in root cubes or rock wool I would

3578
02:29:29,069 --> 02:29:32,369
notice that my clones would actually

3579
02:29:30,659 --> 02:29:34,500
root the best when I would forget about

3580
02:29:32,370 --> 02:29:36,720
them and the cloners and The Rock will

3581
02:29:34,500 --> 02:29:38,129
cube would dry up a little bit I really

3582
02:29:36,719 --> 02:29:40,379
think that that dryness is what the

3583
02:29:38,129 --> 02:29:41,909
plants are looking for a little bit more

3584
02:29:40,379 --> 02:29:45,209
than the wetness you don't want to be

3585
02:29:41,909 --> 02:29:46,889
soggy all the time so it's kind of a

3586
02:29:45,209 --> 02:29:48,389
good idea to give your plants a short

3587
02:29:46,889 --> 02:29:50,909
dry out period you don't want them

3588
02:29:48,389 --> 02:29:51,989
getting wilty and crispy but keep an eye

3589
02:29:50,909 --> 02:29:53,369
on your plant water your plants

3590
02:29:51,989 --> 02:29:55,228
thoroughly and then keep an eye on them

3591
02:29:53,370 --> 02:29:56,939
and watch you'll see right when they

3592
02:29:55,228 --> 02:29:58,289
start to droop a little bit that's when

3593
02:29:56,939 --> 02:30:00,000
you need to give them water so start

3594
02:29:58,290 --> 02:30:02,160
learning right before that happens and

3595
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:03,629
then start feeding them right before

3596
02:30:02,159 --> 02:30:04,739
that right before they start to droop

3597
02:30:03,629 --> 02:30:06,449
that's when you should be given a water

3598
02:30:04,739 --> 02:30:08,699
every time so that you allow that dry

3599
02:30:06,450 --> 02:30:10,200
out phase something that happens in that

3600
02:30:08,700 --> 02:30:12,260
dry out phase that we've talked about on

3601
02:30:10,200 --> 02:30:14,939
this podcast several episodes back as

3602
02:30:12,260 --> 02:30:17,250
the moisture level in your root zone

3603
02:30:14,939 --> 02:30:19,530
changes as the water level in your soil

3604
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:22,439
ball in your coco area as that moisture

3605
02:30:19,530 --> 02:30:24,930
level changes so will the pH so if

3606
02:30:22,439 --> 02:30:27,630
you're feeding your plants a nutrient

3607
02:30:24,930 --> 02:30:29,550
solution that's real high in pH you pour

3608
02:30:27,629 --> 02:30:31,529
it in there only certain nutrients are

3609
02:30:29,549 --> 02:30:33,840
going to be available at that pH level

3610
02:30:31,530 --> 02:30:36,090
but as the moisture level and

3611
02:30:33,840 --> 02:30:37,739
temperature change inside of that soil

3612
02:30:36,090 --> 02:30:39,659
ball inside that rhizosphere

3613
02:30:37,739 --> 02:30:41,969
inside your pot in your container there

3614
02:30:39,659 --> 02:30:44,069
the pH will change and different

3615
02:30:41,969 --> 02:30:45,959
nutrients will become bioavailable to

3616
02:30:44,069 --> 02:30:47,879
your plants so there are several

3617
02:30:45,959 --> 02:30:49,169
advantages to letting your plants dry

3618
02:30:47,879 --> 02:30:51,389
out just a little bit I don't want you

3619
02:30:49,170 --> 02:30:52,680
to let them get crispy but it is good

3620
02:30:51,389 --> 02:30:55,139
for your plants to dry out just a little

3621
02:30:52,680 --> 02:30:57,780
bit you'll see much more production this

3622
02:30:55,139 --> 02:31:00,750
is why I like to put my mother plants in

3623
02:30:57,780 --> 02:31:02,189
root pots or air pots or earth pots any

3624
02:31:00,750 --> 02:31:04,500
type of fabric pot that they can breathe

3625
02:31:02,189 --> 02:31:05,670
a whole bunch or they make those plastic

3626
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:07,978
pots that have a bunch of holes in them

3627
02:31:05,670 --> 02:31:10,559
to have like the dimpled shapes on them

3628
02:31:07,978 --> 02:31:12,929
I really like that because I feel like

3629
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:14,728
your roots get a lot of oxygen and then

3630
02:31:12,930 --> 02:31:16,828
if you're using that in Cocoa your roots

3631
02:31:14,728 --> 02:31:18,629
are going to be surrounded by oxygen and

3632
02:31:16,828 --> 02:31:20,969
they're going to grow rapidly and your

3633
02:31:18,629 --> 02:31:22,828
plants will love it so that is my take

3634
02:31:20,969 --> 02:31:24,658
on cocoa and kind of a segue into

3635
02:31:22,828 --> 02:31:26,340
letting your plants dry out a little bit

3636
02:31:24,658 --> 02:31:28,859
I love cocoa you got to use more

3637
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:31,520
nutrients you definitely need more Cal

3638
02:31:28,859 --> 02:31:34,529
and more mag with cocoa more Cal mag

3639
02:31:31,520 --> 02:31:37,289
heavily with cocoa and then if you're

3640
02:31:34,529 --> 02:31:38,789
using soil or cocoa or a soil this makes

3641
02:31:37,289 --> 02:31:40,920
it a good idea to kind of let your

3642
02:31:38,789 --> 02:31:43,289
plants dry up just a little bit alright

3643
02:31:40,920 --> 02:31:44,939
that was a quick talk quick ramble about

3644
02:31:43,289 --> 02:31:46,470
how I feel about cocoa and what I've

3645
02:31:44,939 --> 02:31:49,139
learned about letting the plants dry a

3646
02:31:46,469 --> 02:31:50,788
little bit so let's move into the next

3647
02:31:49,139 --> 02:31:52,648
part I want to talk about collecting

3648
02:31:50,789 --> 02:31:55,079
pollen you guys yesterday I spent a

3649
02:31:52,648 --> 02:31:56,519
couple of hours working with a male

3650
02:31:55,078 --> 02:31:57,898
plant if you've been following my social

3651
02:31:56,520 --> 02:32:00,988
media you know that I've gotten a rise

3652
02:31:57,898 --> 02:32:02,849
mail from her eyes f1 seed he's a male

3653
02:32:00,988 --> 02:32:05,038
plant that looks like a true stud he

3654
02:32:02,850 --> 02:32:08,488
plans I plan on using him as my breeding

3655
02:32:05,039 --> 02:32:10,260
stud I took him to about eight weeks of

3656
02:32:08,488 --> 02:32:11,760
flour and a flowering room to see what

3657
02:32:10,260 --> 02:32:13,680
he would do and yesterday I cut him down

3658
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:16,020
but before I did I collected the pollen

3659
02:32:13,680 --> 02:32:18,119
now here is how I collected the pond

3660
02:32:16,020 --> 02:32:19,319
there are several methods to doing this

3661
02:32:18,119 --> 02:32:20,909
actually used a couple of different

3662
02:32:19,318 --> 02:32:22,738
techniques to see what I liked better

3663
02:32:20,908 --> 02:32:24,779
I just cuz I wanted to talk about it on

3664
02:32:22,738 --> 02:32:26,818
the show the way I started you guys I

3665
02:32:24,779 --> 02:32:28,470
was holding a mason jar and I was just

3666
02:32:26,818 --> 02:32:29,998
going to the bottom buds and I grabbed a

3667
02:32:28,469 --> 02:32:31,528
drumstick cuz I'm the drummer I grabbed

3668
02:32:29,998 --> 02:32:34,439
a drumstick and I was just tapping the

3669
02:32:31,529 --> 02:32:36,960
male buds over the jar and pollen was

3670
02:32:34,439 --> 02:32:39,059
falling into the jar I liked it it was

3671
02:32:36,959 --> 02:32:40,498
working but I felt that a bunch of the

3672
02:32:39,059 --> 02:32:41,549
pollen was missing the jars I was

3673
02:32:40,498 --> 02:32:43,289
tapping the bud

3674
02:32:41,549 --> 02:32:45,688
pollen was falling down the side of the

3675
02:32:43,289 --> 02:32:47,189
jar pollen was falling on my hand the

3676
02:32:45,689 --> 02:32:48,568
site of the bud that didn't have a jar

3677
02:32:47,189 --> 02:32:50,309
near it there was just pollen falling

3678
02:32:48,568 --> 02:32:51,748
onto the floor there was plenty of

3679
02:32:50,309 --> 02:32:53,219
pollen collected but I felt like I was

3680
02:32:51,748 --> 02:32:55,078
wasting a lot so I had this jar and I'm

3681
02:32:53,219 --> 02:32:56,988
just tapping buds and I'm tapping the

3682
02:32:55,078 --> 02:33:00,090
buds the pollen into the jar I got a lot

3683
02:32:56,988 --> 02:33:02,248
the next method that I tried was I cut

3684
02:33:00,090 --> 02:33:04,590
the buds off of the plant and I just

3685
02:33:02,248 --> 02:33:08,728
laid the male flowers and buds with the

3686
02:33:04,590 --> 02:33:10,350
male flowers onto a glass tray and then

3687
02:33:08,728 --> 02:33:12,538
I was just tapping them with my finger

3688
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:14,309
and what I was noticing was a bunch more

3689
02:33:12,539 --> 02:33:15,960
pollen was falling off and landing

3690
02:33:14,309 --> 02:33:17,488
directly onto the tray and I wasn't

3691
02:33:15,959 --> 02:33:19,769
losing as much the only problem there

3692
02:33:17,488 --> 02:33:21,139
was I was gathering a whole bunch of

3693
02:33:19,770 --> 02:33:23,238
male flowers

3694
02:33:21,139 --> 02:33:25,459
so what I had to do was sift out the

3695
02:33:23,238 --> 02:33:26,629
male flowers from the pollen because you

3696
02:33:25,459 --> 02:33:27,978
don't want to leave those male flowers

3697
02:33:26,629 --> 02:33:30,139
in there if you store it with those male

3698
02:33:27,978 --> 02:33:31,879
flowers in there there is a chance that

3699
02:33:30,139 --> 02:33:33,680
those male flowers have moisture in them

3700
02:33:31,879 --> 02:33:35,420
and they will mildew up inside of your

3701
02:33:33,680 --> 02:33:37,340
jar and moisture is one of your biggest

3702
02:33:35,420 --> 02:33:39,379
enemies to pollen we're gonna talk about

3703
02:33:37,340 --> 02:33:40,699
that here in just a minute so what I

3704
02:33:39,379 --> 02:33:43,278
found to be the most successful was

3705
02:33:40,699 --> 02:33:44,630
taking the chopping of the tops just

3706
02:33:43,279 --> 02:33:46,310
chopped the top right off the male plant

3707
02:33:44,629 --> 02:33:47,988
and I set it on a glass tray and just

3708
02:33:46,309 --> 02:33:49,430
tapped it and I just tapped it for a

3709
02:33:47,988 --> 02:33:51,079
couple of good minutes he was tapping it

3710
02:33:49,430 --> 02:33:53,090
kind of hard and then I could just see

3711
02:33:51,079 --> 02:33:55,189
the pollen falling out of the buds then

3712
02:33:53,090 --> 02:33:56,299
I turned it over and did it again then I

3713
02:33:55,189 --> 02:33:57,859
picked it up and kind of tapped it with

3714
02:33:56,299 --> 02:33:59,738
my finger to knock off any pollen that

3715
02:33:57,859 --> 02:34:02,449
stuck and then I just threw that big old

3716
02:33:59,738 --> 02:34:04,488
pollen what do i do just Paul and

3717
02:34:02,449 --> 02:34:07,850
removed bud just through that part right

3718
02:34:04,488 --> 02:34:09,170
into the trash so I felt it setting it

3719
02:34:07,850 --> 02:34:10,939
on the Tran tapping it was my best

3720
02:34:09,170 --> 02:34:12,500
method for collecting pollen however I

3721
02:34:10,939 --> 02:34:15,290
did get all those male plants so I just

3722
02:34:12,500 --> 02:34:18,199
used kind of sketchy but I just used an

3723
02:34:15,290 --> 02:34:21,199
old ID on a plate and just separated the

3724
02:34:18,199 --> 02:34:22,729
male flowers from the pollen I kind of

3725
02:34:21,199 --> 02:34:24,380
felt like a cross between when you used

3726
02:34:22,728 --> 02:34:25,879
to pick seeds out of schwag weed and

3727
02:34:24,379 --> 02:34:27,379
also when you used to use a credit card

3728
02:34:25,879 --> 02:34:29,539
to do bad drugs it's kind of what it

3729
02:34:27,379 --> 02:34:31,789
felt like so I was a weird feeling but

3730
02:34:29,540 --> 02:34:34,040
it was definitely I worked it worked

3731
02:34:31,790 --> 02:34:36,020
very well so I've got a a mason jar with

3732
02:34:34,040 --> 02:34:37,760
a nice like two-inch layer of a rise

3733
02:34:36,020 --> 02:34:39,470
pollen on the bottom of it and I do plan

3734
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:42,050
on making some crosses with the rise I

3735
02:34:39,469 --> 02:34:44,629
also plan on making and a rise f2 in the

3736
02:34:42,049 --> 02:34:46,009
future here so look out for some seeds

3737
02:34:44,629 --> 02:34:47,568
coming up for my region etics in the

3738
02:34:46,010 --> 02:34:49,100
very near future I'll need some testers

3739
02:34:47,568 --> 02:34:51,170
I need you guys to run those for me and

3740
02:34:49,100 --> 02:34:52,610
tell me what they do

3741
02:34:51,170 --> 02:34:53,899
I'm gonna get a bunch of messages from

3742
02:34:52,610 --> 02:34:54,650
people that want to be testers that's

3743
02:34:53,899 --> 02:34:56,420
cool I could deal with that

3744
02:34:54,649 --> 02:34:58,189
I'm very selective on testers you guys

3745
02:34:56,420 --> 02:34:59,930
so when it comes time to test seeds you

3746
02:34:58,189 --> 02:35:01,159
need to have an impressive resume if you

3747
02:34:59,930 --> 02:35:02,540
want to be a tester for me because I

3748
02:35:01,159 --> 02:35:04,389
need to know what's truly going on with

3749
02:35:02,540 --> 02:35:06,320
these plants I need reliable testers

3750
02:35:04,389 --> 02:35:07,399
when the time comes I will talk about

3751
02:35:06,319 --> 02:35:09,559
that on the show it's not time for

3752
02:35:07,399 --> 02:35:10,850
testers yet all right another method

3753
02:35:09,559 --> 02:35:11,989
that I was using to try to collect the

3754
02:35:10,850 --> 02:35:13,640
pollen that I didn't find to be very

3755
02:35:11,989 --> 02:35:15,289
successful was I was cutting the branch

3756
02:35:13,639 --> 02:35:16,879
off that had the male flowers on it and

3757
02:35:15,290 --> 02:35:19,460
just cutting it into six or eight inch

3758
02:35:16,879 --> 02:35:21,079
sections and holding actually kind of

3759
02:35:19,459 --> 02:35:22,849
dipping that into a mason jar and then

3760
02:35:21,079 --> 02:35:24,680
tapping it at the base of the stalk and

3761
02:35:22,850 --> 02:35:26,180
it was working but I was not able to

3762
02:35:24,680 --> 02:35:28,130
knock off enough pollen to make it worth

3763
02:35:26,180 --> 02:35:29,960
my time and it was also knocking off a

3764
02:35:28,129 --> 02:35:31,309
bunch of male flowers into the mason jar

3765
02:35:29,959 --> 02:35:33,500
which meant that I had to pour that back

3766
02:35:31,309 --> 02:35:35,478
out onto the plate anyway to sift it so

3767
02:35:33,500 --> 02:35:37,728
it wasn't really I didn't find it to be

3768
02:35:35,478 --> 02:35:41,510
effective so I think the best method was

3769
02:35:37,728 --> 02:35:42,559
to put if you got a giant mirror or if

3770
02:35:41,510 --> 02:35:45,110
you're a drummer and you've got an old

3771
02:35:42,559 --> 02:35:46,670
kick drum head just drop a nug the male

3772
02:35:45,110 --> 02:35:48,260
plant right down onto the giant mirror

3773
02:35:46,670 --> 02:35:49,460
and just tap on it then all the pollen

3774
02:35:48,260 --> 02:35:51,860
will fall off and then you use a credit

3775
02:35:49,459 --> 02:35:54,379
card or an old ID just to scrape it up

3776
02:35:51,860 --> 02:35:55,579
it's easy to collect pollen so once

3777
02:35:54,379 --> 02:35:57,438
you've got your pollen you're going to

3778
02:35:55,579 --> 02:35:59,120
need to store your pollen I recommend

3779
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:00,680
putting it in a mason jar and then I

3780
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:02,900
like to put that mason jar in a brown

3781
02:36:00,680 --> 02:36:04,930
paper bag to keep it dark and then I put

3782
02:36:02,899 --> 02:36:07,369
all of that inside of the refrigerator

3783
02:36:04,930 --> 02:36:09,500
carefully label your jars of quality

3784
02:36:07,370 --> 02:36:12,770
guys that's really important my jar says

3785
02:36:09,500 --> 02:36:15,139
a rise f-1 pollen collected five five

3786
02:36:12,770 --> 02:36:16,760
sixteen that's easy enough I know that

3787
02:36:15,139 --> 02:36:19,189
that's a rise pollen and I know what it

3788
02:36:16,760 --> 02:36:21,020
was collected I've never really tried to

3789
02:36:19,189 --> 02:36:23,329
store pollen for too long I always use

3790
02:36:21,020 --> 02:36:25,909
it kind of soon I could imagine it would

3791
02:36:23,329 --> 02:36:29,299
last a few months maybe but I'm honestly

3792
02:36:25,909 --> 02:36:30,950
not sure it's properly stored six months

3793
02:36:29,299 --> 02:36:33,199
maybe a year I don't want to lie to you

3794
02:36:30,950 --> 02:36:34,850
if you've got information on how long if

3795
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:36,650
you've had pollen stored for a long time

3796
02:36:34,850 --> 02:36:38,569
and you used it and it worked

3797
02:36:36,649 --> 02:36:40,719
send me an email grow from your heart at

3798
02:36:38,569 --> 02:36:43,250
hotmail.com I want to hear your pollen

3799
02:36:40,719 --> 02:36:44,929
methods on how long and how you apply

3800
02:36:43,250 --> 02:36:46,850
pollen order how long you keep it before

3801
02:36:44,930 --> 02:36:48,559
you apply it and now what the oldest

3802
02:36:46,850 --> 02:36:50,569
viable pollen you ever had was that's

3803
02:36:48,559 --> 02:36:52,010
what I want to know all right so you've

3804
02:36:50,569 --> 02:36:54,170
collected a bunch of pollen you've got

3805
02:36:52,010 --> 02:36:55,280
it in a mason jar it's well labeled it's

3806
02:36:54,170 --> 02:36:56,510
been stored in the fridge for a little

3807
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:58,939
bit here's something I must have

3808
02:36:56,510 --> 02:37:01,370
mentioned do not get your pollen wet in

3809
02:36:58,939 --> 02:37:04,010
any way shape or form Moisture is

3810
02:37:01,370 --> 02:37:05,060
pollens worst enemy a lot of people ask

3811
02:37:04,010 --> 02:37:07,130
me they're like

3812
02:37:05,059 --> 02:37:08,328
you breed and you grow seedless flowers

3813
02:37:07,129 --> 02:37:10,068
in the same facility

3814
02:37:08,328 --> 02:37:12,228
aren't you scared having that male

3815
02:37:10,068 --> 02:37:13,850
flower around or that male plant around

3816
02:37:12,228 --> 02:37:15,228
that's just spitting pollen aren't you

3817
02:37:13,850 --> 02:37:18,979
worried about seating up all of your

3818
02:37:15,228 --> 02:37:21,019
females um sometimes [ __ ] happens

3819
02:37:18,978 --> 02:37:22,250
yes sometimes I have grown crops that

3820
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:23,750
were meant to be seedless and I have

3821
02:37:22,250 --> 02:37:25,250
accidentally discovered a whole bunch of

3822
02:37:23,750 --> 02:37:27,109
seeds in there and it was because I had

3823
02:37:25,250 --> 02:37:29,930
a male plant in the same area and it

3824
02:37:27,109 --> 02:37:33,340
just got cross pollinated but the secret

3825
02:37:29,930 --> 02:37:36,229
is water deactivates pollen II guys so

3826
02:37:33,340 --> 02:37:38,090
I've got two separate areas one's got a

3827
02:37:36,228 --> 02:37:39,318
male plant one's got female plants the

3828
02:37:38,090 --> 02:37:41,630
female plants are in flower and

3829
02:37:39,318 --> 02:37:43,609
completely able to accept pollen that

3830
02:37:41,629 --> 02:37:45,139
are still in their ovulation phase they

3831
02:37:43,609 --> 02:37:47,600
can accept pollen they can make seeds

3832
02:37:45,139 --> 02:37:49,728
they can become seated they can they're

3833
02:37:47,600 --> 02:37:51,380
gonna grow long enough to make viable

3834
02:37:49,728 --> 02:37:52,938
seed the way that I prevent them from

3835
02:37:51,379 --> 02:37:55,219
being seeded when I mess with my male

3836
02:37:52,939 --> 02:37:57,619
plant so yesterday I was playing with a

3837
02:37:55,219 --> 02:38:00,010
male plant about 30 feet away from those

3838
02:37:57,619 --> 02:38:02,270
female plants what I did was I took a

3839
02:38:00,010 --> 02:38:03,828
like my backpack sprayer that I would

3840
02:38:02,270 --> 02:38:05,270
apply pesticides or follow your feet in

3841
02:38:03,828 --> 02:38:07,158
there I just mixed up some water in

3842
02:38:05,270 --> 02:38:09,828
there just straight clean water i pH hit

3843
02:38:07,158 --> 02:38:11,719
at 6.5 and I sprayed that all over my

3844
02:38:09,828 --> 02:38:13,340
female plants and then I went and I

3845
02:38:11,719 --> 02:38:15,618
played with my male plant in a separate

3846
02:38:13,340 --> 02:38:17,750
area I collected all the pollen from him

3847
02:38:15,619 --> 02:38:19,220
then I cleaned up I threw away all the

3848
02:38:17,750 --> 02:38:21,559
trash I threw away the pot I threw away

3849
02:38:19,219 --> 02:38:23,510
not the pot like the the container I

3850
02:38:21,559 --> 02:38:25,278
throw away the container I threw all the

3851
02:38:23,510 --> 02:38:26,619
dirt I cleaned up I swept up that room I

3852
02:38:25,279 --> 02:38:28,939
cleaned up the room where the mail was

3853
02:38:26,619 --> 02:38:30,140
then I took the clothes that I was

3854
02:38:28,939 --> 02:38:32,119
wearing and I walked straight to a

3855
02:38:30,139 --> 02:38:33,578
washing machine I took the clothes off

3856
02:38:32,119 --> 02:38:36,199
and threw them into a washing machine

3857
02:38:33,578 --> 02:38:38,828
then I walked myself directly to a

3858
02:38:36,199 --> 02:38:41,658
shower and I hosed myself down including

3859
02:38:38,828 --> 02:38:44,209
you guys I am six foot five and I have

3860
02:38:41,658 --> 02:38:47,059
got dreadlocks almost to my knees my

3861
02:38:44,209 --> 02:38:48,589
dreadlocks are mid-thigh region and I

3862
02:38:47,059 --> 02:38:50,000
had to run to a shower and just rinse my

3863
02:38:48,590 --> 02:38:52,010
whole self down so I did go wash the

3864
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:55,578
dreads I did go wash the beard just wet

3865
02:38:52,010 --> 02:38:57,859
and scrub myself I feel that the water I

3866
02:38:55,578 --> 02:38:59,449
applied to those female plants made them

3867
02:38:57,859 --> 02:39:01,068
unable it was a little bit of birth

3868
02:38:59,449 --> 02:39:03,050
control it made them unable to collect

3869
02:39:01,068 --> 02:39:05,028
pollen the pollen was not allowed to

3870
02:39:03,049 --> 02:39:06,948
land on the pistil and move into the

3871
02:39:05,029 --> 02:39:09,439
ovule because the water was in the way I

3872
02:39:06,949 --> 02:39:11,000
also feel that any water or any pollen

3873
02:39:09,439 --> 02:39:12,738
that was on myself on my clothes was

3874
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:14,658
destroyed as soon as it hit the water I

3875
02:39:12,738 --> 02:39:15,648
carried those clothes up to the washing

3876
02:39:14,658 --> 02:39:17,000
machine I threw him in the washing

3877
02:39:15,648 --> 02:39:18,619
machine turn on the water

3878
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:19,940
I even the Hat that I was

3879
02:39:18,620 --> 02:39:21,351
whirring got thrown into that washing

3880
02:39:19,940 --> 02:39:23,480
machine so all the clothes got washed

3881
02:39:21,351 --> 02:39:26,810
the Hat got washed then the dreadlocks

3882
02:39:23,479 --> 02:39:29,000
got washed i got washed and then before

3883
02:39:26,810 --> 02:39:30,709
i went back into the grow room with the

3884
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:33,021
females i went and grabbed my sprayer

3885
02:39:30,709 --> 02:39:35,149
again and i sprayed it in front of me as

3886
02:39:33,021 --> 02:39:36,860
i walked into that room so there was

3887
02:39:35,149 --> 02:39:38,329
water landing on those plants before i

3888
02:39:36,860 --> 02:39:40,970
got into there is kind of what I was

3889
02:39:38,329 --> 02:39:42,709
aiming for I'm pretty sure that these

3890
02:39:40,969 --> 02:39:44,170
plants will not be seated the female

3891
02:39:42,709 --> 02:39:46,159
plants that I was messing with and

3892
02:39:44,170 --> 02:39:47,750
yesterday after I played with my male

3893
02:39:46,159 --> 02:39:50,601
plant I went took pictures of the girls

3894
02:39:47,750 --> 02:39:53,840
I am 99% sure that I did not see them

3895
02:39:50,601 --> 02:39:56,930
it's all about water you guys I have

3896
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:58,549
seen people set up a screen like a

3897
02:39:56,930 --> 02:40:00,079
screen door so you open up your drill

3898
02:39:58,549 --> 02:40:01,819
room door then there's a screen door and

3899
02:40:00,079 --> 02:40:04,069
they've got water running down that

3900
02:40:01,819 --> 02:40:05,629
screen door there's a little mr. spring

3901
02:40:04,069 --> 02:40:07,459
water right at the top and it collects

3902
02:40:05,629 --> 02:40:10,009
on the screen and runs down that is

3903
02:40:07,459 --> 02:40:12,079
their pollen catch they also sell a UV

3904
02:40:10,010 --> 02:40:15,050
light that will kill pollen that goes in

3905
02:40:12,079 --> 02:40:16,430
your ducting so if pollen comes in it

3906
02:40:15,049 --> 02:40:17,629
goes through this UV light that goes

3907
02:40:16,430 --> 02:40:19,579
through your ducting and then it is just

3908
02:40:17,629 --> 02:40:21,259
killed right there it's neutralized so

3909
02:40:19,579 --> 02:40:23,360
pollen isn't as scary as a lot of people

3910
02:40:21,260 --> 02:40:25,219
like to think water will destroy pollen

3911
02:40:23,360 --> 02:40:26,810
if you were afraid of pollinating your

3912
02:40:25,219 --> 02:40:29,299
plants just apply a little bit of water

3913
02:40:26,810 --> 02:40:31,069
and you should be safe alright if you

3914
02:40:29,299 --> 02:40:33,319
guys are playing with pollen and female

3915
02:40:31,069 --> 02:40:35,389
plants and male plants in a small area

3916
02:40:33,319 --> 02:40:37,579
in a house and a home grow the first

3917
02:40:35,389 --> 02:40:39,649
couple of times expect to get some seeds

3918
02:40:37,579 --> 02:40:42,021
it takes one little tiny speck of pollen

3919
02:40:39,649 --> 02:40:43,879
to make a seed and pollen is so tiny you

3920
02:40:42,021 --> 02:40:45,170
can't get it all off of you unless you

3921
02:40:43,879 --> 02:40:46,459
kind of have some experience you know

3922
02:40:45,170 --> 02:40:49,340
what you're doing so don't be surprised

3923
02:40:46,459 --> 02:40:50,869
if you pollinate your crop on accident

3924
02:40:49,340 --> 02:40:52,430
you guys I've been going for 17 minutes

3925
02:40:50,870 --> 02:40:53,811
now and you can hear the dryness in my

3926
02:40:52,430 --> 02:40:55,729
throat so I'm gonna take a quick drink

3927
02:40:53,810 --> 02:40:57,819
and a couple of dabs and I will be right

3928
02:40:55,729 --> 02:41:00,649

wrong and help you correct and improve

3960
02:41:52,761 --> 02:41:57,470
your grow so recently I was called to a

3961
02:41:55,610 --> 02:41:58,761
place where this guy had powdery mildew

3962
02:41:57,470 --> 02:42:01,430
and he could not figure out what was

3963
02:41:58,761 --> 02:42:03,470
causing the powdery mildew the problem

3964
02:42:01,431 --> 02:42:05,899
was that he was not getting rid of his

3965
02:42:03,470 --> 02:42:08,239
old stale air I talk about this a lot

3966
02:42:05,899 --> 02:42:09,619
you need to remove the stagnant air from

3967
02:42:08,239 --> 02:42:11,000
your grow room you need to get rid of

3968
02:42:09,620 --> 02:42:12,380
that extra humidity you need to get rid

3969
02:42:11,000 --> 02:42:13,610
of that old moisture you need to get it

3970
02:42:12,379 --> 02:42:15,829
out of the room and get some fresh air

3971
02:42:13,610 --> 02:42:17,569
in there this guy is failing to do that

3972
02:42:15,829 --> 02:42:19,940
in his area and he is getting powdery

3973
02:42:17,569 --> 02:42:22,190
mildew we've tried a few things to get

3974
02:42:19,940 --> 02:42:23,659
rid of the powdery mildew we've applied

3975
02:42:22,190 --> 02:42:25,521
a couple of products that seem to be

3976
02:42:23,659 --> 02:42:27,110
working but unfortunately he had to

3977
02:42:25,521 --> 02:42:30,771
harvest a little bit early because the

3978
02:42:27,110 --> 02:42:31,940
PM was over taking a couple of plants so

3979
02:42:30,771 --> 02:42:33,681
let me tell you a little bit about what

3980
02:42:31,940 --> 02:42:35,360
we tried to get rid of this powdery

3981
02:42:33,681 --> 02:42:36,681
mildew awhile back when I first

3982
02:42:35,360 --> 02:42:38,210
discovered the powdery mildew in this

3983
02:42:36,681 --> 02:42:41,120
guy's garden I started applying a

3984
02:42:38,209 --> 02:42:43,129
product called stylet oil it's JMS style

3985
02:42:41,120 --> 02:42:45,500
in oil it seemed to be working very well

3986
02:42:43,129 --> 02:42:47,390
it was knocking the PM off of the leaves

3987
02:42:45,500 --> 02:42:49,459
we couldn't see any on there it wouldn't

3988
02:42:47,390 --> 02:42:51,170
come back for quite some time but we had

3989
02:42:49,459 --> 02:42:53,569
to keep spraying at about once a week to

3990
02:42:51,170 --> 02:42:55,970
keep the PM away and I really didn't

3991
02:42:53,569 --> 02:42:57,529
want to spray this stuff on heavy chunky

3992
02:42:55,970 --> 02:42:59,539
buds cuz I could tell it was leaving a

3993
02:42:57,530 --> 02:43:00,829
little bit of an oil on the plants which

3994
02:42:59,540 --> 02:43:02,780
was actually the main ingredient that

3995
02:43:00,829 --> 02:43:04,431
was stopping the PM I just did want to

3996
02:43:02,780 --> 02:43:06,650
put this oil all over his bud so I

3997
02:43:04,431 --> 02:43:08,601
didn't like spraying it I researched

3998
02:43:06,649 --> 02:43:11,090
another product and I was recommended

3999
02:43:08,601 --> 02:43:14,540
big-time exterminator a big-time

4000
02:43:11,090 --> 02:43:16,069
exterminator is 90 or is mostly a citric

4001
02:43:14,540 --> 02:43:17,480
acid or citric oil I don't remember

4002
02:43:16,069 --> 02:43:20,181
which one it is I think a citric acid

4003
02:43:17,479 --> 02:43:21,979
and it works very well and keeping

4004
02:43:20,181 --> 02:43:24,230
insects away it makes the plants look

4005
02:43:21,979 --> 02:43:26,420
really good and it also took the powdery

4006
02:43:24,229 --> 02:43:28,100
mildew off of the plants unfortunately

4007
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:29,840
this product only works to keep the

4008
02:43:28,101 --> 02:43:31,310
powdery mildew at bay for about three to

4009
02:43:29,840 --> 02:43:33,860
five days at a time before he would

4010
02:43:31,310 --> 02:43:35,569
start seeing little speckles pop up it

4011
02:43:33,860 --> 02:43:37,069
was getting closer to harvest and I

4012
02:43:35,569 --> 02:43:39,709
wanted to try something a little bit

4013
02:43:37,069 --> 02:43:42,351
more extreme we were ready to go extreme

4014
02:43:39,709 --> 02:43:44,000
we did not want to use Eagle 20 I am

4015
02:43:42,351 --> 02:43:45,050
trying to only use products that are

4016
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:47,119
allowed by the Emmy

4017
02:43:45,049 --> 02:43:49,219
in my personal grow and in my caregiver

4018
02:43:47,119 --> 02:43:50,689
grows and in my consultant grows just

4019
02:43:49,219 --> 02:43:52,728
because it's easier to have one playing

4020
02:43:50,689 --> 02:43:56,359
field so we will not use Eagle 20 in

4021
02:43:52,728 --> 02:43:59,179
this garden what I did use was I got 30%

4022
02:43:56,359 --> 02:44:02,029
hydrogen peroxide and I filled up a four

4023
02:43:59,180 --> 02:44:04,520
gallon pump sprayer and I put off 20

4024
02:44:02,029 --> 02:44:07,158
milliliters per gallon of 30% hydrogen

4025
02:44:04,520 --> 02:44:09,738
peroxide in this water and I adjusted

4026
02:44:07,158 --> 02:44:11,658
the pH and I soaked all of the plants

4027
02:44:09,738 --> 02:44:14,420
with this hydrogen peroxide solution and

4028
02:44:11,658 --> 02:44:16,368
it took off most of the powdery mildew

4029
02:44:14,420 --> 02:44:17,930
and it did not come back unfortunately

4030
02:44:16,369 --> 02:44:20,029
there was one plant in the back corner

4031
02:44:17,930 --> 02:44:21,979
or the powdery mildew had kind of taken

4032
02:44:20,029 --> 02:44:23,899
over and I didn't see it was so bad back

4033
02:44:21,978 --> 02:44:25,908
there I didn't spray enough it did not

4034
02:44:23,898 --> 02:44:28,519
take off the powdery mildew on one plant

4035
02:44:25,908 --> 02:44:30,139
so my friend harvested most of his

4036
02:44:28,520 --> 02:44:32,029
plants didn't show signs of powdery

4037
02:44:30,139 --> 02:44:34,398
mildew this one plant that did have

4038
02:44:32,029 --> 02:44:36,289
powdery mildew I found a solution online

4039
02:44:34,398 --> 02:44:38,599
my friend Jorge Cervantes taught us

4040
02:44:36,289 --> 02:44:41,449
about this I took a five-gallon bucket

4041
02:44:38,600 --> 02:44:43,609
and I put 50 milliliters of the 30%

4042
02:44:41,449 --> 02:44:45,229
hydrogen peroxide in the bucket because

4043
02:44:43,609 --> 02:44:46,340
whenever you're mad let me let me back

4044
02:44:45,228 --> 02:44:48,170
up a little bit whatever you were

4045
02:44:46,340 --> 02:44:51,170
messing with this hydrogen peroxide be

4046
02:44:48,170 --> 02:44:52,578
sure to wear rubber gloves you need some

4047
02:44:51,170 --> 02:44:53,779
latex gloves you don't want to get this

4048
02:44:52,578 --> 02:44:54,648
stuff on your fingers it'll burn your

4049
02:44:53,779 --> 02:44:56,479
fingers

4050
02:44:54,648 --> 02:44:58,010
depending on what kind of skin you've

4051
02:44:56,478 --> 02:45:00,469
got it could mess up your fingers I'm a

4052
02:44:58,010 --> 02:45:02,270
white guy i dribbled someone my fingers

4053
02:45:00,469 --> 02:45:05,148
and made my fingers look bleached white

4054
02:45:02,270 --> 02:45:06,680
I imagine if you don't have working

4055
02:45:05,148 --> 02:45:08,478
hands if you've got some softer more

4056
02:45:06,680 --> 02:45:10,430
gentle hands it probably could burn your

4057
02:45:08,478 --> 02:45:11,840
skin pretty well so make sure you wear

4058
02:45:10,430 --> 02:45:14,658
gloves when you're using the hydrogen

4059
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:16,460
peroxide so make sure 50 mils of

4060
02:45:14,658 --> 02:45:18,618
hydrogen peroxide into five a five

4061
02:45:16,459 --> 02:45:20,568
gallon bucket of water and you guys this

4062
02:45:18,619 --> 02:45:22,729
may sound crazy but I chopped the buds

4063
02:45:20,568 --> 02:45:24,769
off of this plant and I was dunking them

4064
02:45:22,728 --> 02:45:26,328
directly into the water and swishing

4065
02:45:24,770 --> 02:45:27,949
them around for about five to seven

4066
02:45:26,328 --> 02:45:29,869
seconds just swishing it under the water

4067
02:45:27,949 --> 02:45:32,090
with the peroxide in there let me back

4068
02:45:29,869 --> 02:45:33,859
up I would cut off most of the leaf he

4069
02:45:32,090 --> 02:45:35,630
guys most of the large leaf I'd give it

4070
02:45:33,859 --> 02:45:37,369
a little pre trim and then I would dunk

4071
02:45:35,629 --> 02:45:39,078
the bud into the hydrogen peroxide and

4072
02:45:37,369 --> 02:45:41,630
then I was hanging it on a wine with a

4073
02:45:39,078 --> 02:45:43,549
flat fan an oscillating fan blowing near

4074
02:45:41,629 --> 02:45:45,408
it constantly to dry these buds out as

4075
02:45:43,549 --> 02:45:47,090
quickly not dry them but to get them

4076
02:45:45,408 --> 02:45:48,648
water out of them as quickly as possible

4077
02:45:47,090 --> 02:45:50,719
I left the fan on there for two to three

4078
02:45:48,648 --> 02:45:52,099
hours and then toward the end of the day

4079
02:45:50,719 --> 02:45:53,988
I just turned the fan to where it wasn't

4080
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:56,300
blowing directly on them and I gave all

4081
02:45:53,988 --> 02:45:57,648
the buds of squeeze I cannot tell the

4082
02:45:56,299 --> 02:45:58,760
difference between the buds that I

4083
02:45:57,648 --> 02:46:00,979
dunked in their saloon

4084
02:45:58,761 --> 02:46:03,201
and the buds that were not docked the

4085
02:46:00,979 --> 02:46:06,591
best part is the buds I dunked shows

4086
02:46:03,200 --> 02:46:07,640
zero signs of powdery mildew I don't

4087
02:46:06,591 --> 02:46:08,871
know if this is something you want to

4088
02:46:07,640 --> 02:46:11,001
try at home this is not something I

4089
02:46:08,870 --> 02:46:13,550
would do in my garden but I saw it work

4090
02:46:11,001 --> 02:46:14,810
you guys and when I smoke this product

4091
02:46:13,550 --> 02:46:15,800
it's not ready to smoke yet it'll be

4092
02:46:14,810 --> 02:46:18,140
ready in a couple days

4093
02:46:15,800 --> 02:46:20,600
I am 90% sure that I'm not going to

4094
02:46:18,140 --> 02:46:23,359
notice any of the peroxide solution in

4095
02:46:20,601 --> 02:46:25,551
these flowers so may sound completely

4096
02:46:23,360 --> 02:46:26,690
crazy but if you've got a plant that's

4097
02:46:25,550 --> 02:46:28,251
got to be harvested and it's got a

4098
02:46:26,690 --> 02:46:30,351
little bit of powdery mildew on it the

4099
02:46:28,251 --> 02:46:32,360
best solution is to get a five-gallon

4100
02:46:30,351 --> 02:46:33,951
bucket some water and a little bit of

4101
02:46:32,360 --> 02:46:35,601
hydrogen peroxide and go ahead and dunk

4102
02:46:33,950 --> 02:46:37,220
those buds in there leave them in there

4103
02:46:35,601 --> 02:46:39,621
for five or six seconds pull them out

4104
02:46:37,220 --> 02:46:41,180
hang them up put a fan on them and try

4105
02:46:39,620 --> 02:46:43,370
to start getting them dry safely and

4106
02:46:41,181 --> 02:46:44,780
then from once they get dried out from

4107
02:46:43,370 --> 02:46:46,310
that water you just put in there you're

4108
02:46:44,780 --> 02:46:48,110
just drying them just like normal you

4109
02:46:46,310 --> 02:46:49,700
would dry and cure them just like any

4110
02:46:48,110 --> 02:46:51,771
other flowers that you've cut down so I

4111
02:46:49,700 --> 02:46:52,819
hope that helps save your crop the most

4112
02:46:51,771 --> 02:46:54,110
important part you guys if you're

4113
02:46:52,819 --> 02:46:55,550
getting powdery mildew you need to

4114
02:46:54,110 --> 02:46:57,381
correct the issue in your grow room

4115
02:46:55,550 --> 02:46:59,149
something is causing that powdery mildew

4116
02:46:57,380 --> 02:47:01,399
to happen you are not getting enough

4117
02:46:59,149 --> 02:47:03,649
airflow in there I highly recommend

4118
02:47:01,399 --> 02:47:05,091
heavily defoliation your plants take off

4119
02:47:03,649 --> 02:47:07,100
all the extra leaf that will prevent

4120
02:47:05,091 --> 02:47:09,229
p.m. there will be less surface area for

4121
02:47:07,101 --> 02:47:11,150
the PM to build up on if you've got two

4122
02:47:09,229 --> 02:47:13,130
leaves that are on top of each other one

4123
02:47:11,149 --> 02:47:14,630
leaf lays on top of another and you get

4124
02:47:13,130 --> 02:47:16,640
that little water layer underneath there

4125
02:47:14,630 --> 02:47:18,529
that will eventually turn into powdery

4126
02:47:16,640 --> 02:47:20,479
mildew all your plants are sweating on

4127
02:47:18,530 --> 02:47:22,161
top of each other and that sweaty space

4128
02:47:20,479 --> 02:47:24,859
is the perfect environment to create

4129
02:47:22,161 --> 02:47:26,569
some p.m. also another thing that we are

4130
02:47:24,860 --> 02:47:27,891
experimenting with I need to get with my

4131
02:47:26,569 --> 02:47:29,931
friend that's got this product but he

4132
02:47:27,890 --> 02:47:32,300
recently bought the clean light what the

4133
02:47:29,931 --> 02:47:34,701
clean light is it is a UV light that is

4134
02:47:32,300 --> 02:47:35,990
designed for the strawberry industry and

4135
02:47:34,700 --> 02:47:38,000
the pumpkin industry because

4136
02:47:35,990 --> 02:47:40,700
strawberries and pumpkins apparently get

4137
02:47:38,001 --> 02:47:42,050
powdery mildew very heavily so they take

4138
02:47:40,700 --> 02:47:43,550
this light and they hold it three to

4139
02:47:42,050 --> 02:47:45,229
four inches above the plants and they

4140
02:47:43,550 --> 02:47:47,810
just move this ultraviolet light around

4141
02:47:45,229 --> 02:47:49,819
and this light supposedly kills powdery

4142
02:47:47,810 --> 02:47:51,261
mildew my friend just got it he's only

4143
02:47:49,819 --> 02:47:52,640
used it a few times they say it takes

4144
02:47:51,261 --> 02:47:55,131
about a week of constant use of

4145
02:47:52,640 --> 02:47:56,690
consistent used to get rid of the PM but

4146
02:47:55,130 --> 02:47:58,340
I will check with him in a few days and

4147
02:47:56,690 --> 02:48:00,681
we will see if this has cured his

4148
02:47:58,341 --> 02:48:03,261
powdery mildew problem hey guys since

4149
02:48:00,681 --> 02:48:06,351
I'm talking about p.m. I have a theory

4150
02:48:03,261 --> 02:48:08,920
I feel like CBD rich plants seem to be

4151
02:48:06,351 --> 02:48:10,239
more susceptible to powdery mildew

4152
02:48:08,920 --> 02:48:12,819
I think there's something in the THC

4153
02:48:10,239 --> 02:48:14,439
that gives it resistance to p.m. and I

4154
02:48:12,819 --> 02:48:16,539
do plan on talking to Fox a little bit

4155
02:48:14,439 --> 02:48:18,579
more about this so the next time I have

4156
