93
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:34,560
move forward you guys i do have some

94
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:36,079
topics to talk about not just a bunch of

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,318
rambles on today's episode i've got a

96
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
few great emails here in front of me

97
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,518
this one we're going to jump right into

98
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,359
it this one i titled the selection

99
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,840
question this one comes from our friend

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,239
that calls themselves jh and it goes a

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,560
little bit like this it says in every 10

102
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,878
to 20 seeds there is one plant that just

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,120
looks happy the entire time

104
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:57,039
so that does make sense i've noticed

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,640
sometimes that when you run a pack of

106
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:00,400
seeds you'll run 10 or 20 seeds and

107
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,079
there's always going to be one that just

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,840
just shines that's that's like the

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,920
dating pool that's the way i describe

110
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,598
dating that's the way i find uh describe

111
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,839
finding the phenotype that you like that

112
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,079
one is gonna shine it says in your

113
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,680
opinion how important is that plant in

114
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:18,400
the selection process um that

115
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,120
the fact that it just shines says a lot

116
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,319
is it shining because uh is it now there

117
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,759
are a couple of things to think about is

118
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:25,918
it shining because it's the only one

119
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,600
getting the right [ __ ] or is it shining

120
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,439
because it is thriving we've got a

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,120
couple things to think about

122
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,639
when we run plants for the first time we

123
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,800
don't know what they expect so we just

124
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,120
give them in most cases we give them the

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,560
general uh 84 80ish degrees 70 humidity

126
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,639
we give them all the basics and we run

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,839
them the first time and see what they do

128
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,199
some plants are going to be happy in

129
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,000
that some are not going to be happy in

130
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,000
that

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,959
it looks like you're always finding and

132
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,879
that's that's a good uh the odds of that

133
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,478
one plant shining are always really good

134
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:56,560
because we've designed we've bred these

135
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,918
plants to work in the grow rooms which

136
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
we've designed the plants have been bred

137
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:00,959
to work in the rooms and the rooms have

138
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,720
been designed to work with the plants

139
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,638
the way that we bred them so if you've

140
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,160
got a 10 pack or a 20 pack in a decent

141
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,038
grow room you're always going to find at

142
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,639
least one that super shines now is that

143
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,199
one shining because the other nine are

144
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,439
not happy or 19 are not happy or is that

145
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,960
one shining because it is super happy

146
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:18,399
now also is it shining because that's

147
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,239
the one that doesn't isn't real picky

148
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,599
doesn't require a lot of stuff that is a

149
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,079
very common thing what you're running

150
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
into is just phenotypical expression one

151
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,079
of them is happier than the others and

152
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,479
it is shining um how important is that

153
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,719
in the selection process

154
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,159
that is half of what we're that's a

155
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,840
small portion of what we're looking for

156
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
less than half of what we're looking for

157
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,359
is the performance of the plants in that

158
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
one condition

159
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,120
it performed well that's a good

160
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,879
indication that it works well in your

161
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,079
environment that is one really good

162
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,279
thing but how does it smoke does it ah

163
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:51,199
does it give you good harvest weight

164
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,758
does it give you good potency does the

165
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
smoke give you a desirable effect

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,160
is the flavor there because flavor

167
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,439
matters a lot to me flavor and aroma um

168
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
does it give you the weight that you

169
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,240
need

170
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,839
those are also very

171
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,680
important factors to think about during

172
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,239
a selection process growing it is great

173
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,079
if it grows well that's really cool but

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,240
once you cut it down the consumer has no

175
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,159
idea how it grew and they don't care a

176
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
lot of times the best plants to smoke

177
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,280
are the plants that grew like [ __ ] in

178
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,039
the garden the one that the grower had

179
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:22,239
to struggle with is the one that the

180
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:24,478
smokers really enjoy quite often so um

181
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,560
only part of the it's like a chess board

182
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,758
it's like we call it mimetics you got 64

183
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,759
squares on a chessboard right and the uh

184
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
this one looking good in the grow room

185
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,360
during the grow is one square of the

186
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,318
chessboard we need potency we need bug

187
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,000
resistance we need uh terps we need all

188
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,439
kinds of other things to make this a

189
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,639
winner not just one square on the

190
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:44,560
chessboard you got to cover the whole

191
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,319
board if you want to win

192
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,000
there is more to this it goes on it says

193
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,000
i'm bad at describing things but i'm

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,800
sure you know this plant it always has

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,319
the perfect leaf angle perfect color no

196
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,079
visible signs of stress and it looks

197
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,240
like she just wants to give you a high

198
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:02,159
five yes i do know that plant very well

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
once you grow a lot more and you get

200
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,000
more experience you'll be able to get

201
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,000
every plant in the room to look that way

202
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,279
you'll know that this one i need to move

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,879
it away from the light because it

204
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,239
doesn't like the extra heat but if i put

205
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,759
it in the corner it kind of enjoys that

206
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,360
and the other one it needs to go right

207
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,199
under the legs it wants all the extra

208
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,120
light this one i shouldn't water it so

209
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,800
much this one i can practically over

210
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,439
water it and it loves it so you'll start

211
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,918
learning those individual plants but in

212
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,839
selection something i say a lot of times

213
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:29,439
is don't select the plant for the

214
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:31,758
internet we're not selecting for

215
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:35,680
internet purposes we are selecting for

216
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,960
uh potency vigor resistance to bugs

217
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,639
terps there are a lot of other things

218
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,478
that we're selecting for so if you're

219
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,840
selecting for instagram for photos that

220
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,598
is the great phenotype we've got to

221
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,439
smoke it we've got to grow it all the

222
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,959
way out dry it cure it finish it and

223
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,800
then see if it is desirable that's

224
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:50,799
really the only way to tell is to dry it

225
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,720
cure it smoke it and see what you've got

226
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,400
it goes on it says that being said i

227
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
haven't had the happiest plant and the

228
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,839
best smelling plant lineup ever in 18

229
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,598
years of sprouting 10 seeds at a time is

230
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,758
that just bad luck or am i doing

231
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,800
something wrong no that is the way that

232
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,000
the weed gods like to mess with us

233
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,360
we've learned how to grow you've been

234
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
growing says 18 years you've been

235
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,479
growing cannabis producing cannabis for

236
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,000
18 years which means

237
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,199
you're pretty good at it by now you i

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,560
hope you're pretty good at it by now

239
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,160
you've got a flow you've got a rhythm

240
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,519
you're comfortable you've got a lot of

241
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,360
skills

242
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,878
so the world goes oh you got some skills

243
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,160
you think how about instead of giving

244
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,599
you this perfect plant we're going to

245
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,000
give you two to choose from i often make

246
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,598
the joke that when you run a 10 pack one

247
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,279
is going to be best for the consumer and

248
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,479
one is going to be best for the grower

249
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,559
and it's kind of what you're saying here

250
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,399
the happiest plant and best smelling

251
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,079
plant don't seem to line up the one that

252
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,599
the consumers want they never saw how

253
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
much of a pain in the ass that plant was

254
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,759
to grow they go i want an ounce of this

255
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,919
and then that one that grew super simply

256
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,360
for you and put out all the weight i it

257
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,199
wasn't the desirable it's never the

258
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,360
desirable one for the consumer that is

259
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,519
kind of a joke that i say the weed gods

260
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,959
play on us that is very common you're

261
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,639
not doing anything wrong that is just

262
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,679
how phenotypes work

263
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,480
um

264
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:00,159
i

265
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
i always find at least one keeper and a

266
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,399
10 pack of my stuff so the hard part is

267
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,600
deciding which of the three i usually

268
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,519
want to keep there's one that usually

269
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
tastes real good one that's usually

270
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,000
super potent uh and then that one that

271
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,838
just super [ __ ] performs uh the goal

272
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,360
there is to breed that line further and

273
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,200
get the things that you want out of that

274
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,680
but i know you're not doing anything

275
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,440
wrong you're doing it just right in my

276
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,759
opinion that is just a funny joke that

277
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,399
the cannabis gods the ganja gods play on

278
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:28,639
us uh the best smelling one and the best

279
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,799
performing plant are not the same uh the

280
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,720
consumer and the grower are always gonna

281
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,240
have different opinions in that aspect

282
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,600
all right my friend jh i feel like i

283
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,799

patreon supporters

297

shout out to my buddy guido at guido's

299
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:07,919
grow room you say that three times fast

300
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,360
one time was hard enough it goes on and

301
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,039
it says hey mr rj got a quick question

302
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,919
for you i'm getting ready to flip some

303
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:18,480
plants via sts so he's going to reverse

304
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,559
some plants using a silver thiosulfate

305
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,399
solution i've talked a lot about that on

306
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:24,078
other episodes if you want to learn a

307
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,320
lot more about reversing plants with

308
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,919
silver thiosulfate i've done a full

309
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,200
podcast simply google grow from your

310
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,599
heart podcast sts mix or my sts it will

311
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
come up um it says so he said i'm

312
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,399
getting ready to reverse some plants via

313
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,600
silver thiosulfate and i am wondering if

314
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:43,519
you have ever done it under an 1113 dj

315
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
short style light cycle that's a very

316
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,078
good question let me explain what that

317
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:51,278
means most of the time we put our plants

318
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:53,838
on 12 hours on and 12 hours off to

319
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:56,240
trigger the flowering phase our friend

320
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:59,440
dj short a long time ago taught us that

321
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:02,399
11 hours on and 13 hours off will give

322
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,720
us different results in some cases they

323
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,399
are improved results in some cases they

324
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,120
are diminished results it depends on

325
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,759
your goal i think that the extended dark

326
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,919
period gives the plants an opportunity

327
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:16,799
to show their expression a little bit

328
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:19,039
more we see more phenotypical variation

329
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,199
more phenotypical expression is what it

330
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,439
is that i believe i'm seeing with this

331
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,040
extended dark period this is not common

332
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,480
practice for me i've stopped doing this

333
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,719
i do something way different which i've

334
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:31,200
talked about in other episodes but dj

335
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,278
short has been doing the 1113 for a long

336
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,120
time it's got a lot of advantages if you

337
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:39,120
think about it if you're flowering for

338
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,440
63 days that is 63 hours of electricity

339
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,519
that you don't have to run that's 63

340
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,959
hours of power that didn't go through

341
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,039
your light bulb your air conditioner

342
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,759
your blower all your fans everything got

343
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,240
to chill out and cool down for 63 extra

344
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,039
hours which economically that is great

345
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,039
but in my opinion photons are the number

346
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,319
one source of energy for that plant so i

347
00:11:57,039 --> 00:12:00,240
want to give them all the light that

348
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
they can get that's a whole other debate

349
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,759
a whole other conversation right now

350
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,799
we're talking about putting these plants

351
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,039
under 1113 after they have been treated

352
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:12,000
with the silver thiosulfate solution in

353
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,439
an attempt to make feminized seeds it

354
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,200
goes on it says

355
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,120
i've got four ladies in the room

356
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,519
flowering now and we'll be adding the

357
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,839
two reversal candidates into the spot

358
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:26,159
tomorrow shouldn't be any issues right

359
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,079
um i do see an issue my dude um if the

360
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,679
four ladies are in the flower room

361
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,000
flowering room now and you're just

362
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:34,479
adding the two reversal candidates you

363
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
may have mistimed this

364
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,560
my general practice my standard

365
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,760
operating procedure is to begin the

366
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:42,078
reversal

367
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,720
uh get the plants being sprayed i spray

368
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,638
them seven to f ten to fourteen days the

369
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,120
first plant to get reversed get sprayed

370
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,200
10 to 14 days before it goes into flower

371
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,679
then that one will get sprayed again on

372
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,560
day one of flower then day 3 6 9 12 15

373
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:02,078
18 21 and possibly day 24.

374
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:04,638
i do not put the pollen receiving plants

375
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,039
into that room until i see those

376
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,000
reversed plants begin to show me

377
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:12,240
definite signs of male flowers when i

378
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,078
start seeing those pollen sacs pop up

379
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,159
that is when i move the female plants

380
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:17,759
into the room that is how i time it i

381
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:19,360
really think that timing works out

382
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:22,720
because it's going to be

383
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,320
a few days now several days 26 to 32

384
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,920
days before that male plant starts

385
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,440
producing pollen if your girls are

386
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,199
already in there

387
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
um how flung if they've been in there

388
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,920
flowering now i'll be adding to reversal

389
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,599
so you don't say how long they've been

390
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,759
in there but they're ahead they're too

391
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,399
far ahead of the male plants they're

392
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,399
going to be past their peak ovulation

393
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,519
point of receiving pollen to create

394
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,958
seeds

395
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,120
if you don't get those males dumping

396
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,039
pollen a little bit sooner it will work

397
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,120
don't don't panic don't freak out it

398
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,639
will work but if you would timed it a

399
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,360
little bit differently you would make a

400
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,959
lot more seed many probably double the

401
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,879
amount of seeds honestly it's all about

402
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:59,039
timing you want those plants to the

403
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,879
female plants the pollen receivers to

404
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,399
have the most i call it dandelions

405
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,159
people understand what i mean when i say

406
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,320
the dandelions when it starts making you

407
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:08,078
guys call it hairs those are pistols uh

408
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
when it starts making all the hairs

409
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:11,039
start popping up those hairs are what

410
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,800
are gonna catch the pollen that's that's

411
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,480
what catches the pollen it draws the

412
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,319
pollen down that into the ovule into the

413
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,480
bracton of the calyx starts forming a

414
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,079
seed within that area but all those

415
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,639
hairs are what are going to make the

416
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,399
seed those hairs have to be at the prime

417
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,399
peak point for pollination to get the

418
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,078
most seeds when they're real thick and

419
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,519
real strong looking

420
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,359
right after that is when they want the

421
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,879
most pollen then they start fading they

422
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,800
start wrinkling start crinkling up start

423
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,639
getting brown once they get withered up

424
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,078
and small that they can no longer

425
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,240
receive pollen they've passed their peak

426
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,159
point of pollination they've gone into

427
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,240
uh i guess they've gone into menopause

428
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,480
if you want to compare them to people so

429
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,720
so i think you are doing okay but the

430
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
timing could have been better but don't

431
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,360
panic don't tear it down don't start

432
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,040
over do what you're doing you're going

433
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,240
to get seeds out of this

434
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:59,039
um shouldn't be any issues right i think

435
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,278
the 11 13 cycle should work honestly i

436
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,799
have not done that so i don't have a

437
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,799
testimony but

438
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,599
with the info i've got the knowledge

439
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,000
experience uh i think it will work i

440
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,560
think it will do what needs done it may

441
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,639
help you out because your mail your

442
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,638
reversal plants may actually flip more

443
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,240
quickly because they're sleeping longer

444
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,600
i'm not sure how that will work it may

445
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,680
be beneficial

446
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,680
to correct your timing issue

447
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,278
it goes on it says and of course once

448
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,278
they start to show boy parts they'll go

449
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:30,320
into the breeding tent just need a week

450
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,399
to finish trim jail as i dry in the in

451
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,079
the other tent too i hope you have an

452
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,799
awesome day my man and thank you for

453
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,799
your time my buddy guido thank you for

454
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,159
the great question it sounds like you've

455
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:41,758
got the right idea but i think the

456
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:43,838
timing may have been off just a little

457
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,320
bit but i understand why we're limited

458
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,240
on space uh you're stuck in trim jail

459
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,680
which um should i ramble on that or

460
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,959
should i just let it go trim jail is a

461
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,278
weird thing to me because i actually

462
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:54,879
have friends in jail and if i said trim

463
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,879
jail to them they'd be like [ __ ]

464
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,958
do you see where i am and they'd find it

465
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:00,639
really disrespectful for me to say that

466
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,559
sitting here sitting at the table

467
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,839
listening to sublime eating doritos

468
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,758
talking to my friends and cutting up

469
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,680
weed under the air conditioner to put

470
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,600
the word jail in there my friends in

471
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,559
real jail would be [ __ ]

472
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,079
offended um they'd find it disrespectful

473
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,518
that's my quick rant on that nobody

474
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,758
cares about that i don't like trim jail

475
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,480
it's a silly [ __ ] word to say there's

476
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,839
real people in a real jail um

477
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,600
but i get it dude i get what you've got

478
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,800
to do you had to time it that way i

479
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,959
think it's going to work and i think

480
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,078
your light cycle will work i think

481
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:30,239
everything will turn out just the way

482
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:32,239
that you want it to um

483
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,159
my request is send me an update send me

484
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,919
feedback send me details how does this

485
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,519
work how many seeds do you pull from the

486
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,838
plants that you put in there

487
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,759
are you satisfied with the outcome and

488
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,160
uh did you get pollen on time that is

489
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,680
going to be my main question so guido

490
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,240
send me a follow-up send me some info

491
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,399
bro i can't wait uh for the follow-up uh

492
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,600
this came on may 9th so it should be a

493
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,000
couple of weeks here before i get more

494
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,600
info i'll give you until about june 1st

495
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,198
and i'll expect an update from you my

496
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,120
dude all right guido thank you for the

497
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,278
great message let's see how long we've

498
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,879
been rambling we've got plenty of time

499
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:04,400
for one more message i got a great

500
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,359
question here in front of me

501
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:10,079
this one came on the grow from your

502
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:13,279
heart at hotmail.com email address and

503
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:15,759
it goes a lot like this it says hey ross

504
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,918
did jeff my actual name is jack what's

505
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,078
up jack good to meet you my dude it says

506
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:22,079
when you use the thousand watt hps which

507
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:24,000
is a high pressure sodium lamp what

508
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:27,279
reflector type and what distance to the

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,279
canon canopy do you find to be optimal

510
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,678
that is a very good question

511
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:34,160
um when i was running a thousand watt

512
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,360
high pressure sodium light um

513
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,360
i

514
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:39,119
let's talk about my personal small home

515
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:40,479
grow because i'm pretty sure this person

516
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,678
isn't running a commercial grow with

517
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,519
gavitas which is what i do in a

518
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,840
commercial environment let's talk about

519
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,480
a small home grow or a small personal

520
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:50,879
private setup if i had 1000 watt hps

521
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,038
what reflector type and what distance do

522
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,320
i find to be optimal we've got a few

523
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:58,000
options i really like the vented and

524
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,918
ducted hoods that sounds weird to a lot

525
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,279
of people let me try to explain what i'm

526
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,400
talking about because some people may

527
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,839
not know

528
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,919
we basically

529
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,199
so all lights not all but the basic

530
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,280
design of a grow light is that you've

531
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,600
got your bulb and the bulb hangs

532
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,119
horizontally so it's going this way it

533
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,599
screws into the socket and it goes this

534
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,759
way then when it shines the light goes

535
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,439
all out of that bulb every direction so

536
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,160
we put it inside of what we call a

537
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,279
reflector or a hood and that it does

538
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,360
just like what it sounds like it's

539
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:27,119
supposed to do it reflects the light

540
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:29,119
down so all that light that goes up from

541
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,959
the top of the bulb hits that reflector

542
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,479
and gets spread down onto our plants

543
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,919
down onto our canopy we're paying for

544
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,759
all that light we want to move that

545
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,240
light down where we want it get those

546
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,319
photons to the plants so the light is

547
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,079
the light bulb is inside of this

548
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,079
basically an umbrella think of it as an

549
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,839
umbrella that is directing the light

550
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,678
back down onto your plants

551
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,119
now think about there's going to be a

552
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,960
lot of heat

553
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,359
generated by that bulb and that heat is

554
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,279
going to come down heat does rise but

555
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,439
that heat will come down into the plant

556
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,918
area into the canopy it will also raise

557
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,080
rise up out of that uh environment that

558
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,840
hood there that duct that uh the shield

559
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,918
the reflector will rise up out of there

560
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,079
and start heating up the grow room very

561
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,799
rapidly a thousand watt light puts off a

562
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:12,720
lot of btus of heat so one thing that i

563
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:14,960
like to do is buy what is known as a

564
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
ducted hood it's got glass underneath

565
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,600
there so the light goes inside the hood

566
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,679
or in the reflector and the glass goes

567
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,000
underneath that so now the heat cannot

568
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,759
escape from that enclosure and it stays

569
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,319
inside of there but

570
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,919
they've added six or eight inch flanges

571
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,240
on either end of it to where you can run

572
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
ducting in and ducting out and put a

573
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,720
blower at one end and extract that heat

574
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,079
from that light and get it away from the

575
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,480
grow environment i run a carbon filter

576
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,240
then ducting then the light then more

577
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,679
ducting and that goes right out of the

578
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,759
enclosure if it's a house if it's a

579
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,759
warehouse if it's a into another room if

580
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:51,519
it's a garage i run that right out to

581
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,919
another place just to exhaust that heat

582
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,918
get rid of it immediately and never even

583
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,679
makes it into the grow environment in

584
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,960
the winter i'll actually dump that into

585
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,559
either a veg room or a bedroom just to

586
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,240
use that heat utilize the heat i'm

587
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,158
spending the money on the electricity

588
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,319
let's utilize that heat that i heated up

589
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,640
get something out of it so

590
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,480
my favorite light setup in a thousand

591
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,240
watt environment for a home grow or a

592
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,440
personal project grow

593
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,279
is um a reflector with glass at the

594
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,360
bottom and the flanges at the end that

595
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:22,798
is ducted we call that a vented hood so

596
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,399
that i can just move that heat right

597
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,400
away from that grow light and get it

598
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,919
right out of the grow environment that

599
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,280
is kind of old school that is kind of

600
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,880
archaic but honestly um when i'm trying

601
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,839
something new in my grow space if i'm

602
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:38,159
trying a new nutrient a new grow style

603
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,158
a new product or anything new i run

604
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,679
those hps lights because i've had the

605
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,000
best results with those i've got the

606
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,440
most experience with those i know how to

607
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,279
operate those very well that's old

608
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,200
school it's kind of archaic but it works

609
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,519
really well for me

610
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,360
i've got a lot of led lights i've been

611
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:55,599
gifted led lights

612
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:57,678
people offer me led lighting and

613
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,000
sometimes i just go right back to those

614
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,519
hps lights just because they're reliable

615
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
and i love the way that they work in a

616
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:06,558
commercial grow i always prefer double

617
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,919
ended gavita hps lighting for my

618
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,678
flowering rooms that's always what i

619
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,640
prefer now the next part of the question

620
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:15,280
was um distance from

621
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,440
the canopy to be optimal

622
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:20,240
i talked about a vented light a vented

623
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,600
hood if your light is not vented this

624
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,519
answer is going to vary greatly if the

625
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,959
hood is vented and i'm moving a lot of

626
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,440
air through there and getting that heat

627
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,360
from that bulb away from that reflector

628
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,600
i can get those bulbs that reflector

629
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,918
down super close to the plants

630
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,879
depending on the age and size of the

631
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,120
plant i can get somewhere between six

632
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,280
and 24 inches from the canopy that may

633
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,279
sound crazy but you've got a thousand

634
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,359
watt light on a bunch of clones that are

635
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:50,240
eight inches tall drop that [ __ ] down

636
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:52,158
to about 24 18 inches above those and

637
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,759
then as they grow up raise the light

638
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,520
raise the light and the light can't go

639
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:57,279
anymore i just let those plants grow

640
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,960
right up to it by the time they're done

641
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:01,440
they may be six or eight inches from

642
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,120
that light but it is ducted it is vented

643
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,720
so they're not getting any heat stress

644
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,000
they're not getting any problems they're

645
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,600
not getting bleached from the light

646
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,440
because they grew into it i didn't just

647
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:10,959
drop that light right on there i let

648
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,480
them grow up into it they knew what they

649
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,840
were getting into they adjusted they

650
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,480
adapted slowly so it all depends on the

651
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,558
plant size and the plant health and how

652
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,839
hot you're getting that environment if

653
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,079
you can keep it cool if you can move

654
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:25,279
that light get it low get it on there if

655
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,519
you drop that light right on there

656
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,079
you'll notice real stacked tight dense

657
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:32,158
buds real tight inner nodal spacing that

658
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:34,000
close to the light uh learn about the

659
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,080
law of the inverse square the further we

660
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,319
get that light away we definitely start

661
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:40,158
diminishing the value of that light we

662
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,319
get a bigger footprint but we don't get

663
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
the intense uh it's the law of the inver

664
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:45,759
law of inverse square read about that

665
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,679
with lighting you'll learn a lot there i

666
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:49,919
cannot even delve into that honestly

667
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,400
when it comes to lighting uh lighting

668
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,080
definitely is not my specialty i know

669
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,919
about it i can talk about this really

670
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,918
easily but when it comes to spectrums

671
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,480
and numbers and kelvins my brain does

672
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,640
not absorb that info and i don't that's

673
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,880
i'm lighting ignorant to be mostly

674
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,799
honest with you but uh for this thousand

675
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,760
watt reflector i would drop it real low

676
00:23:06,798 --> 00:23:11,759
if you're not using a vented reflector

677
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,440
stay at least 18 inches above those

678
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,440
plants so they're going to get roasted

679
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,679
stay at least 18 inches above or they

680
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,038
will get too hot have a fan going move

681
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,720
that heat around

682
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,480
but i get as close as i can and i start

683
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,720
paying attention do i see the leaves

684
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,079
curling up do they start giving me signs

685
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,600
that they're pissed off if so then i

686
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,599
just raise that light up just a little

687
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:32,000
bit i really like to push things that

688
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:33,839
comes with experience um

689
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,519
you've really got to just do it to learn

690
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:37,279
it i say get in there and experience

691
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:38,798
some [ __ ] if you cook some plants you'll

692
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,119
learn what the cook limit is it's how

693
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,720
you burn a pizza that pizza oven the

694
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,038
[ __ ] box says leave it in for 12

695
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,480
minutes you try for nine you check on it

696
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:47,919
it looks good you check it at 10. it's

697
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,120
cool if you leave it in there for 13 the

698
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,960
things [ __ ] toast you just got to

699
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,839
learn it you got to figure it out

700
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,319
um

701
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,720
as long as ah the thing is cool you can

702
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,720
get it really really low now let me talk

703
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,720
about uh more of what you've got printed

704
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,319
here it says my room is a four and a

705
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,038
half by four and a half room and my

706
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:07,038
ceiling is six and a half feet high

707
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,640
um i would definitely get a ducted

708
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,558
invented hood if you could that would

709
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:13,038
definitely be ideal for that room then

710
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:15,678
it goes on it says i have a 600 and a

711
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,359
400 watt hps system i can use but i'm

712
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:20,400
thinking about buying a thousand watt

713
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:22,240
hps system to fix my stretching problem

714
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,038
do you think the two lights are equal or

715
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,558
lesser than a single 1000

716
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:28,240
that is a really good question i want to

717
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:30,319
touch on something before i go too far

718
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:32,240
your stretch problem let's talk about

719
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,519
other ways that could help with a

720
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,558
stretch

721
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,000
because

722
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,918
the light is a good idea the light is

723
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,159
one great step to mitigate the stretch

724
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,080
but is your temperature and humidity

725
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,360
dial then if it's too hot the plants are

726
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,038
going to start stretching if it's too

727
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:46,879
dry or too wet the plants are going to

728
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:49,119
start stretching

729
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,080
what is your nighttime temperature and

730
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:53,839
humidity like how drastic are your

731
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,599
diurnal swings is your daytime and

732
00:24:53,839 --> 00:24:57,439
nighttime temperature and humidity

733
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:59,759
within 5 or 10 degrees if you can keep

734
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,360
those super close within 5 degrees that

735
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:03,359
will drastically reduce the amount of

736
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:04,798
stretch you get from those plants other

737
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,158
things i've talked about is popping the

738
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,079
knuckles on the plants doing a little

739
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,200
bit of lst a little bit of super

740
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,720
cropping where you grab the plant and

741
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,000
just twist it and give it a little a

742
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,519
little my knuckle popped didn't do it

743
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,519
too loud but give it a little pop sound

744
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,359
there that will slow down the stretch so

745
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,038
those are things that could help if

746
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:21,038
we're going to do it with lighting one

747
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,158
thing i would think about you've got two

748
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:27,038
fixtures here i wonder if that 400 watt

749
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,278
system will run a metal halide hear me

750
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:30,798
out this is what i would do tell me if

751
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:33,038
you think i'm [ __ ] crazy send me an

752
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,879
email grow from your heart hotmail.com

753
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:37,519
if you were going to do this

754
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,320
i would run the 600 watt high pressure

755
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,079
sodium and the 400 watt metal halide

756
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,439
together as close as you can not as

757
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,678
close you get them but fairly close

758
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,880
together in the dead center of that room

759
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:51,600
you got a 4x5 room um that's not very

760
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,840
big a 4x5 square that's not very big

761
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,759
that 400 will get enough light down into

762
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:57,439
there especially with such a low ceiling

763
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,879
and the 600 will get enough light down

764
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,480
in there i'd put those right at the

765
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,480
center of the room

766
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
and run both of them the metal halide

767
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,159
and the high pressure sodium you'll get

768
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,320
a lot of great effects from that the

769
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,320
metal halide the blue spectrum from the

770
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:12,319
metal halide will help you keep that

771
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,079
light or that plant shortened squat

772
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:16,240
here's a quick detail that i have forgot

773
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,839
to talk about this is something i used

774
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,000
to say a long time ago this detail just

775
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,158
came to my mind as i was rambling if you

776
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
guys are experiencing too much stretch

777
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,760
during the beginning of flower another

778
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,880
thing we can do to mitigate that stretch

779
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:30,879
is don't change your bulb until 14 to 21

780
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,200
days into flower after the stretch phase

781
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,520
is over then switch to that red bulb if

782
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,360
you're running metal halides and hbs's

783
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,200
the blue from the metal halide will keep

784
00:26:37,359 --> 00:26:41,359
those plants shorter and squattier and

785
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,440
more stacked once you see that stretch

786
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,319
stop then switch over to your flower

787
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,759
bulb

788
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:48,399
let me get back on track to what i was

789
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,319
saying i would use the 600 and 400 i

790
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,720
would do the 600 watt high pressure

791
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,480
sodium i do a 400 watt metal halide and

792
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,000
i would run them together i would do

793
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:01,038
them on the 11 on a 12 12 cycle and that

794
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,359
honestly i have i had run a crop in a

795
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,599
5x5 tent with they used to make a

796
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:07,918
reflector called the grozilla and it

797
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:10,319
would hold two bulbs and i put just like

798
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,320
this i put a 600 and a 400 in there and

799
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,319
i ran those just like a thousand watt

800
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,759
light and that was some of the uh

801
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:20,158
tastiest most photogenic densest best

802
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,720
most dense anyway some of the best wheat

803
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,200
i ever grew came from that 5x5 with

804
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,519
those two bulbs running side by side in

805
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,679
your situation and in your environment i

806
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,319
do believe that the 400 and the 600

807
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,720
would be better because it's such a

808
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:36,639
small environment that you don't need

809
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,640
the super penetration from the thousand

810
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,159
watt you want the spread from the two

811
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,278
bulbs imagine if you've got one light

812
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,278
source

813
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,359
you get more shadows if you've got two

814
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,759
bulbs you have two light sources and

815
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,599
less shadows and more light spread yeah

816
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,879
one section is getting a bunch of hps

817
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:52,879
one section's getting a bunch of metal

818
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
halide but you'll get more light spread

819
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,559
we're not going super deep because your

820
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,159
ceiling is only six and a half feet tall

821
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,158
you've only got you've got very little

822
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,880
penetration to try to get there i would

823
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:05,120
do the 600 and the 400 honestly that is

824
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,440
what i would do in that situation if you

825
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,439
can make the 400a metal how wide that

826
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,679
would be totally ideal for you and that

827
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,519
halide will definitely reduce the amount

828
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,840
of stretch that may help you with your

829
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:18,558
stretch situation if you can switch both

830
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,798
of those bulbs to metal halides until 21

831
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,720
days into flower then switch the big one

832
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,798
out to the red bulb uh the high pressure

833
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,399
sodium that should make it bang for you

834
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,599
bro that should definitely give you some

835
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:29,599
progress

836
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,439
all right it goes on it says i know you

837
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,678
have an insane amount of inside

838
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,440
information on this specific topic but i

839
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
do understand that you get thousands of

840
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,759
questions per day and may not have time

841
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,600
for this question you guys i do get a

842

00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,038
useful for the show that people could a

846
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,558
lot of people can gain knowledge from i

847
00:28:49,038 --> 00:28:53,119
try to get those on the show as soon as

848
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:55,278
possible don't ever feel discouraged if

849
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,959
i don't answer your questions right away

850
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:00,159

discouraged don't get upset if you've

866
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,240
sent me a question and i have not

867
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,679
answered it maybe i'm compiling your

868
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,599
question for the appropriate episode

869
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,960
maybe two other three two or three other

870
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:35,119
people had a similar question i'm going

871
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,640
to dock them out all at once uh maybe

872
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,558
it's just not time for that question or

873
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,960
maybe it just didn't fit the format of

874
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:42,480
the show and i do apologize i do my best

875
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,840

876
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,038
that that's enough excuse time with

877
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,558
roster jeff

878
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,158
um thank you for sending me the great

879
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:49,599
question my dude j.h i had a good time

880
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,960
rambling about this one i hope people

881
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,079
learn some stuff out there i hope we

882
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,798
help people

883
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,398
mitigate the stretch um also

884
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,759
pay attention when you're buying seeds

885
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,519
that's a very important part a lot of

886
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,879
the breeders at least myself i try to

887
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:03,200
warn you that you're going to get double

888
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,880
or triple the stretch in a pack of seeds

889
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,840
try to read that when you're shopping

890
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,080
and buying stuff that may give you a big

891
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:11,839
advantage um then it says why not led

892
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:13,839
for me which is a great question it says

893
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,678
money and and then it goes on to say in

894
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,319
my research there aren't many options

895
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,440
for led that truly outperform hbs and

896
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,119
anything larger than a 4x4 configuration

897
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,320
there are a couple but they are super

898
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,599
expensive and they run 650 to 800 watts

899
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,519
anyway

900
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,599
um i kind of agree with you it seems

901
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,359
like all the leds are designed for

902
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,639
little tiny spaces

903
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:36,798
and you got to buy a lot of them and

904
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,880
they are super expensive to buy those

905
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,960
lights at the beginning the upfront cost

906
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,640
is expensive of course you save money on

907
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,319
air conditioning electricity bill but

908
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,320
that initial investment

909
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:47,839
does set you back a little bit

910
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,319
uh my opinion

911
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,558
is that if hps lights are working for

912
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:55,119
you metal halides are working for you

913
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:58,000
and you're not you don't find the led

914
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:59,759
that works for you do your thing the

915
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,599
beauty of running your own grow the

916
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,599
beauty of growing cannabis in your own

917
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,000
environment is that it is yours you can

918
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,678
do what makes you happy as long as you

919
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,679
are satisfied with the outcome of your

920
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,120
product nobody should tell you otherwise

921
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,440
as long as you're not hurting anybody

922
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,599
contaminating anything poisoning anybody

923
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,000
or putting anybody in clear and present

924
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,599
danger ah do your thing bro grow the way

925
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,119
that you want to grow from your heart

926
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:22,558
breathe with love and don't let the

927
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,398
haters sway you if somebody's telling

928
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,519
you something that you're doing is wrong

929
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:27,839
and you're happy with the way you're

930
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,079
doing it keep doing it let let yourself

931
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,240
be open to suggestions and have room for

932
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,798
improvement but don't let the internet

933
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,079
haters mess up your game your strategy

934
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:37,440
everybody on the internet wants to say

935
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:38,480
you're doing this wrong you got to do

936
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,759
this but they don't even know what

937
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,519
you're doing they don't know the rest of

938
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,278
your project so don't let them [ __ ] you

939
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,759
up do your thing grow with the lights

940
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,480
that work best for you i found that in

941
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,079
the winter my led lights do not keep my

942
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,839
grow room warm i found that in the

943
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:53,759
summer those led lights are awesome

944
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,359
because i can take down those hbs lights

945
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:56,879
and not have to run half the amount of

946
00:31:55,359 --> 00:31:59,119
air conditioning so it's all about the

947
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,200
environment the space the time most

948
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,199
importantly what works for you people

949
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,080
always ask what is the best

950
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,159
the best is what works the best for you

951
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,519
i think that uh

952
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,120
i don't even have the best because i

953
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,558
have to change things i think that leds

954
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:15,359
are the best in the summer and i think

955
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:16,879
that hbs are the best in the winter you

956
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:18,959
may think something totally different

957
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,120
because your grow room is totally

958
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,679
different do your thing find what works

959
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:25,359
best for you adjust and adapt and i like

960
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,440
that my friend here said he's done a lot

961
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,439
of research um

962
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,880
why not in my research there aren't many

963
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,919
options i love it because not enough

964
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,440
people do enough research out there my

965
