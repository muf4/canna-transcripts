00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,479
ramble too much here at the beginning of

57
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,560
the show

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,440
may already be too late for that let's

59
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,280
talk about saka souffle i like to start

60
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,280
my strain features by talking about the

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,479
parents that only makes sense the

62
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,039
parents of saka souffle are biscotti and

63
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,719
arise it is a female biscotti plant and

64
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,799
then a rise male

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,439
in this episode and every episode when i

66
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,920
talk about my arise mail uh i will say

67
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,759
arise and king solomon uh

68
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,719
interchangeably they will mean the same

69
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,439
thing king solomon is a specially

70
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:41,840
selected arise plan he's just an arise

71
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:43,519
f1 male uh he's my favorite male in my

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,680
lineup he's one of the best male plants

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,000
i've ever used and work with uh worked

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,840
with i have named him king solomon if

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,759
you read about king solomon you may

76
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,920
understand why i chose that name that's

77
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,560
not important but the important part is

78
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,479
knowing that arise and king solomon are

79
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,878
the same thing when i say male arise and

80
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,119
king solomon same dude same guy he's got

81
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,840
two names i call him sully i call him

82
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,759
saul but that's king solomon or just

83
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,158
solomon that's the arise male that's who

84
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,079
i'm talking about and another note when

85
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:14,560
i list genetics

86
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,680
i always list ladies first so when you

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,519
hear me say biscotti to arise or

88
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,560
whatever to whatever

89
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,519
girl scout cookies to grateful dog or

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,920
banana kush to cherry widow

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,680
i'm always listing always listing ladies

92
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,439
first and the one that i say second is

93
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,080
the pollen donor and i'm saying pollen

94
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:38,479
donor at this time because sometimes uh

95
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,159
that is a reversed cross and it is a

96
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:41,919
feminized plant it was a female that

97
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,079
gave us pollen it wasn't truly a male

98
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,238
but it was the paul and donor so i'm

99
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,000
going to say that it always is the paul

100
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,920
and receiver to the pollen donor first

101
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,519
but the easy way to remember that is

102
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:54,000
ladies first so when i'm talking about

103
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,640
crosses when i say right now biscotti to

104
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,400
arise i do mean the biscotti was the

105
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,318
lady in this cross

106
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,560
i said i was going to try to not ramble

107
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,798
already too late for that so the cross

108
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,598
is biscotti to arise let's talk about

109
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,159
the biscotti to the best of my research

110
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,839
there were uh uh different differing

111
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:13,919
results on the internet i saw a couple

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,759
of different things to the best of my

113
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:16,879
research what made the most sense to me

114
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,279
from the

115
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,959
research online the flavors aromas

116
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,359
growth experience with this plant i'm

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,240
going to agree that i believe it is

118
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,439
gelato girl scout cookies and south

119
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,120

enjoy and appreciate that sort of stuff

132
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:55,120
let me get back on track here

133
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:57,439
i really enjoyed the biscotti the

134
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,959
biscotti came from a friend of mine

135
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,199
he grew it from seed he made the

136
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:03,038
selection he found a great cut i really

137
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
liked it he really liked it he gave me a

138
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:06,478
cut

139
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,799
it smelled so good and the flowers when

140
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:11,120
i smoked the flowers it made me super

141
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,199
mellow it gave me that uh we can't say

142
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,879
girl scout cookies anymore but uh from

143
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,280
here out girl scout cookies means our

144
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,279
gsc means girl scout cookies it gave me

145
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,599
that gsc buzz

146
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,839
but it grew so much better than the gsc

147
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,600
and it gave me more of an open buzz gsc

148
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,918
or the cookies i'll call it kind of put

149
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,160
me in a bubble it seemed to shut me down

150
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,918
and put me in my own uh my own zone i

151
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,439
was not very social i wanted to grab a

152
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:37,359
guitar grab a drum uh write something

153
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:39,839
be creative search the internet scroll

154
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:43,038
my phone that's what uh gsc or cookies

155
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,799
kind of did to me the biscotti had that

156
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,879
punch to the face from the cookies but

157
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,319
also kind of made me want to be more

158
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,918
social it made me want to talk and

159
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:51,680
didn't put me in my own

160
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,279
silent bubble so it's better for being

161
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,319
social better for being outdoors and

162
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,758
active and

163
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:57,279
in the public which i often have to be

164
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,560
over here on a podcast imagine just

165
00:05:57,279 --> 00:05:59,519
being in your bubble here that'd be hard

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,959
to do

167
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,799
so i really enjoyed the buzz it didn't

168
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:04,879
shut me down as much and it seems to

169
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,240
grow better than the original cookies

170
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,478
that seems to be crossed with it but it

171
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,800
had a lot of cookies traits it was like

172
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,159
uh just turbo cookies better cookies and

173
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,478
i enjoy that because i really liked the

174
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,280
cookies back in the day

175
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:19,120
so uh that is the biscotti it was uh

176
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,918
gelato girl scout cookies south florida

177
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
og smelled good really dense flowers

178
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,198
kind of made me mellow but not too

179
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,280
mellow similar to cookies

180
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,478
better grower but a more outgoing social

181
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,159
buzz now let's talk about the arise i

182
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,478
said before that when i talk about king

183
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,199
solomon and arise it is the same plant

184
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,360
it is an f1 arise

185
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,199
that was specially selected and he is

186
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,280
named king solomon so let's talk about

187
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,080
that that is a golden goat female

188
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,918
pollinated by a daybreaker male uh that

189
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,639
golden goat's got that

190
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:51,598
tropical sweet kind of flavors it grows

191
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
with

192
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,918
kind of an indica structure but sativa

193
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,520
traits and it's got a very sativa

194
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,598
dominant head buzz it kind of gets to

195
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,159
your brain it makes your head spin and i

196
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:04,159
think that golden goat uh mixes in with

197
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,919
everything that i cross from the arise

198
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,000
that really adds to the potency that is

199
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:09,519
the golden goat doing the potency on the

200
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
other side of that cross we've got the

201
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:14,000
daybreaker

202
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,560
that is chem d and joseph og so you've

203
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,240
got chem and kush flavors and aromas

204
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,000
that plant had big

205
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
wide fat leaves that you could camp

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
under you could live under those leaves

207
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,840
they were so big

208
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,439
uh it had that funky earthy cushy gassy

209
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,679
chemical sort of smell so i brought the

210
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:31,918
golden goat that sweet tropical to that

211
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,400
gassy cushy thing and that gave us a

212
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,879
rise uh all of those plants grow with

213
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,799
what i call hyper vigor and great

214
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,959
potency so when you cross the rise to

215
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,360
anything that hyper vigor and potency

216
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,038
comes along so that's why i breed almost

217
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,199
everything to king solomon you see

218
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,719
everything crossed to solomon i cross a

219
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,879
lot of stuff to eject the ripper mail

220
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,120
and i do a lot of reversals but solomon

221
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,800
is my most used male so that's why i've

222
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,879
selected solomon for this cross that's

223
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,720
why he was bred to the biscotti let's

224
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,400
talk a little bit about how these plants

225
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,840
grow the original plants the parent

226
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,560
plants that will lead us into a little

227
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,598
bit about how the offspring are expected

228
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,759
to grow

229
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,240
uh the biscotti grows fairly quickly and

230
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,919
it got fairly tall in the garden quite

231
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,519
early i would have to pop it twist it

232
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:15,038
bend it over manipulate it some way

233
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,399
because it would take off

234
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,759
but that was a good thing because i like

235
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:19,679
those vigorous

236
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,680
fast growing plants

237
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,680
some of the phenotypes would make long

238
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,639
branches and it would always make

239
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,439
gigantic tops every branch every top on

240
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,120
the plant of the biscotti was just dense

241
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,278
rock hard nuggets with beautiful

242
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,879
colorings it would make pinks i would go

243
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,240
from light greens to pinks and then it

244
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,320
would fade into like burgundies and

245
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,000
stuff like that but the top color would

246
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,599
always just be a big it looked like a

247
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,440
baseball bat no matter how big the plant

248
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
was we were just kicking out baseball

249
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,120
bats out of that one

250
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:49,119
um where was i now

251
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,200
the golden of the arise i mentioned

252
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,759
before the arise it grows with hyper

253
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
vigor super quick grower uh it is super

254
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,039
resistant to mold super resistant to

255
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,879
bugs uh it passes on that super potency

256
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:03,519
trait so that is the arise and the

257
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,958
biscotti why did i make it uh the buds

258
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,120
from the biscotti were great and the

259
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,679
buzz was super nice but

260
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,879
i say that a rise fixes everything there

261
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,120
was really nothing wrong with the

262
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,879
biscotti but if you could have your

263
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,039
favorite thing and make it better just

264
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,879
make it turbocharged everything why not

265
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,679
it's the new world we want everything

266
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:23,200
stronger faster louder right now

267
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,799
maybe we could do that if we pollinated

268
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,959
it with the rise i know that a rise is

269
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,278
the champ so i hit it with my king

270
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,719
solomon pollen king solomon pollen could

271
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:32,320
be a tongue twister if you try to say it

272
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,959
too many times

273
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
so i crossed those and it made a strain

274
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,359
that i call saka souffle now this gets

275
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:40,639
us to uh something that a lot of people

276
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,480
have been asking about and a lot of

277
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,559
people also understand

278
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,000
what the hell does saka souffle mean

279
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,599
where did you come up with this name

280
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,440
what is this

281
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
if you know me at all if you've been

282
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,880
following me on social media for a while

283
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,799

284
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,360
you know me personally you know that i

285
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:59,120

i love stand-up comedy i love comedy

287
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,919
podcasts i love comedy videos i think

288
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,759
that life kind of beats us down all day

289
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:08,000
and all the if you got a life bar like

290
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,759
in a video game uh when the boss yells

291
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,360
at you you get a couple of damage points

292
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,439
and the cops get behind you and make you

293
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,759
nervous your damage bar starts flashing

294
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,320
and getting all weird uh i think that

295
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:20,240
comedy and music a lot of it is comedy a

296
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,399
lot of it is music in two different ways

297
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,000
those refill your damage bar your energy

298
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,919
bar your life bar it makes life better

299
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,278
again it's like kissing the boo-boos you

300
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,519
get told some good jokes and you just

301
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:31,519
feel better it's like uh it's like soup

302
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,959
on a sick day so i really love comedy

303
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,799
i'm rambling about comedy now i could do

304
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:36,479
that all day i'm a huge fan of stand-up

305
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:38,399
comedy the last episode i put out was

306
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,440
about the machine that of course was

307
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,958
named after bert kreischer so this saka

308
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,279
souffle was named

309
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:47,759
kind of after a combination of another

310
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,919
one of my favorite comedians tom segura

311
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,078
also uh larry king so let me tell the

312
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,919
story of how this name came up tom

313
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,919
segura one of my favorite comedians was

314
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,599

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:06,879
segura one of his guilty pleasures and

318
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,439
tom segura innocently answered chocolate

319
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,399
souffle now larry king at the time was

320
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,360
about 132 years old and he squinted and

321
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,159
looked confused and said saka souffle

322
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,399
and it was funny and that is where saka

323
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,480
souffle came from i kind of took that

324
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,399
sound bite and made it a strain name i

325
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
became very popular on your mom's house

326

00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,639
them high and tight what up jeans but uh

331
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,920
if you're into a weird uh if you're

332
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,078
broken like me you would enjoy that

333
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,240
podcast weird great humor check him out

334
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,000
but that is where saka souffle came from

335
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,399
that clip became real popular on their

336
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,919
show i watched that show a lot uh

337
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,078
friends and i would just say soccer

338
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,240
souffle when somebody was uh just doing

339
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,679
something outlandish or if there wasn't

340
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,759
the right thing to say at the right time

341
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:57,439
i just go suck a souffle and it just

342
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,240
fills gaps it was great

343
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,519
so saku souffle became a strain name i

344
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,399
said i wasn't going to ramble too much

345
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,320
on that

346
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,559
i've done that already now let's talk

347
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,360
about growing uh big up to tom segura

348
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,039
also

349
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,000
let's talk about growing some saka

350
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:15,360
souffle most phenotypes of saku souffle

351
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,320
are going to take between 60 and 70 days

352
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,680
to flower the darker black leaf

353
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,000
phenotype finishes in 63 days there will

354
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:26,479
be a phenotype that pops up that is kind

355
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,879
of short and kind of squat and it makes

356
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,800
dark dark leaves very easy

357
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,240
you probably aren't messing it up it'll

358
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,240
look like you're having a problem like

359
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,799
you're struggling in your grow that is a

360
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
trait of this plant that comes from the

361
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,240
we're not allowed to say girl scout

362
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
cookies anymore so now i have to say

363
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
cookies or gsc the girl scout cookies

364
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,680
got mad that somebody made a strain

365
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,958
called girl scout cookies now we have to

366
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,759
say gsc

367
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:52,479
cookies i'll say random things

368
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,759
culturally it's cookies gsc uh well i'll

369
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,680
say those when i'm talking about girl

370
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:57,600
scout cookies just know that but the

371
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,679
girl scout cookies would turn black back

372
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,600
in the day there was a hashtag on social

373
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,599
media social media i'm not sure what i

374
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,959
said the first time there was a hashtag

375
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,959
on social media that said hashtag black

376
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,039
leaf society and that was because a lot

377
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:13,199
of the girl scout cookies

378
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,679
the cookies the cookies crosses plants

379
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,680
we're changing black leaf colors uh in

380
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,479
mid to late flower if you see a

381
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,479
phenotype where the pitials are turning

382
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,200
uh really dark purple really quickly and

383
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,879
the leaves fade to black you're probably

384
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,879
not messing it up that is probably the

385
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,240
plant that is just what these plants do

386
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:36,078
so that black leaf phenotype does finish

387
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,720
at 63 days the lighter colored plants do

388
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,120
take approximately 70 days it kind of

389
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,199
seems like the darker the shorter

390
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,278
finishing and the lighter plants are the

391
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,120
longer finishing so the lighter color it

392
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,078
could be a nutrient thing also but if

393
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,679
you're growing them right and feeding

394
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,278
them properly the lighter colored plants

395
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,599
are going to take a little bit longer

396
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:56,879
with this cross let's talk about the

397
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,920
aromas and flavors i really really enjoy

398
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:02,879
the funky gross aromas and flavors that

399
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:05,599
come from the soccer souffle it starts

400
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,198
off with that peppery cookie dough thing

401
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,959
and i know that sounds weird but imagine

402
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:10,879
if you took one of those store-bought

403
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:13,359
logs of cookie dough and just sprinkled

404
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,360
just a hint of black pepper in it and it

405
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,199
warmed it up it's got a warm cookie

406
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,360
dough with pepper sort of a smell and i

407
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:22,240
really really do enjoy that

408
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,560
it's got pastries uh sugary pastries

409
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,480
maybe some sort of scones or

410
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,078
maybe the bakery aisle at the store or

411
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,920
maybe just a bakery it's got that sort

412
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:34,399
of smell also there are some phenotypes

413
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,958
that present a cough syrup sort of a

414
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,278
smell and also a bubble gum sort of a

415
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:42,078
candy flavored sort of a smell

416
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,320
also there's one that mixes that

417
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:46,799
remember when you were little sometimes

418
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,800
they gave us a pink cough syrup that was

419
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:49,838
almost good almost gross at the same

420
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,759
time

421
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,880
some of the phenotypes reminded me of

422
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,720
that good gross pink cough syrup so

423
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,720
there's a lot of pastry

424
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,079
peppery candy flavored then there's a

425
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,680
bubble gum and then there's a cough

426
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:05,120
syrup funky flavor that does appear um

427
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,399
lots of great aromas and flavors but

428
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,679
those are what the flavors i think you

429
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,519
can expect there are more but i'm gonna

430
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,198
stop there i can confuse you and give

431
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,519
you too many descriptors that's a bad

432
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,399
habit of mine so expect cookie dough

433
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,799
pastries cough syrup and some bubble gum

434
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,519
phenotypes i've noticed that the lighter

435
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:24,319
colors are more prone uh have more

436
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,759
potential for the bubble gum phenotypes

437
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,079
those dark colored plants aren't going

438
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,078
to have the bubble gum in most cases is

439
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,078
what i have noticed now let's talk a

440
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,559
little bit about the growth shape and

441
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:36,958
structure of these plants

442
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,799
these plants are they make really tight

443
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,439
buds and most of the phenotypes make a

444
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,599
big baseball bat type center bud no

445
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,079
matter how you train it trim it top it

446
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,720
that middle bud with the center stock

447
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:51,679
that thing likes to grow a big fat

448
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:54,399
chunky bud you can almost always expect

449
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:56,559
impressive top coals from these plants

450
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,720
some of the phenotypes only grow a top

451
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,559
cola if you're a screen or a sea of

452
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,000
green type grower the kind of grower

453
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,399
that just puts a bunch of plants like

454
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,159
small plants in one table or one tray

455
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,480
packs them in real tight just wants one

456
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,240
tall branch there's a phenotype

457
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
in this line that does do that for you

458
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,959
if you're looking for that one cola i

459
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,198
call it the spear i just makes one big

460
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,958
rock all the way up it is beautiful that

461
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,198
is a good cash crop there's another one

462
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,518
that is more kind of bushy it grows kind

463
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,679
of even and it doesn't get that super

464
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,440
top cola and it grows real even without

465
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,278
topping it it's kind of bushy uh makes

466
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,519
that minora effect and then there's

467
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,360
another one that does the uh it gets

468
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:35,198
kind of bushy but it doesn't it gets

469
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,199
real tall and the branches get real long

470
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:39,359
but it doesn't go out real wide it stays

471
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:41,439
real and real skinny so you got one that

472
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,519
kind of branches out gets bushy doesn't

473
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,199
make a top one that is just tops and

474
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,039
then one that is a top with branches

475
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,120
trying to keep up basically those are

476
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,039
the three dominant phenotypes that i uh

477
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,720
phenotypical categories i'm going to say

478
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:54,159
categories because you're going to see

479
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,560
differences you're going to see outliers

480
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,879
these are f1s it's an f1 cross you're

481
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,599
going to see variation but that one big

482
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,278
spear is a common phenotype that minora

483
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,120
type branchy one is a very common

484
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,119
phenotype and that one that just gets

485
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,438
tall and lanky with a bunch of chasers

486
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,399
that is a very common phenotype that one

487
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,240
that gets tall and has all the chasers

488
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,038
every bud along the side and along the

489
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,199
bottom will rock up and be silver and

490
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,279
shiny and covered in trichomes even the

491
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,919
bottoms on these plants are amazing that

492
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,558
one that's just a tall spear all the way

493
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,400
down usable harvestable product that one

494
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:29,440
that's bushy and spreads out that's a

495
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,360
great plant that's kind of like a

496
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,880
classic plant that'll grow very well and

497
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,519
give you everything you're expecting and

498
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,200
looking for that one may change colors

499
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:38,720
on you a little more quickly the and

500
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,160
it'll get a little bit woody as well if

501
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,679
you got that more branchy spread out

502
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,320
phenotype that's you're going to get

503
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,798
more colors possibly some woodier type

504
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:48,879
responses from the branches let's talk

505
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,759
more about some specifics uh these

506
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,360
plants are kind of slow growers uh they

507
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,759
a lot of my plants are known for hyper

508
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,439
vigor and they grow very quickly in veg

509
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,200
i've noticed that these don't grow as

510
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,480
quickly in veg but the minute you put

511
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,558
them in flour

512
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,519
they make up for all of the lost time

513
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:07,038
they just go shebang kapow they take off

514
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:10,240
these plants have the potential and

515
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:12,798
opportunity to triple in size from when

516
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,480
you put them in flour so if they're uh

517
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:17,759
one foot tall when you put the plant in

518
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,919
flower expect it to get up to three feet

519
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,839
tall by the time it is flowering allow

520
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,919
proper light space allow proper sealing

521
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,439
space these plants have the potential to

522
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,919
triple in size i'm going to say that

523
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,200
again triple three times the size from

524
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,520
when you flower that can get out of

525
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,279
control for some growers so be prepared

526
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,798
for that if you're running a scrog net

527
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,200
if you're bending popping twisting that

528
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,558
will help you out if you've got that

529
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,640
tall stretchy fino that makes the

530
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,558
stretchy branches that bad [ __ ] is

531
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,880
going to triple in size before it is

532
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,960
done so be ready for that uh what else

533
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,840
do we have to mention uh the straight

534
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,079
spear that one big cola the bush the

535
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,678
rocks oh the black leaves if you're

536
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:55,279
getting black leaves i probably said

537
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,840
this already

538
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,079
that is not your fault that is probably

539
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,000
uh just the phenotype from that plant

540
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,678
that even bushier phenotype is great

541
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,919
that thing will put out great product

542
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,559
that smells great it looks beautiful

543
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,919
the node spacing is super tight

544
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,599
it's kind of a it's kind of not the

545
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,360
super easiest plant to grow but the

546
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:15,759
smoke from that one is my favorite the

547
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,199
bushier phenotype is my favorite to

548
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,359
smoke all right now i'm going to talk

549
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,360
about the buzz that i experience when i

550
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,279
smoke saku souffle this is what i got

551
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:24,479
from it i feel like saku souffle is the

552
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,480
kind of herb that you could roll up a

553
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,000
big fat joint and smoke it on the way to

554
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,679
work and when you get to work you clock

555
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,679
in and by the time you clock out you

556
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,840
don't even know you just had a long hard

557
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
day at work it's like just get [ __ ] done

558
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,439
weed but you don't even know it like

559
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,199
you're so in this tunnel vision thing

560
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,400
but you're still like uppity and peppery

561
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,319
so you could deal with customers if you

562
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,919
got a social job i think it would be

563
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:45,759
great work weed if you had to go deal

564
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,120
with people deal with the public if

565
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,038
you're not into the public it would be

566
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,959
good herb if you like to smoke and then

567
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,319
go out in public and go do your stuff

568
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,279
this would be great for that because it

569
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:55,119
gives you that it just gives you a

570
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,798
little bit of a pep but it also gives

571
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,798
you that like um super high kind of

572
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,480
thing sometimes when you get too high

573
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,319
you get too much into your bubble this

574
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,759
one doesn't put you into that little

575
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,038
that little private bubble does it give

576
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,879
you the blinders that they put on the

577
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:08,079
horses some of the herbie breed will

578
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,000
give you the blinders and give you a

579
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,678
panic attack this one doesn't give you

580
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,359
too much of that but it does put you in

581
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,519
the bubble one thing i did notice was

582
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:17,199
every time i smoked it it kind of got me

583
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,599
like above and behind my eyes it felt

584
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,960
like my uh like my hat was too tight it

585
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,558
almost felt like like i was wearing a

586
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,079
headband there's already a strain called

587
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,240
headband but it did feel like i had like

588
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:27,678
my headphones were too tight i kept like

589
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,038
feeling like pressure or something

590
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,600
around my face

591
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:33,359
i noticed it and i enjoyed it so it gets

592
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,119
me in the eyes it puts me in that bubble

593
00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:37,199
but i'm also still functional which is a

594
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:39,038
good thing for me because people like to

595
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,279
talk to me people expect me to be

596
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,599
functional and doing [ __ ] so i can't be

597
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,079
too roasted all the time i've noticed

598
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,079
that those uh the phenotypes they get

599
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,199
the purple pedials the long purple

600
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,359
leaves those are going to give you more

601
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,279
of that that tunnel vision sort of a

602
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,719
sort of a buzz sort of a thing now let's

603
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:56,879
work into that part of the paper where i

604
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
always write tips and tricks i've

605
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,320
already mentioned that this plant is a

606
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,759
slow grower but it does explode in

607
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:05,519
flower i wrote again triple in size some

608
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,599
of the phenotypes of these plants will

609
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:10,079
triple in size be prepared you've been

610
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,439
forewarned uh where do we go from there

611
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:15,119
fat dense nugs even the lowers get dense

612
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,960
and frosty if you don't have your

613
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:18,639
environment dialed in you may want to

614
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,880
pop and twist and bend and top these

615
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,880
plants and create a bunch of smaller bud

616
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,039
sites instead of just one big gigantic

617
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
bud side if you lay it on its side

618
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,960
those smaller buds will grow up and you

619
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,280
don't get one big giant dense bat you

620
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,279
get a row of smaller buds if you tip

621
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:34,879
that big branch on its side it may help

622
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:37,759
you out with mold issues but you're

623
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,679
going to get big buds so be prepared get

624
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,599
your environment dialed in

625
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,200
these plants some of the phenotypes i

626
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,279
mentioned i may have mentioned that the

627
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,080
bushier phenotypes will get a little bit

628
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,599
woody later in their life pop and twist

629
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,759
them early because you don't want them

630
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,839
to explode some of the woody phenotypes

631
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:54,960
will get a little bit crunchy uh they're

632
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:57,599
going to get big they're going to need

633
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:00,159
some sort of support even those

634
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,000
single bud phenotypes they may enjoy

635
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,840
some support it may help you out if you

636
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,159
just put down a screen and put one bud

637
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,079
per screen or just put one stick per bud

638
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,000
that would help you out the tall

639
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:12,158
stretchy one is definitely going to need

640
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,240
some sort of supports the light green

641
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,919
phenotypes are more bendy uh they're

642
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:18,159
easier to work into a trellis into a

643
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,840
canopy they're more pliable once they

644
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,360
start getting a little bit purple they

645
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,639
do get kind of woody they do kind of

646
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,279
snap you'll break off leaves and

647
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,960
branches much more easily so be careful

648
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:28,720
with those purple phenotypes that it's

649
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,558
not a nutrient deficiency that's not a

650
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,519
problem that is just something in the

651
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,720
genetics that does happen pop and twist

652
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:37,119
those gently because you don't want

653
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,519
those to explode top them early let them

654
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,399
branch out to prevent that giant cola at

655
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:42,158
the end

656
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,000
uh purple stems and purple and dark

657
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,960
colors is common i keep saying that but

658
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,038
that is in my notes a lot uh it fades

659
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,798
hard and late blooming looks sad it's

660
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:53,839
okay it just does that it looks like a

661
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,359
phosphorus or a potassium deficiency

662
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,759
it's just done

663
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:59,439
sometimes that purple stock finishes up

664
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,319
it's not a nutrient issue what i wrote

665
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,679
down was sometimes the plant itself

666
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,678
looks like it's done before the

667
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,759
trichomes are ripe just let the plant

668
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,440
keep going the trichomes will ripen up

669
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,359
even if those leaves are black and

670
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,120
turning gold and yellow let it keep

671
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,959
going there will be some very beautiful

672
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,479
photo opportunities

673
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,400
there's not a problem it's just done

674
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,079
that plan is entering what is called

675
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,919
senescence it's like dude i've done my

676
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,240
life i'm only supposed to live a year

677
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,240
i'm only supposed to flower for so long

678
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,400
it had its uh its whole goal was to get

679
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,319
pollinated all of its organs to receive

680
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,159
pollen have now receded and dried up

681
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,319
that plant is done it's in senescence

682
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,600
it's over uh it's waiting for its time

683
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,759
to die it's just waiting for you to cut

684
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,599
it down but until you do those trichomes

685
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,759
will keep ripening so let it keep going

686
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,079
don't cut it down too early let it

687
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,158
finish that trade again does come from

688
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,639
the gsc i'm not sure what trait in the

689
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,480
gsc that what line from that came from

690
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,200
what parent but that is a trait from the

691
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,120
gsc anyone who grew the cookies back in

692
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,038
the day we saw it turn different colors

693
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,798
we got it black we got it purple

694
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,319
environmental factors and pushing it

695
00:23:58,798 --> 00:24:02,158
nutrients would change these plants so

696
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,839
many different colors

697
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,278
eventually just realized that when you

698
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,798
dial it in it will change a lot of cool

699
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,599
colors it's not anything we're doing

700
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:09,839
wrong

701
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:12,079
don't try to over feed it to correct a

702
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,158
nutrient issue uh that's when you mess

703
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,599
it up it'll start doing uh usually it'll

704
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,440
stack up and make a good butt if you

705
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:19,759
over feed it it'll do what i call the

706
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,240
spiral staircase you get the main stalk

707
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,759
and then right up that stem you get

708
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,120
a bud here then a butt here and a butt

709
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:26,879
here and it doesn't fill in like it's

710
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,959
supposed to if you feed it properly

711
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,120
that'll all fill in it'll be one giant

712
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,038
cola that fills up that whole meristem

713
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,759
just be one chunky baseball bat worth of

714
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,879
nuggets where else do i have to go from

715
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,440
there

716
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,159
these plants handle spider mites very

717
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,080
well we had one tester get hit with uh

718
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,159
regular spider mites and these plants

719
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,839
didn't get touched we had another tester

720
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,159
get hit with the worst of all he got the

721
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,839
russets and he said these plants fared

722
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,760
the best in the room i'm not going to

723
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,439
call anybody out for their russets but

724
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,440
good work for recovering from that they

725
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,360
finished the harvest of this plant with

726
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,720
russets and made it to the end that's a

727
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:03,038
big challenge

728
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,759
all right my final notes on this one

729
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:09,519
i've got expect big buds so have airflow

730
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,558
and vpd dialed in possibly water less to

731
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:12,558
reduce

732
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,480
humidity and to prevent issues if you're

733
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:16,798
watering less you're going to have less

734
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,200
water in the room defoliate that will

735
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,720
reduce transpiration these plants don't

736
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,798
make a lot of leaves they're super easy

737
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,798
to trim i pull off a lot of those big

738
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,839
leaves with the long purple pedials

739
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,558
that'll make less air in the room less

740
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:30,959
transpiration you won't have as much

741
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,480
water in the room just because of that

742
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,720
these plants

743
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,200
don't really like cold at all they get

744
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,440
uh purple and they stop growing i had

745
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,038
some plants on a cold floor they just

746
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,120
stopped we had another person report

747
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,200
their room got cold they just stopped

748
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,599
don't get them excuse me

749
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,000
don't get them extremely cold basic

750
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,480
diurnal temperature swings will be okay

751
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
your five seven maybe 10 degree swings

752
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,839
don't get them cold at night they'll

753
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,519
stop growing they'll turn purple the

754
00:25:55,839 --> 00:25:59,199
buds just turn into these black rocks

755
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:02,000
they don't do anything they freeze up on

756
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,919
you don't do that they do not like being

757
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,400
over watered and they especially don't

758
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,000
like cold water no plants really do

759
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,320
enjoy the cold water

760
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,440
they're slightly challenging to grow the

761
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,119
problem is

762
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,360
they're supposed to change colors and do

763
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,038
weird [ __ ] and new growers see those

764
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,798
colors and see the differences that

765
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:21,038
these plants do and they panic and freak

766
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,879
out and try to fix it grow it just like

767
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:24,480
any other plant and it will work just

768
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,559
like any other plan if you don't [ __ ] it

769
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,919
up and freak it out uh it won't [ __ ] up

770
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,000
and freak out it's supposed to change

771
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,600
colors and do weird [ __ ] that's part of

772
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,558
the plan i'm trying to find my pages in

773
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,879
order there we go uh the next thing is

774
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,038
they like low ph and medium nutrients in

775
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,799
flour too much nitrogen will make it do

776
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:43,119
the bud spin i talked about that spiral

777
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,798
staircase a moment ago too much nitrogen

778
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,759
will definitely attribute to the spiral

779
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:49,519
staircase now i did say low ph a lot of

780
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,000
the time i recommend about six two to

781
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:54,319
six four stick around that six one six

782
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,400
two i've seen these plants grow very

783
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:59,038
well in low low ph i've seen them go

784
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,759
five eight and thrive uh you'll make the

785
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,759
dark plants really dark really purple uh

786
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,879
low ph and lots of kelp i think will

787
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:09,038
bring out a lot of stank that yeah stank

788
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,679
no just stink it's stank all right where

789
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:13,679
am i going from there i've got another

790
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,038
i've got one last page i do apologize

791
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,159
for the throat clearing i'm not even

792
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,158
sure that i'm going to edit that out

793
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,360
because i'm on such a good flow

794
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:22,960
the best grows were in soil or soilless

795
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,038
mixes this plant didn't seem to like

796
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,278
hydro as much as the soilless mix is

797
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,440
however the hydro guys did kill it but

798
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,519
the soilless and organic eyes were

799
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,399
crushing it if i were going to grow saku

800
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,480
souffle i would probably grow it uh four

801
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,558
seven gallon pots under a thousand watt

802
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,319
light i would veg it until it reached

803
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:42,079
the scrog net and then i would put it

804
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,158
into flour and for the first two weeks

805
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,158
work it into that scrog net then it'll

806
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,159
take off and keep growing i may put up

807
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,880
another net to support those big buds

808
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,559
but that's probably how i would do it or

809
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,360
i would find that phenotype that shoots

810
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,918
one main cola and i would do in a uh in

811
00:27:55,359 --> 00:27:59,359
a five by five i'd probably do

812
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,919
depending on numbers if you add

813
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:04,798
unlimited numbers probably go with 16 of

814
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,159
those uh in a five by five veg them

815
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:07,759
until they're about a foot and a half

816
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,039
tall then flip them and they'll be ready

817
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:11,278
to go

818
00:28:09,038 --> 00:28:12,480
that's what i would probably do

819
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,599
it looks like there's a lot of space

820
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,679
when they grow because they get a little

821
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,000
bit stretchy but they will fill in if

822
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:19,360
you don't over feed them uh veggies like

823
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,038
cookies is what i wrote down but it

824
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,678
takes off in bloom

825
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,599
where are we oh do the sea of green find

826
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,679
a good phenotype that makes the big cola

827
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,240
and just cram a bunch of them in if

828
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,960
you're the hydro guy that grows on cubes

829
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,038
do the 4x4 table with like 64 cubes and

830
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,120
veg for like a week this plant would

831
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,480
kill it with that

832
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:40,319
i don't know that i would recommend

833
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,919
soccer souffle outdoors for a lot of

834
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,918
people unless you've got a good

835
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,840
environment i said it makes giant buds

836
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,120
those giant buds do put you at risk for

837
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,278
problems outdoors late in the season

838
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,759
this year we saw a lot of people with

839
00:28:51,278 --> 00:28:55,839
bud rot with powdery mildew with extreme

840
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:58,720
damage in the middle of their buds

841
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,319
i fear that this makes such big buds you

842
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,240
would experience those types of problems

843
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:03,439
so unless you can control that i don't

844
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,720
know that i would recommend this

845
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,960
outdoors

846
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,440
these plants do make a very great calyx

847
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,600
to leaf ratio so they are easy to trim

848
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,519
if you hate trimming and you like big

849
00:29:11,599 --> 00:29:14,480
fat harvest these may be the plants for

850
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,278
you

851
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,679
very very nice bag appeal the buds have

852
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:22,398
a silvery purple color that comes from

853
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,399
the cookies some of them get very dark

854
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,678
the others are very bright bright green

855
00:29:24,398 --> 00:29:28,319
so you're going to get very good bag

856
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,519
appeal everything will be super frosty

857
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,839
um

858
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,319
the rosin we made raw i can't say we i

859
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,319
watched i supervised i had my hands on

860
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,000
my hips i was smelling a lot going

861
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,240

862
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,480
friends of mine made rosin and the rosin

863
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,038
that came out of the press looked like

864
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,640
velvet it had it was silver and glittery

865
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:47,839
it looked like a silver sheen with

866
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,320
speckles in it looked like they were

867
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,918
mixing metallic paint uh really

868
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:54,079

869
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,000
