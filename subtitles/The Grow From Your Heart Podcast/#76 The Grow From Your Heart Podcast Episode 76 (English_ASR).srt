hear the podcast or the theme song but

32
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,680

they're able to send comments that I can

34

see on the bottom of the screen uh I'm

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,759

36
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,599

00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,359
into iTunes and Stitcher and then you

49
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,959

97
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,959
buddy Joe who will be on a future

98
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,199
episode of the podcast we've talked

99
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,080
about that uh but we went up to Denver

100
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:27,560
to Comedy Works and we saw Joey Coco

101
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,400
Diaz and that [ __ ] blew the roof

102
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,878
off of Comedy Works that dude ripped it

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,319
up that's one of the best comedy shows

104
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,878
I've seen in quite a while I know I say

105
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,518
that about every comedy show when I come

106
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:40,359
on this show but it was one of the best

107
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,640
shows I've seen in quite a long time it

108
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:46,000
totally kicked ass uh for the first six

109
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:47,559
or seven minutes of the show uh he came

110
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,438
out and he told a joke right and he kept

111
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,598
telling jokes but he told it it was like

112
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,799
he hit me and then I would start

113
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,199
laughing and as soon as I felt like I

114
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000
was going to catch my breath he'd Hit Me

115
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,438
Harder so I'd laugh even harder and lose

116
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,400
my breath and every time I feel like I

117
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,359
was coming around he'd hit me and I was

118
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,640
starting get a pleasant pain in my

119
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,000
cheeks and stomach from laughing so hard

120
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,119
and then I got this weird headache

121
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,039
toward the back of my head from laughing

122
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,480
so [ __ ] hard I was like Joey stop for

123
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:13,759
a minute bro I need a little bit of

124
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:16,120
oxygen because I cannot breathe and I

125
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,560
cannot keep up with this I'm moving the

126
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,680
Periscope camera right now so that they

127
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,079
can see me a little bit better I think

128
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,959
I've got everything I need on the

129
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,600
screen so uh Joey Coco Diaz is

130
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,399
definitely one of my favorite comedians

131
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,439
Joe Rogan says he's the best comedian on

132
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,719
the planet right now I could almost

133
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,879
agree with that if you're into that

134
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,360
style I can listen to Joey talk all day

135
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,519

00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,079
on to the main topic of the show the

192
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,800
main topic of the show you guys is going

193
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,879
to be feno hunting and selecting mother

194
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,319
plants I didn't take a lot of notes

195
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,759
because I feel like I can pull that

196
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,000
episode off without a lot of preparation

197
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,960
I mean I've got all the preparation in

198
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,120
my head I've done this a thousand times

199
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:46,279
so I think I can pull it off but let's

200
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,439
see I got one or two more things I want

201
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:50,079
to talk about where are my notes Here we

202
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:52,839
are uh I want to announce something this

203
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,800

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,120
through Instagram I'm sorry about the

206
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,759

and then the throat goes to [ __ ] uh a

209
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,840
long time ago I was scrolling through

210
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:08,079
Instagram and I came across an Instagram

211
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:10,439
page of a lovely lady called dude it's

212
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,279
damsel and I've been following damsel

213
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:13,800
she's a Suicide Girl she's tattooed up

214

215
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,840
beautiful she's an amazing woman uh I've

216
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,598
been following damsel on Instagram for

217
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:21,719
quite a while and then a good friend of

218
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,560
mine our friend hunt the grimy Gatsby

219
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,360
introduced me to damsel uh and also my

220
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,639
friend Julia I got to give shouts to

221
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,840
Julie what's up Jules miss you Boo uh

222
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,400
she is partly responsible for

223
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,159
introducing me to damsel so I introd I

224
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,318
got introduced to damsel we've talked

225
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,280
we've spoken a few times and I am proud

226
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,400
to announce that I am working on a

227
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:45,959
strain for dude it's damsel The Suicide

228
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:48,758
Girl it will be a strain specifically

229
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:51,758
selected for her and this strain will

230
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:53,960
represent damsel it will be colorful it

231
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,919
will be sexy it will stand out from the

232
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:58,839
crowd it will be something you want to

233
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:01,158
look at it will smell Beautiful it will

234
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:03,918
taste amazing and her idea is that when

235
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:06,639
she smokes it she wants a nice giggly

236
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,719
sativa head high so I'm working on that

237
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,000
strain I've got several the seeds are

238
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,639
ready here's here's where I am the seeds

239
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,720
are ready and I have several crosses

240
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,319
that I think would make damsel happy but

241
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,039
instead of just running one cross I'm

242
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,280
going to run three or four crosses that

243
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,680
I've made and we're going to see if one

244
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,198
of those gives us a phenotype that

245
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,720
damsel completely

246
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,479
loves so that is a great segue to get

247
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,440
into the main meat of this podcast the

248
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:37,479
main topic of this podcast is feno

249
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
hunting and selecting a mother plant for

250
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,680
the future we're definitely going to

251
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,560
focus on feno Hunting because I've

252
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:47,000

for

271
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,920
um giving me the honor to grow a strain

272
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,159

linking damsel and I up together to get

276
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,679
this project started I'm sure this is

277
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,440
going to work out great for everybody

278
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:42,719
once this project is completed and damel

279
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:44,640
has picked her favorite phenotypes or

280
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,200
phenotype uh The Strain should be

281
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,759
available for purchase in flower form at

282
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:52,000
Green and healthy cannabis in Colorado

283
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,439
Springs and also the spot dispensary in

284
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,759
PUO West Colorado so that'll be a long

285
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,760
time coming but once it's available uh

286
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,919
we will let you guys know so to get that

287
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,240
far I am going to have to do a pheno

288
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,240
hunt which is actually the main topic of

289
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
this

290
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,360
show now it feels like a good place to

291
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,120
start would be to define the word

292
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,240
phenotype so I'm headed over to Google

293
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,959
and Wikipedia says a phenotype is the

294
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,519
set of observable characteristics of an

295
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:22,000
individual resulting from the

296
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,440
interaction of its genotype with the

297
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,278
environment so kind of what that says is

298
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,640
if we have a bunch of seeds and we grow

299
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:29,399
them out and they are all the same

300
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:31,000
genotype which means they came from the

301
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,399
same parents they're the same batch of

302
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,360
seeds uh if we grow those out we will

303
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,799
see what is called phenotypical

304
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,639
Expressions which means some of those

305
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:41,719
plants are going to show characteristics

306
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,919
of its mother some are going to show

307
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,839
characteristics of its father some are

308
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,679
going to show characteristics of

309
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,160
grandparents that we didn't even see in

310
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:52,799
the parent plants and then some of them

311
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,919
are going to show perfect traits of

312
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,199
50/50 combinations of each and then

313
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:58,519
you're going to see variations in

314
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,920
between depending on which final

315
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,078
generation you're working with so one

316
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,759
way to kind of put that is uh if you

317
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:06,919
have a brother or a sister you probably

318
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:10,278
don't look exactly alike because you're

319
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:14,399
from the same parents but you are

320
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:15,838
different phenotypes basically uh maybe

321
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,278
maybe your brother is a little taller

322
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,200
than you or a little fatter than you or

323
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,919
something that's just phen phenotypical

324
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,879
expression of the same genotype

325
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,799
basically so when we're working with

326
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,799
plants when we're looking for phenotypes

327
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,759
the purpose of a pheno hunt is to find

328
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:32,039
the plant that you want from that 10

329
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,000
pack of seeds now you have a couple of

330
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,599
uh decisions to make do you want um do

331
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,480
you want the plant that represents the

332
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,480
one that's on the picture of the package

333
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,959
of seeds the one that you read about do

334
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
you want the one that grows a little bit

335
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,000
shorter for your grow room do you want

336
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:46,159
the one that's a little more indicia

337
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,240
dominant the one that's a little more

338
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,719
sativa dominant that's something to

339
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,039
think about when you were starting a

340
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,839
pheno hunt the purpose of the pheno Hunt

341
00:11:52,039 --> 00:11:56,838
is to run through see I would recommend

342
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,040
at least 10 seeds as a breeder I do

343
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:02,120
anywhere from 25 to 100 seeds of the

344
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:04,919
same same strain so the ideal thing is

345
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,679
to run as many of these seed seedlings

346
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:09,120
as you can underneath the same

347
00:12:06,679 --> 00:12:11,278
conditions to find the one that you want

348
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,440
that is the Stellar keeper out of all of

349
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,198
the plants that you're working with a

350
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,199
lot of times I see people purchase a

351
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:20,399
package of seeds and they will run two

352
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:23,039
of those seeds and then they'll say hey

353
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,958
look I've got sour diesel or hey look

354
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,480
I've got Super Lemon Haze and you might

355
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:30,278
have a decent Super Lemon Haze but you

356
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,519
don't have that super phenotype because

357
00:12:30,278 --> 00:12:33,320
you haven't gone through and done the

358
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,320
work you haven't pheno hunted out the

359
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,959
one that is Stellar that is worth

360
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,240
keeping that's going to blow everybody

361
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,638
else's mind so a pheno hunt is where

362
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,919
you're going to find a lot of good [ __ ]

363
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:44,680
and you could have gotten that Stellar

364
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,399
keeper out of just a couple but I mean

365
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:47,838
if you do a large feno hunt the chances

366
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,958
of finding what you want and that

367
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,560
Stellar keeper just even better all

368
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:54,319
right so let's talk about a couple of

369
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,559
really popular phenotypes while we're on

370
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,639
this subject before we get into me

371
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,239
explaining how I do my pheno typical

372
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,799
pheno hunt

373
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,198
um I'm sure you guys have heard me talk

374
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:06,159
about jell Bean there is a really

375
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:07,879
popular phenotype of jell Bean known as

376
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:09,679
the candy store phenotype and there's

377
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:10,639
also another phenotype known as the

378
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:13,719
orange

379
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,039
phenotype um the the candy store

380
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,360
phenotype smells like uh when you walk

381
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,838
into the candy store in the mall it's

382
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,519
got that sweet uh it's like those candy

383
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,440
hearts you buy at Hall or at Valentine's

384
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
Day it all smells real sugary and sweet

385
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,880
and it makes you like want to eat candy

386
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,078
that's what the candy store phenotype

387
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,159
smells like that's of course why it's

388
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,278
called candy store the orange phenotype

389
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,958
smells like a basket of [ __ ] oranges

390
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,120
it's so delicious and those are known

391
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:37,278
phenotypes so when you hear people

392
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,078
talking about yeah I got the orange

393
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,278
phenotype I got the Jil pheno that's

394
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:44,159
what they're talking about uh I breed a

395
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:46,278
strain called Heart of Gold and there is

396
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,399
the chunky girl phenotype which just

397
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:50,879
grows big fat phenos and then there's

398
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,679
the mean girl which looks a little uh

399
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,838
she's real Jagged and the way that her

400
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:56,359
buds grow are real spiky and pointy so I

401
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:58,519
call her the mean girl just cuz she

402
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,399
looks angry when she grows it's a really

403
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,120
great plant but it looks like ferocious

404
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,919
it's like an intimidating plant for some

405
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,600
reason and then there's also the uh the

406
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:07,838
other feno which is the non-desirable

407
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,560
feno it's the one that's more Golden

408
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,160
Goat leaning I don't keep that feno when

409
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:13,399
I grow Heart of Gold I'll toss that one

410
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:15,838
out right away when I identify it but

411
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:17,399
that's more of an advanced thing uh so

412
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,279
when you hear us talking about like I've

413
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,679
got the whatever feno that's what we're

414
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:23,720
saying that we grew out a pack of seeds

415
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,559
and we found the feno that was known uh

416
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,639
that's been talked about a lot or that

417
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,399
the breeder told you to look for like I

418
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:32,440
know that there are fenos of black

419
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,159
cherry Chim that I tell guys my friends

420
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm like if you see that I wouldn't even

421
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,240
keep that one I would just get rid of

422
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,278
that right away I'm like if you see this

423
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,039
that's kind of the one you want to keep

424
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:41,958
so if you're growing black cherry Kim

425
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:44,360
the one that shows dark dark purple

426
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,838
right away like a plum purple right away

427
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,120
I don't think that's a keeper uh it

428
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:51,000
grows little tiny popcorn balls of

429
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:52,399
bright dark dark purple buds and I don't

430
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,839
find that to be a keeper so as a fenal

431
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,159
Hunter I know to throw that away and I

432
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
only know that because I've grown it out

433
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:58,639
so many times I feel like I'm drifting a

434
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,799
little bit away from the topic but it's

435
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,639
all useful information here all right I

436
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:05,359
should probably get into explaining a

437
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,720
little bit how I do a pheno hunt or how

438
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,519
I would recommend you doing a feno hunt

439
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,800
as a kind of a new grower without a lot

440
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,759
of space and a lot of money to spend on

441
00:15:11,799 --> 00:15:16,838
seeds um so the way to do it I would get

442
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,480
a 10 pack of seeds or a 12pack if you

443
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:20,320
can get it some some folks are selling

444
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,240
TW get about 10 seeds if you can 10's

445
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,959
enough you know if you want to run a

446
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:25,839
feno hunt for yourself 10 is enough

447
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:28,318
seeds I would get seeds from a reputable

448
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,759
company from a reputable vendor um I

449
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:34,759
would recommend stuff like gagee green

450
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:36,399
genetics llat Labs iy genetics of course

451
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,919
uh Sin City Seeds has shown me some

452
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,799
great [ __ ] lately the sour seed company

453
00:15:38,919 --> 00:15:42,360
has a great uh lineup and a lot of great

454
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,078
things to offer there are a lot of great

455
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,278
uh DNA genetics is somebody who I would

456
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,599
recommend rare dankness uh somebody who

457
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:50,278
I would recommend uh Crockett Family

458
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,319
Farms there are a lot of seed breeders

459
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:53,720
out there you guys try to do some

460
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,399
research get a reputable brand uh give

461
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,879
yourself a chance get some good seeds

462
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:00,039
and give yourself a chance so get a good

463
00:15:57,879 --> 00:16:01,919
10 pack of seeds feminized or regulars

464
00:16:00,039 --> 00:16:04,639
that's up to you so what we're going to

465
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:06,958
do we are going to germinate all 10

466
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,759
seeds and we are going to treat them all

467
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,439
the same we are going to do everything

468
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,959
exactly the same to all 10 of these

469
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,600
seeds for almost all of their lives

470
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:18,359
until kind of midflower if we see that

471
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,480
they need more uh water or more nitrogen

472
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:22,600
or more something in late flour we'll

473
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,278
make a note of that and then we will

474
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,360
keep that in mind when we select our

475
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:28,360
Keepers in the future so we're going to

476
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,560
germinate 10 seeds we're going to get

477
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,839
we're going to pay attention to them

478
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,758
from day one because you just want to

479
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,959
keep notes if you've got a seed that's a

480
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,639
straggler uh make a note of one that's a

481
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:40,318
straggler if you can label your seeds

482
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,120
somehow like seed one seed 2 seed three

483
00:16:40,318 --> 00:16:44,000
make a note of that so germinate these

484
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,679
seeds get them into cups grow them take

485
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,958
some pictures if you can about once a

486
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:49,919
week if you can then what we want to do

487
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:51,599
is pay attention to them really closely

488
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,120
veg them out a little bit then you want

489
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,720
to take a clone of them as soon as

490
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,919
they're big enough to take clones so now

491
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,319
you've got these little plants that are

492
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,360
probably in like one to three gallon

493
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:02,719
pots and you've probably taken a couple

494
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,798
of clones off of them hopefully right so

495
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,759
now you've got a decision to make do you

496
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,599
want to flower out the original seed

497
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,959
that you started or do you want to keep

498
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:12,599
that seedling as a mother plant or do

499
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,679
you want to keep one of the Clones as a

500
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:17,279
mother and flower out that plant that's

501
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,480
already large uh it's kind of a toss-up

502
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,000
it depends on how much space you have

503
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,078
and what you want to do what I have

504
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,880
learned is I like that seated uh the

505
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:28,119
seedling mother to stay as my mom for

506
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,919
some reason it has more Vigor it seems

507
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,599
to be a good idea to keep that one as

508
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,679
your mother that's just my opinion um a

509
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,240
lot of people say that that one's

510
00:17:34,679 --> 00:17:39,120
already grown and already big why not

511
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,720
flower it out lately uh from watching

512
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,399
clones grow and watching seed plants

513
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,079
grow I prefer to have my mother plant

514
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,200
come from seed that's something I have

515
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,879
learned um I may be hypocritical because

516
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,400
sometimes time doesn't always allow that

517
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,320
sometimes I need the space in the room

518
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,120
to bloom so I Bloom out the large Plant

519
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,558
that's already going but from now on I

520
00:17:55,119 --> 00:18:01,038
will try to keep that seed plant as my

521
00:17:57,558 --> 00:18:02,158
original mother so um you got these

522
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,359
plants they're big enough to take a

523
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,520
clone off of you take a couple clones

524
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,038
and then you decide which one you want

525
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:09,279
to flower so if you're going to flower

526
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,798
that original mom you put all 10 of

527
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,879
those Original Seed moms into a

528
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,879
flowering room and you treat them all

529
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
the exact same and you flower all of

530
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,760
them if you choose to do clones all you

531
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,919
have to do is get the Clones into pots

532
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:21,558
get them rooted and everything get them

533
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,120
healthy and then put those into the

534
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:25,759
flowering room that'll catch everything

535
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:27,319
right up we're on the same lesson now so

536
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,839
now you're in flour now is when you

537
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:31,519
really have to start paying attention

538
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,879
taking good notes uh if you've got males

539
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:35,240
you'll find out about day 10 uh get

540
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,799
those out of there unless you plan on

541
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,359
breeding because those males are going

542
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:40,639
to start dropping pollen uh it'll start

543
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,079
causing you problems get the males out

544
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,440
of there about day 10 we talk about that

545
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,319
a lot if you're pheno hunting for males

546
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,279
that'll be a whole another episode you

547
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,240
guys you're I'm not even ready to do

548
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:51,440
that I'll write it down but I'm not sure

549
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,359
that that's going to happen for a long

550
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,720
time uh pheno hunting

551
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:57,319
males that's going to be neat that's a

552
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,759
really Advanced lesson that'll be way up

553
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:01,200
there in like the way past episode

554
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:03,079
episod 100 but we'll talk about it maybe

555
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,279
so pull out the males now you want to

556
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:06,639
take a lot of notes because around week

557
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,359
three week four is when you're going to

558
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,880
start seeing a lot of different

559
00:19:08,359 --> 00:19:12,439
[ __ ] um if something Herms you're

560
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,600
probably going to see that around

561
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,320
between five and eight get rid of all of

562
00:19:14,599 --> 00:19:19,038
those you don't want to keep the

563
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,119
hermaphrodites so um if you got a 10

564
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:22,319
pack you're probably going to get

565
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:23,678
somewhere between four and six boys out

566
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:25,200
of there right if you've got regular

567
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,200
seeds so you pull those out now you got

568
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,558
like five more to deal with if you've

569
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,558
got fem seeds and probably you lost one

570
00:19:29,558 --> 00:19:33,200
during germ you only got nine so now you

571
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:35,558
probably got four or five plants to work

572
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,798
with maybe six uh if you're working with

573
00:19:35,558 --> 00:19:39,200
fems you may still have 10 of them a

574
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:40,480
couple of them are going to be runty a

575
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,080
couple of them be squatty or whatever

576
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,599
it's okay to pull those squatty plants

577
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,279
if they're shitty uh if it's healthy and

578
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,879
not looking like a run and a problem

579
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,839
keep it because when you run LA

580
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,679
Confidential the shitty looking plant is

581
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,558
the one you want to keep honestly it's

582
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,919
the it's not the runt it's not crappy

583
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,158
looking it's the small slow growing one

584
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,200
if your plant looks like a run you can

585
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:00,799
go ahead and get rid of it so you want

586
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,880
to watch them grow some are going to do

587
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:04,879
stupid [ __ ] uh pay attention to what you

588
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,480
like the ones that fall over a lot if

589
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,240
the one if one attracts bugs or one

590
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,919
attracts mold that's not the keeper uh

591
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,519
watch for naners like I said around week

592
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,600
five or eight if you get a hermaphrodite

593
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:17,000
get rid of that one so take a lot of

594
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:18,279
pictures uh smell them pay a lot of

595
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,119
attention to how they grow then you're

596
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:21,440
going to have to harvest all 10 of these

597
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:23,439
plants or however many made it to the

598
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,038
end I said four to six right so Harvest

599
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,919
all four to six of these trim them down

600
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,720
uh cure them properly listen to episode

601
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:34,960
number 35 about drying and curing uh dry

602
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,798
and cure your medicine properly once all

603
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,519
of your finished plants are dried and

604
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:40,279
cured it's time to do a few smoke

605
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:42,720
samples on every phenotype that you've

606
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:45,279
grown now if you're growing it for just

607
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,798
you you can smoke it and you can decide

608
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:48,279
which one you like for yourself but if

609
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,798
you're going to be selling it or giving

610
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:51,720
it to medical patients or sharing it

611
00:20:49,798 --> 00:20:53,400
with your friends it's a good idea to

612
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,720
pass out a few buds of each one and I

613
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,679
don't tell anybody which is which I just

614
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
label it A or B and I'm like tell me

615
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,960
which one you like better and tell tell

616
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,400
me why and then I send it off to a

617
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
couple of my patients my buddy Doug

618
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,280
what's up Doug I hope you're listening

619
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,120
uh every time I grow new plants I don't

620
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:09,480
label them and I I remember what they

621
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:11,079
are I'll give them initials or a code

622
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,440
word or something and I'll take it to

623
00:21:11,079 --> 00:21:13,678
Doug and I'll be like smoke these tell

624
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,519
me which ones we need to keep and which

625
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,320
ones we should get rid of and since I'm

626
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:20,000
his medical provider his opinion is a

627
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,639
big influence on what I keep and then

628
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,038
also White Mike that's on the podcast

629
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,919
milky tricomes uh Nemo Punk 15 he does a

630
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,278
lot of helping with my selection also if

631
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,880
you're the grower

632
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,798
uh it's a lot up to you 50% of it is up

633
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,720
to the grow if it grows like [ __ ] if it

634
00:21:33,798 --> 00:21:38,519
grows 12et tall in 8 weeks and you're in

635
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,480
doors and you're under an 8ft ceiling

636
00:21:38,519 --> 00:21:42,759
that's not the phenotype for you you

637
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,079
know if it grows 32 feet wide in 6 weeks

638
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:46,519
and you're in a small room that's not

639
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,359
the phenotype for you if it grows super

640
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,000
completely lanky and falls over and

641
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:52,719
needs a thousand staks and you're trying

642
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,880
to get one bud kind of scrog system that

643
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,480
might not be the one for you so look for

644
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,320
the one that grows the way that you want

645
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,319
it to grow hopefully that out to be the

646
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:03,879
one that smokes well also and typically

647
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,480
this is what I found as a a grower

648
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,400
growing a 10 pack you're going to end up

649
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,519
with one that is [ __ ] beautiful

650
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,159
you're going to end up with one that is

651
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:12,119
covered in resin and has a lot of

652
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,360
tricomes and then you'll probably have

653
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:15,719
one that tastes really really good and

654
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,439
you'll have one that harvests really

655
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,679
really heavy but if you can find one

656
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,720
that does all of those then you're

657
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,038
golden that's the one that you want but

658
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,360
if you can get two or three of those if

659
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,558
you can get the good high and the good

660
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,519
flavor that's awesome I would sacrifice

661
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:29,918
that for weight if you're a cash Cropper

662
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,599
maybe you want to sacrifice the good

663
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,720
flavor for the weight you know just

664
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:34,798
think about what you want if you can

665
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,519
find a strain that does it all for you

666
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,319
find that get clones of it and grow it

667
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:40,960
forever but a good fenal hunt you have

668
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:42,158
to take clones because if you don't take

669
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,679
clones of everything you grow you're

670
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,278
going to end up having the best weed on

671
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,320
the planet one time and not have a clone

672
00:22:45,278 --> 00:22:49,159
of it and be so pissed off at

673
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,119
yourself all right guys that's the

674
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:53,200
basics of a pheno hunt basically keep in

675
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,239
mind that uh not all seeds are going to

676
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,319
yield the exact same plants you might

677
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,558
not get the plants that you saw in the

678
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,399
package you might not get the plants

679
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,639
that were

680
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:04,038
advertised uh but your goal is actually

681
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,919
to find the one that you love and keep

682
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:07,038
that one around and turn it into a

683
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,278
mother plant we're going to talk about

684
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:09,679
that in a second but once you've got

685
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:11,359
that one keeper you know what you can do

686
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,640
next you got to do another feno hunt of

687
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,839
10 more seeds and find another keeper

688
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,640
and if it's better than the other one

689
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:18,079
that you've got then toss out that other

690
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,000
one or do it until your mother room is

691
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:21,519
full just keep hunting for keeper plants

692
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,240
and more keeper plants until you've got

693
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,918
the most Stellar [ __ ] lineup of

694
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,720
plants all right so let's talk about

695
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:29,240
keeping a mother plant now you've grown

696
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,519
this pheno hunt you have found the plant

697
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,000
that you like you've got the one that

698
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:33,400
has the flavor you like it gives you the

699
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,038
high you like it grows well for your

700
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,679
room now you've got you either took a

701
00:23:36,038 --> 00:23:39,440
clone of it or you've got that remaining

702
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,159
seed plant that you're going to use as a

703
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,640
mother so the trick to keeping that

704
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,120
plant as your mother plant is to keep it

705
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,200
under a vegetative light I like to use a

706
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:51,399
195 cycle for my mother plants uh 19 on

707
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,960
19 hours on 5 hours off because I feel

708
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:55,640
like this gives my plants uh plenty of

709
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,079
light to keep them from uh trying to

710
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:01,278
autoflow some more tropical strains will

711
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:04,240
try to autoflow if you let them go a

712
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:05,960
little less light so the 195 5 hours to

713
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,120
give them a little bit of sleep cycle

714
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,679
and let my equipment rest uh every

715
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,278
living thing likes to sleep so I like to

716
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,840
give my mother plants a little bit of

717
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,839
sleep time so you keep your mother plant

718
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:19,038
on a vegetative cycle a vegetative light

719
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:20,678
cycle to keep it alive indefinitely and

720
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:23,240
you like I would like to feed it some

721
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:24,440
sort of like uh just a basic uh veg

722
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,440
nutrient whatever you're feeding your

723
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,120
veg plants you can feed your mother

724
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:30,200
plants that just basic nitrogen keep the

725
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:31,719
roots happy uh if you want to keep them

726
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,759
for a long time you're going to have to

727
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,200
repot your mothers they will get root

728
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:39,319
bound so what I do uh my mother plants

729
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,640
only last me about eight months to a

730
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:43,439
year I'll cut new mother plants I'll cut

731
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,120
a clone I'll cut six or eight clones for

732
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,640
my mother plant right and I will run

733
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,319
four or five of those but I'll keep one

734
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,480
of them behind uh it'll go into a cup

735
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:52,519
it'll go into a pot and then I'll just

736
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,000
put it into that mother room and replace

737
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:55,519
the old mother plant because they start

738
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,720
to get ran out they start to get kind of

739
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:59,278
lazy and [ __ ] you you take a bunch of

740
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
cuts from it take clones from it it's

741
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,440
been sprayed for bugs it's been

742
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,960
manipulated under these lights for 8

743
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,880
months it starts to get kind of kind of

744
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,079
lazy so I feel like it's a good idea to

745
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,039
take a fresh cut from my mother plant

746
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:12,798
keep it under that 18 [ __ ] or that

747
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:14,839
195 light indefinitely and then just

748
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:16,359
keep it alive and then if you prune it

749
00:25:14,839 --> 00:25:18,119
if you keep it free of bugs if you keep

750
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:19,759
it healthy that mother plant will stick

751
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:21,759
around and give you lots and lots of

752
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,158
clones and keep that strain alive

753
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:27,640
forever so I think that wraps up uh

754
00:25:25,159 --> 00:25:29,679
pheno hunting selecting a keeper and

755
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:31,600
using that keeper as a mother all within

756
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,000
we got that down here in 25 minutes and

757
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:34,879
30 seconds so I think that's going to

758
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,960
work for you guys I really appreciate

759
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,919
you listening to the podcast I recorded

760
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,640
this in two sessions on a on a new app

761
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,080
called Periscope I do plan on possibly

762
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,360
doing a podcast through Periscope I will

763
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,918
record as normal I will also record on

764
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,678
Periscope if you're participating on

765
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,799
Periscope you will be able to ask me

766
00:25:50,679 --> 00:25:54,278
questions live on the show and I will

767
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:55,759
answer them for you you'll only be able

768
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:57,480
to type in the text box but I'll be able

769
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:58,798
to read them answer the questions I'll

770
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,640
be able to help out the listeners live

771
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,359
on the show it'll be a little bit more

772
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,200
interactive uh we're going to try it out

773
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,398
once and see how it goes I will try to

774
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,519
announce when it's going to happen so

775
00:26:05,398 --> 00:26:08,918
that people can participate and then we

776
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:10,679
can get people on and then we'll try to

777
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:12,080
do regularly scheduled shows like that

778
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:14,278
every four or five episodes will be a

779
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,240
question episode a live Q&amp;A is what I'm

780
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:17,440
aiming for so guys I really appreciate
