61
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,078
monday

62
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,680

63
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:40,000
years worth of podcasting i've never

64
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,399
missed

65
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,438
a monday this monday the show was

66
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:45,200

67
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,279

68
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,960
barely monday in the mountain time zone

69
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,960
when it came out there was a technical

70
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,839
difficulty with my website where the

71
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,438
uh podcast is posted i had to contact a

72
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,960
couple of people to try to help me

73
00:01:55,438 --> 00:01:59,758
i was left with a couple of baffled

74
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,879
faces eventually i contacted the web

75
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,399
hosting service

76
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,399
and they were able to get me fixed up it

77
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,920
took a couple of hours on the phone

78
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
some head scratching some click and some

79
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,520
punching away we got it solved so

80
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,360

81
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,640

89
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,560

91
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,878

cheers to 2021 so

146
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,360
in a previous episode i mentioned that i

147
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
think i smell in colors

148
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,400
and i've been told that that's an

149
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:03,560
official thing it looks like i've been

150
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,640
diagnosed with

151
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:07,759
synesthesia i'm not crazy my mother had

152
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:10,318

153
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:11,039
um big thank you for the great uh update

of the

155
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:14,878
diagnosis i guess we can say i'm gonna

156
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,560
read more about that and now i don't

157
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:18,319
feel like i am as crazy

158
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,000
trust me i still feel crazy but that's

159
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,478
one more thing we don't have to worry

160
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
about

161
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:23,758

162
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,478

163
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,000
episode

164
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:27,918

165
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,560
very valuable episode for a lot of

166

168
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,520

it's ahead to check out your podcast

191
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,880
thank you for all of the knowledge

192
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,800
and for keeping it simple for us stoners

193
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:17,038
i like to explain things in a way that

194
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,478
everybody can understand some people

195
00:05:17,038 --> 00:05:20,560
learn from this angle some learn from

196
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,240
this angle i make sure to deliver

197
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
my teachings from a lot of angles i did

198
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,160
not like school i loved learning but i

199
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,759
didn't enjoy school

200
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,520
that may sound redundant but i'm not

201
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,120
good at sitting in a classroom

202
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,279
looking at a chalkboard or now it's a

203
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,879
dry erase board i guess and listening to

204
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,638
some boring ass person

205
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:39,120
drone on for eight hours a day that was

206
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:41,280
not for me i understand that learning

207
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,720
uh can be totally boring for some people

208
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:43,599
and i try to keep it entertaining i try

209
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,360
to keep it fun

210
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,120
try to tell a couple of jokes in there

211
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,000
so i'm glad you find it uh that i'm

212
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,560
keeping it simple

213
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,759
for the stoners i try to keep everybody

214
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
involved if you're a new grower if

215
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,919
you're an advanced girl if you're a pro

216
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,519
grower that's

217
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,038
always been my slogan i try to have

218
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,038
something for you

219
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:00,318
it says i have a question about silver

220
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:02,240
thiosulfate

221
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,759
if you recommend a certain brand also

222
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,439
when to spray

223
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
and how often to spray and how you

224
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,560
dilute your spray i know you said

225
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,159
different strains will require different

226
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,319
solutions and intervals

227
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,400
i just want a good starting point or a

228
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,080
reference to go off of thanks again big

229
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,279
respect and of course this comes from

230
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,719
our buddy joe

231
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:20,719
joe thank you for the great question

232
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,080
there is a lot to talk about here

233
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,400
what joe is asking about is uh a silver

234
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,519
thiosulfate solution which would be used

235
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,918
to reverse

236
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:30,879
a plant that reversed plant would then

237
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,318
create pollen

238
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,000
and that pollen would then create

239
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,919
feminized seeds i have talked

240
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,839
in great detail about feminized seeds on

241
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,680
other episodes i'll include a link to

242
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,719
the other feminized seed episode in the

243
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,560
show notes

244
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,240
but basically what we're going to do is

245
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,839
take a female plant

246
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,918
and we're going to treat it with this

247
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,399
solution that will cause this plant to

248
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:52,318
create pollen sacs which only contain

249
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,478
female chromosomes because it's a true

250
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,039
female plant we have tested that solid

251
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,959
uh it's a female it will make uh pollen

252
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:01,360
with female chromosomes we put that on

253
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,000
another female plant the seeds that come

254
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,720
from there are

255
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,918
all females the way that we do that is

256
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,440
with a silver

257
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,639
thiosulfate solution now our friend joe

258
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,399
asked what brand

259
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,000
do i use there are a lot of reversal

260
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,758
products out there on the market there

261
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
are a lot of companies making pre-mixed

262
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,400
silver thiosulfate solutions

263
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,160
there are a lot of options i make my own

264
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:25,359
i buy silver nitrate

265
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,400
what do i buy i wrote it down because i

266
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,720
want to make sure i get it right i

267
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,879
bought silver nitrate and i buy sodium

268
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,560
thiosulfate in separate containers they

269
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,199
are dry powdered forms

270
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,598
and i make my own silver thiosulfate

271
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,080
solution

272
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:42,000
this will work on ninety percent of the

273
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,680
plants you are trying to reverse

274
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
most of the products on the market are

275
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,079
overpriced and unnecessary when you can

276
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,038
make your own silver thiosulfate

277
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,478
for about 13 for probably a hundred

278
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,000
gallons you don't need to make that much

279
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:56,240
at a time you only need about

280
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,839
a half a gallon at a time is probably

281
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,280
the most i've ever needed

282
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,719
so you don't need to make a lot at a

283
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:02,478
time and you don't need a lot of product

284
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,080
to make it you don't need a lot of money

285
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:05,839
if you do have plants that are a little

286
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:06,159
bit stubborn there is one product out

287
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,239
there

288
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,680
that i'm not going to say is overpriced

289
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,120
if you've got some stubborn plants that

290
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,280
won't reverse

291
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,519
that one reversal spray may be worth the

292
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,519
money but otherwise i would say

293
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:18,478
make your own silver thiosulfate i'm

294
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:19,359
going to teach you guys how to be

295
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,598
self-sufficient

296
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,800
i want you self-sufficient and always so

297
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:23,360
you're going to get some gold from me

298
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,038
today

299
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,280
today we're going to talk about making

300
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,478
our own silver thiosulfate solution i'm

301
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,279
going to clear my throat really quickly

302
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,718
and then we will move forward

303
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,000
all right excuse me i felt it was better

304
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,879
to get that out of the way instead of

305
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,320
just keep doing it

306
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,719
all right here we go we're going to make

307
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
our own silver thiosulfate solution to

308
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,278
reverse our plants the first thing we

309
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,359
need is

310
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,480
distilled water i highly recommend

311
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,399
distilled water

312
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
distilled water is easy to get it's very

313
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,278
affordable it's probably two bucks for a

314
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,639
gallon

315
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,159
you can probably get it at the gas

316
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:53,600
station or the grocery store right down

317
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,519
the street from wherever you are so we

318
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,000
start off with distilled water

319
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,799
then like i said before we need silver

320
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,679
nitrate

321
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,719
we also need sodium thiosulfate these

322
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,278
products are both

323
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
readily available on the internet a very

324
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,080
short google

325
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,600
search will find these products for you

326
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,800
don't spend too much they are very

327
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,278
affordable products

328
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:14,319
the most expensive part will probably be

329
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,600
shipping

330
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,680
they're going to ask you all kinds of

331
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,519
questions some of the websites ask more

332
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:20,479
questions some websites don't ask any

333
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,240
questions

334
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,560
this these products could be used for

335
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,480
photography there is a wide range of

336
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,759
uses for these products if they ask a

337
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,120
lot of questions maybe you don't use

338
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:30,958
that website find the website that

339
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,720
doesn't ask you what you're using it for

340
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,559
find a website that i don't know where

341
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,920
you are find a website in your country

342
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:37,199
so you don't have to ship these products

343
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,399
over the border so that you get them

344
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,080
more quickly

345
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,000
um something i'm going to jump in this

346
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,680
is not in my notes but i feel like i do

347
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,639
need to say this anytime i talk about

348
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,120
mixing or

349
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,000
touching dangerous products wear the

350
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,919
appropriate

equipment

354
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,079
these products are caustic you don't

355
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,519
want to breathe in silver nitrate or

356
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,839
sodium thiosulfate

357
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,720
it's very fine particles if you're new

358
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,399
at this please

359
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,079
protect yourself if you're experienced

360
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,200
at this please protect yourself wear a

361
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,838
respirator

362
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,200
maybe even some goggles wear some gloves

363
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,640
please protect yourself i know you're

364
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
going to say that's extreme

365
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,759
but i'm teaching you how to do something

366
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,959
i need to teach you how to protect

367
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,480
yourself please

368
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,919
protect yourself when making these

369
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,440
products so you're going to get

370
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,838
distilled water you will need

371
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
silver nitrate you will need sodium

372
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,640
thiosulfate

373
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,679
you'll need a couple of containers i

374
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,399
prefer glass containers glass vessels

375
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,439
we're going to put 500 milliliters in

376
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,278
one container

377
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
of water of distilled water in one

378
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:37,360
container and 500 milliliters of

379
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,800
distilled water in another container

380
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,240
then we're going to pour those two

381
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,719
containers of water

382
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,399
into one vessel of water so we need two

383
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,079
containers that will hold 500

384
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,480
milliliters each and we need another

385
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,479
vessel which will hold at least one

386
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,159
liter of water a thousand milliliters is

387
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,039
going to going to go into this next

388
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,278
container

389
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:57,120
so the way that we do it the way that i

390
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:59,600
do it is i will take

391
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,639
one half of a gram of silver nitrate

392
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,680
i'll repeat that

393
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,480
one half a gram 0.5 of a gram of silver

394
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,479
nitrate

395
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,560
and i will drop that into 500

396
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,240
milliliters of distilled water

397
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,319
and stir it until it is completely

398
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,440
dissolved it shouldn't take too long

399
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,839
then i will take a separate jar

400
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,160
or container of distilled water this is

401
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,880
jar number two or jar b

402
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,639
500 milliliters of distilled water to

403
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,879
that jar i will add

404
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,799
two and a half grams of sodium

405
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,000
thiosulfate powder

406
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:34,639
2.5 grams of sodium thiosulfate

407
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
to the 500 milliliters of distilled

408
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:37,360
water

409
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,440
now i've got my jar a and my jar b i've

410
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,440
got my my silver nitrate my sodium

411
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
thiosulfate jars that are separate

412
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,880
we've stirred them both up i use a

413
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,159
butter knife to stir them honestly

414
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,838
because it's metal nothing's going to

415
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,759
stick to it it's non-porous

416
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,519
i use i use the butter knife i pull it

417
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:52,879
out i clean it stir the other one with

418
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,240
the butter knife

419
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:57,439
that's what i use honestly then like i

420
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,360
mentioned a moment ago

421
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,480
we will take those two bottles those two

422
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,320
jars of solution

423
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,759
and pour them into the one container in

424
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,000
most cases you would mix

425
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,600
uh one into the other i honestly since

426
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,799
my containers are full at this time i've

427
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,399
got a bigger vessel here

428
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,078
i pour them both into there kind of at

429
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,519
the same time and stir them with the

430
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,078
butter knife after they're poured into

431
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,120
there

432
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:20,559
now you have got a silver thiosulfate

433
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,480
solution that is a 100 ratio do not

434
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,559
spray that 100

435
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,879
concentrate onto the plants we need to

436
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:28,000
dilute that solution let's jump into

437
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:31,120
that part now

438
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
we've got our one uh a liter of silver

439
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,759
thiosulfate solution in our large vessel

440
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,679
this is when i get a spray bottle just a

441
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,439
basic spray bottle i get them from uline

442
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:40,958
you can get them from the dollar store

443
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,639
uh what's that other place harbor

444
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:44,319
freight's got them all the time just a

445
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,320
basic spray bottle you'd put a window

446
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,160
cleaner in it and spray the window

447
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,600
spray the window and wipe it down that's

448
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,480
the exact type of spray bottle i'm

449
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,320
talking about

450
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,680
maybe something depending on how many

451
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,639
plants you're spraying you may want

452
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,879
something bigger

453
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,720
the small squirt pump spray bottle works

454
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:01,759
just fine for what i'm doing

455
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,800
so then i will take uh this is where it

456
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,600
comes into

457
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,479
uh adjusting for the plant i will start

458
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,159
with a

459
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,720
one to nine dilution i will use one part

460
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,799
silver thiosulfate and nine parts

461
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,920
distilled water so i'm diluting it one

462
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,919
to nine

463
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,000
one part of the silver thiosulfate

464
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,159
solution nine parts distilled

465
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,440
water so if my spray bottle will hold a

466
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:26,000
thousand milliliters

467
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,839
i put 100 milliliters of silver

468
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,159
thiosulfate solution in there

469
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,120
then i top it off with 900 milliliters

470
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,039
of clean water

471
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,480
uh the distilled water then i shake the

472
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,679
[ __ ] out of it to make sure i've got a

473
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,278
nice mix in there

474
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,359
and i've got a thousand milliliters and

475
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,639
a spray bottle this is when we start

476
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,320
treating the plants

477
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,079
see how easy it was to make the silver's

478
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,199
thiosulfate solution that's why i don't

479
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:47,198
want you guys paying

480
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,120
so much money for these products you get

481
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:50,719
500 milliliters of something

482
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,000
and you got to spray it way often you

483
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,278
don't have enough of the solution it's

484
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,159
not going to work and it was way

485
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:55,600
overpriced

486
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:57,600
don't buy into those products like i

487
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
said there's one product that is worth

488
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,360
it

489
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,199
if you're having a hard time reversing

490
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,079
plants but otherwise don't spend that

491
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:03,759
expensive money

492
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,519
because most of the time silver

493
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:06,958
thiosulfate will do it and it's very

494
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,959
affordable you'll be amazed

495
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,799
at how affordable this project will be

496
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:12,799
it's like 13 bucks and you can make

497
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,319
gallons and gallons of this stuff so

498
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,958
we've used a half a gram of silver

499
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,240
nitrate

500
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,638
two and a half grams of sodium

501
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,159
thiosulfate that's in our liter of water

502
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,039
it's all mixed up together

503
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,480
we've mixed uh we've diluted that into

504
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,000
our spray bottle we've got 100

505
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,639
milliliters of sts

506
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,198
900 milliliters of uh the distilled

507
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,680
water

508
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,198
in a spray bottle now it is time to

509
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,719
start spraying the plant

510
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:36,319
uh let me jump back into the message and

511
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,839
make sure i'm getting all the things you

512
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,519
asked for a certain brand

513
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,680
okay when to spray is the next part of

514
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,759
the question here when to spray

515
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,198
is a very important part of this

516
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,639
equation

517
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,399
i spray about a week before i put the

518
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,919
flat the plant into flour

519
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,839
so if i'm going to put the plant into

520
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,039
flour on the seventh i will spray it on

521
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
the first

522
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:59,198
today i'm recording on a wednesday if i

523
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,759
wanted to flip my plants on wednesday

524
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,519
i would spray them on wednesday so pull

525
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,000
that plant that you plan on flipping

526
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,600
out of the room don't do it in the room

527
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,198
with the rest of the plants don't think

528
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,959
you can control the spray don't be a

529
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,198
dumb ass don't be a smart ass

530
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,599
take the plant out of the room spray it

531
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,919
with the silver thiosulfate solution

532
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,600
spray it to run off i like to spray it

533
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,759
till it's really running off

534
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,639
also don't just spray the leaves with

535
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,879
the solution

536
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,278
spray the stem spray the stalks get the

537
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,639
entire plant with the silver thiosulfate

538
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,600
we want to get as much of the silver

539
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,759
into the plant

540
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,839
the sodium thiosulfate is a carrier

541
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,320
agent the silver actually gets into the

542
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,240
plant

543
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,000
and causes the reaction which i spoke

544
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,079
about in the feminized seed episode not

545
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,559
going to go too far into that right now

546
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,838
so pull that plant out spray it when it

547
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:45,599
is completely dry

548
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,600
you can put it back in the grow room

549
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,839
then you wait a week then we put all of

550
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,440
the plants into flower

551
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,639
maybe not all of them that is another

552
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,759
issue that you've got to think about

553
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,440
it's going to take

554
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,440
somewhere between 25 and 35 days

555
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,279
for this plant to produce pollen we want

556
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,800
the female plants closer

557
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,320
to day 23 to 30 ish when they get pollen

558
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,159
so time that out you may want to put

559
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
this boy into flower a little bit

560
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:10,958
earlier

561
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,399
get him head started or this girl that

562
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,159
is going to be a boy

563
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,759
that's a reversed female is technically

564
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,759
what it is we may want to get

565
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,519
him her into flower a little bit more

566
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,959
early than the other females

567
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,399
let's get back on track with the plant

568
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,958
we are spraying we're going to spray a

569
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,679
plant

570
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:28,479
spray on a week before flower day then

571
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:32,239
move it to the flower room on flower day

572
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:34,000
spray it again the first day of flower

573
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
so whatever day you flip the lights

574
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,919
spray that plant again that days pull

575
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,759
it out of the room spray it to run off

576
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:42,799
then we're going to spray that plant

577
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,480
every three days so on day one

578
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,479
day four day seven ten thirteen and so

579
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,199
on every three days you wanna spray that

580
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,399
plant

581
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,039
i sprayed the plants approximately seven

582
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,799
to nine

583
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:58,078
times including that first initial spray

584
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,278
something's clicking when i move and i

585
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:00,638
apologize if you can hear it in the

586
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:01,360
recording i think it's my headphone

587
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,120
cable

588
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,798
uh it's driving me nuts i'm hoping it's

589
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,880
not driving you crazy so we're going to

590
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,639
spray the plants seven to nine times

591
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,160
some plants that take longer to flower

592
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,160
some plants that are more stubborn will

593
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
get 10 or 11 sprays

594
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,519
this comes with learning the plant this

595
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,360
comes with learning

596
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,119
the dilution of the solution and the

597
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,639
frequency of how often to spray that

598
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,838
plant

599
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,919
i wish that this 90 percent diluted uh

600
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,198
solution would work on every plant with

601
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,880
seven sprays

602
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,798
but we're working with cannabis plants

603
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,000
we're working with living things they

604
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,798
are picky

605
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,240
some plants you can spray them with a

606
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,839
really strong solution

607
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,839
a couple of times and they'll reverse

608
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,678
very well some of them you have to spray

609
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,519
them a lot of times with a very diluted

610
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,360
solution and they'll reverse better

611
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,558
the only way to learn this is by doing

612
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,639
it to the plants

613
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,639
if you have a plant that you have chosen

614
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,679
to be your pollen donor that you're

615
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,759
going to reverse

616
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,440
i recommend taking several clones of

617
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,919
that plant and treating it with

618
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,200
different dilutions of the solution

619
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,720
treat it with a 90

620
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
treat it with an eighty percent treat it

621
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,400
with the or the eight to one

622
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,840
or a nine to one and then an eight to

623
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,679
two and a seven to three

624
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,199
just start increasing the potency of

625
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,360
your mix

626
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,480
or start increasing the frequency of

627
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,199
your sprays

628
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,038
then see how the plants react you will

629
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,480
see in the end which plant makes

630
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,079
the most pollen that's kind of what

631
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,200
we're looking for which plant makes the

632
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,798
most pollen

633
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,960
the only way to really tell if this

634
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,839
project was successful is to grow out

635
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,319
the seeds

636
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,678
which you produce so let me recap just

637
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,599
to make sure i got everything

638
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,038
because i'm going kind of quickly um

639
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,038
we're going to spray

640
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,079
about a week before flip then we're

641
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:38,798
going to spray again

642
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,000
on day one and then every three days so

643
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:44,079
day one day four

644
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,880
seven ten continue until about day 22

645
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,720
ish

646
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
sometimes if the plant doesn't look like

647
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,519
it is reversed or if it's not doing what

648
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,599
i want it to do

649
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,798
i will continue the spraying i'll

650
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,038
continue to spray it

651
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,639
maybe nine to 11 times just depending on

652
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:57,200
the plant some of the longer flowering

653
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,559
plants

654
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
some of the more stubborn plants will

655
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,200
get more sprays out of me

656
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,798
uh if you over spray the plants will not

657
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,720
produce pollen they'll simply make

658
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:08,240
pollen sacks that open up and nothing

659
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,000
comes out they fizzle out and the plants

660
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,359
kind of dry up and look like [ __ ] you

661
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,798
won't get any pollen

662
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:14,479
sometimes you'll spray them and

663
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,839
immediately the leaves

664
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,759
will just crinkle up and look like

665
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,119
complete [ __ ] by the time you put it

666
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,000
back in the grow room those leaves are

667
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:21,599
turning brown

668
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,279
you've over sprayed the plant doesn't

669
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,879
want that heavy of a dilution

670
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,558
so then you've got to lighten it up and

671
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,679
you've got to spray more frequently

672
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,599
and then you've got to pay attention to

673
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,038
those leaves sometimes the plants don't

674
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,798
react at all you spray it and you go i

675
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,879
wonder if that's even doing anything

676
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,079
and then about 21 24 days in you start

677
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,000
going oh look it's starting to make

678
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,000
balls it's starting to make male plants

679
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,839
sometimes it takes even longer so it's

680
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,440
all about the plant it's learning that

681
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:45,439
female plant that you are trying to

682
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,600
reverse we are really doing a lot to

683
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,120
this plant we are changing the hormones

684
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,639
of this plant to make it do something it

685
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,479
was never intended to do

686
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,840
so be patient with it and you've got to

687
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,079
adjust to the plan i say this

688
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,159
all the time the plants are the boss i

689
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,399
wish i had an sop that i could say

690
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,880
spray it at 90 percent at one o'clock on

691
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,320
friday do it again at 2 30 on thursday

692
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,320
and then feed it a cookie and everything

693
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,678
will go magically but again these are

694
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,678
plants this is science

695
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,519
uh this is biology this is horticulture

696
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,480
and nature there are a lot of variables

697
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,720
to work with here

698
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,319
a lot of it depends on the female plant

699
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,759
like the breeding of the female plant

700
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:19,599
what are the genetics in there

701
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,038
if the plant can reverse too easily

702
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,639
maybe you don't want to work with it so

703
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:23,359
make sure you've got a solid tested

704
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,960
female

705
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,038
a very important part is that you use

706
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,038
solid tested genetics don't use any

707
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:31,359
hermaphrodites or you're going to make

708
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,720
more plants with more intersex traits

709
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,119
and that's just going to mess up

710
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,400
everybody's grow nobody wants that so

711
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,879
select good plants

712
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,840
test your progeny and if you can't get a

713
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,600
plant to reverse

714
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:43,678
that's when it's time to start thinking

715
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,000
about that more expensive

716
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,919
reversal spray you guys i feel like i

717
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,759
went super quickly over that but i feel

718
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,880
like i covered all of the things we need

719
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,359
to cover

720
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,120
make the solution and start spraying

721
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,839
don't get the solution on the other

722
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:58,639
plants

723
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,519
also sometimes the silver thiosulfate

724
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,919
solution

725
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,918
will leave a purple stain behind so if

726
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,520
you're spraying against a wall

727
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,280
maybe you don't want that wall to turn

728
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,038
purple maybe put something down put some

729
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:11,519
newspaper behind it or something

730
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,038
but spray until that plant runs off then

731
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:14,558
put it back in the room once it's dry

732
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,919
don't get the other plants wet

733
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,359
i think i covered it all you guys i

734
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,038
don't want to ramble and go back over

735
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,879
anything unnecessarily because i feel

736
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:23,038
like i repeat myself a lot

737
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,559
uh that's so that everybody can learn i

738
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:25,839
do want to thank my friend joe let's

739
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:27,119
read the email one more time and make

740
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,038
sure we covered everything

741
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,319
uh how do you spray how do you dilute it

742
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,240
different strains take different

743
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,599
solutions and different intervals

744
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,359
i think i covered that you're gonna have

745
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,959
to experiment with the plant so i

746
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:37,359
recommend taking clones of the same

747
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
plant

748
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,959
and just treating them all differently

749
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,720
and take a lot of notes when you do that

750
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,079
otherwise you don't know what you did

751
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,000
you don't have anything to reference

752
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,158
later to see what worked for you

753
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,480
all right that is my lesson on making

754
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,600
your own silver thiosulfate solution to

755
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,200
reverse your plants

756
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:55,038
i hope you learned something if you
