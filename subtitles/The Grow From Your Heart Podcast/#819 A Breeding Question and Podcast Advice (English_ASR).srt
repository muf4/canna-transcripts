00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,000
it says hello I love your stuff

92

00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,639
that is a great way to start a message

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,319
thank you for the compliments hello good

95
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,359
to meet you my friend the question

96
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:47,199
continues it says I have a question

97
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:49,080
about root biology of a cannabis plant I

98
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:51,158
am currently on my first grow in week

99
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,360
four of veg and I was struggling for a

100
00:03:51,158 --> 00:03:55,598
while uh the first grow in a struggle is

101
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,760
not a surprise that's okay don't feel

102
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,280
discouraged it does say I was trying to

103
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,399
use House and Garden sample kit to feed

104
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,479
my plants but it seems I was over or

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,760
underfeeding these plants were looking

106
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:09,119
terrible yes um learning to use a

107
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:11,438
nutrient line can be a struggle uh I I

108
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,759
will repeat myself don't get discouraged

109
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,000
let's just keep going and work through

110
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:16,279
it we will figure out the balance all

111
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,358
right there is more to this message it

112
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,439
goes on it says I have now decided to go

113
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:23,519
into an organic nutrition system from

114
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:25,918
this point forward uh as I am impatient

115
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,758
the question now is is there anything

116
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,758
you would warrant against this as the

117
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,038
roots are bringing synthetic which are

118
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,680
not really doing anything and then

119
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:35,159
switching to an organic nutrient line so

120
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,240
the question here is this listener has

121
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,680
been growing with bottled nutrients and

122
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,759
they are not enjoying that they're not

123
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,680
having a positive experience instead of

124
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:44,840
quitting altogether which is admirable

125
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,600
they want to switch to an organic

126
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,239
nutrient system which I'm proud of you

127
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,520
for that uh you've learned something's

128
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,840
not working let's try something

129
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,279
different maybe you'll find enjoyment

130
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:55,079
and success through that the question is

131
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,399
am I going to shock the plants and shock

132
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,038
The Roots by switching from this

133
00:04:56,399 --> 00:05:01,198
synthetic nutrient regimen to an organic

134
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:03,560
nutrient system the quick and short

135
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,280
answer is no as long as you don't overdo

136
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:07,319
something and completely overfeed

137
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,038
something in this organic system the

138
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,360
plants probably uh will enjoy the change

139
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:12,959
they will say oh you've been feeding us

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,319
that bottled stuff that we weren't happy

141
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,319
with you couldn't get the mix figured

142
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:18,519
out here's some organic stuff let's just

143
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,120
settle in take a nice meal and they may

144
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:22,159
adjust very quickly and really

145
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,360
appreciate your switch now like I said

146
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,759
as long as you're not burning these

147
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,038
plants they should adjust smoothly as

148
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,680
long as you're covering all of your

149
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:31,318
basic needs the 16 basic elements for G

150
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,079
plants to grow healthily uh they're

151
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,720
getting solid NPK they're getting their

152
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,800
boosters all the things that you could

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,199
put in there as long as they're getting

154
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,560
the basic feed and the basic nutrition I

155
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,520
think your plants will enjoy the organic

156
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,759
switch uh with the bottled nutrients

157
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:46,639
those bottled nutrients are buffered and

158
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,439
they are being basically force-fed to

159
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,280
the plant there's no way for the plant

160
00:05:48,439 --> 00:05:52,240
to say I do want or I don't want this

161
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:53,918
nutrient that is coming in the way the

162
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,800
uh the nutrients are formulated they're

163
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,918
being force-fed to your plants basically

164
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,439
at all times when using the organic

165
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,120
feeds there are systems within the plant

166
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,800
plants biology that say oh I need a

167
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,000
little bit of this or hey I need a

168
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,160
little bit of that there are uh signals

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,079
and uh markers and identifiers that tell

170
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,280
the plant what to uptake and what not to

171
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,758
uptake so it can kind of adjust itself a

172
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,519
little more uh a lot more actually when

173
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,038
it's using the organic nutrients

174
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,478
compared to those buffer nutrients when

175
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:21,560
it's just being forced to them so you

176
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:23,199
may find great success with this switch

177
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,680

222
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:54,000

uh people have to be subscribed to me to

231
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,639

passion do what you love uh don't do it

242
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,759

00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:38,200
that I wanted to teach and express my my

244
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:40,158
thoughts in some sort of a way that

245
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,879
people beyond my Social Circle would

246
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,759
hear that I didn't know that's what I

247
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,039
wanted as a kid but that was what I was

248
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:47,600
uh I was saying I wanted to be a

249
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:50,719
podcaster before podcasting existed and

250
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,399
I love growing ganja I love teaching a

251
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,639

280
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,159
started off uh with a stumbly uh

281
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:54,039
half-ass podcast and I had to edit a lot

282
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:55,879
and fix a lot of things I was very

283
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,399
uncomfortable uh don't worry about that

284

do the podcast be you now sometimes I'll

285
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,600
pick my nose a little little bit on the

286
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,159
show I'll scratch my eyee on the show I

287
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,120
say what I say huh I check my notes a

288
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,919
couple of times and I do the show that I

289
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,200
feel like is uh a quality show also I

290
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,360
let you see that I am not perfect I'm

291
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,680
not a robot I'm a dude I'm a person I'm

292
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,278
a guy I'm a person out here putting

293
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,719
together a show that is going to make

294
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:20,838
some mistakes I'm going to stutter I'm

295
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,519
going to stumble uh try to do a good

296
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:23,959
show do the best show that you can but

297
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,480
don't be too much of a critic on

298
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,399
yourself is what I think I'm trying to

299
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,839
say you're going to stumble you're going

300
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:30,958
to stutter you're going to have to edit

301
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:32,360
some [ __ ] out but also leave some of

302
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:34,439
that in and show the world that you're a

303
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:36,120
human being I'm a person I think the

304
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,360
audience you guys whoever's watching and

305
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,039
listening would prefer to see that uh

306
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,480
once in a while I get a booger uh

307
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,958
occasionally I sneeze on a [ __ ]

308
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,560
podcast they like to know that you're

309
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,759
humanid it helps the people connect with

310
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,958
you us them it it breaks down that

311
00:10:46,759 --> 00:10:51,120
barrier a little bit better uh and this

312
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,239
isn't the news this isn't CBS This isn't

313
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,159
HBO we don't have to be perfect as long

314
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,039
as it's passionate and accurate that's

315
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:59,799
the most important part so um put out

316
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,799
quality don't be too critical on

317
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:03,799
yourself and then here's one big part

318
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:05,519
don't be afraid to get started the

319
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:07,199
hardest part I said hardest see I'm not

320
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,159
even going to edit that out uh the

321
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,839
hardest part of podcasting is getting

322
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:14,199
started I've done 817 shows 800 I said

323
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,000
18 that might not even be the right

324
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,720
number see I'm making mistakes and we're

325
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,559
just flowing this is real podcasting uh

326
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,920
sometimes for me the hardest part is

327
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,679
just pressing record and pressing record

328
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,599
and then shaking it off and going hey

329
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:28,359
welcome to the show but as soon as my

330
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,519
arms are in the air and I go welcome to

331
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,800
the podcast Everybody by then I'm in it

332
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,879
I'm in the zone it's ready to rock so

333
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,439
don't be afraid to get started don't be

334
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,958
afraid to get started just because it's

335
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,399
not perfect it's never going to get

336
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:42,518
perfect until you get started so make

337
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,679
some mistakes get comfortable put out

338
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:47,120
those terrible episodes let us watch

339
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,078
your progression let us be proud of you

340
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,000
um I love it it's embarrassing but I

341
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,000
love it when people say hey bro I found

342
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,120
your podcast I listen to episodes one

343
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,639
through now I'm like oh man they saw

344
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,399
that old stuff where I sucked at

345
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,759
podcasting but also there's some back

346
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:02,559
there the podcasting was different

347
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:04,480
there's some gold in the older episodes

348
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,759
I encourage you to go back and listen to

349
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,560
my older catalog there's some good [ __ ]

350
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,278
even though I said um and I said uh and

351
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:12,919
people interrupted me and we talk over

352
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:14,759
each other [ __ ] constantly in the old

353
00:12:12,919 --> 00:12:17,240
episodes there's some quality in there

354
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:19,240
and it shows the growth and growth is

355
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,440
important in humans we're all going to

356
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,680
grow go see the growth in your podcast

357
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,000
go see the growth in your Growing

358
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:27,159
Experience watch the growth in yourself

359
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,480
uh don't be embarrassed by that so I've

360
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:30,240
rambled on a lot I didn't know I had

361
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,680
that much about starting a podcast I

362
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,000
said I didn't have good advice and here

363
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,439
I am giving you some [ __ ] gold uh

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,159
don't be afraid to get started just

365
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,399
press record start talking um as long as

366
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,879
it's not live at the time we can edit

367
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,480
that we can go back to the editing room

368
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,720
and we can cut out all that silly [ __ ]

369
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,839
you weren't comfortable with and we can

370
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,920
make a good show out of it um don't be

371
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,680
too critical though Le I just said um

372
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,599
and paused for a long ass time as I

373
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,078
swallowed don't worry about that [ __ ] be

374
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,240
natural do a podcast and then uh put out

375
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:58,838
something you're passionate about I

376
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,159
don't care if your show is about this

377
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:01,440
says everything green or green

378
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:03,519
everything it's about plants but if your

379
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,880
show is about bacon if it's about roller

380
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,120
skates if it's about kombucha do it with

381
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:09,198
passion and you will have great success

382
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,639
all right I feel like I answered the

383
00:13:09,198 --> 00:13:12,439
first part of your question more than

384
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,440
thoroughly let's jump into the second it

385
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,959
said the second part is a breeding

386
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:18,240
question two of my favorite things to

387
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:20,239
talk about podcasting and breeding so

388
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,399
here we go it says do you really think

389
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,600
breeding with a female that is pushed to

390
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,720
show intersect traits by letting her go

391
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,199
late in flower is a bad idea I get that

392
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:32,360
that increases the odds of having

393
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:35,000
hermaphrodite daughters but what is what

394
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,639
is the increase if that at all the

395
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,519
mother only hermaphrodite it shows

396
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
interex traits because it was late in

397
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,078
flower so why would The Offspring have a

398
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,000
higher rate okay now I understand where

399
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:48,399
you're going with this and I get it this

400
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,000
is like saying um this person is super

401
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:53,198
cool but sometimes around 11: p.m. they

402
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,198
stab me like you've got a lot of better

403
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,519
options how good is this plant that you

404
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,198
want to breed with it that it shows

405
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:59,799
intersect Straits like there are better

406
00:13:58,198 --> 00:14:02,240
options that's the first thing my brain

407
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:04,439
says like why you could just have a

408
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,079
better plant would be my first instinct

409
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,920
but sounds like you really want to breed

410
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,278
with it so let's think about it it shows

411
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,039
intersects late in flower um are those n

412
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,240
are those is that really showing like

413
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,719
intersect flowers or is it just putting

414
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,198
out one or two sterile nanners uh that

415
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:21,480
would make a big difference to me now

416
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:23,758
here's where it makes a big difference

417
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:25,639
in our approach you are probably

418
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,278
breeding I'm assuming I'm guessing this

419
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,159
is what I've got to work with you're

420
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,759
most likely breeding for yourself you

421
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,600
want some seeds so that you can grow

422
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:35,159
them go for it because you're the one

423
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,399
that has to deal with the outcome of

424
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:39,600
this cross not deal but rep what you sew

425
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,320
exactly with this cross you're the one

426
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,920
putting your uh interex Gene in the

427
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
breeding mix you're the one that knows

428
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,679
it's there you're the one that knows to

429
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,278
look out for it you know it's there

430
00:14:46,679 --> 00:14:51,799
you're aware that's the most important

431
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:53,759
part I breed for uh not just for myself

432
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:56,198
but I breed to sell seeds I am a seed

433
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,278
seller uh I sell a lot of seeds I don't

434
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,519
want to put anything out there with the

435
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:02,639
opport o Unity for intersex plants for

436
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,560
my customers I don't want you guys to

437
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,278
have to not just look for males but also

438
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,198
keep your head up for intersex plants

439
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:09,600
that's not what I'm trying to do I've

440
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,639
got a different level of standard

441
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,000
because my seeds are going a different

442
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,480
direction if a plant is known to make

443
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,320
intersect traits and I really really

444
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,360
love it and I breed with it those seeds

445
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,639
stay in My Vault I grow them nobody else

446
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,159
will ever have access to them I'm going

447
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,120
to go off on a random tangent here

448
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,159
because it popped up in my head often

449
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,198
times on social media or other internet

450
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,399
platforms

451
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,719
I see I will even post a male plant and

452
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:35,440
people will say that's a Herm kill it

453
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,639
ladies and Gentlemen please educate

454
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,319
yourselves more on what is an intersex

455
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:41,360
plant what is a female plant what is a

456
00:15:39,318 --> 00:15:44,078
male plant the reason there are a couple

457
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,360
of reasons I ask that I'm a seed seller

458
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,838
if you get a mail plant out of my pack

459
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,839
and you tell everybody that you got a

460
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,079
Herm that definitely tarnishes my

461
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,639
reputation please don't let your

462
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,318
miseducation tarnish my reputation

463
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,600
because you could not identify a mail

464
00:15:56,318 --> 00:16:01,479
plant you just immediately said Herm and

465
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:03,120
INX bro it's a male males are common

466
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,120
males pop up if you bought a regular

467
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,278
pack of seeds 50% of those are going to

468
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,399
be boys quit calling those inex plants

469
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:11,559
please uh just for breeder sake not just

470
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,919
me every breeder out there wants you to

471
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:15,599
stop calling male plants Herms it hurts

472
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,439
uh it feels terrible when you're calling

473
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,519
our male plants Herms those plants have

474
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,480
feelings and so to the Breeders I'm half

475
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,959
exaggerating but for real let's learn

476
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,519
that also those things um so you got a

477
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,879
branch right or you got your main stock

478
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,720
you got a branch that comes down those

479
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,278
things that grow right here those two

480
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,278
look ball looking things those aren't

481
00:16:30,278 --> 00:16:34,519
male parts those are bracks um often

482
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,198
times those will fill with the seed if

483
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:38,799
the plant is pollinated if not that

484
00:16:36,198 --> 00:16:40,958
Brack will just swell up and it's not a

485
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:43,159
seed that's not a Herm please read some

486
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,000
plant anatomy books anyhow let me get

487
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:46,838
myself back on track here we're talking

488
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,198
about breeding with an intersex plant a

489
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,800
possible intersex plant it definitely

490
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,799
depends on when and how strongly

491
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,359
intersect that plant is if I would breed

492
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,198
with it for my own personal use I would

493
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,318
never put an interex plant into the

494
00:16:56,198 --> 00:17:01,159
commercial breeding program but think of

495
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:03,120
it this way we know let's think about it

496
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:05,639
like uh the intersex is just a touch of

497
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,880
poison and it's in this ingredient and

498
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,199
now you're going to make a pie and

499
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,199
you're going to put this ingredient in

500
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:11,600
the pie we're going to mix up that pie

501
00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:12,759
batter that cake batter whatever you

502
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,639
want to call it and we're going to

503
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,759
spread that pie batter out to a bigger

504
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,120
pie there's a little bit of poison in

505
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:21,400
there every few slices is going to get

506
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,958
some poison it's up to you how much of

507
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,959
that poison you want to put into your

508
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,439
pie mix we know it's there we've

509
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,600
obviously uh confirmed that there is an

510
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,480
intersect straight Within this plant you

511
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,000
can breed with it if you want if you

512
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,240
want to put that in your that poison

513
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,319
into your mix you're more than welcome

514
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,558
but it will pop up in some of the pi

515
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:41,918
pieces I can't tell you how many pieces

516
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:43,440
of the P but it is in there you've got

517
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,640
the potential we don't know if all that

518
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,400
intersect straight ran to one slice of

519
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,400
pie or if it all spread out a little bit

520
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,240
we don't know where it is but it is in

521
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:53,480
the mix so that is up to you if you want

522
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,359
to take that risk we know it's there I

523
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,038
wouldn't run the risk it sounds like you

524
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,519
want to so let me read again and make

525
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,000
sure I'm answering the question

526
00:17:58,519 --> 00:18:02,279
correctly cuz I feel like I really got

527
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,440
off on a random tangent uh the mom only

528
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,839
intersect because it was laid in flower

529
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,240
uh because we know that trait's there it

530
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,079
says why would The Offspring have a

531
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,480
higher rate of hermaphroditism because

532
00:18:09,079 --> 00:18:13,439
we know it's there it's in there that

533
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,759
trait is in there just like the flavor

534
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,200
the color the growth structure those are

535
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:19,400
all traits those are things that are

536
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,840
expressed by the room uh by its

537
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,759
environment those are phenotypical

538
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:25,439
expressions those are traits that

539
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:27,400
interex trait is in there it just might

540
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,679
not show under certain conditions you

541
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,360
might have to feed it just right you

542
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,038
might have to get it too cold might have

543
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,199
to run it too long but it is in there we

544
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,919
know it's there so that's why I wouldn't

545
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,600
do it there's more it says thanks and
