continued patreon support

46
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,759
most of this podcast episode does come

47
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:27,759
from patreon questions

48
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,519
so let's just jump right into it this

49
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,478
patreon member did ask to remain

50
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,478
anonymous

51
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:33,920
so this doesn't come from uh anybody

52
00:01:32,478 --> 00:01:36,478
with a specific name

53
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
it says hey rosta jeff you only consume

54
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,078
dabs and i understand

55
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
does dabbing require oh and it says and

56
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:42,719
i understand so that makes more sense

57
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
that way it says

58
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:47,679
does dabbing require less cleanup and is

59
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,640
dabbing more expensive than smoking

60
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
flour

61
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,478
that's a great question if you do notice

62
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:54,158
on the show most of the live shows i'm

63
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:55,679
on most video feeds that i'm on i do

64
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,520
talk about dabbing i don't talk much

65
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,719
about smoking flour

66
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,718
i do prefer to smoke mostly dabs

67
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,478
i feel like to catch the buzz that i

68
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,078
need from smoking flour i would have to

69
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,239
just be smoking from the bong

70
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,239
all day long i don't have time for that

71
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,759
that's not super healthy for my lungs

72
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,759
i don't need to be consuming a bunch of

73
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,239
chlorophyll and green leafy matter

74
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,439
i can get everything i need in a big fat

75
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
dab if i take

76
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,800
about a dab every hour maybe every two

77
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,399
hours depends on what i'm doing that's

78
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
an ideal world you know if i'm hanging

79
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,319
out

80
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,840
doing work around here if i'm somewhere

81
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,598
else then you don't get to do dabs every

82
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,920
hour two hours maybe it's every four to

83
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,079
six

84
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,919
hours but in an ideal world i would just

85
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,959
have to take a dab every hour maybe

86
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,878
every two hours

87
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,878
as tour if i were smoking flowers i

88
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,000
would smoke until my throat was harsh my

89
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,479
voice was dry

90
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,560
my lungs were coughing up also i find

91
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,439
that smoking flour makes my eyes much

92
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,680
more red

93
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:47,680
than smoking concentrates so being a

94
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,000
podcaster being somebody who

95
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,959
works with other people uh teaching

96
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
people kind of

97
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,080
in a boss situation most of the time i

98
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,800
can't be

99
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560
uh real scratchy voiced real coffee

100
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,120
lunged all the time real red-eyed and i

101
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,640
can't be

102
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,158
going to the car to take a bong rip

103
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,158
every [ __ ] 20 minutes

104
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,759
so we get a break about every two hours

105
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:07,519
in a real work environment so i pull a

106
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:08,959
big fat dab about every two hours

107
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,719
allegedly i don't know if i'm working

108
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,360
for you maybe i'm not smoking dabs wink

109
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,598
wink

110
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
uh but so you will notice that i do

111
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:18,158
prefer to smoke concentrates

112
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:20,079
over the flowers however i have been

113
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:20,479
smoking a lot of flowers lately i've got

114
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,239
some

115
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:23,518
great blue raspberry truffle flowers

116
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,280
that were grown by a friend i got some

117
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
good nepali girl flowers

118
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,360
i ran into some good double dose flowers

119
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,480
so i'm stocked up on good flowers right

120
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
now i've been rolling

121
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:33,759
uh king-sized joints joints the size of

122
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:35,680
my middle finger and

123
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,280
uh during the super bowl i didn't watch

124
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
the game i watched the tom

125
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,519
uh tom segura bert kreischer uh was the

126
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,878
companion to the super bowl i watched

127
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,760
that instead of watching the super bowl

128
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,359
but that day

129
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,840
smoked a big old giant joint during the

130
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
super bowl anyway i digress i'm rambling

131
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,200
you are correct i don't smoke a lot of

132
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:54,000
flour on camera on video

133
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,359
but i do smoke some flour if you watch

134
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,400
the video with mike and i that i

135
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,000
recently put up

136
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,080
i smoked a couple of bowls during that

137
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
video so i do smoke flower but the main

138
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,319
part of the question

139
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,759
uh is dabbing less cleanup i don't know

140
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,318
about that there is

141
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,079
uh i guess everything is sticky is the

142
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:12,000
bottom line when it comes to dabbing

143
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,760
you've got a jar of concentrates you

144
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,199
stick a little tool into that jar of

145
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:17,199
concentrates

146
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,478
now that tool is sticky you put that

147
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,400
into the banger

148
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,000
you put a carb cap on the banger now

149
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,638
you've got a sticky dabber and a sticky

150
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
banger

151
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,840
you got to set those down somewhere when

152
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,080
you put them down

153
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:30,000
that surface becomes sticky so a lot of

154
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,839
times my elbows and my hoodie sleeves

155
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,639
are sticky because the table and desk

156
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,839
around me

157
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,759
are perpetually [ __ ] sticky so

158
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,839
i don't know that it's cleaner and less

159
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,360
cleanup than smoking flowers there's no

160
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:42,799
ashtray which i prefer

161
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,479
i don't have to scrape out a bowl i

162
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,319
don't have to scrape my bong scrape my

163
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,478
pipe clean my pipe as often

164
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,560
uh dabbing doesn't make that black funky

165
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,240
residue the tarry like [ __ ]

166
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
but i don't know about cleaner

167
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,478
everything is [ __ ] sticky so

168
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
we use a slick mat to put down on the

169
00:04:56,478 --> 00:04:59,680
table so that after you take a dab you

170
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
can put your tools on there

171
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,519
uh but then you got to clean that up

172
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,000
with alcohol if you were dabbing

173
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,038
uh what i used to call insert dabs or a

174
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,120
bucket dabs

175
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,719
you've got a thicker banger and you heat

176
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,800
that up you put your dab inside of

177
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
another bucket that looks like a thimble

178
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,160
and you drop that inside of that banger

179
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,639
so that you don't roast it kind of a

180
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
double boil or a sort of the idea there

181
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,639
but that way requires a whole another

182
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:23,599
setup of cleaning you need a thing of

183
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,960
alcohol and

184
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,960
you gotta clean it immediately or it

185
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,959
just gets too sticky so i don't know

186
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:30,478
about cleaner or less cleanup

187
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:32,319
everything is i keep saying everything

188
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:33,439
is [ __ ] sticky there was a point in

189
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:36,399
time

190
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,038
when i wanted to name the studio sticky

191
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:38,719
knob

192
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,560
studios it sounds a little bit obscene

193
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,680
which is right up my alley but the idea

194
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,519
was that everything

195
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,038
was [ __ ] sticky all my knobs my

196
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:47,680
computer gear the table

197
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,599
uh sticky table studios was an option i

198
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
just went with gfyh studio girl from

199
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,039
your heart studio

200
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,879
it works out quite well but everything

201
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,560
is sticky when you're dabbing so

202
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,240
um then it says is dabbing more

203
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,160
expensive than smoking

204
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,280
flour oh also another thing that i was

205
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,680
gonna say the rig

206
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,318
water isn't so bad compared to bong

207
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,319
water

208
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
if you cle if you keep your rig water

209
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,199
fairly clean it's not nearly as bad as

210
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,439
bong water

211
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,879
when you spill it a bunch of funky shits

212
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,879
not going to come spilling out

213
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,719
the rig water the water inside of your

214
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,839
rig if your rig is just dedicated to

215
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,680
smoking dabs

216
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,519
the water that pours out if you don't

217
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,959
get big chunks of reclaim and oil just

218
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,639
pouring out when you spill it

219
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,079
it won't smell as bad it may actually

220
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,918
smell kind of good sometimes when i

221
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,519
clean my rig i dump out the water

222
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,439
it smells like whatever the last few

223
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:34,639
dabs i took were and sometimes it's

224
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:37,199
really [ __ ] delicious so uh rig water

225
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,879
is not as bad as bong water if

226
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,280
you keep them separate if you're smoking

227
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:43,120
flowers and dabs through the same piece

228
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,719
that water is going to smell terrible

229
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,439
and you are a [ __ ] savage you need to

230
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
get i don't i can't say need i recommend

231
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,719
you would get two separate devices that

232
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,598
way you can enjoy the flavor and terps

233
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,199
of those dabs

234
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,639
and enjoy the essence of that flower

235
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,038
through two different pieces

236
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
that's a totally different podcast is

237
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:59,839
dabbing more expensive than smoking

238
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,199
flour

239
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,758
the initial setup to smoke dabs

240
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,199
could be can be a little bit expensive

241
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,240
there are some hurdles there to getting

242
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,478
into smoking flour

243
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,879
to smoking concentrates when you smoke

244
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,639
flour you get a bag of weed or now it's

245
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,719
a medicine jar filled with weed

246
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,800
and you need a pipe or some rolling

247
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
papers and a lighter and you're [ __ ]

248
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,360
smoking weed that's no

249
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:22,800
no problem then you get into the

250
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
accessories something to scrape it out

251
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,319
or an ashtray maybe you get a bong

252
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,919
something fancy to carry your pipe in

253
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,919
but it doesn't go too far from there

254
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,159
there's not too much fancy [ __ ] when it

255
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,719
comes to taking dabs there is a lot of

256
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,960
equipment

257
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,560
involved you need a banger uh you need a

258
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,159
rig you need a rig first of all and a

259
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,079
banger that's your first combo

260
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,639
uh the banger is what the dab goes into

261
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,000
you neither need like a banger a nail

262
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,680
ah there's something called a terp

263
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,279
slurper there's a honey bucket

264
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,038
there are all kinds of different

265
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:50,799
variable nails it's the piece that the

266
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:51,519
dab actually goes on to the piece that

267
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
gets heated

268
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:54,959
then you need a rig to put that onto

269
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,758
that's the part that you smoke through

270
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,959
it the water go

271
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,720
it goes through the water then it goes

272
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,239
up to your face the glass piece you

273
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,039
smoke through that is your rig

274
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,598
so you need a nail a banger a bucket a

275
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:05,680
rig

276
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:07,120
then you probably need a carb cap to cap

277
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,879
that banger your bucket

278
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,319
uh your turp slurper whatever you chose

279
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,560
to go with i just like a normal club

280
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
banger that's what i use uh then you're

281
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,120
probably going to need a torch to heat

282
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,000
that banger

283
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,120
so now you're looking at anywhere from a

284
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,439
hundred to

285
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,560
thousands thousands of dollars for a rig

286
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,160
we're going to talk about that in a

287
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,319
minute in a minute i do kind of have

288
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
some notes

289
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,240
so you need a rig a banger a torch a

290
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,918
carb cap you need a dabber you need

291
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,200
something to stick in the concentrates

292
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,598
and transfer the dab from the

293
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,200
concentrate to the banger

294
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,959
then you're going to need oh other

295
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,000
things that you're going to need q-tips

296
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,838
why do we need q-tips

297
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,120
after you take a dab that [ __ ] banger

298
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,480
is going to be filthy you're going to

299
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,000
want to clean it out i like to use a

300
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,879
q-tip just get in there and wipe it out

301
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,879
a little bit

302
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:50,480
then if you're super cool you need

303
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,080
something fancy you can't just throw the

304
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,839
q-tips on the table you need something

305
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,160
fancy to throw the q-tips in so you need

306
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,480
a

307
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:57,360
little fancy trash can for your q-tips

308
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,120
then also

309
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
you need a q-tip holder they can't just

310
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
come out of the [ __ ] plastic

311
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,560
container

312
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,480
you need matching glass q-tip holders

313
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:08,000
and q-tip trash cans that's something if

314
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,879
you're super cool if you're a heady boy

315
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,159
if you're hyped up

316
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,679
if you're going out in public and people

317
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:13,120
are gonna see you that's the [ __ ] you

318
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,159
gotta have we'll talk about that in a

319
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,600
minute then you need

320
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,439
that slick mat that i talked about a

321
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
minute ago something to set all your

322
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,920
sticky [ __ ] on then a lot of people like

323
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,879
to buy

324
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,639
some sort of a a mood mat a dab pad

325
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,039
something thick sort of like a mouse pad

326
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,120
they're

327
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,799
basically repurposed mouse pads made out

328
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,080
of that thin rubbery type stuff i don't

329
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,079
know what it is honestly

330
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,519
uh it's a mouse pad and they cut them

331
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,879
into you can get them cut into all kinds

332
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
of shapes every brand out there's got

333
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,679
their logo eventually you'll see the

334
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,879
roster jeff dab mat

335
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,120
the rig mat the rig pad the mood mat um

336
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,559
but that is to set your rig on so that

337
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,080
you don't have to set your expensive

338
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:47,199
thousand dollar rig back down on the

339
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,639
hardwood table

340
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,240
every time you take a dab you got that

341
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,080
soft little surface you don't hear tink

342
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,000
tink every time you set your rig down

343
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,278
just feels nice so there are a lot of

344
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,278
things to buy

345
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:58,639
to get into dabbing so once you're over

346
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:01,600
the entry hurdles

347
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,360
then it's not expensive per se to take

348
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,040
dabs it's no more expensive than smoking

349
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,480
flour once you're into it

350
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,439
like i said you can get yourself a cheap

351
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,800
rig for probably 75 to 100 bucks maybe a

352
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
little bit cheaper depending on where

353
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:13,919
you are but then they go all the way up

354
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,600
to thousands and thousands of dollars

355
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:17,439
there are rigs that i drool over

356
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,720
that are in the five and ten thousand

357
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,880
dollar price range

358
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,480
uh you can get a banger depends on where

359
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,679
you go where you are who you know what

360
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,159
store you shop at

361
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,479

362
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,919
banger you can get them for 300 bucks

363
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,000
it's all about what you want to spend

364
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:34,399
the entry level 30 40

365
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,240

366
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,919
thousand dollars for a banger i know it

367
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,879

369
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:43,838

to 100

372
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,319
on a torch a dabber you could buy a lot

373
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,559
of different devices for a dabber

380
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320

uh anyway we're not gonna go too far

385
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,399
into that then you need a carb cap a

386
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,120
carb cap can be anywhere you can get a

387
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,120
clear one

388
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,399
for like 20 bucks or you can get a fancy

389
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,240
one like i keep saying

390
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
three five maybe seven or nine hundred

391
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,600
maybe a thousand dollars if you want a

392
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,240
mother ship carb cap they could be 2 500

393
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,759
bucks

394
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,278
uh they're not even called card caps

395
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,039
they got their own special name

396
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,639
uh so things can be cheap things can get

397
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,000
really expensive a dab mat can be

398
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,000
anywhere from 30 to 100 bucks q-tips

399
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,360
get the q-tips don't buy normal q-tips

400
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,639
to clean your dab rig they're going to

401
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,560
melt in the banger if you're trying to

402
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,078
clean it if that oil is still hot

403
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,719
get glob mobs glob mops something like

404
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,159
that

405
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
something that's kind of aimed for the

406
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,958
dabbers they're a little bit thicker a

407
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,079
little more industrial strength i think

408
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,479
they're honestly made

409
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,278
uh for the cosmetic industry that's not

410
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,519
my alley

411
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:51,120
uh but get the better q-tips uh then

412
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,200
that q-tip holder bro you got to get a

413
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,320
fancy head eq tip holder

414
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,399
then um let's talk about the prices

415
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,879
of dabs versus flour once you've got all

416
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,679
that gear the prices aren't too far

417
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,879
apart

418
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,078
buying like an eighth of flower versus i

419
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:08,159
don't know where you live i don't know

420
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:10,638

421
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,159
um here right now in colorado you can

422
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,799

between 90 to 240 bucks

424
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,879
uh the quality will vary based on your

425
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,439
price just like you should expect the 90

426
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:22,720
ounce looks like a 90 ounce the 240

427
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,639
looks like a 240

428
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,839
ounce uh it's what you would expect here

429
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,600
in colorado

430
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,560
these grams depending on who you are

431
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,639
where you are one gram of this is my

432
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,479
uh concentrate of choice today the

433
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,919
garlic banger number nine from green dot

434
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,519
they don't pay me to say that they don't

435
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,439
advertise with me they don't i don't

436
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,039
uh we don't have any deals i pay cash

437
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
for this [ __ ] i am friends at the

438
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,240
dispensary i was actually

439
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,920
the first person to buy recreational

440
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,480
cannabis in this county

441
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,120
so i was from this dispensary the same

442
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,800
ownership

443
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,480
so i've got a little bit of a vip

444
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,000
friends and family discount that does

445
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,519

446
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,399
complaining i do get a little bit of a

447
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,000
discount

448
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,278
it's like 10 percent which is it goes a

449
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,799
far away when you're buying 300 bucks

450
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,399
worth of concentrates but

451
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,679
um they don't advertise with me they

452
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,440
don't pay me it's just what i like i

453
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,879
love garlic terps this is a good brand

454
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
quality product

455
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:11,600
it's in my price point i think these are

456
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:14,639
40 or 45 dollars

457
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,360
without any discounts so you can get an

458
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,399
ounce

459
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,839
for about uh around you know 240 if you

460
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,440
want to get that top shelf [ __ ] if you

461
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,959
want to get some stuff that

462
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,079
is not you don't want to show it off on

463
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,000
instagram or anything it's going to be

464
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,879
like 80 90 maybe 100 bucks

465
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
a gram of top shelf concentrate 45 bucks

466
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:31,120
maybe

467
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,040
maybe you can find it for 35 somewhere

468
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,320
between 35 and 50 out the door is what

469
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:35,120
you should expect for a top shelf

470
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
concentrate

471
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,959
so i don't know about the price

472
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,040
difference because ah i would smoke

473
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:42,319
a lot of flour you would have to be

474
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,639
blowing a bong hit

475
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,600
in each ear while i take a bong hit

476
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,440
through my face

477
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,600
and maybe do bong hits through other

478
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,600
aurify at the same time

479
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,159
to get me nearly as high as i can get

480
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,320
off of one dab of this garlic banger

481
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,000
live batter so or it's uh actually this

482
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,000
one's full spectrum extract

483
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,320
it's got a real nice punch to it uh

484
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,639
crystals and sauce diamonds and sauce

485
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,000
so uh cost-effective it just kind of

486
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,839
depends on what you prefer

487
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
there are more affordable concentrates

488
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:10,800
just like there are more affordable

489
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,959
flours there are also

490
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,159
more expensive concentrates i just

491
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,919
prefer the green dot

492
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,198
and they don't pay me to say that i paid

493
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,039
cash for this today

494
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,799
that's what i chose to buy uh with my

495
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,159
own pocket money uh so

496
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:23,838
also tip your bud tinder when you're

497
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,360
buying [ __ ] you guys that [ __ ] tip

498
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,199
jar was not full enough today for how

499
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,519
many cars were in the parking lot

500
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,439
stuff that tip jar so is dabbing more

501
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,759
expensive than smoking flour

502
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,480
i don't think so if you are the type of

503
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:36,159
person

504
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,920
that likes to just have a pipe in your

505
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,278
hand have a bowl and just be puffing on

506
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:42,078
something all the time

507
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,958
maybe ah maybe the flour will get

508
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,599
expensive because

509
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,479
i like to take a dab and then maybe i

510
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,079
take a dab and then i

511
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,600
wait an hour maybe two hours for another

512
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:50,958
dab honestly i'll take two or three dabs

513
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,159
and then wait an hour or two for another

514
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,078
one but i'm just chilling i'm not

515
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,759
you know i like to have that pipe in my

516
00:14:54,078 --> 00:14:57,278
hand i just carry my bowl around and hit

517
00:14:55,759 --> 00:14:58,480
a bowl occasionally

518
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,399
it's nice to know that if you're just

519
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,839
sitting there watching a netflix video

520
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,320
or a youtube video you don't have to get

521
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,920
out the torch and

522
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,440
heat up the [ __ ] dab nail and do all

523
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,559
that work you could just pick up your

524
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,920
lighter pick up your ball

525
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:11,599
take a couple of quick puffs off the

526
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,000
bowl and just enhance the buzz that

527
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,440
you've already

528
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,879
got it kind of keeps it going keeps

529
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,320
riding it so if you're the kind of

530
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,439
person that likes to keep talking on

531
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,560
something

532
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,880
you may go through all of your

533
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,159
concentrates super quickly but if you're

534
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:24,240
the kind of person they can just take a

535
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,759
dab every hour a dab every two hours and

536
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,079
they're not gigantic dabs it could be

537
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,278
more

538
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,439
cost effective now i was joking earlier

539
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,799
about all of that fancy equipment why do

540
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,639
people have

541
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:36,879
three thousand dollar rigs why do people

542
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,278
buy custom-made torches why do people

543
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:39,039
buy

544
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,639
a thousand dollar carb cap what the [ __ ]

545
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,759
there's a thirty dollar carb cap sitting

546
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,440
right there on the shelf

547
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,519
why would i buy the one that's twelve

548
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,880
hundred dollars and [ __ ] purple and

549
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,360
faceted and has all kinds of different

550
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,720
colors

551
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
of glass in it they're both glass

552
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,480
they're going to do the same thing it

553
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,680
has become a cultural thing

554
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,560
to that's a way to flex to show off a

555
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,799
lot of people wear

556
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,799
chains a lot of people drive fast cars

557
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,879
some of us like to wear fancy shoes

558
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,159
a lot of people prefer to show off that

559
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,799
they're doing okay by

560
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,958
having a really fancy glass setup it's

561
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,679
something we do uh so a lot of us we do

562
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,838
it often

563
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,120
all day every day it's something we're

564
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
passionate about you can definitely say

565
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,240
i'm passionate about consuming cannabis

566
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,480
and consuming concentrates

567
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,399
so it only makes sense to have and in

568
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
rastafari we call it the chalice that's

569
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,839
my chalice that's part of my ceremony

570
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,600
part of my connection with the most i

571
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,519
job part of my connection with you

572
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
so why not have something that's ornate

573
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,078
and decorative and makes me smile when i

574
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,079
see it

575
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,239
so that's why a lot of people spend

576
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,559
extravagant extraordinary money

577
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,399
on a rig that is shaped like their

578
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,159
favorite cartoon character or that's got

579
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,480
their favorite color scheme or

580
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:44,240
is orange and has crazy spirals on it

581
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,839
and it's just the way that they like it

582
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,440
or maybe a lot of times it's just an

583
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,040
artist that they are buying from

584
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,120
is very well known and has a good

585
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:52,639
reputation uh just like if you wanted to

586
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,839
buy a really fancy painting from an

587
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,039
artist that's well known you're going to

588
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,399
pay extra money for it

589
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:57,919
if you want to buy a painting from me

590
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,759
it's a dollar because nobody knows who

591
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,399
the [ __ ] i am my paintings are cheap

592
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
so the glass game and art goes just like

593
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,919
that some people want to have nice [ __ ]

594
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,359
just to show you that they're doing okay

595
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,199
some people will

596
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,399
just save all their money for that one

597
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,839
real nice ornate

598
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,679
[ __ ] rig so that's what they've got

599
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,838
they got a nice rig a nice carb cap in

600
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,519
their smoke session their smoke ceremony

601
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,879
is top notch they're smoking the best

602
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:20,720
concentrates they can

603
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,319
through the best piece they can ah

604
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,959
that's just what a lot of people do

605
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:26,639
i myself i prefer a rig that is not

606
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,078
super ornate i've got a couple of rigs a

607
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,720
few rigs that are quite decorated

608
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:30,480
they've got

609
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,079
i've got one with a really stylish star

610
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,759
of david on the back i [ __ ] love

611
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:35,439
it however i'm afraid that i'm gonna

612
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,038
bump it on something and break that star

613
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,600
of david off i'm gonna pass it to a

614
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:39,359
buddy

615
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:41,038
and it's gonna get broken and i'm gonna

616
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:42,240
be heartbroken because it's beautiful

617
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,440
artwork which

618
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,839
that's what happens when you're using

619
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,160
glass but my favorite rig

620
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,959
is what i call functional scientific

621
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,080
glass

622
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,000
it has got a spot for your banger to go

623
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,240
it's got a down stem that splits off two

624
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,919
directions it percolates on two sides

625
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,440
it's a small rig that fits in the palm

626
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,080
of my hand with the mouthpiece that goes

627
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,720
straight to my

628
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:05,038
face that's what we call a side car and

629
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,880
then the mouthpiece is flared out like a

630
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,079
like a [ __ ] exhaust pipe or a trumpet

631
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
it doesn't have one of those

632
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,839
uh like a peepee shaped mouthpiece you

633
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,038
got to make a funky lip uh funky lip

634
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,720
shape to try to hit it

635
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:16,480
it's flared out and i really think that

636
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,519
i get a better dab because my mouth fits

637
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,720
better on it i don't have to make a

638
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,879
funky face

639
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,038
i take monstrous dabs compared to a lot

640
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,440
of people bigger dabs than you should

641
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,720
and with the smaller uh the peepee shape

642
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,600
and the phallic kind of shaped

643
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,360
mouthpieces

644
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,119
i get a lot of build up around my lips

645
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,119
when i take a dab of a fat dab of

646
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,399
concentrates with that flared mouthpiece

647
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:36,399
i don't get that effect because there's

648
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
more surface area for that dab to get

649
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,559
through i don't get all sticky lips so

650
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,798
ah that's some rants on why we buy

651
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,279
expensive rigs rig preferences

652
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:46,558
uh people just they're trying to flex a

653
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:48,240
lot of young kids a lot of

654
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,678
[ __ ] other folks are just saying hey

655
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,440
look i did all right one month or a

656
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,960
couple of months i saved up or

657
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,400
i just [ __ ] maxed out the credit card

658
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,079
and i got this rig i'm gonna set it on

659
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,160
the table and everyone's going to go ooh

660
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,519
ah then we're all going to dab out of it

661
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,038
we've got a really ornate

662
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,480
piece that we could be proud of also you

663
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,599
can support and show off one of your

664
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,440
favorite artists

665
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,000
so um dabbing prices versus flower

666
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
prices

667
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,720
that's debatable um you could buy topper

668
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,240
bottom shelf product i mean you can get

669
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,079
top shelf product or bottom shelf

670
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,279
product when it comes to dabs or when it

671
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:19,359
comes to flowers

672
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,798
i've seen people buy bottom shelf

673
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,399
concentrates and complain that that

674
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:23,599
store sell shitty product

675
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
if you go to any store and you buy the

676
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:26,558
bottom shelf [ __ ] expect bottom shelf

677
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:28,240
[ __ ]

678
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:29,918
if that's concentrates or flowers don't

679
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,359
complain about that also

680
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,360
um if you're buying pens pens can get a

681
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:38,798
little bit expensive the cartridges

682
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,798
are like 30 to 50 or something bucks

683
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,960
for a i think it's a half a gram it's

684
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,240
0.5 of whatever's in there it's a liquid

685
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,600
unit of measurement i don't remember

686
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,319
that measurement wasn't prepared for

687
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:48,159
that

688
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,798
those can get expensive quite quickly

689
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,960
however i love how discreet they are

690
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,480
if i were gonna be in a place where we

691
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,840
really aren't supposed to smoke or

692
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,200
consume products

693
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,519
i could just say i've got to go to the

694
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,000
bathroom and i can allegedly possibly

695
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,480
take

696
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,359
three to four good rips off of a pen one

697
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,960
in the hallway

698
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,719
two while i'm taking a piss and one in

699
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
the hallway on the way back

700
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,240
and i can get fairly ripped off of a pen

701
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,760
if you got to go to a concert you don't

702
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,519
want to take the dab torch or your

703
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:15,440
joints and [ __ ] into the concert

704
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,918
a couple of pens take those right on in

705
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:20,400
you can smoke with a pen so the pins are

706
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,679
semi-cost effective for what they are i

707
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,960
think they're great for their price if

708
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,880
you get a good battery and a good

709
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,519
cartridge that you can replace

710
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,039
uh they're cost effective for what they

711
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,240
are for their advantage if you're a

712
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,759
casual smoker

713
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,519
if you're not a heavy dabber those pins

714
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,440
will get you [ __ ] up i like to do

715
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,960
double pins i call it the double dragon

716
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,558
put a pin in each side of my mouth and

717
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,319
hit two pins at the same time so you get

718
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:43,599
a big fat cloud

719
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,079
that [ __ ] gets expensive also there is

720
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:46,480
wax

721
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,519
wax is cheap if you're buying a shatter

722
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,558
or wax

723
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:51,599
that [ __ ] should be like 15 maybe 12 15

724
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:53,440
maybe 22

725
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:55,038
a gram depending where you are that's

726
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,279
very affordable

727
00:20:55,038 --> 00:21:02,000
there is also sho solventless honey oil

728
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,119
that shits anywhere from 85 to 150

729
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,880
dollars a gram

730
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,439
if you want some of what they call percy

731
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,600
rosin personal rosin from some companies

732
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,759
will run you 150 dollars

733
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,199
per gram so it depends on how hard you

734
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,038
want to flex with your equipment

735
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,960
and your products if you want to buy

736
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,158
affordable stuff and just be satisfied

737
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,519
you can do that if you want to throw

738
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,080
your whole wallet and your whole [ __ ]

739
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,918
paycheck

740
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,918
at the dispensary and at the [ __ ]

741
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,280
glass store that is also

742
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,440
an option i'm going to take a sip of

743
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:28,639
this marvelous coconut pineapple juice

744
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,000
out of this beautiful grow from your

745
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,440
heart rig and then we will continue this

746
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,440
show sips tea

747
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,279
oh that is delicious and tropical and

748
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,880
refreshing all at the same time

749
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:46,639
so i think that covers up that part of

750
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,080
this episode let's move on to the next

751
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,159
part of this question

752
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,918
it says you hardly ever talk about what

753
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,440
you're dabbing on before the show

754
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,440
anymore is that by

755
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,519
choice uh there are a couple of reasons

756
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,480
that factored into that

757
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,158
politely i touched on this a moment ago

758
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,640
nobody pays me to advertise for their

759
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,559
product

760
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,840
nobody uh i get a little bit of a

761
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,440
discount from my friends at the

762
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,359
dispensary shout out to my friends at

763
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,798
the colorado cannabis exchange

764
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,399
they are actually the ones that hook me

765
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,480
up and give me good deals

766
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
none of the concentrate companies uh

767
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,159
reached out or replied when i talked

768
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,679
about doing a sponsorship deal or an

769
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,240
advertising deal

770
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,679
i said hey i'm smoking your [ __ ] on 600

771
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,720
podcasts would you like to work out a

772
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,159
deal maybe just

773
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
help me with concentrates or something

774
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,799
like that i didn't get a reaction

775
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,480
and um i just chose to if they're not

776
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,158
going to respond i'm not going to give

777
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,440
them a boost on every episode it just

778
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,120
seems fair that way

779
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,120
i still enjoy the concentrates i'm still

780
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,558
smoking them so that's my polite way of

781
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,000
saying uh nobody wanted to do an

782
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,279
advertising deal so they're not going to

783
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,519
get free advertising

784
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,639
uh maybe that's a capitalist attitude

785
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,000
but that is uh

786
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,520
advertising is expensive and they were

787
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,159
getting it for free to be quite honest

788
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,038
with you

789
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,799
so uh that is honestly i try to be

790
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,079
completely honest and transparent that

791
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,319
is a [ __ ] completely honest

792
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,678
answer part of why i stopped talking

793
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,119
about what i'm smoking because there's

794
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,080
always the same brand i just told you

795
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:03,839
who i enjoy

796
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,519
i like to smoke green dot labs i like

797
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,678
there i prefer their batter

798
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,200
the live batter is my favorite i will

799
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,400
smoke the full spectrum extract if

800
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,440
that's what you give me

801
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,960
ah but i prefer the batter so um also i

802
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,360
didn't think anybody really cared i got

803
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,798
a

804
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:18,319
couple of comments like hey bro nobody

805
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,000
cares what you're [ __ ] smoking can we

806
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:21,038
just move on with the podcast

807
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,319
and if people don't care what i'm

808
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:23,759
talking about then there's no sense in

809
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:24,960
talking about it so i just moved on with

810
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,000
the podcast

811
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,798
um yeah and i guess uh another thing i

812
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,640
was gonna mention

813
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,240
i've been taking less dabs i don't know

814
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,559
if you notice i clear my throat less on

815
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,000
the podcast my throat is less itchy

816
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,798
i feel like the show is better the show

817
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,440
has only been 25 to 32 minutes long

818
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:41,759
lately

819
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,200
because i don't spend [ __ ] six extra

820
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,240
minutes talking about dumb [ __ ] because

821
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,400
i'm too high

822
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,919
so uh in my opinion the show has been

823
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,440
better with less dabs i've been more

824
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
functional when i'm not dabbing

825
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
uh super hard before the show i used to

826
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,480
take like [ __ ] six dabs before the

827
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,159
show don't get me wrong i took two or

828
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,278
three fatty dabs tonight before i did

829
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,880
this podcast

830
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,880
but i didn't try to dab myself into a

831
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,880
[ __ ] coma like i used to do so

832
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,200
that is also part of why i don't talk

833
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:07,520
about why or what i'm dabbing so much

834
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
uh honest answer nobody's paying me for

835
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,240
the free advertising they've been

836
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,079
getting for multiple episodes

837
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,159
i didn't think anybody gave a [ __ ] and

838
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:17,439
i've been dabbing less i actually took

839
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,960
a couple of uh dabbing days off

840
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,558
i thought it would be good for me i went

841
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,919
to the doctor just for a regular checkup

842
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,119
i had a cold that lasted a couple of

843
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,038
days i went to go make sure that i was

844
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,599
okay during this season which we are in

845
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:26,879
you know

846
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,879
the dog's like nah you're young and

847
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,159
healthy we talked about the things i do

848
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,520
the doctor said are you addicted to

849
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,919
cannabis and i said i don't

850
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,839
think so the doctor said do me a favor

851
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,120
give me three days without cannabis and

852
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,079
i said i'll see your three days i'll

853
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:40,959
give you five

854
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:41,359
and the doc said game on i went three

855
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,038
days

856
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,479
and i was like that was easy i didn't

857
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,400
smoke a single dab i didn't eat any

858
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,120
edibles i'm [ __ ] living large i went

859
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,480
five days

860
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,239
and i was like this is a good time i

861
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,240
think i'm gonna try to go seven full

862
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,919
days without smoking

863
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,839
and i went seven full days without

864
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,799
smoking when i got to seven days i

865
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:58,798
decided let's go

866
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,960
ten days and there's just something in

867
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:02,558
my brain uh something in me clicked and

868
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,440
i was like well let's do 10 days and at

869
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,759
day 11

870
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,519
i was like 10 days was cool i can do 11.

871
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,839
and i thought the challenge was 3 i made

872
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:13,278
it 11 on day 12 i took a dab

873
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:16,000
and i got high you guys i was

874
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,359
high school high i had to chill out on

875
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,200
the couch for a couple of minutes i had

876
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,000
to regroup i had to recoup i had to

877
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,679
recover

878
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,038
i had to write my name down on a [ __ ]

879
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,798
piece of paper and keep looking at it

880
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:28,000
just to remember who the [ __ ] i was

881
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,759
it was a really good time so i realized

882
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,359
at that point when dabs weren't

883
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,919
affecting me like i could take

884
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:34,798
[ __ ] three fat dabs and do whatever

885
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,320
you needed done

886
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,759
if we're at work and you're like hey

887
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:39,678
corporate called we need you to talk to

888
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:41,278
him i could be hitting the dab rig and

889
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,320
blow out my dab and talk to corporate

890
00:25:41,278 --> 00:25:43,200
you know what i mean i could talk to

891
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,200
whatever i could

892
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,798
do whatever i shouldn't talk about some

893
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,360
of the physical activities that i did

894
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:49,759
like

895
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,558
uh with machinery and driving equipment

896
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,400
and stuff but

897
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,879
allegedly i could still do all that [ __ ]

898
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,880
just fine which meant something after

899
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,799
i took 11 days off and took a dab that

900
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,480
nearly incapacitated me

901
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,319
maybe i was overdoing it maybe i was

902
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,960
just dabbing too hard

903
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,839
since i took my little break i feel like

904
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,079
i'm working back

905
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,599
up to where i was honestly so i took

906
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:10,798
another couple of day breaks and then i

907
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:12,240
would smoke for like a week and then

908
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:13,599
take a day or two off

909
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,400
now that i've been taking little breaks

910
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:18,000
i get much higher my buzz is much more

911
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,880
enjoyable it sticks around for a little

912
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,119
bit longer

913
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,720
it comes on a little bit stronger so

914
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:24,319
sometimes i'll blow out that dab and my

915
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,400
eyes get heavy and i'm like oh

916
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:27,839
[ __ ] i need a minute gotta grab onto the

917
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,120
table and make sure i don't float away

918
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,439
or something like that

919
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,959
but i think it was really advantageous

920
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
to take that little bit of a dab break

921
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,960
so i

922
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,038
was dabbing a little bit less is one of

923
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,319
the reasons why you didn't hear me

924
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,158
talking about what i'm dabbing on the

925
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,678
show i think it was good for me uh the

926
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,960
doctor said give me three days i was

927
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:43,600
like i'll see your three and give you

928
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,278
five

929
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,439
uh something in my brain like the

930
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,599
challenge i went 11 days without a dab

931
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,120
day 11 we got [ __ ] wrecked you guys

932
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,879
and then it taught me a lot about myself

933
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,479
it taught me that maybe i'm not smoking

934
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,600
medicinally maybe i'm not smoking

935
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,798
recreationally

936
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:58,959
maybe i'm just smoking [ __ ]

937
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,480
habitually it's not even about chasing

938
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,759
the buzz it's not even about feeling

939
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,400
good it's not even keeping myself

940
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,839
healthy

941
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,679
it's just when i'm sitting here editing

942
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,278
a podcast or writing a podcast or

943
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,919
watching a youtube video i got some time

944
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:10,720
to kill

945
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:12,559
what are you gonna do take a dab the the

946
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,278
hardest thing was after i would eat a

947
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:15,440
fat meal

948
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,480
was to not go take a big fat dab after i

949
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,798
ate because that's one of my favorite

950
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,720
things

951
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,319
do you finish up a meal put the dishes

952
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,839
in the sink clean yourself up

953
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:23,200
go take a fat drink or something to get

954
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,720
all that spicy out of your mouth because

955
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,798
i ate a lot of spicy food

956
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
chill out for a minute and then you look

957
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:29,599
at whoever you're with and you go

958
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,720
you're ready for some dabs and everybody

959
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:32,000
goes [ __ ] yeah and you're heading to

960
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,360
wherever you take dabs you go get the

961
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,640
rig and you take some dabs

962
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,000
i'm sure you got some sort of routine

963
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,399
like that that was the hardest part for

964
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,319
me

965
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,079
was not dabbing after every single

966
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,359
[ __ ] meal that i put in my face

967
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,199
i am running out of time but there are

968
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,079
more parts to this question let me keep

969
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,319
moving

970
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,759
um oh let me see it's on the next next

971
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,519
page here uh it says since

972
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:50,798
dabbing concentrates are sometimes as

973
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,720
high as 70

974
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,519
does that ruin your tolerance of smoking

975
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,960
flour at all or do you still get a buzz

976
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:59,519
like i mentioned before

977
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,440
tolerance breaks are key now yes i am

978
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:03,038
getting stoned again when i smoke flour

979
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,038
and i like to smoke flour because i'm a

980
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,558
breeder i'll breed some stuff i'll grow

981
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,720
it out then i get to select which

982
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,240
phenotype gets me the better buzz

983
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,240
that has a lot to do with what gets

984
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,599
selected for next breeding projects gets

985
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,120
moved forward with so

986
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,798
i like to smoke those flowers which

987
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:17,918
means i need to be able to feel the

988
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,158
effect taste the

989
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,880
aromas and flavors and enjoy that flower

990
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,480
to make good decisions with breeding so

991
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,399
uh what's the question again i got so

992
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,240
stoned i forgot uh do you still get a

993
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,398
buzz from smoking flower yes because i

994
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,240
do take tolerance breaks and it's a bit

995
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,158
of a different buzz i say that

996
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,000
a lot of times dabbing will make me bug

997
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,919
i got this beanie over my face right now

998
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,200
but dabbing makes me like woo i'm high

999
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,120
i'm so high

1000
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,319
but smoking good flour makes my eyes

1001
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:45,038
heavy and makes me like oh

1002
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,398
i'm stoned and so in the evening in the

1003
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:47,919
night time when i'm chilling out i like

1004
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,278
to carry around that bowl and just hit

1005
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,038
on a bowl or whatever

1006
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,119
if you're doing shaving getting in the

1007
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,720

1008
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,398

1011
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,919
mellow i like to be mellow

1012
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,760
and i mentioned earlier i like that

1013
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,559
comfort of just carrying a bowl around

1014
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:06,558
with me

1015
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,558

1016
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:11,599
