concentrate but this one seems to have

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,289
mellowed me out it made me sit back in

12
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,570
the chair a little bit and it kind of

13

38
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:49,228
one of my new most recent and most

39
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:50,759
favorite creations this will be the

40
00:01:49,228 --> 00:01:52,920
debut most of you haven't heard about

41
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,500
this one yet this is the first time we

42
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,329
will talk about blue raspberry truffle

43
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,549
here on the podcast so ladies and

44
00:01:57,328 --> 00:02:01,859

00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:05,650
a little bit about blue raspberry

47
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:07,990
truffle

48
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:10,180
when this episode originally comes out

49
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:12,549

50
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,580

the first released packs of the blue

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,710
raspberry truffle I like to let things

64
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:49,390
go with the events in person face to

65
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,310
face before some of the vendors even

66

67
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:55,420
opportunity so let's talk a little bit

68
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,730
about blue raspberry truffle what is

69
00:02:55,419 --> 00:03:00,219
this blue raspberry truffle that I keep

70
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:03,340
talking about blue raspberry truffle is

71
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:05,620
of course a cross of my arise mail I've

72
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:08,379
got a prized arise mail that I've named

73
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,500
King Solomon I use in many of my crosses

74
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:14,049
a rise is a golden goat female

75
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,909
pollinated by a Daybreaker male we'll

76
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,770
briefly talk about a rise I've done a

77
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:22,129
full Episode on a rise

78
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:24,740
it is episode 329 and I do a full

79
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:26,780
feature of the strain arise we'll

80
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,850
briefly talk about it here arise is a

81
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,490
golden go female pollinated by eight-day

82
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:33,469
breaker male golden goat is kind of

83
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,210
tropical kind of sweet at his island

84
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:37,460
sweet skunk Hawaiian sativa and a

85
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,469
Romulan so it's got that tropical sativa

86
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,150
flavor to it it's got a really nice head

87
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:43,609
buzz to it is a really great growing

88
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:45,590
plant and it is very potent the

89
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:49,580
Daybreaker male used in that cross is

90
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,710
Kim D crossed it Joseph OG the Kim D has

91
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:53,750
kind of a fresh tennis ball kind of a

92
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:56,930
fresh rubber sort of a smell and then of

93
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,909
course Joseph Bo G smells like swampy og

94
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:01,400
cush it's kind of piney kind of gassy

95
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:03,469
it's got kind of a really unique funk to

96
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,270
it so I like that one for its funky

97
00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:07,129
flavors and aromas it had a short

98
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:09,230
squatty structure with really wide

99
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:11,359
leaves so it really contrasted that

100
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:14,739
golden goat quite well so I bred those

101
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:18,049
two together and I made that arise cross

102
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:20,720
out of those arise seeds came a very

103
00:04:18,048 --> 00:04:24,319
standout male that male has been known

104
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,540
as King Solomon King Solomon basically

105
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,459
turbocharges everything he pollinates

106
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,650
you can take a plant that has great

107
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:32,269
flavor and great trichome production but

108
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:34,310
maybe doesn't grow the best and King

109
00:04:32,269 --> 00:04:36,919
Solomon will fix that growth he gives

110
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,230
plants hyper vigor he also increases

111
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,060
potency he also increases yield

112
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,100
I feel like King Solomon is a very

113
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,040
special plant that is why I breed him to

114
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:48,379
so many different things so that is a

115
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:50,660
quick rundown of King Solomon King

116
00:04:48,379 --> 00:04:52,519
Solomon is the male I used in the blue

117
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,590
raspberry truffles now let's talk about

118
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:55,879
the female they'll be used in this cross

119
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:57,529
I know I'm good at building suspense

120
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,199
everybody wants to know what was the

121
00:04:57,529 --> 00:05:02,599
girl in that cross the female that I

122
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,789
used for the blue raspberry truffle

123
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,770
cross was the blueberry cookies cross

124
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,260
and that blueberry cookies is actually a

125
00:05:06,769 --> 00:05:13,029
cross of blueberry Tahoe and platinum

126
00:05:09,259 --> 00:05:15,709
cookies it's got a very very blueberry

127
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:18,559
dominant kind of a blueberry skittles a

128
00:05:15,709 --> 00:05:21,949
nerds kind of a flavor and a really

129
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,509
funky aroma going on I've been working

130
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:25,670
for a little while with the blueberry

131
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:27,680
cookies and I have only seen impressive

132
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,140
results I've ran the blueberry cookies

133
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,389
in commercial environments I've grown it

134
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:32,810
in my personal grow I have seen it grown

135
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:34,729
in

136
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,918
there grows by growers who are not as

137
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,740
experienced by myself and it always does

138
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:42,168
a great job the blueberry cookies was

139
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:44,509
one of my favorite strains to smell to

140
00:05:42,168 --> 00:05:46,969
grow to smoke to work with I quickly

141
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:50,899
fell in love with that I had to cross it

142
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:53,000
to my prized arise King Solomon mail so

143
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:55,370
I did that I pollinated the blueberry

144
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,100
cookies with my arise mail and the

145
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,980
offspring are impressive

146
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:02,840
I could tell early on in the veg phase

147
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,689
that these plants were going to be

148
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,339
impressive they had amazing growth their

149
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:10,189
structure was beautiful they were

150
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:13,429
perfectly shaped and early in veg I

151
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:15,589
could smell a blueberry sort of a

152
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:17,120
rubbery tennis ball sort of a burnt

153
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:19,728
muffin sort of a thing coming off of

154
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,439
these plants in their veg faith so I was

155
00:06:19,728 --> 00:06:22,939
super excited to get these plants into

156
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,389
flower and when they went into flower

157
00:06:22,939 --> 00:06:27,829
the aroma is only intensified these

158
00:06:26,389 --> 00:06:29,930
plants took off when I put them in

159
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:31,219
flower they did get kind of tall kind of

160
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,750
quickly but we're gonna talk about the

161
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,039
growing and stuff in a minute let's talk

162
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,728
about the aromas and smoking this plant

163
00:06:36,038 --> 00:06:41,629
while it was growing

164
00:06:37,728 --> 00:06:44,360
it smelled like blueberries and almost

165
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:45,949
like hot chocolate or really dark

166
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,840
chocolate which is where it got the

167
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:50,180
truffle name from the blue raspberry

168
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,469
truffle it's got that blueberries with

169
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,449
something sour which is where the

170
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,160
raspberry comes in and then that dark

171
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,689
chocolate was kind of truffle II blue

172
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,270
raspberry truffles was what I thought of

173
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,689
the first time it got real real musty in

174
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:04,879
the grow room so it's kind of got a sort

175
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:07,550
of a blue skittles or a pack of nerds

176
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,050
and dark chocolate and blueberries is

177
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,220
really dominant in there so that is

178
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:13,100
where I got the name is the blue

179
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:16,310
raspberry truffles as it got older in

180
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:19,789
flower the truffle II smell that chem

181
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:21,978
dog OG Kush Joseph OG really came out in

182
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:24,709
it it started off sweeter and more candy

183
00:07:21,978 --> 00:07:27,019
like most of the phenotypes got a little

184
00:07:24,709 --> 00:07:29,089
bit more of the truffle flavor toward

185
00:07:27,019 --> 00:07:31,219
the end some of the plants honestly I

186
00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:33,469
let go too long I should have cut some

187
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:35,360
of them down a little bit earlier I feel

188
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:37,610
like there is a nice window with some of

189
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,009
the phenotypes where it will change from

190
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:42,919
that blueberry thing sort of over to a

191
00:07:40,009 --> 00:07:44,899
musty er more of the truffle II it's got

192
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,430
a foot kind of a thing going on if you

193
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:48,438
let it kind of transfer

194
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:50,180
into that phase at the end if you let it

195
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:51,830
go a little bit too long we're gonna

196
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,278
talk about those phenotypes here in just

197
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:54,949
a minute

198
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:57,468
so as the grow went on many of the

199
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:58,728
phenotypes got a little bit musty ER is

200
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:00,110
the word that I like to use for it a

201
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:02,240
little more truffle II a little more

202
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,740
dark chocolatey a little earthy is kind

203
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,509
of the flavor and aroma I think I should

204
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,699
be saying as earthy they got a little

205
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:09,860
more earthy but when I cut them down it

206
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,158
kind of seemed like I just broke open

207
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:15,499
the blueberry Terp jar it was just

208
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:18,288
blueberries and raspberries and kind of

209
00:08:15,499 --> 00:08:20,569
a skinny flavor just filled the room it

210
00:08:18,288 --> 00:08:23,058
was crazy that it produced that much of

211
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:25,399
a different aroma I thought it was very

212
00:08:23,059 --> 00:08:27,469
interesting so as it grew it started off

213
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:29,778
with the real blueberry raspberry sort

214
00:08:27,468 --> 00:08:32,179
of a thing as it got older many of the

215
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:34,370
phenotypes shifted to sort of an earthy

216
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:36,799
truffle kind of a flavor some of them

217
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,240
did maintain their blueberry thing we're

218
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,189
gonna talk about the phenotypes and the

219
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,399
the division of that just a minute here

220
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,790
but when I cut it down it exploded with

221
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,559
blue raspberry nerds and remember those

222
00:08:46,789 --> 00:08:49,849
blue lollipops we used to get back in

223
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,309
the day that would turn your whole face

224
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,560
blue it kind of reminded me of that the

225
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:56,929
flavor and aroma was very reminiscent of

226
00:08:54,559 --> 00:09:00,138
that blue raspberry lollipop and a

227
00:08:56,929 --> 00:09:03,049
package of nerds so I cut it down I

228
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,480
dried it i cured it as I cured it I

229
00:09:03,049 --> 00:09:07,490
noticed that that musty smell kind of

230
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,649
got lighter and as it lightened it

231
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,839
balanced out the blueberries and the

232
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:13,519
earthy smell really nicely I think it

233
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,040
really balanced them out very well

234
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,839
toward the words blue raspberry truffle

235
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,578
just made more sense as time went on

236
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,470
when I started smelling it I was like

237
00:09:19,578 --> 00:09:23,448
that's blue raspberry truffles and as

238
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,550
time went on it just proved itself that

239
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:27,588
that name was perfect for it so I really

240
00:09:25,549 --> 00:09:29,958
think that it smells and tastes like a

241
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:32,180
blue raspberry truffle so I dried it i

242
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:34,549
cured it then what's next I got to smoke

243
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:37,068
it first before we get there let me say

244
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:39,019
this stuff destroys a grinder your

245
00:09:37,068 --> 00:09:41,269
grinder will be sticky your fingers will

246
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:43,940
be super sticky this is some extremely

247
00:09:41,269 --> 00:09:45,889
resinous and sticky herb so when I

248
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,990
smoked it I tried to roll a joint and it

249
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:50,060
got really sticky maybe I needed to let

250
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:52,818
it dry a little longer but it was really

251
00:09:50,059 --> 00:09:55,099
sticky but it tasted amazing I had to

252
00:09:52,818 --> 00:09:57,019
try again and put it in a bowl the bowl

253
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:58,939
tasted even better

254
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:59,840
it had that blueberry thing come out

255
00:09:58,938 --> 00:10:02,059
right away

256
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:04,580
as soon as you hit it it was like ooh

257
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:06,679
that is blueberry skittles or blueberry

258
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,800
nerds or something really blueberry like

259
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:12,649
a blueberry muffin not the not like the

260
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:14,120
real blueberries it smells like fake

261
00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,919
blueberries like if there were a

262
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,929
blueberry air freshener that's what it

263
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,879
would be don't think it's fresh fruity

264
00:10:17,929 --> 00:10:22,309
blueberries this smells like straight-up

265
00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:24,649
fake blueberries and candy like if they

266
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:26,029
had blueberry candy Terps at the candy

267
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:28,519
store that's what it would be like it is

268
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:31,519
not like a fruit blueberry it is like a

269
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:34,759
very powerful almost a sour blueberry

270
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,379
candy and it is delicious but as soon as

271
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,029
that green ball started to burn that

272
00:10:36,379 --> 00:10:39,409
blueberry aroma hit the room it was like

273
00:10:38,029 --> 00:10:41,000
you cracked open a blueberry air

274
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:42,559
freshener and then it was like ooh

275
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,960
that's delicious but then on the exhale

276
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,729
that's where that warm cushy flavor

277
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,470
comes through so it filled the room with

278
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,930
sweet blueberries and then right after

279
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,500
cushion truffles so that was pretty nice

280
00:10:50,929 --> 00:10:57,799
it gave me intense cottonmouth

281
00:10:53,500 --> 00:11:00,259
immediately it was I never drink but it

282
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:02,809
tasted so good that I did not want to

283
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:04,730
drink anything to wash away that complex

284
00:11:02,809 --> 00:11:08,839
flavor it's really neat when you've got

285
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:10,129
you go blueberry ooh and chocolate your

286
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,720
brain has to figure that out you're

287
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:14,389
going oh how did I get such a range of

288
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,550
flavors I really enjoy that wide range

289
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,319
of flavors it was very reminiscent of

290
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:21,079
some of the old blueberry strains I've

291
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,180
smoked back in the day also very similar

292
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,730
to the blueberry cookies mom that it

293
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:27,679
came from but also that arise it took

294
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:30,590
that Kim D flavor and it really put the

295
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:32,389
tennis balls of the Kim D that chocolate

296
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:34,430
flavor that Kim D sometimes has it

297
00:11:32,389 --> 00:11:37,340
really brought that out into this cross

298
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:38,449
so the cottonmouth happens instantly the

299
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:41,060
hi is crazy

300
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,830
the head-high comes on super quickly

301
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:45,709
when you hit it you're like oh I'm high

302
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,900
now and I smoke a lot of dabs so to

303
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,639
notice a bowl or a joint of flour come

304
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:51,709
on that quickly that means that it is

305
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,840
potent so that the head buzz comes on

306
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:55,490
quickly it went to my eyes it kind of

307
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,350
went behind my eyes it made my eyes feel

308
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:59,690
heavy but not like droopy like they were

309
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:01,519
being pushed on I kind of kind of

310
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:04,520
intense I was high I was really high

311
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,029
then it kind of slowly drifts over my

312
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:06,860
body

313
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:08,449
I could feel it it went from my brain

314
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,740
and then it was like oh I'm really high

315
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,259
I'm really high and then I felt it like

316
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:13,370
kind of radiates down my spine across my

317
00:12:12,259 --> 00:12:14,809
shoulders down

318
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,789
arms and then worked its way all the way

319
00:12:14,809 --> 00:12:17,959
down my back to my hips and my knees and

320
00:12:16,789 --> 00:12:19,939
my shoulders are kind of where a lot of

321
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,410
my my pain and stress are I keep my

322
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,760
attention and my shoulders into my gut

323
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:24,588
and then my knees are distressed because

324
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,539
I'm old so it gets to the knees and it

325
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:28,370
relaxes them and my whole body just

326
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:29,360
feels like it's in a cozy blanket I

327
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,889
described it the other day is a

328
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,180
superhero cape because it just made me

329
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:33,740
feel good I was like I want to get up

330
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:35,479
and do some [ __ ] and somebody's like

331
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,339
what do you want to do is like [ __ ] I

332
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,659
don't really know I just want to get up

333
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,339
and do some [ __ ] I didn't really have

334
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:41,838
any goals or anything but I felt like I

335
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,940
should be doing something damn it

336
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,529
but I love it it comes on super quickly

337
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,630
it spreads throughout your body it makes

338
00:12:45,528 --> 00:12:49,490
you feel all warm and tingly is a really

339
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:51,230
great feeling if you've got some pain

340
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:54,379
I'm sure that this one would be great

341
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:57,080
for your pain so that is a basic smoke

342
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:59,480
report it tastes amazing the smoke was

343
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,070
great my first sample I did not let dry

344
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,930
long enough but once I let it dry and

345
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:05,510
cure properly it really had a great

346
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:07,969
amazing flavor and it burned beautifully

347
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:10,700
so now let's talk a little bit about the

348
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,800
growing aspect of our blue raspberry

349
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:15,740
truffle most of the time the first

350
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:18,349
question people ask is how long does it

351
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,970
take I would recommend nine weeks maybe

352
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,670
a little longer but you probably don't

353
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,920
need to go past ten weeks maybe 72 days

354
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:26,599
at the absolute longest I don't think it

355
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:29,120
would take any longer than that I've

356
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:31,610
gone 72 days honestly some of the

357
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,549
phenotypes had gone too long at that

358
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:38,209
point growth structure she gets a little

359
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:40,519
bit tall but she makes huge colas if

360
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:42,169
you've seen pictures of a rise if you've

361
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,730
seen pictures of the blueberry cookies

362
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:46,610
you know that both of those plants make

363
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,259
monstera stop colas these plants will

364
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:50,629
get tall on you quickly but it is worth

365
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:53,299
it because they put out quite a bit of

366
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:55,879
weight you will have big fat chunky

367
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:57,169
colas that are covered in tri cups if

368
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:59,208
you've seen photos of the blueberry

369
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:01,250
cookies if you've seen photos of any of

370
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:04,039
the arize crosses all of them are coated

371
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,708
in trichomes this one is just like that

372
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:08,899
it will put on a layer of crusty

373
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:11,389
trichomes so you'll have giant colas

374
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:13,850
these plants grow with what I call hyper

375
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:16,250
vigor I have had a few people tell me

376
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:18,740
that plants crossed with the rise grow

377
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:21,350
too quickly for them and they need to

378
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:24,169
reduce their veg time by at least one

379
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:27,089
full week so be prepared for fast

380
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:30,149
growing hyper vigorous tall plants the

381
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:32,160
we'll take off on you now they do like

382
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:33,720
to be topped and spread out if you were

383
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,719
the type of person that tops your plants

384
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,329
you can top these they will make a giant

385
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,009
glory Cola at the top if you do not top

386
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:42,958
them if you choose to top them you're

387
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:44,850
going to get nice branching that's going

388
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,919
to spread out very far you'll have a

389
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,689
nice full canopy these plants can take

390
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:50,128
some abuse they like to be cracked they

391
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,318
like to be popped they like to be

392
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:53,999
twisted these plants like to get worked

393
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:56,068
into a trellis if you've got a net or

394
00:14:53,999 --> 00:14:58,589
something like that I highly recommend a

395
00:14:56,068 --> 00:15:01,438
trellis system if not you're going to

396
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:02,879
need some sticks some stakes some cages

397
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:05,129
or something to keep some of these

398
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,620
taller bigger buds up when they get big

399
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:09,749
they may get a little bit floppy I

400
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,519
recommend you top them and spread them

401
00:15:09,749 --> 00:15:13,079
out I like to spread out my plants kind

402
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,959
of far these are gonna get a little bit

403
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:18,328
bushy on you when you top them blue

404
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,609
raspberry truffles can take a [ __ ] ton

405
00:15:18,328 --> 00:15:23,008
of nutrients in my experience of course

406
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:25,800
I have only grown this plant in soilless

407
00:15:23,009 --> 00:15:27,568
mix and cocoa I've tried to feed it too

408
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,758
hard I gave it a little bit too much

409
00:15:27,568 --> 00:15:32,338
shine it didn't react too poorly to me

410
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,110
it can take a beating I really like to

411
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,399
push my plants and I really like to see

412
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,889
what they can take and the blue

413
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,749
raspberry truffle can really take a lot

414
00:15:37,889 --> 00:15:42,058
of nutrients I've grown it in the cocoa

415
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:45,269
I've grown it in the soil and it can

416
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:47,490
really take abuse in both of those blue

417
00:15:45,269 --> 00:15:49,769
raspberry truffle will react a little

418
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:51,509
bit poorly if she gets too hot you'll

419
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:53,549
get taco leaves and it will stunt her

420
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:56,188
growth and she will get extra stretchy

421
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:57,748
she's already a stretchy plant if you

422
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,428
get her too hot she will start

423
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,079
stretching on you she wants to get away

424
00:15:59,428 --> 00:16:03,120
from herself and away from the other

425
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:05,039
plants she wants to stretch out and find

426
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,289
some fresh air she will get growing when

427
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,789
she gets too hot she also does that if

428
00:16:07,289 --> 00:16:11,129
you cram her in with too many other

429
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:12,870
plants she wants to be up high so she

430
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,999
will grow give her space

431
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:17,220
topper maybe give her a trellis to hold

432
00:16:14,999 --> 00:16:19,319
her down but if it gets too hot you'll

433
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,089
get taco leaves you'll get massively

434
00:16:19,318 --> 00:16:23,428
slowed production from this plant so

435
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:24,899
don't get it too hot and I'm sure at

436
00:16:23,428 --> 00:16:27,088
that point somebody's going to say what

437
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,438
is too hot there are so many variables

438
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:30,809
to think about when you ask that

439
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:32,909
question which phenotype are you working

440
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:34,769
with what is the rest of your VPD

441
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,958
looking like in the room it may be able

442
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:38,850
to take more heat if you've got co2 I'm

443
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,048
not exactly sure what to tell you on

444
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,649
what is too hot

445
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:42,809
some of

446
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:44,370
we'll react poorly to too much heat so

447
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:46,019
keep an eye out for heat stress the

448
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,879
first thing you're going to see is those

449
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:49,199
leaves at the top they'll start pointing

450
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:50,820
straight up at the light and then they

451
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,320
will start talking it looks like they're

452
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,940
praying that is not what's happening

453
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,070
that plant is telling you I'm a little

454
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,990
bit too hot please raise the light or

455
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,840
please taught me or please Bend me down

456
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:03,090
so I'm not getting a sunburn so that is

457
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,430
the basic grow breakdown of the blue

458
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,559
raspberry truffles nine to ten weeks ten

459
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,720
weeks should be plenty I found that she

460
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:11,849
can take a lot of nutrients I haven't

461
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,920
burned this plant and I have tried so

462
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:16,289
she can take a lot of nutrients I would

463
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,390
suggest giving it a lot with this plant

464
00:17:16,289 --> 00:17:21,029
you were more likely to under feed than

465
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,980
you are to overfeed make sure you give

466
00:17:21,029 --> 00:17:24,420
her lots of space spread her out and

467
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,430
make sure she doesn't get too hot

468
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:29,279
because that is the one thing she really

469
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:31,170
does not like I have seen a lot of

470
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,480
beautiful colors come from the blue

471
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,730
raspberry truffle a lot of dark colors a

472
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:37,769
lot of dark purples a lot of gold and

473
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:40,049
amber colors for the end of flower she

474
00:17:37,769 --> 00:17:41,940
really makes gorgeous colors I really

475
00:17:40,049 --> 00:17:44,369
like to drop the temperatures late in

476
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,990
flower in my grow room and for the last

477
00:17:44,369 --> 00:17:46,679
few days I will really bring out the

478
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:49,319
cold

479
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:51,390
I really saw a lot of color changing

480
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,069
when the room got colder also I did

481
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,710
throw a couple of plants in the dark for

482
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:57,539
24 hours and they turned gold and purple

483
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,400
on me so it will give you a lot of

484
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,470
beautiful colors get the temperatures

485
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,150
down low toward the end of flower and I

486
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,339
really think you will see the beauty

487
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,230
come out of this plant it is powdery

488
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:09,149
mildew resistant I haven't seen powdery

489
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:12,029
mildew on the blue raspberry truffle yet

490
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:15,690
so that is a bonus another bonus is this

491
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:17,730
plant loves to make resin there is a lot

492
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,470
of resin on the blue raspberry truffles

493
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,120
you will see phenotypes then it looks

494
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:23,870
like the trichomes are fighting for

495
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:26,519
space so let's move into talking about

496
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:29,909
phenotypes of blue raspberry truffles

497
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:32,250
this is a really stable hybrid in my

498
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,710
opinion some of the phenotypes are blue

499
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:37,289
berry cookies dominant their very

500
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,210
skittles II and I say skittles II they

501
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:41,909
smell like a bag of skittles more like a

502
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,130
bag of blue raspberry candies or

503
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,080
possibly those blue nerds if heat blue

504
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:48,060
nerds candies that's kind of what it

505
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,639
smells like to me it's kind of sweet and

506
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:53,039
sour and blueberry and delicious and it

507
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,300
is so wonderful so you will have some

508
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,700
phenotypes that are blueberry

509
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:59,369
cookies dominant and you will also have

510
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,080
some arise dominant phenotypes if you've

511
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:03,719
got more of a lemon more of a citrus

512
00:19:01,079 --> 00:19:06,539
type of a thing that is very arise

513
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:08,970
golden goat dominant now since the

514
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:10,920
parent plants are very similar it's

515
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:12,539
going to be kind of hard to tell the

516
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,420
difference between maybe a blueberry

517
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:18,299
cookies dominant phenotype and in a rise

518
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,610
dominant phenotype both of those plants

519
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,619
have a similar structure a similar leaf

520
00:19:20,609 --> 00:19:24,929
shape and size they're very different

521
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:26,339
but they are very similar to a new

522
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,110
grower they've both got long skinny

523
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:30,000
pointy leaves they both grow tall they

524
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:31,589
both grow kind of branchy

525
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,690
they both branch out they both have

526
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:35,819
hyper vigor so the main thing you're

527
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:37,980
going to notice is the aroma the aroma

528
00:19:35,819 --> 00:19:39,990
is really going to be what stands out

529
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,940
the most now yes you are going to see

530
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:43,440
phenotypes that will show you golden

531
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,080
goat you'll see phenotypes that will

532
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,970
show you the Daybreaker the cross on the

533
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:49,740
blueberry cookies is the blueberry tahoe

534
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,809
and platinum cookies so you're going to

535
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:53,700
see blueberry you're going to see tahoe

536
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,980
OG and you're going to see platinum

537
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,630
cookies come out a little bit because

538
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,819
you're going to find recessive traits

539
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,830
from the grandparents for the most part

540
00:19:59,819 --> 00:20:04,439
these plants are going to look like a

541
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:06,539
rise that smells a lot like blueberry

542
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,210
cookies so you're going to find

543
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,009
blueberry cookies dominant phenotypes

544
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:13,769
then you are going to find a rise

545
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:17,099
dominant phenotypes then in the mix we

546
00:20:13,769 --> 00:20:18,960
are going to find 50/50 phenotypes let's

547
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:21,179
talk about that the arize phenotypes are

548
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,940
going to be a little airier a little

549
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,490
fluffier just a little more loose also

550
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,100
you may find that the arise dominant

551
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:31,440
phenotypes will have a tropical citrus

552
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:34,019
sort of a thing you may also notice that

553
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,150
the arise dominant phenotypes are a

554
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:38,730
little bit stretchier and I believe that

555
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:41,009
that comes from the Joseph og side of

556
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:43,110
things now the blueberry cookies

557
00:20:41,009 --> 00:20:45,269
dominant phenotype seems to stay a

558
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,829
little shorter and the node spacing

559
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:49,289
seems to stay a little bit tighter

560
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:52,409
you'll also see a little bit larger leaf

561
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:54,389
from the blueberry cookies dominant

562
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,610
phenotype I think that comes from the

563
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:59,610
Platinum cookie side of things also the

564
00:20:56,609 --> 00:21:01,740
Tahoe og has fairly large leaves so

565
00:20:59,609 --> 00:21:02,250
there is one phenotype that is really

566
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:04,200
tight

567
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,819
really sharp looking buds it's got

568
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,769
little wider leaves toward the bottom

569
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:08,129
they get thinner leave toward the top it

570
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:09,930
kinda

571
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:11,700
gets a nice uh menorah shape toward the

572
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:14,250
bottom and it's got one glory Cola that

573
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,289
grows out of it it's got a blueberry

574
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:18,390
skittle sort of a smell to it that is

575
00:21:16,289 --> 00:21:20,789
the blueberry cookies dominant phenotype

576
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:22,950
then there is another phenotype that is

577
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:24,389
very similar without a comparison it is

578
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:26,670
hard to tell the difference it is also

579
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:28,470
tall it's got a big glory bud but that

580
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,570
bottom branching will be a little bit

581
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:33,569
stretchier it'll be a little bit further

582
00:21:30,569 --> 00:21:35,579
apart in node spacing it won't have the

583
00:21:33,569 --> 00:21:38,069
blueberry skittles flavor it will have

584
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:40,379
more of a tropical sweet flavor along

585
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:41,879
with that earthy flavor as a dominant

586
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:44,160
sort of a thing so that is the golden

587
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,830
goat dominant phenotype then we've got

588
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,509
the 50/50 the 50/50 is the one that

589
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:50,009
smells like blueberries and dark

590
00:21:48,509 --> 00:21:52,829
chocolate it is the blue raspberry

591
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:54,869
truffle scented phenotype I really enjoy

592
00:21:52,829 --> 00:21:56,460
that one the lower leaves are a little

593
00:21:54,869 --> 00:21:58,289
broader as it gets taller it gets the

594
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,840
thinner leaves the leaves get real long

595
00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:02,789
and skinny toward the top my favourite

596
00:22:00,839 --> 00:22:04,799
phenotype of the blue raspberry truffle

597
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:06,359
is the one with the shorter pea deals if

598
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,889
the leaves are closer to the plant the

599
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:09,719
bigger Sun leaves if they're closer to

600
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,790
the plant that is one of my favorite

601
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:13,559
phenotypes and the further out those

602
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,389
beetles get the more I feel like you're

603
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,099
getting that golden goat trait so I

604
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,170
think we're getting more of the 50/50

605
00:22:17,099 --> 00:22:20,849
more of the desirable one when we get in

606
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,220
a little bit some of the leaves will

607
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:26,219
hang down I've noticed more of the

608
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:28,380
chocolate flavor comes from the plants

609
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,819
with the leaves that droop you'll see

610
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,320
some that have droopy leaves that

611
00:22:29,819 --> 00:22:33,000
doesn't mean the plant is thirsty that

612
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:35,159
does not mean the plant is over watered

613
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,960
that comes from Daybreaker that is a

614
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,240
trait of the day breaker mail which I

615
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,190
used that doesn't pop up a lot but it

616
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,349
comes out in this cross so if you see

617
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:45,900
the leaves drooping that has potential

618
00:22:43,349 --> 00:22:48,000
of being a very chocolate maybe a tennis

619
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,310
ball maybe a rubbery sort of a smelling

620
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,170
phenotype so we've got that blueberry

621
00:22:50,309 --> 00:22:54,059
cookies dominant the real jagged the

622
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,920
real sharp looking one we've got the

623
00:22:54,059 --> 00:22:57,629
arize dominant phenotype the one that

624
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,610
opens up a little bit it's not super

625
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:01,320
tight it's not super fluffy either it

626
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:03,029
just has more air space than that

627
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:05,189
blueberry cookies dominant phenotype

628
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,500
it's got more of a tropical smell longer

629
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,809
P deals that is the golden goat dominant

630
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,970
phenotype we've got the 50/50 it is that

631
00:23:09,809 --> 00:23:14,099
beautifully balanced mix nice tight buds

632
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,990
that blue raspberry truffles sort of

633
00:23:14,099 --> 00:23:17,669
aroma it's got the blueberry skittles

634
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:19,589
it's got the chocolate kind of

635
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,538
background going on to it that is the

636
00:23:19,589 --> 00:23:24,148
desirable sought-after phenotype

637
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:27,179
my opinion then there's a phenotype that

638
00:23:24,148 --> 00:23:29,579
I have dubbed the weirdo this one may be

639
00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:31,830
great for concentrates this one is a

640
00:23:29,579 --> 00:23:34,408
little bit Airy it is kind of a

641
00:23:31,829 --> 00:23:36,599
blueberry golden coat but it kind of

642
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:39,629
gets a little bit fluffy I suspect it is

643
00:23:36,599 --> 00:23:41,398
probably a blueberry Hawaiian sativa is

644
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:43,648
kind of what we've got going on or

645
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:45,358
perhaps maybe like a blueberry Hawaiian

646
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:47,339
sativa is what kind of came out of that

647
00:23:45,358 --> 00:23:49,589
because it gets tall and it gets a

648
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:51,569
little bit fluffy it doesn't tighten up

649
00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:53,249
it's quite airy I think it would make

650
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:55,950
great concentrates because it tastes

651
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:57,749
very very blueberry dominant it brings

652
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:59,788
out a really sweet blueberry sort of a

653
00:23:57,749 --> 00:24:01,858
thing and it's just covered in trichomes

654
00:23:59,788 --> 00:24:03,419
but it is not desirable for bag appeal

655
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:05,009
it wouldn't work good on the market

656
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:06,509
nobody would want to buy it didn't want

657
00:24:05,009 --> 00:24:07,739
to smoke it a few times but once they

658
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:10,348
saw but it looks like it would change

659
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:12,778
their opinion so that is the one weirdo

660
00:24:10,348 --> 00:24:14,519
phenotype from what I have experienced

661
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:17,038
I've grown a lot of these seeds from

662
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,839
what I have experienced I see the

663
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,419
blueberry cookies dominant phenotype

664
00:24:18,839 --> 00:24:23,699
approximately 30 percent I get the arize

665
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,919
dominant approximately 30 percent

666
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,319
I get that fifty 50 percent that

667
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,809
beautiful the one I'm after comes up

668
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,608
about 30 percent of the time then that

669
00:24:30,808 --> 00:24:34,618
[ __ ] weirdo plant that pops up

670
00:24:32,608 --> 00:24:36,358
somewhere between five and fifteen

671
00:24:34,618 --> 00:24:37,709
percent just for math sake at this time

672
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:40,079
we're gonna say it comes up at 10

673
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:43,108
percent you may see that weirdo in there

674
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,608
that weirdo is easy to identify early in

675
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:47,128
flower because it just takes off

676
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:48,509
immediately it makes little tiny sparse

677
00:24:47,128 --> 00:24:50,128
bud sites right at the very beginning

678
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:51,720
you can tell everything else is starting

679
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:53,488
to make in my opinion it looks like

680
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,319
dandelions this one doesn't make the

681
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:57,269
dandelions it just gets little tiny tiny

682
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:59,278
bud sets you can see it is it wants to

683
00:24:57,269 --> 00:25:01,079
build calyxes on calyx is kind of kind

684
00:24:59,278 --> 00:25:02,788
of like the old doctor doctor Grinspoon

685
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,069
used to do and just be real galaxies but

686
00:25:02,788 --> 00:25:06,778
it also fluffs out like like a diesel

687
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:09,450
plant doesn't that probably comes from

688
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:10,829
the chem D somewhere along the line so

689
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:13,200
those are the phenotypes are gonna look

690
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:15,538
for that is how it grows that's how it

691
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,690
smokes that's what the buzz is like that

692
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:20,819
is my breeder breakdown on my new blue

693
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:22,229
raspberry truffle if you were into

694
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:24,239
unique aroma as if you're into

695
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,619
blueberries if you're into fruitiness if

696
00:25:24,239 --> 00:25:26,909
you're into skittles if you're into

697
00:25:25,618 --> 00:25:29,339
earthiness there are a lot of

698
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:31,230
opportunities for great phenotypes in a

699
00:25:29,339 --> 00:25:33,298
pack of blue raspberry truffles they'll

700
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,009
be available at the dude Gro show on
