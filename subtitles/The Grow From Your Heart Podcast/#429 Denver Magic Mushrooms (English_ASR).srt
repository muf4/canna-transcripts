13
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,170
the show we'll get into that here in

14

Oregon elite seeds you can find them at

19
00:00:34,488 --> 00:00:43,919
www.haddadsubaru.com by talking about

20
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,780
what we are dabbing we have been dabbing

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,879
some of this buffet over here from our

22
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:49,950
friends and apothecary farms no buffet

23
00:00:47,878 --> 00:00:52,320
is not a strain I've got a buffet of

24
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,930
concentrates on the table here we just

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,600
recently our most recent dab was Malibu

26
00:00:54,929 --> 00:01:00,780
pier cush hambrosia mixed with Malibu

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,480
pure Kush full spectrum extract one of

28
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,760
these labels says 82.1% total

29
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,709
cannabinoids the other one says

30
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,900
ninety-eight percent total cannabinoids

31
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:11,459
that's why Mike looks pale red bells

32
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,170
ring yeah that's why mike is nice and

33
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,728
quiet it's why Mike coughed for about 20

34
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:16,320
minutes over there that was the heat of

35
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:18,359
the new okay yeah well we're doing these

36
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,699
insert dabs now and you went in like for

37
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:22,560
good news like the insert dab helps with

38
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,680
the temp control which was a lot easier

39
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,868
on my lung so I shot out to the insert

40
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,310
tab I think it may have backfired on you

41
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:30,810
I think you thought you were gonna go in

42
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,189
and take that third and fourth pull cuz

43
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:35,250
it was nice and cool and on that fourth

44
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:37,019
one I saw you do that all god-realized I

45
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,328
just got too close to the Sun over here

46
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:41,969
it's all right you're back welcome to

47
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:43,859
the show the sweats have subsided man

48
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,269
I'm ready to roll I know people hate

49
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,950
talking about the weather but it just

50
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:48,629
switched from like I need a hoodie and

51
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,100
some pants too bro we need some shorts

52
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:51,569
and flip-flops out here real quick

53
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:54,298
around here in Colorado you know

54
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:57,000
Colorado they say don't plant until

55
00:01:54,299 --> 00:02:00,090
after Mother's Day and this year that

56
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,590
rule proven super true yeah we got snow

57
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,210
like two days before and then it was

58
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:04,649
super warm on Mother's Day it has been

59
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:06,179
every type of weather you could imagine

60
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,890
this month I was just [ __ ] gorgeous

61
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,959
yeah it was super high it was hot today

62
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,370
but now it is gorgeous this evening what

63
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,340
I was saying is it is time to start

64
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,259
getting the air conditioners

65
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,450
and the winter time equipment prepared

66
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,709
if you haven't done so already I changed

67
00:02:17,449 --> 00:02:20,139
the filters and the air conditioners

68
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:23,300
maybe it's time to upgrade some of your

69
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:25,699
blowers and exhaust fans fans in the

70
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,280
room don't create cool air fans in the

71
00:02:25,699 --> 00:02:29,628
room move around heat and humidity they

72
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,250
don't cool anything off so you got to

73
00:02:29,628 --> 00:02:32,449
get some cooling in there it's time for

74
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:33,769
that sort of stuff in the grow if you

75
00:02:32,449 --> 00:02:35,119
haven't already thought about it it is

76
00:02:33,769 --> 00:02:36,439
time to think about it temperatures are

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,539
going to increase you're going to start

78
00:02:36,439 --> 00:02:40,719
slowing down productivity think about

79
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:43,128
cooling it at that time of the year

80
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,259
indeed all right usually at this point

81
00:02:43,128 --> 00:02:47,598

yes thank you thank you so at the start

115
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,870
of the show I said it was a special

116
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:52,400
episode usually we talk about cannabis

117
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:54,530
it's cannabis news education and

118
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,329
conversation sometimes I rant for a long

119
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,568
time about comedy and comedy shows and

120
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:01,159
other things like that but this time

121
00:03:58,568 --> 00:04:02,629
let's talk about some recent Colorado

122
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,829
news by now people know what the [ __ ]

123
00:04:02,629 --> 00:04:05,539
I'm talking about because I said recent

124
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,480
Colorado news we are going to talk about

125
00:04:05,539 --> 00:04:10,039
the fact that they keep saying this is

126
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:12,379
the first thing we should talk about the

127
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:14,509
news articles all keep saying magic

128
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,788
mushrooms magic mushrooms have been

129
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:18,918
decriminalized that's the second thing

130
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:20,060
we're gonna have to focus on in Denver

131
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:21,858
and that's another thing we need to

132
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,259
highlight so magic mushrooms have been

133
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:26,149
decriminalized in Denver psilocybin

134
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:27,019
mushrooms have been decriminalized in

135
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:28,549
Denver

136
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:29,899
I don't know if I like that all of the

137
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,579
articles are calling them magic

138
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:33,198
mushrooms there are psilocybin mushrooms

139
00:04:31,579 --> 00:04:34,728
but I was a little disappointed in that

140
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
it's a little bit unprofessional it's a

141
00:04:34,728 --> 00:04:39,079
little bit childish but when you're not

142
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,788
into the culture and when you're a news

143
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:43,098
article and a news writer and a news

144
00:04:40,788 --> 00:04:44,509
source I guess magic mushrooms is really

145
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:47,149
good catchphrase it looks good on paper

146
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,500
and it makes no confusion people don't

147
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:50,448
think what do they mean these kinds are

148
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:52,250
these kinds they know like it's magic

149
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:53,478
mushrooms so that's the first part that

150
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,399
gets attention is why are they calling

151
00:04:53,478 --> 00:04:57,589
it magic mushrooms but they have

152
00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:00,049
decriminalized magic mushrooms for

153
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:02,299
personal use they have not yet set

154
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,970
possession limits all that's still to

155
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,918
come okay the other thing I was gonna

156
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,409
say is other than magic mushrooms that's

157
00:05:06,918 --> 00:05:10,758
the first part that gets my attention

158
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,639
legal they have decriminalized these

159
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:14,569
mushrooms they are not illegal

160
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,970
decriminalized is way different than

161
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:18,439
legalized DUI do you want to give us a

162
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,110
good rant on that difference since

163
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:25,550
you're slowly guy the biggest

164
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:27,560
differences are decriminalized means and

165
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:30,168
in in this case it's spelled out in the

166
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,139
the Denver mushroom law that it's now a

167
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:37,218
low enforcement priority for a police

168
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:39,319
officer so for an example if you get

169
00:05:37,218 --> 00:05:41,718
caught jaywalking and the cop realizes

170
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:44,779
that you have a small bag of mushrooms

171
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:46,879
in your pocket the cop is instructed to

172
00:05:44,779 --> 00:05:49,218
care more about the jaywalking awesome

173
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:51,218
um and it is it's a huge step in the

174
00:05:49,218 --> 00:05:55,158
right direction but it's definitely not

175
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:56,779
legalization if you checked out the

176
00:05:55,158 --> 00:06:00,740
comment sections on any of the news

177
00:05:56,779 --> 00:06:01,758
stories 80% of the comments assumed that

178
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,168
there would be much from the

179
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,120
dispensaries popping up everywhere

180
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:06,439
that's something I was gonna touch on or

181
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,490
that we would have a big mushroom

182
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:12,680
tourism problem in Denver County because

183
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,990
people would come from the world over to

184
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:16,908
enjoy the world's first mushroom market

185
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,460
and none of that's coming to fruition

186
00:06:16,908 --> 00:06:20,718
with this law right this isn't

187
00:06:18,459 --> 00:06:22,788
legalization like we have done cannabis

188
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:26,569
this is decriminalization of personal

189
00:06:22,788 --> 00:06:29,360
use it's still illegal to possess or

190
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:32,689
have or grow on it but we're saddled

191
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,460
just Denver County now or just the city

192
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:38,060
of Denver rather that you're allowed to

193
00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:40,149
grow possess and consume personal

194
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,819
amounts in the privacy of your own home

195
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,709
have they decided who decides what is a

196
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:48,430
personal amount of mushrooms a City

197
00:06:44,709 --> 00:06:49,930
Council of Denver in different elected

198
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,310
officials in Denver are all gonna have

199
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:52,150
to hammer this out over the next six

200
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:55,540
months okay

201
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:58,179
this bill gets signed into law the 16th

202
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,800
of May so just I think today it'll be

203
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,600
today well it's midnight at this time so

204
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:04,449
it'll be Thursday if we want to be

205
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,040
technical yeah okay so let's let's

206
00:07:04,449 --> 00:07:08,319
rewind on a couple of things there it is

207
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,760
not legal it is decriminalized so if you

208
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,800
get caught if you were happen to be

209
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,240
walking in Denver you get caught you get

210
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,350
caught for jaywalking or whatever and

211
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,519
you've got some mushrooms you get pulled

212
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:17,110
over for speeding and you got your

213
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,038
mushrooms in your backpack as long as

214
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,410
they're in your backpack and you weren't

215
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:22,329
tripping ah it's not it's not a problem

216
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,210
to have your mushrooms now so you can

217
00:07:22,329 --> 00:07:27,909
have your mushrooms that's not illegal

218
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:30,099
small possession personal use they have

219
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:32,260
to find out they have to decide what we

220
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:34,389
consider personal possession now they

221
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:35,560
have to decide what we can cultivate now

222
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,930
that is going to be a fun process

223
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,649
watching Denver try to figure that's

224
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,949
always fun

225
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:43,779
boots it's gonna be interesting to see

226
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:48,610
how and where they come up with some of

227
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:50,619
the info for this the I'm guessing most

228
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:52,090
of this process will involve people that

229
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,500
were involved with putting this ballot

230
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:56,069
initiative together and passing it

231
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:00,160
directly wise Denver is the group's name

232
00:07:56,069 --> 00:08:01,629
I'm hoping they're involved in the laws

233
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,030
being crafted as they move forward

234
00:08:01,629 --> 00:08:06,490
because if we just let Denver City

235
00:08:04,029 --> 00:08:07,929
Council decide how how much is a

236
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,150
reasonable amount of mushrooms to grow

237
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,590
for personal use in your own home the

238
00:08:10,149 --> 00:08:13,299
number they come up with is gonna be

239
00:08:11,589 --> 00:08:15,129
insane one way or the other it'll be

240
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,780
really small they'd rather go away low

241
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:20,680
didn't help us out you're allowed like a

242
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:23,019
six inch by 6 inch plot of mushroom or

243
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:25,180
something you like it'll be silly if if

244
00:08:23,019 --> 00:08:26,859
they don't have stakeholder input so

245
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,538
we're not going to see mushroom

246
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,639
dispensaries that is not a thing it is

247
00:08:28,538 --> 00:08:32,559
decriminalized it is not legalized and

248
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,229
it is still illegal to sell that but you

249
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:37,119
can produce your own mushrooms you can

250
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:39,158
get legally in most states you can

251
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,979
acquire mushroom spores from the

252
00:08:39,158 --> 00:08:43,899
internet in Colorado that it's legal all

253
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,790
the news reports say that it's perfectly

254
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,139
legal to buy spores online in Colorado

255
00:08:45,789 --> 00:08:48,519
and have them shipped to your house so

256
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:50,230
you can get your spores you can get a

257
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:51,309
small set up it is really easy to do I'm

258
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:52,329
not going to teach you how to grow

259
00:08:51,309 --> 00:08:54,599
mushrooms there are plenty of people

260
00:08:52,328 --> 00:08:56,729
that have been doing that for

261
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,740
yes it is all over there so you can now

262
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:01,200
legally get your spores in Colorado in

263
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,480
Denver in Denver's thing I wanted to

264
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,430
touch on their magic mushrooms is a

265
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,659
weird word legal no they're not legal

266
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:08,129
they're decriminalized we're not gonna

267
00:09:06,659 --> 00:09:11,069
have dispensaries it's not gonna be like

268
00:09:08,129 --> 00:09:12,450
that Denver County is the only place

269
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:13,770
that this is illegal that is a small

270
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,589
section of Colorado

271
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:18,480
yeah so you can get your spores you can

272
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:20,310
produce your small personal amount of

273
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,959
mushrooms you can harvest them and you

274
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:24,149
can enjoy them you can possess them

275
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:27,479
let's talk about a few things that you

276
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:31,889
cannot do you cannot take your mushrooms

277
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:33,509
to Red Rocks legally venues and cop will

278
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:36,088
not all there are several good concert

279
00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:39,000
venues in Denver proper but most of the

280
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,080
big ones the arena the fish plays out

281
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,629
every year Dix

282
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,190
is not in Denver why do you specifically

283
00:09:42,629 --> 00:09:46,559
pick fish what are you trying to do bro

284
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:49,230
well no it's just all the big arenas Red

285
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,449
Rocks not in Denver Fiddler's Green not

286
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,730
in Denver it just leaves the little

287
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,940
venues what county is Fiddler's Green

288
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,860
there rapaho County rap oh okay oh man

289
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:01,140
so yeah it just it really makes a really

290
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,209
narrow section of Denver Denver County

291
00:10:01,139 --> 00:10:04,860
just the middle part there I'm not the

292
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:07,409
Hodgdon theater the Bluebird theater the

293
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,360
Arg the film are a good film or in

294
00:10:07,409 --> 00:10:11,819
Bluebird I think of the three in Denver

295
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:15,480
the Paramount it's on 16th Street there

296
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,528
yep Fillmore there's a handful there's

297
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,110
still be some good times to be had

298
00:10:16,528 --> 00:10:21,720
though plenty but you're not allowed to

299
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,149
consume in public public intoxication is

300
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,680
still a no-no now this is you just made

301
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,579
it take a perfect turn that I kind of

302
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,278
wanted to talk about

303
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,190
they've decriminalized something that

304
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,360
has never really been an issue before it

305
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,100
doesn't seem like there was a lot of

306
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,620
problems involving mushrooms of course

307
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:39,180
it does suck if if you've had too many

308
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,200
beers and he gets stopped for a cop

309
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:42,059
going hey you've had too many beers

310
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,800
let's talk to you and you're okay but

311
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:46,049
you have mushrooms in your pocket that

312
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:47,669
can [ __ ] things up but if you were

313
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:49,078
acting like an adult with almost

314
00:10:47,669 --> 00:10:51,269
anything in your pocket and you're not

315
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:53,549
doing anything stupid almost everything

316
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:55,708
is legal and or decriminalized if you

317
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:58,439
are a responsible adult with almost

318
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,879
everything well that's sort of how we do

319
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,010
it in the in the u.s. like you're

320
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,509
allowed to have anything that's legal or

321
00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:04,519
whatever until you do something stupid

322
00:11:03,509 --> 00:11:08,088
with it like

323
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:09,889
cars guns kids right so as long as

324
00:11:08,089 --> 00:11:11,839
nobody knows that you've eaten three or

325
00:11:09,889 --> 00:11:13,189
four grams or maybe just 0.2 is our

326
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,410
buddy Tennessee recommends

327
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,480
if nobody knows you've eaten a few grams

328
00:11:15,409 --> 00:11:18,860
of mushrooms and you were you were out

329
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,778
you should be just fine but don't go out

330
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:22,550
Koonin out acting like a weirdo because

331
00:11:20,778 --> 00:11:25,580
that is still not legal it is not legal

332
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,990
to go out [ __ ] bugging out staring

333
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:28,580
off into space watching the spiders

334
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:30,379
crawl up your buddy's arm that is

335
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,850
embarrassing and it's still illegal if

336
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:33,679
that's what you want to do man go for it

337
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:35,209
but one of the things in the reporting

338
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,870
around this that made me laugh is just

339
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:43,429
how few cases involve mushrooms in

340
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:46,070
Colorado anyway one report I saw said

341
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:48,379
three people in Denver County last year

342
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,640
were charged with a mushroom based

343
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,639
offense and they were all charged with

344
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,799
distribution which this law wouldn't

345
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,269
impact the distributions still a crime

346
00:11:54,799 --> 00:12:01,159
right if you've got that much and then

347
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:04,129
the report I just read before we hit

348
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:05,899
record said and it was a two or three

349
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:09,559
year span there'd only been 11 cases

350
00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:11,570
involving mushrooms oh wow and like that

351
00:12:09,559 --> 00:12:13,578
we have a major summer concert tour

352
00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:15,079
series through here if mushrooms were an

353
00:12:13,578 --> 00:12:16,939
issue we would have noticed in the

354
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:18,500
numbers before now we have a few

355
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,480
festivals that come here we have quite a

356
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,458
few very large concerts you're accurate

357
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,990
with that is there an age limit to the

358
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,809
mushrooms is it 18 or 21

359
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,089
it's just decriminalized for possession

360
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:31,609
I'm pretty sure it's at 18 oh that's

361
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:35,420
pretty cool but I'm not positive there

362
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:37,550
all right so I'm excited and curious to

363
00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:38,958
see where this goes I want to see the

364
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,969
cultivation limits because when

365
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,199
legalized cannabis became a thing I was

366
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:44,329
really curious about the cultivation

367
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,740
limits and the possession limits kind of

368
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:48,289
how it plays out I want to see how this

369
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:50,810
goes I'm really curious with all of the

370
00:12:48,289 --> 00:12:53,480
the trending of micro dosing that's

371
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:56,958
really going to have a large factor a

372
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:59,209
large role in how we allow and manage

373
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,528
the production and possession I think

374
00:12:59,208 --> 00:13:02,778
since everybody's micro dosing it's

375
00:13:00,528 --> 00:13:04,189
become so popular I think people need to

376
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:05,778
have it available if that's a medicine

377
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:08,329
that's working for them there definitely

378
00:13:05,778 --> 00:13:10,549
needs to be a legit like regulated

379
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:13,069
supply chain for sure yeah or you have

380
00:13:10,549 --> 00:13:17,299
to well there's a ton of research coming

381
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:20,570
out all over the Southwest in the

382
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:22,309
westcoast on psychedelics being used to

383
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:26,028
treat a plethora of different things

384
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:31,069
everything from like sleep problems to

385
00:13:26,028 --> 00:13:33,139
depression to grief and loss or as part

386
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,940
of the process when you've been

387
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:36,828
diagnosed with the terminal illness and

388
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,269
sort of coming to grips with that

389
00:13:36,828 --> 00:13:40,399
diagnosis being part of your life now

390
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:42,919
and the way forward there's been

391
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,679
research going on in this sector since

392
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:49,208
the 60s but it's all been super fringe

393
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:51,379
and now is sort of the golden age in

394
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:54,129
opening up research that we've been

395
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:56,509
blocking for the last 50 years right in

396
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:59,470
psychedelics and in mushrooms is the

397
00:13:56,509 --> 00:14:01,730
next frontier in that you're not a

398
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:03,500
psychedelic user you're a cannabis

399
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:05,028
consumer and a cannabis advocate but I

400
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,039
think that's as far as it goes with mind

401
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:10,189
expansion for you

402
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,750
how do you do you have an opinion on the

403
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:13,070
legalization of first off we'll talk

404
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,110
about mushrooms and then I'll ask about

405
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:18,110
other drugs this is a step in the right

406
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:20,419
direction if you ask me policy wise and

407
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:22,730
it's the conversations Denver City

408
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:25,569
Council is gonna have now we should have

409
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:27,170
had for all drugs a long time ago

410
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:28,310
prohibition doesn't work it doesn't

411
00:14:27,169 --> 00:14:31,219
matter what you're trying to prohibit

412
00:14:28,309 --> 00:14:36,078
its wild nuclear waste is regulated not

413
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:38,930
prohibited it these things exist in the

414
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:41,889
world we have to deal with them I can't

415
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:45,409
wish them away and you can't legislate

416
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:49,809
legislate morality none of these things

417
00:14:45,409 --> 00:14:52,789
work the if you go back even to like the

418
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:55,729
original creation of the idea of the

419
00:14:52,789 --> 00:14:57,740
police they're not it's not designed

420
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,170
they're not designed at all to protect

421
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:02,570
you from yourself that's not a function

422
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:05,179
they can serve they can protect you from

423
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,060
me but they can't protect you from you

424
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:10,789
that's not it's impossible it's like

425
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:12,979
asking a fat dude to fly by flapping his

426
00:15:10,789 --> 00:15:14,719
arms really fast like it's not something

427
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:16,940
that's physically possible asking to do

428
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,769
it is you being an [ __ ] and that's

429
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:21,470
what prohibition is it simply doesn't

430
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:23,899
work and it creates all sorts of

431
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:26,180
horrible things on its own right just by

432
00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:27,708
prohibition existing we have to deal

433
00:15:26,179 --> 00:15:29,509
with all kinds of horrid [ __ ] we

434
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,679
wouldn't have to deal with if we just

435
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:34,009
win another way with

436
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:37,250
all of this and anytime you look at a

437
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:39,230
list of drugs ranked by harm mushrooms

438
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,450
at the very bottom of the list which

439
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,909
always surprised me because they

440
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,649
emphasized in the drug education I

441
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:49,100
received in our public education system

442
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:52,039
that marijuana was sort of the entry

443
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,259
level soft drug in mushrooms were a big

444
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:56,838
scary step up from that where like you

445
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:59,929
could lose your mind and the the big

446
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,029
rumor when I was in school was everybody

447
00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:04,370
had a cousin who thought he was a glass

448
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:06,409
of orange juice and every time you heard

449
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,778
this story you would [ __ ] cringe but

450
00:16:06,409 --> 00:16:10,250
you heard it every three months from the

451
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:12,980
time you were eight till the time you

452
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,720
were out of college yeah it was just

453
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,730
[ __ ] nonce afraid to get tipped over

454
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,019
man I heard that story I already ate too

455
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:21,409
much acid though it was the story I

456
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:22,850
heard it it was basically any

457
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:24,679
psychedelic and it was always a

458
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:26,839
different one sometimes it was [ __ ]

459
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:29,958
acid sometimes it was LSD sometimes it

460
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:32,000
was mushrooms sometimes was peyote it

461
00:16:29,958 --> 00:16:34,039
was never really my thing so I just sort

462
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,330
of ignored it and I've got a couple of

463
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:37,099
funny stories about having to like

464
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,490
babysit a number of other people on

465
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:43,129
mushrooms when I was in college but I

466
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:46,339
always volunteered to participate is the

467
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:48,708
babysitter in those excursions because

468
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:50,510
mushrooms weren't my thing I was happy

469
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:52,338
to go sober that night and make sure all

470
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,990
my other friends had a fun time yeah

471
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,690
I've needed guys like you around

472
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,870
occasionally yep I've had I've I on the

473
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,330
other hand have had some mushroom aches

474
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,449
and I've had lots of friends all the way

475
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:07,279
through that that enjoyed mushrooms it's

476
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,009
just never my thing and I had a couple

477
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,750
people reach out to me online recently

478
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:13,400
as this boat came up just saying like

479
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,650
hey I know you from the podcast what do

480
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,269
you think about this and when I said

481
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:18,910
like mushrooms aren't my thing like I've

482
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:21,679
never I've never really had an interest

483
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:23,929
I've always kind of met with shock that

484
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,069
that's true and I'm a supporter and it's

485
00:17:23,929 --> 00:17:26,540
like it doesn't have anything to do with

486
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:28,940
the mushrooms or the fact that they're

487
00:17:26,539 --> 00:17:30,678
super safe for people I'm like if you

488
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:32,179
look at the harm caused by drug

489
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,530
consumption mushrooms don't make the

490
00:17:32,179 --> 00:17:35,150
list of things you need to worry about

491
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:36,049
you need to worry about more about what

492
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:38,540
you had for lunch today

493
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:40,609
yeah or the soda you're drinking they

494
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:42,859
don't give you from somebody who is ah

495
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:44,178
when I used to be on Phish tour and I've

496
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:44,449
seen a bunch of Grateful Dead shows you

497
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,679
could

498
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:47,389
by looking at me that I've got some

499
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,659
psychedelic experiences under my belt

500
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:53,538
you can't and from my opinion you can't

501
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:55,639
do mushrooms too many days in a row you

502
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:57,470
can't develop an addiction to that type

503
00:17:55,638 --> 00:17:59,928
of a thing because you can't you don't

504
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,210
get physically addicted it's just too

505
00:17:59,929 --> 00:18:03,440
it's too much of it's a brain workout

506
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,240
when you're done tripping on enough

507
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,409
mushrooms if you take a good dose I

508
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,759
don't know we're gonna talk in a minute

509
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:10,220
about the difference between a micro

510
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:12,109
dose and trip and if you take some

511
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,210
people it's three grams some people it's

512
00:18:12,109 --> 00:18:15,740
for guys like Tennessee and some other

513
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,329
folks tonight sees a friend of mine that

514
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,308
we'll meet later on in the podcast a lot

515
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:21,528
of people know who he is but if you're

516
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:23,329
taking a big heroic dose of of mushrooms

517
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:25,609
which makes you breakthrough is what we

518
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:27,949
call it your body and brain can't handle

519
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:29,028
that multiple multiple days in a row you

520
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,580
don't even want to do it there's no

521
00:18:29,028 --> 00:18:33,138
desire it's like it's like having

522
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:34,398
masturbated so many times like no I

523
00:18:33,138 --> 00:18:36,168
don't even want to do that again I'm

524
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:38,989
good that the last one was enough I'm

525
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:40,340
good for so many so long I'm cool that's

526
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,409
how a good mushroom trip is okay you

527
00:18:40,339 --> 00:18:44,509
want some more today like no dude I

528
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,970
exercise my brains so hard yesterday it

529
00:18:44,509 --> 00:18:48,230
just needs a little rest today and so I

530
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:50,210
don't think you can really develop that

531
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,490
type of an addiction you it's got to be

532
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:54,019
possible for somebody out there but it's

533
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:55,700
not the type of thing that most people

534
00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:57,440
are gonna get stuck on when you study

535
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:59,179
drugs and drug use that's one of the

536
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,070
things that comes up during psychedelics

537
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:03,500
is they're not addictive in the way that

538
00:19:01,069 --> 00:19:07,308
people think of its as drugs as being

539
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,898
addicted I'm not any sort of a scientist

540
00:19:07,308 --> 00:19:10,250
or doctor in that role but I think it's

541
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,558
just because it works on your brain and

542
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,119
not the other types of systems which

543
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,700
probably should have experienced not a

544
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:18,528
feeling okay that do oh I'm gonna print

545
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,298
that out I want to print that out on

546
00:19:18,528 --> 00:19:24,740
paper Bradley if you're listening write

547
00:19:20,298 --> 00:19:26,898
a song about that it's just the part of

548
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,990
that I really like about this is it's

549
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:31,908
the first step at a conversation we're

550
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,700
just talking about Denver County it's

551
00:19:31,909 --> 00:19:36,110
not even a whole state and honestly

552
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,269
there are a lot of people here freaking

553
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:41,898
the [ __ ] out over what this means and

554
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:42,980
what it says about a society and it says

555
00:19:41,898 --> 00:19:44,388
that we're progressive and we're

556
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,798
forward-thinking and we believe that

557
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:49,009
people are adult enough to actually

558
00:19:45,798 --> 00:19:53,000
manage their own life in development

559
00:19:49,009 --> 00:19:55,278
there's I mean for my whole adult life

560
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,289
we've needed to have a real adult

561
00:19:55,278 --> 00:20:00,579
conversation about

562
00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:04,230
mistakes we've been making for the last

563
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:06,359
hundred years and how to move forward

564
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,039
understanding that their mistakes and

565
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,799
drug prohibition is at the top of this

566
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:14,589
list for me it literally poisons every

567
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:18,428
other aspect of society and it does this

568
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:19,839
absolutely zero good um and it doesn't

569
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:26,259
matter what drug you're talking about

570
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:27,909
but steps like this where first we force

571
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,710
them to legalize marijuana and this

572
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,950
started back with Denver decriminalizing

573
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:35,679
marijuana like back in the 70s and it's

574
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:37,539
been a slow inch - we've we've gotten

575
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,840
marijuana legalized in several states

576
00:20:37,539 --> 00:20:43,440
now now it's time to start really having

577
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:46,089
this conversation about other drugs and

578
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,370
having had the marijuana conversation

579
00:20:46,089 --> 00:20:50,199
already especially in places like

580
00:20:48,369 --> 00:20:53,169
Colorado where it's been a continuous

581
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,049
conversation for twenty years now the

582
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,640
arguments for marijuana legalization a

583
00:20:56,049 --> 00:20:59,319
lot of them don't have anything to do

584
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:03,490
with marijuana and they have to do with

585
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:05,558
a massively popular product a black

586
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:09,429
market and our attempts to prohibit all

587
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:12,460
of this and they're easily applied to

588
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:14,230
every other drug that we prohibit and if

589
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,789
you want to get into it like we can go

590
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,429
straight to heroin and fentanyl and

591
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:20,529
argue that which is where most people

592
00:21:18,429 --> 00:21:21,610
tend to take it but I mean it doesn't

593
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,379
really matter what you're talking about

594
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:24,129
in my opinion prohibition makes the

595
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,860
situation worse

596
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:29,559
and legalization is where we need to

597
00:21:26,859 --> 00:21:31,719
head with all of this so if it were up

598
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:34,660
to if white Mike was president or drug

599
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,808
czar or leader of the DEA would you

600
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:41,140
basically find a way to allow every drug

601
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:43,389
to be legal and then yeah okay nope and

602
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,690
I would agree with that not just and you

603
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:48,700
are not you're not a drug type of person

604
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,420
no no I know that's weird to classify

605
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,130
but there are people out there that

606
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:52,210
[ __ ] love drugs you know other just

607
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,470
want to get [ __ ] up there are people

608
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,420
that will admit it I'll do whatever you

609
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:57,039
got you're not that kind of guy but you

610
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:58,720
feel that we should have the opportunity

611
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,428
to if I wanted to go out there and put

612
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,640
crack in my butt you think I should be

613
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:05,830
able to do that yeah I think us trying

614
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,400
to prohibit you from from getting crack

615
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:10,278
is much more harmful than you having the

616
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,499
availability

617
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:15,378
by cracking the store I like that yeah

618
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:17,749
it there's literally nothing that people

619
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:20,358
want to buy that they can't buy it's all

620
00:22:17,749 --> 00:22:22,819
for sale in our attempts to prohibit it

621
00:22:20,358 --> 00:22:27,699
make it more dangerous they make it

622
00:22:22,819 --> 00:22:30,259
impure they make it underground and like

623
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:32,778
liquor store a never goes to war with

624
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:36,409
liquor store B in the street over

625
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:38,598
customer bases or turf but rival crack

626
00:22:36,409 --> 00:22:41,869
dealers getting shootouts all the

627
00:22:38,598 --> 00:22:44,378
[ __ ] time over customers and turf yep

628
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:47,329
there are things inherent with having

629
00:22:44,378 --> 00:22:49,548
the illegal market produced things that

630
00:22:47,329 --> 00:22:51,439
humans consume to the tunes of billions

631
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:52,999
of dollars the liquor store never finds

632
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,389
you and shoots you because you got a big

633
00:22:52,999 --> 00:22:59,479
ol vodka debt the point when you go to a

634
00:22:56,388 --> 00:23:02,569
liquor store to buy liquor you walk into

635
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:05,409
a regulated business that's reasonably

636
00:23:02,569 --> 00:23:08,178
safe and you buy a product that's

637
00:23:05,409 --> 00:23:11,690
specific and regulated and standardized

638
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:14,359
and so when you buy a beer it's stamped

639
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:18,259
right on the side 3 2 or 600 or whatever

640
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:20,658
is legal in your area and you understand

641
00:23:18,259 --> 00:23:22,999
how that's going to affect you when you

642
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:26,149
buy a bag of heroin on the street you

643
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:29,149
don't know if you're getting 25% pier 30

644
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:31,038
percent piers 60 percent pier or 2

645
00:23:29,148 --> 00:23:33,138
percent pure laced with fentanyl and a

646
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,219
fuckload of baby powder if you have no

647
00:23:33,138 --> 00:23:36,218
idea what the [ __ ] you're getting

648
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:45,109
there's major implications to that to

649
00:23:40,579 --> 00:23:47,088
the end consumer further like you could

650
00:23:45,108 --> 00:23:48,829
offer me all the free heroin you like

651
00:23:47,088 --> 00:23:50,148
you could put down a kilo of heroin and

652
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:52,848
be like here take this home if you want

653
00:23:50,148 --> 00:23:57,528
and I'd be like no thanks yeah me too

654
00:23:52,848 --> 00:24:00,439
I'm not interested in any heroin but

655
00:23:57,528 --> 00:24:00,798
like I appreciate the offer but no thank

656
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,609
you

657
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:06,829
and it's because I understand what that

658
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:08,569
drug is capable of in a lot of other

659
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:10,728
stuff and I'm just not interested and so

660
00:24:08,569 --> 00:24:12,788
you solve these things with education

661
00:24:10,729 --> 00:24:17,389
and access to healthy healthcare not

662
00:24:12,788 --> 00:24:19,249
with the threat of jail yeah yeah if you

663
00:24:17,388 --> 00:24:21,378
become if you do and I'm not even gonna

664
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:23,179
go down the addiction is a disease path

665
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,049
but if you do become addicted to

666
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,670
something and you

667
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:27,829
like some help it is hard to reach out

668

been doing this what you're you that's a

670
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,230
criminal thing it needs to be treated

671
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,379
more as a health problem you've got a

672
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,930

Pepper nobody is going to arrest me they

674
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,500

675
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,120
consumed today somebody should beat my

676
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,980
ass but nobody cares because it's dr.

677

pepper I'm gonna get diabetes it's gonna

678
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,029
be miserable but since it's dr. pepper

679
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,220
that's my addiction it's okay that's my

680
00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:53,869
thing I'm the one poisoning me I'm not

681
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,160
hurting anybody except when I die people

682
00:24:53,869 --> 00:24:58,159
are gonna miss me but we all got to die

683
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:59,630
anyway I don't like because you're

684
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,630
talking about caffeine but because it's

685
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:04,280
legal its regulated like they tried to

686
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,870
pull four loko off the shelf because

687
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:07,039
they don't like when people makes a

688
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:08,769
whole bunch of alcohol with a whole

689
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,769
bunch of caffeine I'm not good at Dow

690
00:25:08,769 --> 00:25:14,900
most places like you'll see them on road

691
00:25:12,769 --> 00:25:16,730
trips and truck stops by the register

692
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:19,009
they've got like super duper caffeine

693
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,480
pills there's been attempts to get those

694
00:25:19,009 --> 00:25:22,309
off the [ __ ] market because every now

695
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,380
and then some trucker ODS on them or

696
00:25:22,309 --> 00:25:26,659
some teenager Odie's on and end up in

697
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:29,210
the hospital in a serious medical event

698
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,880
because they've consumed hundreds of

699
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:33,950
times the safe dose of caffeine that's

700
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,780
not even fun that doesn't feel good do

701
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,330
you think that most drugs would work

702
00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:40,430
themselves out now in most situations in

703
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:43,009
my experience the way that I have

704
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:45,440
learned to tolerate and handle almost

705
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:47,539
anything I've been given whether it's uh

706
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,830
chocolate milk I've made myself feel

707
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:50,629
like [ __ ] with chocolate milk you know

708
00:25:48,829 --> 00:25:52,039
how I learned I tried a little bit of it

709
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,360
and then I had a glass of it and I like

710
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:55,519
chocolates [ __ ] good I want two

711
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,629
glasses of it I'm almost [ __ ] vegan

712
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,009
now I haven't had chocolate milk in

713
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,120
probably twenty years I've just picked

714
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:01,640
something that I know would give me a

715
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:02,899
stomachache so I discovered chocolate

716
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,330
milk right away it was [ __ ] good [ __ ]

717
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:08,120
had a glass of it it was good had two

718
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:10,099
glasses of it don't [ __ ] ooh third

719
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,079
glass oh I want to die stomach hurts I

720
00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:14,149
hate this [ __ ] that's how I learned

721
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:15,559
about alcohol that's how I learned about

722
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:17,570
chocolate milk that's how I learned

723
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:19,190
about how much cereal I can eat that's

724
00:26:17,569 --> 00:26:20,539
how I've learned how much kombucha I can

725
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:22,370
drink that's how you learn how much

726
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:25,369
pasta you can eat before you want to die

727
00:26:22,369 --> 00:26:26,989
I think just exposing yourself to it and

728
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:28,759
not treating it like it's some crazy

729
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,980
[ __ ] thing and giving you the

730
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:32,869
opportunity to learn and the choice if

731
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,569
you want it or not it gives you the

732
00:26:32,869 --> 00:26:37,669
ability to make it a decision do I

733
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:39,409
helmet and and they'll learn

734
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,820
experience like where is my limit to

735
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:42,590
this do you think most of the other

736
00:26:40,819 --> 00:26:44,509
drugs will kind of work themselves out

737
00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:46,009
by I'll see my buddy over there who

738
00:26:44,509 --> 00:26:47,690
tried the heroin just puke and I don't

739
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:49,970
want to do that but then I'll see the

740
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,259
guy that that ate a little mushrooms

741
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:52,490
already know my limit on mushrooms and

742
00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:54,349
I'll say well that looks like fun he ate

743
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,819
how much did he owe eat one gram I want

744
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:56,750
to do that how much did he he ate seven

745
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:58,129
grand and he's laying on the floor

746
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,599
digging into the dirt I don't want to be

747
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:01,310
there I'm gonna try one gram and then

748
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:02,899
I'm gonna try two and see do you think

749
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:04,669
people have do you think we're gonna

750
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,930
figure ourselves out like that or do you

751
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,460
think a bunch of us are just gonna goon

752
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:09,769
out and end up in the streets [ __ ]

753
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,180
full [ __ ] well I think anybody who's

754
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:13,940
gonna goon out and end up in the streets

755
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:15,620
is gonna do that regardless with or

756
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,320
without decriminalization yeah with or

757
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:19,849
without their now or if I was king of

758
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:23,359
the world that everything was legalized

759
00:27:19,849 --> 00:27:25,490
but that's the thing that's cool about

760
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:29,059
this law is it's pushes the conversation

761
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:34,150
forward another step until marijuana was

762
00:27:29,059 --> 00:27:38,210
legalized we didn't have any sort of

763
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:41,030
concept of what an individual dose of a

764
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:43,190
marijuana edible would be and since then

765
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:46,099
we've come up with historic estimates

766
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:49,970
and we're working the kinks out of those

767
00:27:46,099 --> 00:27:52,039
right now is states legalize everybody's

768
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:53,720
kind of doing it their own little every

769
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:57,889
but every States got to do its their

770
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,170
special way and so over the next 20

771
00:27:57,890 --> 00:28:02,570
years we're gonna watch all that play

772
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:06,140
out and figure out ok maybe 10 was a

773
00:28:02,569 --> 00:28:07,730
little low let's call it 15 now or maybe

774
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,770
10 was a little high let's call seven

775
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:12,049
and a half now you know what I mean yeah

776
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:14,869
and now Denver is about to start that

777
00:28:12,049 --> 00:28:17,149
conversation with mushrooms and over the

778
00:28:14,869 --> 00:28:19,399
next six months or a year the

779
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:22,070
conversation in a very public and real

780
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,840
way about well how much is a reasonable

781
00:28:22,069 --> 00:28:26,569
amount of mushrooms for someone to grow

782
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:27,409
at home if you're micro dosing to treat

783
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:30,439
your depression

784
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:33,440
what sort of gross setup is realistic

785
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,390
for an amateur to produce enough product

786
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:40,400
for them to sustain their dose regimen

787
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:44,660
if it's just a sometime concert go or

788
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:46,660
what's a noob dose for mushrooms where

789
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:50,080
they're gonna have a pleasant

790
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,850
intoxicating experience rather than a

791
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:55,089
I got sick and threw up on everybody

792
00:28:51,849 --> 00:28:56,949
experience or I ended up in the hospital

793
00:28:55,089 --> 00:29:01,779
while they laughed at me and gave me

794
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:03,640
water kind of experience yes and that

795
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:05,740
conversation hasn't taken place in the

796
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,940
u.s. before I have a feeling it took

797
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:08,710
place in the Netherlands because I know

798
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,210
it for at least for a long time you

799
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:14,019
could buy mushrooms and a lot of the

800
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,549
head shops and coffee shops there but we

801
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:18,190
definitely have that haven't had that

802
00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:20,470
conversation in the US and as states

803
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,600
move to decriminalize mushrooms and

804
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:26,440
other drugs all of these conversations

805
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:29,049
are gonna have to take place and how we

806
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,730
legalize or how we we regulate other

807
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,369
drugs all those conversations are gonna

808
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,470
have to take place one of the other

809
00:29:33,369 --> 00:29:37,209
bills that they talked about in Denver

810
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:40,450
this session was safe injection

811
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:41,680
facilities and people freaked out so

812
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:43,330
like there's you people are gonna travel

813
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:46,330
across the country so they can do heroin

814
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:48,669
in this train cars they set up in Denver

815
00:29:46,329 --> 00:29:50,589
where there's just a doctor on-site in

816
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,700
case you do get something that's got

817
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:54,369
more fentanyl in it than you were

818
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,230
expecting and you end up needing medical

819
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:59,649
help it's just right there that's all it

820
00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,360
[ __ ] is and the idea that a hardcore

821
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,680
heroin addict is gonna have money to

822
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:05,469
move across the country is just sort of

823
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,060
batshit but we're finally having these

824
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,289
conversations in the US and I wasn't

825
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:09,849
sure we were ever gonna have them

826
00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:11,409
honestly when I was studying the [ __ ] in

827
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:14,730
college I was like it's a fantasy that

828
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:17,140
we're ever gonna move this far forward

829
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,839
mainly because we'd love to do [ __ ] just

830
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,610
because that's how we do [ __ ]

831
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:23,859
decriminalization black market is still

832
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:25,990
the source market and so you're left

833
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:27,669
with all the problems of the the

834
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:31,930
production and distribution chain being

835
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:33,610
illegal you don't like I hate that

836
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:35,830
marijuana's growing on public land

837
00:30:33,609 --> 00:30:39,339
I love marijuana but I also love our

838
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:40,990
national parks and I hate that because

839
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,309
it's illegal it's grown in national

840
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:43,900
parks it's the same thing with all the

841
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,579
other drugs they're produced in ways

842
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:48,610
that are super [ __ ] destructive

843
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:50,949
because they're illegal if if heroin

844
00:30:48,609 --> 00:30:53,199
were legal we wouldn't have poppy fields

845
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:55,360
all over different parts of the planet

846
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,940
just [ __ ] up the economy right now

847
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:59,709
same thing with coca production like it

848
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:01,059
wouldn't be little kids stomping on coca

849
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,389
leaves and the [ __ ] jungles of Peru

850
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:07,408
so the people in New York and have their

851
00:31:03,388 --> 00:31:09,628
well it just makes sense have this [ __ ]

852
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:11,909
legal if you ask me feel free to send

853
00:31:09,628 --> 00:31:13,108
hey mail the add new upon 15 I don't

854
00:31:11,909 --> 00:31:14,369
think the listeners of this show are

855
00:31:13,108 --> 00:31:15,749
going to hate you I think most of the

856
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:17,398
people that listen to the show are

857
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:18,690
open-minded and they're free thinkers

858
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,228
and they would encourage other people to

859
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:23,999
think for themselves and most of us are

860
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:25,889
informed and wise enough to not do

861
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:27,778
things to our body and our minds that

862
00:31:25,888 --> 00:31:30,689
aren't going to benefit us in some way

863
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:33,509
and sometimes you got to learn by seeing

864
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,649
and doing but I think most of us are

865
00:31:33,509 --> 00:31:36,868
smart enough to make our own decisions

866
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:38,848
you know it's I think there's two

867
00:31:36,868 --> 00:31:41,999
conversations that are really pushing

868
00:31:38,848 --> 00:31:43,618
this forward one is I mean marijuana

869
00:31:41,999 --> 00:31:46,319
legalization is a conversation that's

870
00:31:43,618 --> 00:31:48,808
happening in every corner the u.s. right

871
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:51,499
now and in places like Colorado where

872
00:31:48,808 --> 00:31:54,868
it's already happened we're discussing

873
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:56,838
how it's playing out and in tweaks we

874
00:31:54,868 --> 00:32:02,218
need to make to the law and the other

875
00:31:56,838 --> 00:32:05,759
conversation that's taking place is law

876
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:07,979
enforcement based and problems with how

877
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,409
we police ourselves as a society and

878
00:32:07,979 --> 00:32:11,429
changes we need to make to that and I

879
00:32:10,409 --> 00:32:13,589
think both of those conversations

880
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:16,440
happening at the same time are really

881
00:32:13,588 --> 00:32:19,200
pushing things like this Denver law

882
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:21,778
forward most people get it they see the

883
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,819
problems the prohibition causes and they

884
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:25,979
see how pointless our efforts have been

885
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:28,138
and how wasteful they've been the other

886
00:32:25,979 --> 00:32:29,879
part of this is like when heroin was

887
00:32:28,138 --> 00:32:32,008
legal before it was outlawed the most

888
00:32:29,878 --> 00:32:36,238
popular consumption method was a low

889
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:37,558
dose liquid like people always go

890
00:32:36,239 --> 00:32:40,169
straight to heroin in this conversation

891
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,908
and it's back when it was legal man it

892
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:44,909
was [ __ ] housewives drinking laudanum

893
00:32:41,909 --> 00:32:46,528
yep we didn't have a heroin junkie

894
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:48,089
problem and so long after it had been

895
00:32:46,528 --> 00:32:50,308
made illegal and then we had everybody

896
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:54,418
addicted to [ __ ] morphine in the army

897
00:32:50,308 --> 00:32:56,940
hospitals look it up man drug histories

898
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:58,469
interesting is yet absolutely Mike

899
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,088
thanks for coming in educating us we've

900
00:32:58,469 --> 00:33:01,320
been going for about 30 something ish

901
00:33:00,088 --> 00:33:02,578
minutes now after a couple of quick

902
00:33:01,319 --> 00:33:04,319
edits so we should probably start

903
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:05,999
wrapping up this show it's getting kind

904
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,259
of late we should come back to the kids

905
00:33:05,999 --> 00:33:08,519
it was a great show man I had a lot of

906
00:33:07,259 --> 00:33:10,259
fun I hope you had as much fun as I did

907
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,858
I hope everybody listening had a bunch

908
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,969
of fun let's recap maybe their magic

909
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,468
maybe they're not that's up to you to

910
00:33:14,969 --> 00:33:17,250
decide depends on how many you eat I

911
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:20,160
guess not

912
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,170
magic its science it is science um it's

913
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:24,029
spiritual it's not a feeling it's a book

914
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,950
I don't even remember what you said it's

915
00:33:24,029 --> 00:33:27,240
not a feeling it's an experience maybe

916
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,559
that's it maybe it's a little bit of

917
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,390
both depends on how many you eat once

918
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,099
again they are not legal they are

919
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:33,720
decriminalized which is a big difference

920
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,849
if you have too much they will still

921
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,740
arrest you right now at this point it is

922
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:39,089
up to the cop to decide how much is too

923
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:40,289
much if you got a backpack full and

924
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:42,059
you're trying to hook everybody up on

925
00:33:40,289 --> 00:33:43,319
the campus you're going to jail bro

926
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:44,940
if you got enough swear you can get a

927
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:47,879
couple of trips on this weekend you'd be

928
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,200
just fine probably not in Denver the way

929
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,400
they used to screw with you back when

930
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,170
marijuana was decriminalized is how many

931
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,410
bags you had and if you had a scale oh

932
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:00,090
yeah if you went to your guy and try to

933
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:02,790
order a quarter and they gave it to you

934
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:03,750
in seven gram bags I was always like you

935
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:06,119
[ __ ]

936
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,099
cuz as soon as possible I had to get

937
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:09,809
that into one sandwich bag because if

938
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:11,909
you get busted with seven one gram bags

939
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:13,949
you didn't buy a quarter you're trying

940
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,200
to sell seven times that is intent to

941
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:18,269
distribute if they choose to do so so be

942
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,549
careful I don't have too much and that

943
00:34:18,269 --> 00:34:22,710
is in Denver it is not all of Colorado

944
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:24,769
so like we said earlier most of the

945
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:27,119
concert venues you were [ __ ] out of luck

946
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:29,159
anywhere outside of Denver Pueblo

947
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,309
Colorado Springs Fort Collins Boulder

948
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,878
Paul still illegal possession for

949
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:38,579
mushrooms um you'll be alright don't

950
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:40,019
worry all right Mike I think it is time
