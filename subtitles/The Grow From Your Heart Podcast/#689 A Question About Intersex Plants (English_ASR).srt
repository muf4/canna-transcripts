previous episode in the last episode i

68
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
did talk about somebody's seedling they

69
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,039
planted a seedling they had it in a

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
container with their soil or their

71
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:37,359
soilless mix i said from the best of my

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,199
uh knowledge from looking and my

73
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,200
observations in the description that

74
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,598
that plant was probably too wet and too

75
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:44,958
cold we did get an update this one came

76
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,799
from our friend and it said i just

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,800
listened to the latest episode thank you

78
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,319
for listening it says awesome i will

79
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,480
send you an email this evening with more

80
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,359
details but the show was very helpful

81
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,359
and i think you were right too cold and

82
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,599
too much water so it's great to get some

83
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,280
feedback when people agree uh we know

84
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:02,639
that we're actually helping people when

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,400
they say you were right that means we

86
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,479
gave them a diagnosis they know next

87
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
time not to water so much maybe make it

88
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,158
a little bit warmer we are correcting

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,080

what i said the guidance i gave the

95
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:22,958
advice that i offered was uh helpful and

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,799
that the diagnosis i gave from what

97
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,560
we've determined was probably correct

98
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,080

99
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,158

thank you for the continued patreon

145
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,720
support we'll get right to the question

146
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
it says i made a fatal mistake by mixing

147
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
a tent with your starstruck so he had a

148
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,080
package of irie genetic starstruck seeds

149
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,038
and what he calls some knockoff genetics

150
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,560
of gdp and runs normally when i'm

151
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,319
talking about a growth that went wrong

152
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,160
and somebody got seeds i do not mention

153
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:21,439
the strains because it is not my job to

154
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,800
excuse me i'm not even gonna edit that

155
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:24,959
i'm a human that happened my throat's

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,800
clogged up today it is not my job as a

157
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,879
podcaster or a

158
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
anybody to call out another seed brand

159
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,918
unless they're doing something malicious

160
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:33,599
unless they've got intent we did call

161
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,038
out one company before

162
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
for selling fake seeds that are not what

163
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:38,000
they're claiming to be but that's not

164
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,600
what this is about most of the time i

165
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
don't say the strained names the reason

166
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,680
i did say that this was gdp and runts is

167
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,839
because they said they got knock-off

168
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,000
genetics they didn't get these crosses

169
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:49,439
from the original makers so if you got

170
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,879
knock-off genetics i'll say it was a

171
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,719
knock-off of that they didn't buy the

172
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,279
real [ __ ] so i'm not dissing whoever

173
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
made gdp or whoever made the runts uh

174
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,719
there they shouldn't feel any problem

175
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,319
because this was a knock off product if

176
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,400
it was the original i wouldn't have said

177
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,319
the strain name and i'm using the strain

178
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,478
names because he talks about these

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,240
strains so much in the story here that

180
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:09,918
if i tried to alternate and replace it

181
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,280
it would confuse all of us so i had to

182
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,359
keep the names the same just to make

183
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:14,559
this make sense i feel like i did just

184
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,840
did one of those uh names have been

185
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,839
changed to protect the innocent sort of

186
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,599
speeches oh by the way shout out to dabs

187
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,000
i'm stoned as [ __ ] rambly here we go

188
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,800
this message goes on it says i got some

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,918
knock off genetics of gdp and runts the

190
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,360
gdp hermed early and i caught it well

191
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,839
that's always unfortunate but i'm glad

192
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,520
you caught it it does say i took it out

193
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,439
cut the pollen sacks and sprayed the

194
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:37,599
plant and the rest of the tent down with

195
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,918
water i happened to keep a smaller tent

196
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,280
that i had and quarantined it and then

197
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,079
about two and a half weeks later the

198
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,359
ruts hermed alright so i at one point

199
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,879
let's see star stroke what point

200
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,840
hermed early it doesn't say exactly when

201
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:53,598
it says herm early um if it hermed early

202
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,279
it got further in your tent than it

203
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,360
would have in mind something that herms

204
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,239
early something that shows obvious signs

205
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,400
of intersex does not last long in my

206
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,519
garden if it shows me herm bye bye i

207
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:05,519
don't need that there are plenty of

208
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,038
seeds plenty of plants i don't need a

209
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,198
headache this is like the dating pool

210
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:11,279
this person already told me we are not

211
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,879
compatible buy why spend another date

212
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,119
with it why spend another week with it

213
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:16,879
in your case why spend more

214
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,038
lights air water soil electricity

215
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:21,199
nutrients time energy why waste all that

216
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,879
[ __ ] on a problematic plant so it got

217
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,038
further in your grow than it would have

218
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,719
in mind if it shows intersex that early

219
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,560
unless it is something magical that i've

220
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,400
been really trying to get i'm not even

221
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,680
gonna [ __ ] with it and still i would

222
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:33,198
really consider getting rid of it so it

223
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,439
got further in your spot than it did

224
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,478
mine it goes on though it says about two

225
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:40,000
and a half weeks later the runts hermed

226
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,079
i was a short and stocky plant that

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,680
grows a tight pattern so i made a point

228
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,000
for a couple of weeks after the first

229
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,079
intersex plant to check the others very

230
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,918
close including the runs after a few

231
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:51,598
weeks i thought i was safe but when

232
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,079
taking them out for the first time in a

233
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:56,639
week i found what looks to be

234
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:58,800
freshly popped male flowers all right so

235
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,720
our friend had a gdp plan he noticed

236
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,560
that that was showing intersex signs he

237
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,840
took that plant put it into another tent

238
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,759
because he happened to have another tent

239
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,198
where he could quarantine things good

240
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,038
move there if you really insist on

241
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,400
keeping that now two and a half weeks

242
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:12,399
later we have discovered that the other

243
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,598
plant in the room which is a runt plant

244
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,839
is showing male flowers so it goes on to

245
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,839
say i repeated what i did before but i

246
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:21,279
don't have another tent or another light

247
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,679
and the idea of running three tents

248
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,000
isn't something i could do and i know i

249
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,400
should call the runts and or the gdp but

250
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,959
honestly i believe where am i i caught

251
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:32,399
my i believe i caught the gdp in time

252
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,519
but i never stopped checking and i

253
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,278
haven't had issues with it repeating all

254
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,080
right so if you think you got the gdp on

255
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:39,838
time

256
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,240
it might not throw out new nanners new

257
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,800
male flowers but it could the runts you

258
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,240
said you saw full on male flowers and

259
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,359
two and a half weeks in that's probably

260
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,440
going to be about three weeks because it

261
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,159
was two and a half weeks later could be

262
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,240
four weeks honestly you are you have

263
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:56,799
much more leeway in your garden than i

264
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,480
do of course i have access to many more

265
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,559
seeds many more clones i've got a lot

266
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,039
more backup plans but these plants

267
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,278
showing me intersex traits at this point

268
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,439
of the cycle they would be gone they

269
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,720
wouldn't even make it this far in micro

270
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,120
this question wouldn't even be asked

271
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,278
it'd say intersex intersex snip snip bye

272
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,200
bye they'd be out of there because there

273
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:16,480
are so many other seeds and clones that

274
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,839
aren't going to give you a headache

275
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,600
you're already getting a headache from

276
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,959
it i wouldn't i wouldn't [ __ ] with it so

277
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,320
i know that further on the question you

278
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,719
asked me what to do and we will answer

279
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,879
that my overall answer is going to be uh

280
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,560
continue them because it's so far in but

281
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,159
don't ever grow these again bro call

282
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,199
them chop them why are you wasting your

283
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,799
time with these you know that they're

284
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,080
crazy don't [ __ ] with them ever again

285
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,399
you know that they're problematic don't

286
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,959
waste time space energy growing should

287
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,159
be uh delightful is the overall word

288
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,239
growing should be great you should feel

289
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,600
good about the entire process this is a

290
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
headache so you're getting a headache

291
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,720
and [ __ ] get rid of that like any

292
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,200
anything that gives me that much of a

293
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,560
headache in my grow by felicia let me

294
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:53,120
find out where we are here in this

295
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,719
message because i've got the 80d and i

296
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,639
can't find my spot but i'm going to keep

297
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,639
talking until we find it it says i've

298
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:00,958
also read and heard that sometimes

299
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:03,439
certain cultivars will throw impotent

300
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:06,399
male flowers and will not pollinate yes

301
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,240
a lot of times a plant will throw a non

302
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,200
uh what's the word you used impotent i

303
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
don't know if that's the right word but

304
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
i'm gonna go with it it seems to work uh

305
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,399
they will throw flowers that do not

306
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,559
contain any pollen sterile is the word i

307
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,720
would have used um

308
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,799
that looks more like just a skinny dried

309
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,079
up banana it looks like a dried up

310
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,759
flower that wouldn't do anything if

311
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,439
you're getting full-on male flowers that

312
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,039
are opening it's a good chance there's

313
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
pollen in there a good chance i didn't

314
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,120
say for sure but many times yes some of

315
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,279
these plants can't throw out male

316
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,278
flowers that are non-viable that are

317
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:36,958
sterile that are non-potent i guess

318
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:37,919
impotent is might be the correct word

319
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:39,439
i'm going to say non-potent because

320
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:41,120
impotent makes me think it can't get its

321
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,399
pp hard

322
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,159
i'm going to keep going with this it

323
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,759
says how would you deal with this issue

324
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:47,199
that's a really good question honestly i

325
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,799
said it before these plants wouldn't

326
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,399
make it this far as soon as i saw these

327
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:53,199
problems choppity chop chop chop these

328
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,600
plants would be gone but i have access

329
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
to more plants and more what may be more

330
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,360
important is i have access to more

331
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,360
medicine you may be relying on these

332
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,560
plants for medicine which let me get off

333
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,839
on a side tangent here i'm going to put

334
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,039
my finger here so i know where the [ __ ]

335
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,680
i am so that we can get back to this

336
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,519
there we go um side tangent i would

337
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:11,278
never have let these plants get this big

338
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,480
they would have been little tiny plants

339
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,240
i would have tested them out to

340
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
determine if they have intersex traits

341
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,240
or if they're problematic before i grew

342
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,839
them this far in my last run when i was

343
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
growing bigger plants these would have

344
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,200
been in the side in the corner little

345
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,120
tiny plants showing me if they were

346
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,480
worth a [ __ ] or not so that i could test

347
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,959
run them and then we grow them in big

348
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
pots i'm not uh what's i'm not talking

349
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,239
down on you because you didn't do a test

350
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:33,518
run but that's a way to prevent it next

351
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,959
time that would have helped you out

352
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
especially since you've got two tents

353
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,479
you could be doing test runs in that

354
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:41,518
second tent and full on production runs

355
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,959
in the big tent find keepers that way

356
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,799
you skipped a step is what i think i'm

357
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,078
trying to say there was a phenohunt step

358
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,679
skipped in here these plants should have

359
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,679
been auditioned you got them on the big

360
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,958
stage they never played open mic night

361
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:52,399
you got to give them an open mic night

362
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:54,159
before you put them on the big stage in

363
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,759
my opinion all right let me get myself

364
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:58,000
back on track here i did save my space

365
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,240
with my finger it says should i put the

366
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,519
runts in with the gdp yes that's i

367
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,879
immediately would have done that i

368
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,039
didn't realize you did not do that

369
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,559
already as soon as i saw intersex on the

370
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:08,159
other plant it would have gone over to

371
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,919
the intersex hotel whichever you want to

372
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,319
call that spot i would have gone over

373
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,000
there uh to let it finish yeah if you

374
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,000
insist on finishing those definitely put

375
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,200
them both over there in the freak show

376
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,879
hotel um and then leave the non-intersex

377
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,959
plant in the other room and see what's

378
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,639
happening it goes on to say uh the

379
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,399
reason i'm trying to save it is because

380
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,639
i'm in prohibition land and it is hard

381
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,799
to come by my state just now started

382
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,759
rolling out medical but dispensaries are

383
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:35,759
a bit off still without the uh still

384
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,039
without okay are still a bit off there

385
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:39,439
should be a comma or a period there but

386
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,519
not a big deal without these means no

387
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,600
meds and i will make my own edibles so i

388
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,919
know i can use them that way if it comes

389
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
down to having been pollinated that is a

390
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,039
that's kind of what i was thinking if

391
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,879
these plants are pollinated and have

392
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,480
seeds it's better to have something with

393
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,838
seeds in it than to have no medicine you

394
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,399
did state that the dispensaries aren't

395
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,320
quite ready for you yet oftentimes in a

396
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,000
new place the dispensaries are so

397
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
expensive that it's not even accessible

398
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,919
to patients they say it's a medical

399
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:05,359
program but then they charge you 500 for

400
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:07,679
an ounce and how's a sick person gonna

401
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,440
have a 500 extra [ __ ] chunk of money

402
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,278
laying around to pay for some medicine i

403
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,959
get it dude i really do get it i used to

404
00:13:11,278 --> 00:13:14,958
be there that's part of what started

405
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,638
that's probably part of what starts so

406
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,719
many people growing this stuff is so

407
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,399
expensive and it's questionable you pay

408
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
for a product you get it home and you

409
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,440
smoke it you're like this doesn't taste

410
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,680
right or this tastes like pesticides or

411
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,959
this burns like [ __ ] if you grow it

412
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,638
learn about it you got so much more

413
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,919
passion and so much more quality i do

414
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,399
get it that's why we get going that's

415
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,039
why i got going in this dis dissatisfied

416
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,958
with other products um if it is seeded

417
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:40,559
you can smoke it if it does have seeds

418
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:42,638
in it it is smokable some people um i am

419
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,159
a seed breeder i make seeded plants i

420
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
make a lot of seeded plants a lot of my

421
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,278
shit's got seeds in it sometimes we'll

422
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,559
just cut off a couple of nuggets and

423
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:49,679
we'll smoke we'll dry and cure them and

424
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,359
we'll smoke them just to see what the

425
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,198
buds like i've made a lot of

426
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,440
concentrates out of seeded material we

427
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,679
pull the seeds out run the material

428
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,839
there's a different buzz that happens

429
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,439
from seeded material there's a different

430
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,199
cannabinoid a different terpene a

431
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,560
different i don't know what it is but

432
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:06,559
it's something in that plant that you

433
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:08,879
can only get from a plant that has been

434
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:11,198
seeded it's a totally different buzz it

435
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:13,919
is heavier and the stony department like

436
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:15,439
your body feels it but also it's more

437
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:17,519
psychedelic and for me to say

438
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,040
psychedelic that takes a lot in cannabis

439
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,799
because i have uh more than delved in

440
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:24,719
the world of psychedelia i know what

441
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,799
real psychedelics are and for me to say

442
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,959
that weed can be psychedelic that takes

443
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,198
something so that seeded weed can almost

444
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,278
bring on like a trippy vision head

445
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,120
change sort of a thing so even if there

446
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:36,958
are seeds in there you can dry it and

447
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,519
cure it and smoke it if you choose to do

448
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,599
that but making edibles making tinctures

449
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,519
making whatever is great also so get

450
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,879
those seeds out of there separate those

451
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,399
seeds i would recommend probably just

452
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,078
tossing those seeds some people will say

453
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,600
they're viable you're already dealing

454
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:51,039
with an intersex issue you don't want

455
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,959
more headaches in my opinion those are

456
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:54,240
headache seeds those are bird seed i

457
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,000
would get rid of them a lot of people

458
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,839
out there are raising their fist in the

459
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,679
air saying those are good seeds i think

460
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,720
intersex bee gets intersex i would toss

461
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,638
them so you don't have to deal with this

462
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,000
again in the future get that material

463
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,759
make the products you want to make that

464
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,639
will work let me catch up because there

465
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,639
is more to this message it says i know i

466
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,320
can still use them that way if it comes

467
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,079
down to having been pollinated yes there

468
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,519
are still viable plants if you want to

469
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,198
let them finish

470
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,560
they are intersex they are possibly

471
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:19,838
pollinating the

472
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:21,439
other plant that you've got in that

473
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,760
other room they may already have

474
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,600
pollinated that but if you insist on

475
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,198
finishing them they will be usable

476
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,360
however don't grow this again if you've

477
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,679
got clones of that starstruck grow that

478
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
if you've got other seeds grow those do

479
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,879
a proper phenol hunt so that you can

480
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,120
eliminate this kind of problem in the

481
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:39,600
next run grow some plants grow your

482
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,679
legal limit grow them small don't grow

483
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,920
them very big veg them for a small time

484
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,838
get a clone from them then flower them

485
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,759
if you see any problems get the [ __ ] rid

486
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,519
of it when you see keepers keep those

487
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,600
and keep that clone forever create a

488
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,919
mother plant i think i've done podcasts

489
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,920
on pheno hunting selection and mother

490
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,479
plant so those should help you out i do

491
00:15:55,919 --> 00:16:00,479
need to find my space again it says also

492
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,800
the main reason i messaged at all is to

493
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,800
ask you if you can tell if a plant is

494
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,479
actually seated or not or do you

495
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,799
literally have to tear open a bud to

496
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,278
know for sure you don't have to tear

497
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,958
open a giant bud um

498
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,799
and find one little tiny nugget

499
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:16,319
somewhere on that plant is a little just

500
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,799
a little shitty popcorn nugget that you

501
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,959
can spare just pinch it just squeeze it

502
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,399
seeds by now if it's been a couple of

503
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:24,000
weeks seeds are starting to get hard

504
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,480
they don't feel like normal weed normal

505
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
blood uh feels i almost said smells they

506
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,759
don't feel like normal bud would feel

507
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,679
normally the bud would be squishy maybe

508
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,759
spongy right now there's a hard piece in

509
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,000
there that is your seed if you squeeze a

510
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,759
calyx if you squeeze a bract you may

511
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,278
feel there's a seed in there you could

512
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,720
take off a little nug from the bottom

513
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,320
you could take off just one tiny nug

514
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,839
you're not going to ruin the whole crop

515
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,759
tear it open give it a squeeze give it

516
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,519
an investigation you may see little

517
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,360
white starts of seeds you may see fully

518
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,759
developed seeds you may have fully

519
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,199
ripened hardened seeds in there if so

520
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,120
you've got seeds to deal with and you've

521
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,479
got a good learning experience but you

522
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,759
don't have to destroy the whole plant

523
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,759
just to find out if there's a seed in

524
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,278
there as a breeder when it comes close

525
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,519
when i've pollinated a plant i know it's

526
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,519
almost time to cut it down i'll take

527
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,439
fingers and just grab a butt just grab a

528
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,879
nug and pull you can pull off a couple

529
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,400
of bracks and they'll come right off the

530
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,000
plant and you can just roll it around in

531
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,199
your fingers and all the material will

532
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,558
come off and you'll have seeds in your

533
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,279
hand if there's seeds there you'll

534
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:18,399
definitely be able to tell hopefully

535
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,720
if it was just

536
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,439
a small intersex section of your plant

537
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,120
that uh showed intersex and pollinated

538
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,038
hopefully it didn't put out a bunch of

539
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,318
pollen maybe just just some sprinkles

540
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:30,000
and you only got a few seeds here and

541
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:31,678
there it sounds like you caught it early

542
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,759
you started being proactive or at least

543
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,200
reactive to what you found maybe you

544
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:37,119
didn't get a lot of seeds in there it

545
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
wasn't in there for very long maybe it

546
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,079
was non-viable what's the word we used

547
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,400
maybe it was impotent like you said

548
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,678
before maybe it didn't make any seeds

549
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,200
right now it's kind of just a wait and

550
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,720
see game or go in there and give it a

551
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,679
squeeze and see but

552
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,079
um

553
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,240
there could be depending on which part

554
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:55,359
of the plant was facing the plant that

555
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,400
uh uh intersexed maybe those two buds

556
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,079
that were touching maybe some

557
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
pollination happened there but up top

558
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:01,519
nothing happened i noticed that in the

559
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,359
greenhouse this summer the plants that

560
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:05,359
were right around the male plant that

561
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,719
perimeter was loaded with seeds you

562
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,399
could walk by the plant and brush it and

563
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,160
seeds would fall out but as you got

564
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,440
further from that male and circumference

565
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,480
in the greenhouse there were less and

566
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,080
less seeds so depending on the how far

567
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,759
that male was shooting his pollen you

568
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,439
may not have a lot of seeds or that

569
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:20,879
whole plant could be busted up it's hard

570
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,320
to hard to guess

571
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
but i'm wishing for the best for you to

572
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,798
tell you the truth now it says um thanks

00:18:44,798 --> 00:18:48,240
more great questions and i feel like it

584
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,319
is kind of my responsibility at this

585
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,240
point to field those questions i've been

586
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:53,918
given this gift of gab i've been given

587
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,919
this gift to understand the plants in a

588
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,520
way i don't try to act like i'm some

589
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,440
major college professor when it comes to

590
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,720
growing and cannabis i know the plants

591
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,640
because i've grown them touched them

592
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,480
been in the grow rooms i've got a lot of

593
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,640
experience and i feel if i didn't share

594
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,000
that between the gift of gab and the

595
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,840
experience with the plants something

596
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,440
would go wrong this is my duty whatever

597
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,918
you believe in i believe that that

598
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,440
inspires me to teach you how to be a

599
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,799
good cannabis grower without me doing

600
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,320
that i think that uh i might

601
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,879
spontaneously combust or something i

602
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:22,798
would not be doing my duty as a person

603
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,400
so that's my job supposed to be here

604
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,759
teaching people how to grow i'm also

605
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,880
supposed to be a good dad and be a good

606
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,558
drummer and there are a few other things

607
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,919
i think i'm supposed to do so thank you

608
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:31,279
for the huge compliments bro i do

609
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,038
appreciate that thank you for the

610
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,038
encouragement i never will stop and he

611
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,759
wraps it up by saying you've helped my

612
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:40,160
game go up so far that it nearly matches

613
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,599
my high from my last crop of orgasm

614
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,840
that's good you must be super high from

615
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,678
that orange gasm i hope i keep stepping

616
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:47,678
up your crop because that is my goal to

617
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,200
improve everybody's crop to set

618
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,880
everybody up for success that's harder

619
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,160
to say than it sounds trying to get

620
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,919
everybody out there growing on a

621
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:57,679
professional level so that people don't

622
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:59,120
have to rely on dispensaries and uh

623
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
free market growers if that's where

624
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:01,519
you're getting your product that's great

625
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,359
but wouldn't it be awesome if you could

626
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:05,599
just grow it yourself not have to meet

627
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,439
some random person in a parking lot at a

628
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:08,879
random place at 5 30 and they don't show

629
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,640
up till 6 and the product they have

630
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,320
isn't what you were hoping for if we

631
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,679
could all produce our own products we

632
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:16,079
would all be self-sufficient the world

633
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,640
would be great also we can all overgrow

634
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,960
the government one grow at a time one

635
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,640
seed at a time one harvest at a time

636
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,640
that is the goal all right ladies and

637
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,960
gentlemen boys girls pimps hoes friends

638

640
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,599
cannabis enthusiasts out there i want to

641

thank you once again for listening to

642

another episode of the grow from your

643
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:37,279
heart podcast i know the past couple of

644
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,359
episodes have been short but it seems to

645
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:40,639
work i'm getting a lot of clicks and a

646
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:42,959
lot of views we're popping up in the

647
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,559
algorithm more frequently uh the quicker

648
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,880
episodes seem to work for the people
