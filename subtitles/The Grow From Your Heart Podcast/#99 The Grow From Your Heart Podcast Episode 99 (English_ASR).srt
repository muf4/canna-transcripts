really here today yeah so these two guys

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:40,699
have been responsible for their medical

97
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:42,319
marijuana for over five years that I can

98
00:03:40,699 --> 00:03:44,000
say for sure without a doubt yeah

99
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,319
probably closer to five or six years

100
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,989
okay I was gonna say closer to eight or

101
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:49,549
ten maybe even it's getting there it's

102
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,799
getting there okay yeah I don't have a

103
00:03:49,549 --> 00:03:53,599
good sense of time I honestly do not do

104
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:57,489
that honest I used to remember time

105
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,810
periods by what fish shows I went to

106
00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,689
yeah I've been doing a lot of fishes yes

107
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,789
I used to document yeah how much time I

108
00:04:02,689 --> 00:04:05,989
was spending places all right so I've

109
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:07,370
been responsible for these guys as

110
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:10,129
medical marijuana and I have noticed

111
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,780
that when Mike wants to get high he

112
00:04:10,129 --> 00:04:13,310
wants to smoke some sativa like some

113
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:15,079
Jillybean that we just took dabs over

114
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,780
some golden goat but when Mike needs

115
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:19,189
medicine he reaches for the heavy CBD I

116
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:21,589
got this jar over here if either one of

117
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:25,579
you would like a dam this big crystal

118
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,329
clear oil that's almost pure CBD that

119
00:04:25,579 --> 00:04:28,168
was given to me

120
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:31,149
we're both staring

121
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:33,639
when these guys excuse me for the coffee

122
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,959
when these guys are hurting when they

123
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,269
feel pain they hit me up and they're

124
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:40,120
like do you have something extra CBD for

125
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:42,008
me right now cuz Mike's got sore hands

126
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,478
Mike's our Doug was an old railroad

127
00:04:42,009 --> 00:04:44,800
worker over here you got a picture this

128
00:04:43,478 --> 00:04:47,228
guy he's in jeans and a flannel shirt

129
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
with a big-ass knife on his Bell this

130
00:04:47,228 --> 00:04:51,128
man looks like he is ready to do some

131
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,288
work whatever you need done I'm sure and

132
00:04:51,129 --> 00:04:55,330
confident Doug can handle that work I'm

133
00:04:53,288 --> 00:04:57,068
gonna certainly give it a shot

134
00:04:55,329 --> 00:05:01,060
yeah I'm sure you'd get it done a little

135
00:04:57,069 --> 00:05:02,710
better than myself well maybe depending

136
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,848
on water was that's true that is true

137
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,128
there are some things that I bet I could

138
00:05:03,848 --> 00:05:07,718
do but Doug's a confident man he can

139
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,550
work it but he's an old railroad guy and

140
00:05:07,718 --> 00:05:09,939
so he's pretty much broken all over the

141
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,650
place

142
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:14,139
broken all over the place yeah back

143
00:05:11,649 --> 00:05:16,989
knees all the joints all the joints are

144
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,000
in bad shape and so I think that AG E's

145
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:20,050
got a little bit you know yeah well yeah

146
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,158
you're getting a little bit up there do

147
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,360
you mind if I ask you how you'll old

148
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:24,819
you're on the show my friend not at all

149
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,250
I'm 61 years old so my friend Doug is 61

150
00:05:24,819 --> 00:05:29,379
and medical cannabis is keeping this

151
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,288
student moving then he hurts we give

152
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:33,490
them some CBD do you have a family were

153
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:35,168
just gonna kind of jump into this part

154
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:40,478
do you have a favorite way to consume

155
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:43,778
your CBD medicine um my my favorite way

156
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:46,120
to consume is with my little electric

157
00:05:43,778 --> 00:05:48,370
pen okay my old lady calls it the

158
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,740
pacifier because it's always around my

159
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,360
neck it's hanging on a lanyard you never

160
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:56,079
know when you're gonna need it and it's

161
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:57,699
one of the most resin coated you can

162
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,680
tell that that thing has been around the

163
00:05:57,699 --> 00:06:02,978
block well you know it had to have a

164
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,930
little extra work done to it because

165
00:06:02,978 --> 00:06:07,180
those glass tops just don't work for me

166
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:09,668
oh yeah I know how you get been a little

167
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:12,750
modified there that's pretty it's custom

168
00:06:09,668 --> 00:06:14,829
but it but it works really good it's

169
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:18,819
there at a moment's notice

170
00:06:14,829 --> 00:06:21,158
okay and it's the way out that seems to

171
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,169
well anytime you smoke it we all know

172
00:06:21,158 --> 00:06:26,228
that that that's the quickest way to get

173
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:29,139
it yes and when you're in pain and you

174
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:31,718
want relief now I find that's the

175
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:33,310
quickest way so what's gonna hurt most

176
00:06:31,718 --> 00:06:34,718
frequently if we're hanging out what are

177
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,759
you gonna say [ __ ] this hurts what are

178
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:39,158
you gonna grab first my hip your hip my

179
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:41,050
hip my lower back okay so then you're

180
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:42,639
probably gonna say [ __ ] that hurts

181
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,310
Kanade is gonna be where's my vape pen

182
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,379
right exactly how long from inhaling off

183
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,610
okay first how many rips off that pen

184
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:50,919
does it take to kind of give you a

185
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:51,970
little relief to notice some easing of

186
00:06:50,918 --> 00:06:53,740
the pain mmm

187
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:55,479
to notice easing of the pain Republican

188
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,720
doctor as I asked the Robley within two

189
00:06:55,478 --> 00:07:00,758
or three two or three ribs off the veil

190
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,069
tell you the truth I'd like the truth

191
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,840
holding you're not under oath or holding

192
00:07:03,069 --> 00:07:06,580
the damn thing in my hand and knowing

193
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,310
that I'm about to take a hit off of it

194
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:12,279
starts the process right there because I

195
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:15,939
know relief he's an honest way is on its

196
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:19,869
way and I think I've told you this

197
00:07:15,939 --> 00:07:23,680
before your definition of what a pain

198
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:28,408
killer is we know that CBeebies help

199
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:34,360
control pain but marijuana in general

200
00:07:28,408 --> 00:07:38,319
changes your outlook on pain okay so I

201
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,509
think it's and what is pain relief I

202
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:43,750
mean that's what that's what pain

203
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,460
killers do is they well we know that

204
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:49,028
there there's chemicals that go in and

205
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:50,918
right shut down certain receptors maybe

206
00:07:49,028 --> 00:07:52,449
uh maybe the THC part is making you

207
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:54,098
forget that you her and helping your

208
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:57,370
mind go to a better place and stop being

209
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:59,978
focused on that exactly going out on you

210
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,209
and hurt okay right okay so two or three

211
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:03,218
rips and you start feeling that

212
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:05,198
forgetting about the pain and a little

213
00:08:03,218 --> 00:08:17,348
bit of pain going away yes how long does

214
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:19,360
that take hmm okay so it starts right

215
00:08:17,348 --> 00:08:20,680
then immediately within about two or

216
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,379
three rips which only takes you know

217
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,759
thirty seconds okay able to go back to

218
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:29,919

I see why he's got a dog that needs a

222
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:40,778
lot of walking so ya seen walking with

223

224
00:08:40,778 --> 00:08:44,139
seconds now if you were to take and I

225
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:45,458
won't even ask any about about any

226
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:47,528
pharmaceuticals that I know you take but

227
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,750
if you were to take a pharmaceutical to

228
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:51,399
treat that pain oh no 20 minutes 20

229
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,059
minutes you know if you're lucky and

230
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,090
then what are the side effects

231
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:59,059
well he just leaned back into the life

232
00:08:56,090 --> 00:09:01,940
flow you got all day and we do so I take

233
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:04,479
your truck opioids right which is the

234
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:09,320
major ones okay

235
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:14,139
anywhere from the dry mouth to listless

236
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:17,570
feeling to constipation okay for that

237
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:21,980
well that's their that's the way they do

238
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:24,379
medicine anymore at all absolutely it's

239
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,899
just prescribing other medication and

240
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:31,639
see how that work is it you on skype no

241
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:33,250
I know that I've done that before I will

242
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:36,350
never do that again

243
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,590
skyping with your doctor is not a good

244
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,450
thing

245
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:39,889
I want my doctor to touch me yeah well

246
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:43,480
you know you'd like to be able to look

247
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:46,250
around the room and see the diplomas

248
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,139
with just a shirt on cuz that's you know

249
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,759
that's all you see it's not like you can

250
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:51,679
look around and you're like you know

251
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,250
there's interaction between humans that

252
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,229
doesn't happen on Scott absolutely right

253
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:59,059
especially someone from your generation

254
00:09:56,230 --> 00:10:02,420
yeah Skype is probably [ __ ] Fingal

255
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:04,969
technology for you yeah yeah and try to

256
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,679
keep current but sky we don't expect you

257
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:08,330
to be that current I was periscoping

258
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,529
earlier you guys and Doug had no idea

259
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:11,650
what was happening for the first thirty

260
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:15,439
seconds of that periscope video no

261
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:17,959
what's he talking to I actually said I'm

262
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,640
going to periscope for a minute alright

263
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,590
so we'll get back on topic here so

264
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,240
within 30 seconds to a minute you're

265
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,889
feeling relief from the CBD your pain

266
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:26,570
and your hip isn't earn but 20 minutes

267
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:27,769
if you take some medicine and do it all

268
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:29,240
so thanks a lot for getting let me get

269
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,889
so personal ask about your medicine and

270
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,860
tell me the side effects I'm sure that's

271
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:36,649
gonna deep compared to taking pills and

272
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,789
I don't see why we can't grow our own

273
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:39,079
why they don't want us to grow our own

274
00:10:37,789 --> 00:10:41,449
medicine when this dude can feel better

275
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:43,879
in 20 minutes from taking a ripoff of a

276
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,980
vaping blow it's money it works so well

277
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:48,049
I like what you say it is money if

278
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,870
cannabis didn't do half of what it does

279
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:52,490
like it would be legal we discovered it

280
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,899
right now it would be celebrated

281
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:55,820
everywhere so it should print that on a

282
00:10:53,899 --> 00:10:58,100
shirt if cannabis didn't do half of what

283
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:01,040
it does it wouldn't it would be illegal

284
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:03,230
yeah yeah it's true if it if it just

285
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,389
worked as medicine if we could just

286
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,009
replace you know cotton with

287
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,710
like all the pharmacies we can just do

288
00:11:07,009 --> 00:11:11,929
one replaced by it yep I don't know

289
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:13,519
about all like there's still use for

290
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:15,349
plenty of what Pharma has to offer it's

291
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,689
just cannabis replaces a lot of what

292
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:20,590
we're using in a Pharma inappropriately

293
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:23,570
for now you bet

294
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:27,519
anyone that's taking vicodin realizes

295
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:30,879
that just up the uptick from I think a

296
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,889
grade two or grade three to agreed to

297
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,480
narcotic yep so there's no refills you

298
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,059
have to go to your doctor you have to

299
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:40,850
get a hard script from them and walk it

300
00:11:38,059 --> 00:11:45,289
to your pharmacy it has to be filled out

301
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:47,420
on a certain day it's it's incredible

302
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:49,639
and and the reason is because of the

303
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:52,399
incredible losses that we've had of life

304
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,720
due to overdose right and it's on the

305
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,970
streets everywhere it's easier sometimes

306
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,500
to find stupid drugs and pills than it

307
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,629
is to find weed before we had

308
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,909
dispensaries dispensaries we could find

309
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:04,009
the weed but back in the day it you'd

310
00:12:01,909 --> 00:12:06,549
run into other drugs and can't find the

311
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:09,049
weed right yeah and it's not that hard

312
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:10,759
it's actually would be easier for me to

313
00:12:09,049 --> 00:12:12,289
get some of this medication on the

314
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:13,819
street than it is from the dog right or

315
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:15,559
anyone and then that's what

316
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:17,120
unfortunately results to in heroin use

317
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,889
when you can't get those pills any more

318
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,509
from your insurance company without your

319
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:21,860
doctor being unavailable then you're

320
00:12:20,509 --> 00:12:22,819
gonna have to go and I know you wouldn't

321
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,440
do it you're another dude you got a

322
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:26,120
strong mind and keep you medicated with

323
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,710
good weed but other folks that don't

324
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,509
have good weed and a good caregiver and

325
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,470
a good family like yourself they would

326
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:31,460
have to go to the street and get

327
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,840
something because everybody hurts

328
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,900
they're sick from not having their pills

329
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,639
that's what these states are facing an

330
00:12:35,899 --> 00:12:41,480
increase in heroin use right now and

331
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:43,100
that's exactly why is regular folk get

332
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,539
hurt they go to the doctor the doctor

333
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:46,580
throws opiates at them

334
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:48,799
they take the pill until their bones not

335
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:50,810
broken anymore and by the time they're

336
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,959
healed though they're now addicted to

337
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:55,609
whatever painkiller they were alright

338
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,710
find it eventually they get cut off or

339
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:59,930
it becomes too expensive and they turn

340
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,180
to heroin get some help if you need help

341
00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:04,129
you guys that's what I'm saying please

342
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:05,989
and feel free to tell the doctor no you

343
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:07,730
don't need pain pills like sometimes you

344
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,500
pain pills I'm not saying people don't

345
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:12,080
because I've used them many many times

346
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,059
but like when I broke my finger I had to

347
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,800
refuse pain meds six different times I

348
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:17,039
kept asking if the pain was gonna get

349
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:20,389
any worse

350
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,389
I kept looking at me like I was insane

351
00:13:26,149 --> 00:13:33,600
vibrates stupid loud music what is

352
00:13:31,948 --> 00:13:35,159
happening figure out no problem no

353
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,480
worries at all alright

354
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,919
so Mike I won't ask you the same

355
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,539
question kind of that I was asking Doug

356
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,088
since we got off track here and I need

357
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:43,769
to find a good launching spot um can I

358
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:44,970
ask what your medical condition is that

359
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,110
you smoked for and you don't have to go

360
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,139
to any detail if you don't feel like it

361
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:52,169
the short version version is I damaged

362
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:54,480
my neck and never had cartilage in my

363
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:56,849
knees and so I need something that helps

364
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,519
with inflammation and nerve generated

365
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:01,709
pain and cannabis works wonderfully

366
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,929
where most of the drugs available on the

367
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:07,258
pharmaceutical market don't do anything

368
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:08,849
for nerve generated pain no so how long

369
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:13,350
if you took it what's your preferred

370
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:16,319
method of smoking right now dabbing yeah

371
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:19,199
we boil we've currently upgraded like

372
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:21,269

373
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,208

374
00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:27,600
a pipe right yep pipe in pipe and

375
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:29,578
flowers are bong in bong and flowers if

376
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,680
I had a bong handy but I broke my

377
00:14:29,578 --> 00:14:33,599
beautiful bong a while ago rest in peace

378
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,109
bond yep and have just been piping it

379
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,879
for a long time and then recently

380
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:41,159
upgraded to an oil rig and a nice nail

381
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,139
and a torch and I've been doing a lot of

382
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:44,759
dabs lately but flowers are still sort

383
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,190
of my first love Mike should I put some

384
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,629
delicious Jilly bean hash today big

385
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:54,839
shout out for that right on thank you

386
00:14:48,629 --> 00:14:57,240
that's a delicious yeah yeah but

387
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:02,689
honestly the most common way I consume

388
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:06,000
these days is with tincture really I do

389
00:15:02,688 --> 00:15:09,659
three milliliters of synergy which is a

390
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,289
half THC half CBD tincture compound

391
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:15,179
that's really really low dose and I take

392
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:17,039
it sort of as a preventive morning and

393
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:21,269
evening to help keep the inflammation

394
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:23,639
down before it gets bad and that seems

395
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:26,519
to work wonders for my knees and for my

396
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:27,539
back what do those cost for a customer

397
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:31,709
uh

398
00:15:27,539 --> 00:15:34,528
forty forty bucks before tax for a

399
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:37,018
hundred milligrams total so for me

400
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:38,610
that's a week's worth of meds okay Wow

401
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:40,679
okay forty bucks for a week worth of

402
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,839
meds yep you get thirty doses per bottle

403
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:45,120
and I'm taking six a day so it's not

404
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:46,699
even a seven-day week for me it's a

405
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,139
five-day week for me all right

406
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:52,289
dang okay so it's worth it for 40 bucks

407
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:54,329
I was paying more when I was just taking

408
00:15:52,289 --> 00:15:56,610
pills oh yeah oh yeah pills are

409
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:58,349
expensive yep even if you've just got a

410
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,180
copay or something pills yeah I was just

411
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,720
doing a copay and it was still 90 bucks

412
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:02,250
a week

413
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,569
I got some vicodins when I got some

414
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,370
wisdom teeth pulled they're going to get

415
00:16:03,568 --> 00:16:07,469
those was like 14 bucks for like seven

416
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,480
pills and that was the generic [ __ ] I

417
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:12,389
don't even really need them why not a

418
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,519
bunch of money for when I stopped taking

419
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:15,778
pills I was on two different pain

420
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,959
medications

421
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:21,179
neither of them were opiates but neither

422
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:22,888
of them worked for [ __ ] either and then

423
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,239
I was on a third med to help cope with

424
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:26,639
some of the side effects from the first

425
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,120
two of course and when I started smoking

426
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:34,019
regularly and first got access to CBD

427
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:35,730
flour I didn't have a need for the pills

428
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:37,409
at all the next day so I just didn't

429
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:39,449
take them one day and then I didn't take

430
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:41,578
him the next day either nice so now

431
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:43,379
you're drug-free well except for

432
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:45,359
cannabis your drug-free bro I don't

433
00:16:43,379 --> 00:16:51,149
think is like a drug that's a plant man

434
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:57,509
it's a plant totally a drugs just a very

435
00:16:51,149 --> 00:16:59,240
good one so how long does this go ahead

436
00:16:57,509 --> 00:17:01,110
to get some sale well no I was just

437
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,039
interesting what he was saying but I was

438
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:07,019
thinking while he was saying that that

439
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:13,240
since I'm primarily using concentrates

440
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:16,299
now I got incomplete

441
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:18,849
of two narcotic medications that I was

442
00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:21,279
getting through my doctor Wow

443
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:21,818
from smoking concentrates on a daily

444
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:23,859
basis

445
00:17:21,818 --> 00:17:32,849
smoking concentrates on a daily basis

446
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:35,949
how long how often do you smoke probably

447
00:17:32,849 --> 00:17:36,789
starting within an hour after I wake

448
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,080
okay

449
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:40,029
yeah because you got to keep the pain

450
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,210
away before it sets in right yeah so get

451
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:45,910
a head start on the pain and then

452
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:48,490
throughout the day it's not like a sit

453
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:50,259
down smoke fest for me it's it's just

454
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:51,670
you've dipped the pacifier hanging on

455
00:17:50,259 --> 00:17:54,429
your neck so you got it right around my

456
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:57,759
neck take a couple of rips and as I'm

457
00:17:54,429 --> 00:18:01,090
going on my merry way that's one of the

458
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,890
things I really like about my pen I find

459
00:18:01,089 --> 00:18:04,928
myself using it when I get home

460
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,640

from just medical to medical and

00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:24,178
card on Wednesday yeah we keep up on

521
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:28,308
that you can find wreckage in a range of

522
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:33,090
prices between like 25 and 30 gram up to

523
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:35,819
98 gram here locally but it's not always

524
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:37,918
quality no there's still a lot of real

525
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:40,470
mediocre amateur product on the market

526
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,179
right now because we're are even our

527
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:44,899
legal market doesn't have all of the

528
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:47,490
things in place that it should quality

529
00:20:44,898 --> 00:20:49,709
standards are still a little axe we're a

530
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:51,808
little off topic did you buy any of the

531
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,909
live wax from the spot the tiara

532
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:55,859
concentrates I have not purchased any

533
00:20:53,909 --> 00:21:00,049
but I have consumed some I would like a

534
00:20:55,859 --> 00:21:04,019
review of that stupendous stupendous

535
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:07,079
that works for one word just the word I

536
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:08,368
got some dozen flavors on the shop now

537
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,288
but I got some of the star dog and it

538
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:12,538
was incredible guys I maybe investigate

539
00:21:10,288 --> 00:21:15,749
investing in so I just the night I

540
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:17,398
dropped my rig I got to try it and so

541
00:21:15,749 --> 00:21:18,929
that was the consolation ten minutes

542
00:21:17,398 --> 00:21:20,008
later while I was mourning the loss of

543
00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:24,090
my original rig

544
00:21:20,009 --> 00:21:25,839
I got to hit some what was 98 gram is

545
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:28,449
now 75 gram hash

546
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,369
uh-huh very cool yep very cool let me

547
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,930
step in there after after work tomorrow

548
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:35,909
and grab some of that and a couple other

549
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:39,039
things all right call me if you do yeah

550
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:40,930
all right so I asked Doug how quickly it

551
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,490
works how he consumes it and how much of

552
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:43,630
it he uses now I want to jump to Mike

553
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,430
we've talked about how he's using

554
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:47,170
tinctures I want to ask about when

555
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:51,580
you've been dabbing lately how many dabs

556
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:56,259
does it take for you to feel relief one

557
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:59,049
to feel relief two to kind of push the

558
00:21:56,259 --> 00:22:00,430
pain down to where it's sort of like

559
00:21:59,049 --> 00:22:02,799
your toe edge is it's no longer

560
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:04,390
something of it's something you're aware

561
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:07,680
of but it's not something of importance

562
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:11,350
and that's how I feel after work is

563
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:12,940
usually about three what I think of as

564
00:22:11,349 --> 00:22:18,399
Mike sighs dabs which are fairly small

565
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:22,000
dabs after a third day yeah I was gonna

566
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,670
say maybe 0.1 a dab maybe even a little

567
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,059
less than that sometimes but after about

568
00:22:24,670 --> 00:22:30,850
three like there's some intoxication and

569
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:32,859
like a lot more fun going on then then

570
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:35,529
just medical effect but that first dabs

571
00:22:32,859 --> 00:22:38,529
all just turning the pain down from a

572
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:40,509
five down into the one or a two range

573
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,950
all right so two and a half dabs would

574
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:43,359
be cool but you take that number three

575
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,970
because you can't take a half dab right

576
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,679
and then uh then there's something then

577
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:50,890
there's some intoxication going on all

578
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,720
right but get but you can handle six or

579
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:57,540
eight - yeah I can sit here and take

580
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,539
eight or ten and still be coherent a

581
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:02,410
little giddy all right so let's get to

582
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,500
the the synergy drops that you've been

583
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:08,529
taken um you said you take three

584
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,910
milliliters how often a three

585
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:12,700
milliliters in the morning and the three

586
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:17,050
at night and the dosing is 1.7

587
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:19,980
milligrams of THC and CBD per milliliter

588
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:23,440
so if I remember this I'm taking about

589
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,180
5.8 milligrams of each in the morning

590
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,670
and then in the evening now I could

591
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,920
drink the whole 100 milligram bottle so

592
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:32,170
50 milligrams of both it just drink it

593
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,660
down like a shot or a chug like a beer

594
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:37,150
and not get much intoxication from it

595
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:38,950
but if I take it in small doses in the

596
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,730
morning in the evening it feels like my

597
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:41,230
knees now

598
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:43,569
we get to the point where they're really

599
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:45,370
swollen and stiff and achy okay and my

600
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:48,308
neck never gets to the point where it's

601
00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:50,138
just a solid bar of muscle cramped up

602
00:23:48,308 --> 00:23:52,000
trying to protect those vertebrae that

603
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:54,099
are squeezing nervous it's nerve stems

604
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,138
going down that arm all right and you

605
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:58,959
guys I feel like my mic is really hot

606
00:23:56,138 --> 00:24:02,439
I'm sorry part of what why they're doing

607
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,690
the THC CBD combo is I believe that you

608
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,730
need both cannabinoids to get into your

609
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,259
bloodstream to work together to hit the

610
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:10,360
mind a little bit to take your mind off

611
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:13,240
of things to work on the the THC hits

612
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:16,209
the nerve pain I think the CBD goes for

613
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,638
the like the swollen stuff I think

614
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:21,399
together you don't get super high from

615
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:24,579
it you don't feel much high from the CBD

616
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:26,829
THC 50/50 combo because the CBD really

617
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:29,288
feels like it calms down the high it

618
00:24:26,829 --> 00:24:32,349
does it's there's research into that CBD

619
00:24:29,288 --> 00:24:35,829
keeps the THC high from being quite a

620
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:37,058
psychoactive so the the CBD helps kind

621
00:24:35,829 --> 00:24:39,759
of tone it down there's I've heard

622
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:41,798
people carry CBD pills from time to time

623
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,359
when there's gonna be extreme

624
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:45,490
consumption going on just in case

625
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:47,319
anybody goes a little overboard they've

626
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,359
got sort of a come down lever that thank

627
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:51,038
your girlfriend takes a big dab and

628
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,319
can't handle her [ __ ] you just give her

629
00:24:51,038 --> 00:25:12,879
a CBD dab and she'll relax a little in

630
00:24:53,319 --> 00:25:16,450
theory in theory I hope so cartoons yeah

631
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,809
all right so how much does this energy

632
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:22,179
cost 40 a bottle yeah that's right yeah

633
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:24,519
okay and it lasts you a week five days

634
00:25:22,179 --> 00:25:26,440
five days all right and Doug's plinth

635
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:30,069
pan if you go to a dispensary it's gonna

636
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:33,340
be 40 45 30 maybe 25 if you kids because

637
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:36,908
and find like member pricing and you get

638
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:39,278
that first-time shopper there's a couple

639
00:25:36,909 --> 00:25:41,919
that I've seen advertised on certain

640
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:45,548
days at certain times right have a

641
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,640
special or something something like that

642
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:49,599
what

643
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:53,540
never been able to find a constant

644
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:55,699
quality like you deliver right well

645
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:58,099
that's the garden of Weeden so uh the

646
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,230
difference yeah between a good caregiver

647
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:03,769
a bad caregiver is being sort of

648
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,809

did not have to charge Doug anything for

650
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:10,519
the hash that he consumes but it doesn't

651
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,900
always come from me so I have to go get

652
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:13,220
it so I have to just relay it and I

653
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,530

shotgun you can't be as tall as we are

669
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:52,490
and not have any issues yeah I think so

670
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,109
I think that's true cuz my knees get

671
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,640
wobbly sometimes when I'm tired like

672
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:58,159
they just get like shaky and my hips

673
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:59,900
hurt and then uh I've got some stomach

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,710
problems but so I take fat fat dabs you

677
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,600
guys I take some more between 0.3 and

678
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:11,329
0.5 I like to smoke about a gram and a

679
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:13,490
half a hash a day I do that in about

680
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:15,710
three sessions throughout the day I'll

681
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:17,359
take about one dab in the morning right

682
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,039
one like not right when I get up give

683
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:20,119
myself like get up get the morning

684
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,559
shower and get dressed

685
00:27:20,119 --> 00:27:23,299
right before I leave I'll take one dab

686
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:25,359
just so that I'm kind of crispy when I'm

687
00:27:23,299 --> 00:27:27,919
getting where I'm going at lunchtime I

688
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:29,959
may get a little dab like about a point

689
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,820
three and then do it bro take some of

690
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:33,319
that CBD oil and then after work I'll

691
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:35,599
come home and take like a point five and

692
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:37,220
then before the show I did about a point

693
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,509
five and then later on in the evening

694
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,910
before bed I'll just drop like another

695
00:27:38,509 --> 00:27:42,710
point five instead of taking thirty dabs

696
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,570
throughout the day I take like six or

697
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,519
seven of them I guess maybe three to six

698
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:49,460
fat dabs throughout the day mm-hmm and

699
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,549
that keeps me well medicated it's

700
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,740
expensive but since I'm the I produce it

701
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:56,869
myself mostly like that part or I get it

702
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,950
from Spence garden of Weeden kind of

703
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:59,809
guys I don't know if I should be saying

704
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:01,250
that much on the show but since the

705
00:27:59,809 --> 00:28:03,319
Weedon can supply us with quality hash

706
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,180
and dispensaries I work at a shop that

707
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,889
can supply me with quality hash then I

708
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,259
go to a medical shop and buy a bunch of

709
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,670
[ __ ] all the time but I smoke a lot and

710
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:13,670
I stay well medicated I like to eat

711
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:16,070
edibles but they hit me hard yeah hard

712
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:17,420
hat edibles hit you the yeah they hit me

713
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:19,669
hard too but it's because you're

714
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,350
consuming a hundred percent of it right

715
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:23,720
is sting within your body you're not

716
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:25,730
blowing out thirty five percent of what

717
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,940
you just to again right okay

718
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,589
it takes a little longer the rush is a

719
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:34,279
little different the way that it feels

720
00:28:30,589 --> 00:28:35,929
when it starts to get into your

721
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:38,299
bloodstream I feel like it comes on

722
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:41,990
slower but hits a lot harder yeah I do

723
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:43,339
too I can more of a body healing crow

724
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:46,930
how did you do that did you take some

725
00:28:43,339 --> 00:28:46,929
CBD oil and some of the jellybeans

726
00:28:50,109 --> 00:29:05,629
prepared with the email cord and the dab

727
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:08,089
rig and the microphone in his face it

728
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:09,710
looks like the pothead Olympics yeah

729
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:13,720
some kind of stoner obstacle course

730
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,720
management [ __ ] cord management

731
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:17,569
alright cuz I want to ask him when he

732
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:19,160
gets done coughing I'm gonna ask him

733
00:29:17,569 --> 00:29:21,829
about how he likes edibles and how they

734
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:24,019
work for him but Doug you were talking

735
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:26,599
earlier about how medicine just totally

736
00:29:24,019 --> 00:29:29,450
uh helps your like psychological the

737
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:32,089
whole thing is that do you need a sativa

738
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,830
or does a CBD medicine get to your head

739
00:29:32,089 --> 00:29:35,839
a little bit as well when you smoke the

740
00:29:33,829 --> 00:29:37,490
Tora Bora the Tora Bora is really high

741
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,549
in CBD so you can use that as a specific

742
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:41,200
okay yeah and I really like the Tora

743
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:43,819
Bora

744
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,370
shout out to DNA genetics for breeding

745
00:29:43,819 --> 00:29:52,429
it and shout it to the person they got

746
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:56,329
me a cut there we go yeah you can tell

747
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:58,450
between different strains even with some

748
00:29:56,329 --> 00:30:00,859
that say there are the same string of

749
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:03,149
different ways that it affects you as

750
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:06,748
you as you're ingesting it

751
00:30:03,148 --> 00:30:09,148
you know some more mentally than

752
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:11,009
physically so you kind of forget about

753
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:12,959
the pain before the relief of the pain

754
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,848
and sometimes just the opposite

755
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,879
all right the Tour Boras more of the

756
00:30:14,848 --> 00:30:19,710
relief of the pain and then okay aspect

757
00:30:17,878 --> 00:30:21,689
so it comes it knocks out the pain and

758
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,919
then later on it gets you high yeah all

759
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,269
right okay

760
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:25,950
okay I don't smoke a lot of the CBD

761
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:27,838
stuff you guys it doesn't do much for me

762
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,759
so these guys get all the CBD products

763
00:30:27,838 --> 00:30:30,960
that I get I was gifted that hash if

764
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:31,979
Doug want to dab it out one give him a

765
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,200
dab of that one too Mike

766
00:30:31,979 --> 00:30:40,369
make sure Doug get some TV it's hard to

767
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,869
get big dabs the CBD oil bit is super

768
00:30:40,368 --> 00:30:44,519
this snappers got a flat tip on it they

769
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:47,128
may work a little bit better trouble

770
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:51,808
yeah mom's new was so cold it felt like

771
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:53,398
it was burning for a second you guys

772
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,808
winter is here in cold I don't know

773
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:56,788
about what your the fall is certainly

774
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:58,138
here in solar on Oh yep you need a

775
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:59,759
long-sleeve shirt when you drive to work

776
00:30:58,138 --> 00:31:02,008
in the mornings and done changed yeah

777
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,558
you know and speaking medically I know

778
00:31:02,009 --> 00:31:06,690
we're talking about pain yeah I'd love

779
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,178
to hear what you have to say but I'm

780
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:12,359
disabled with post-traumatic stress

781
00:31:09,179 --> 00:31:15,450
disorder okay and I know there's been a

782
00:31:12,358 --> 00:31:18,468
lot of studies looked at I think that

783
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:21,569
it's probably the best medicine for it I

784
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:24,749
had been prescribed many other things

785
00:31:21,569 --> 00:31:26,519
but I believe that cannabis is probably

786
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:29,338
the best thing that I've ever had that

787
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,919
helps me control what goes on with that

788
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:34,138
you know I I don't want it yeah I

789
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,339
probably got a similar thing I don't

790
00:31:34,138 --> 00:31:36,778
want to compare myself and I probably

791
00:31:35,338 --> 00:31:37,979
got something I'll agree with you and if

792
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:39,239
I start thinking about [ __ ] then I don't

793
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:41,278
even want to think about I can make

794
00:31:39,239 --> 00:31:42,690
those things not happen in my mind it's

795
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:44,460
just by coming and just taking a couple

796
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:45,629
of dads and it may be part of the ritual

797
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:48,058
like you were saying earlier I've just

798
00:31:45,628 --> 00:31:49,319
done grab a dad get into the internet

799
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:51,960
play around for a minute my brain will

800
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:55,528
change yeah yeah it's also you know for

801
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,058
me it's real hard for Easter love to go

802
00:31:55,528 --> 00:31:59,579
where anywhere there was lots of people

803
00:31:57,058 --> 00:32:02,038
it's not that way anymore I really have

804
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:03,658
to get prepared to go to the grocery

805
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:05,638
store not because I don't know what I'm

806
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:09,149
gonna get because I get the same thing

807
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:12,418
every time but just to deal with with

808
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:12,898
people in close quarters is make you

809
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,729
nervous

810
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:16,418
it just makes me uncomfortable Oh guys

811
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:19,149
would rather not do if I come up in

812
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:21,369
parking lots completely full or you look

813
00:32:19,148 --> 00:32:25,018
over in the baskets are almost all gone

814
00:32:21,368 --> 00:32:30,038
I just go back home okay you know which

815
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:32,798
even if I really need the food go back

816
00:32:30,038 --> 00:32:35,470
Oh chill for a little bit and wait for

817
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:38,108
the crowds to die down cheesy yeah not

818
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:40,659
that bad you know sometimes you can't do

819
00:32:38,108 --> 00:32:44,319
that you know you got other people

820
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:47,049
depending on you then you suck it up and

821
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:49,778
you do it and sometimes faced with those

822
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:52,628
types of situations cannabis definitely

823
00:32:49,778 --> 00:32:55,269
helps me deal with them okay it's a

824
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:57,908
little bit of anxiety oh yes a little

825
00:32:55,269 --> 00:33:00,128
bit of social anxiety okay all right so

826
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:02,230
if anybody's listening that doesn't

827
00:33:00,128 --> 00:33:03,788
think that this [ __ ] is good for PTSD

828
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:06,339
because in Colorado we cannot get it

829
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:07,898
validated as a No I can qualifying

830
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:09,878
condition for medical treatment or for

831
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:12,459
medical use if you guys think that

832
00:33:09,878 --> 00:33:14,259
that's not a reason to use it

833
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,579
listen to this dude this is an honest

834
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:17,440
guy this dude has never lied to me I

835
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:18,788
believe every single word that Doug has

836
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:30,500
ever said yeah he's got a reason to lie

837
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:34,210
to me dude these kids and beyond the

838
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:34,210
[Laughter]

839
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,798
person that gave it to me I don't know

840
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:49,898
if they want to be mentioned on the show

841
00:33:47,798 --> 00:33:53,378
or now they do nice work the pain is

842
00:33:49,898 --> 00:33:56,258
mounting as we speak yes yeah that

843
00:33:53,378 --> 00:33:58,329
cherry flavor yep yeah the CBD I saved

844
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:59,769
all that for you guys it's way over here

845
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:00,720
just kind of tucked away until you guys

846
00:33:59,769 --> 00:34:04,179
showed up

847
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,700
that's delicious cherries it is it's

848
00:34:04,179 --> 00:34:08,619
like a mouthful of cherries out of the

849
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,449
Hitman rate with the elevat-- drop down

850
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:18,490
on the e nail because we're champs over

851
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:19,779
here al you son climbed up there oh yeah

852
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,128
this carbon cap needs to be cleaned a

853
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,798
little bit they get quite filthy around

854
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:25,298
here anybody needs a dad there's a

855
00:34:23,798 --> 00:34:26,139
little wax in here I think you guys be

856
00:34:25,298 --> 00:34:29,048
cool for a minute

857
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:29,800
all right so Doug was talking about you

858
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:32,320
were talking about how

859
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:36,030
with the PTSD yeah you know and we you

860
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,030
know the military was looking into it

861
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:42,460
they found out that they didn't want to

862
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,650
do it right now but I think that if you

863
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:48,039
were toxin people that were suffering

864
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:50,650
from it I think we see a lot of them

865
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,360
around town now yeah absolutely

866
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:54,400
because this is where the help is yeah

867
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:56,200
yeah oh man so many people are coming

868
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:57,519
here any guys unfortunately what I've

869
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,349
discovered through some conversations

870
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:01,989
lately that a lot of children moving

871
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:03,909
here for CBD treatment betcha and those

872
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:05,500
people are falling into traps with

873
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:07,449
people that advertise that they can give

874
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,670
them CBD medicine and they're not

875
00:35:07,449 --> 00:35:10,839
providing the CBD medicine unfortunately

876
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,970
if you're looking for qualified

877
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,220
legitimate CBD medicine in Colorado

878
00:35:12,969 --> 00:35:16,569
somebody that can take on a new person

879
00:35:15,219 --> 00:35:19,359
and provide that it's going to be a

880
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:22,170
three-month wait maybe six months yeah

881
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:25,210
the caregivers are strapped and with you

882
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:28,990
the new regulations taking effect in

883
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:31,630
January I doubt many more people will be

884
00:35:28,989 --> 00:35:33,339
becoming caregivers I expect a number of

885
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,309
caregivers in business now to end up not

886
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:39,070
being caregivers sometime by the middle

887
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:41,380
of next year the state's really looking

888
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,850
to clamp down and kind of snap out that

889
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:44,079
whole section of our industry which

890
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,730
sucks for people like me and I

891
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,279
absolutely that's that's depressing

892
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:49,780
right now myself yep there's a lot of

893
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,460
new rules coming down the pipe that are

894
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,769
gonna make it incredibly difficult for

895
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,990
people to produce the amount of meds

896
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:58,000
they need for their patients and yeah

897
00:35:55,989 --> 00:36:00,059
and that's been that's by design so they

898
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,579
want everybody buying from the stores

899
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:05,619
and we're gonna see Walmart type stores

900
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:06,880
in the future right yep well like we

901
00:36:05,619 --> 00:36:09,130
talked about earlier I'm already having

902
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,360
this source other chatter to get you

903
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,769
guys supplied in your shattered because

904
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,240
everybody stepped up I don't know if it

905
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:19,480
was a good idea for me to step everybody

906
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:21,159
up to shatter smoke so much yeah I'm not

907
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,809
complaining but between the three of us

908
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:25,299
we clean out the garden that I grow yeah

909
00:36:22,809 --> 00:36:27,639
you know and other people that I know

910
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:29,800
are everybody's looking towards

911
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:32,829
concentrates right because so much more

912
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,240
convenient and it works better all the

913
00:36:32,829 --> 00:36:36,909
way around it's just a better product

914
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:39,219
right for me it's the time saver is what

915
00:36:36,909 --> 00:36:41,500
I've been enjoying lately yeah if my day

916
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:43,509
is full my hours are very

917
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,809
well allocated I don't have extra time

918
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:48,430
to grind up some bud pack a bowl sit

919
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:50,559
there and puff on it for a little while

920
00:36:48,429 --> 00:36:51,489
I just don't have that kind of time

921
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:53,799

00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,969
a shop and get a drink with a hundred

973
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,889
milligrams

974
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:53,358
that sucker living on the REC side you

975
00:38:51,889 --> 00:38:54,980
guys have to put ten milligrams in them

976
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,150
and drink ten of them the same effect

977
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,250
that's coming you can get a hundred

978
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:59,840
milligram drink right now but they're

979
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,340
taking that away if you can't carry the

980
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:04,730
stamp it's got to be in a 10 milligram

981
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:07,608
package period so if you can't stamp

982
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:09,199
your [ __ ] no more I mean you can't stamp

983
00:39:07,608 --> 00:39:11,210
like what's periods two liquids

984
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,739
popcorns granolas that kind of things

985
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:14,389
got to come to ten milligrams so they're

986
00:39:12,739 --> 00:39:20,089
actually going to put a stamp on

987
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:22,670
everything that's the plan yellow yellow

988
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:28,039
trying so that the teacher can see it

989
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:31,220
from across the room is like I've got a

990
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:33,259
triangle I'm like why isn't society

991
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:35,149
buddy whyatt but shouldn't be parenting

992
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:37,280
should you focus on parenting instead of

993
00:39:35,150 --> 00:39:40,849
labeling a [ __ ] up analogy that I came

994
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:45,560
up with is we we put a special symbol on

995
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:47,480
the fake guns not the real ones we got

996
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:50,119
we got to put a special pimple assemblee

997
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,769
yep right now off all your toy guns got

998
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:54,588
to come with a little orange nub on the

999
00:39:51,769 --> 00:39:56,239
[ __ ] front of it they do no real gun

1000
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:58,489
doesn't need nothing on it that's like

1001
00:39:56,239 --> 00:40:00,588
just so you know this is a gun gun and

1002
00:39:58,489 --> 00:40:02,659
not like a look-alike gun or a squirt

1003
00:40:00,588 --> 00:40:04,940
gun I wish somebody could have seen me

1004
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:07,969
pressing my for microphone in

1005
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,130
retardation but but now that all the pot

1006
00:40:07,969 --> 00:40:12,829
cookies have to carry a special [ __ ]

1007
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:15,470
warning symbol because people that have

1008
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:17,960
never been in a marijuana shop are

1009
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:19,789
convinced that they look just like Chips

1010
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,220
Ahoy oh yeah and that they're gonna be a

1011
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:23,779
party one day and one of us is gonna

1012
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:25,969
change out the real Chips Ahoy

1013
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,230
for the medicated chips of Hawaii no

1014
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:30,230
wait and then they're gonna kill

1015
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:31,730
everybody at their trip just nuts I'm

1016
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,349
gonna share the cookies about you guys

1017
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,869
my friends and I'm gonna tell you that

1018
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:39,200
hey there's weed in these eat them with

1019
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:41,119
me they've so much fear last Halloween

1020
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,348
that we're definitely gonna pose get

1021
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,510
ahead that way that was part of what I

1022
00:40:42,349 --> 00:40:45,559
was gonna ask here and then a minute I

1023
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:47,300
had two questions for you in the

1024
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:48,858
Halloween it was one of them because we

1025
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,150
were putting up Halloween decorations at

1026
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:51,559
the spot I was like do you guys really

1027
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:53,900
think that somebody's gonna give out

1028
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,239
some weed candy this year it might kind

1029
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,639
of beat me to it so yeah last year

1030
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:58,848
though they're gonna eat it themselves

1031
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:00,858
yeah

1032
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:02,730
the two big anti pod groups in the state

1033
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:05,489
like took out billboards

1034
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:08,369
with edibles out of their packaging next

1035
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:10,500
to candy edible treats that they look

1036
00:41:08,369 --> 00:41:12,690
similar to it was like if you can't tell

1037
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,639
the difference how were your kids and

1038
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:16,800
not a whole bunch of people in this

1039
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,690
state were convinced that the day after

1040
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,410
Halloween like the ers would just be

1041
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:23,940
full of kids that were just high yet it

1042
00:41:21,409 --> 00:41:25,559
didn't happen and it didn't happen for a

1043
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,300
lot of reasons mostly because it's the

1044
00:41:25,559 --> 00:41:31,559
dumbest crime ever right like there are

1045
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:33,780
so many better ways to get a felony you

1046
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:36,449
can't hand out dirty candy on Halloween

1047
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,950
and have like that leads right back to

1048
00:41:36,449 --> 00:41:39,598
you and there's no payoff for the

1049
00:41:37,949 --> 00:41:41,699
criminal there right you got about three

1050
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,769
hours worth a he's a sick [ __ ] that

1051
00:41:41,699 --> 00:41:45,629
likes to hurt kids like doesn't like to

1052
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:49,769
hurt kids in theory and it was expensive

1053
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:51,300
right like 25 bucks a [ __ ] piece like

1054
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:53,940
who's got that kind of money to get

1055
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,250
local kids stoned right I'm gonna eat

1056
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:58,500

1057
00:41:56,250 --> 00:42:00,329
candy that your kids got on Halloween

1058
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,940
and you suspect that it is medicated

1059
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:04,950
with cannabis you seen that [ __ ] you can

1060

1096
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,990
really funny because if when you think

1097
00:43:29,949 --> 00:43:34,539
that the links we've gone to as a nation

1098

their [ __ ] sidewalks covered with

1103
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:46,779
sugar cookies and all the parents think

1104
00:43:44,199 --> 00:43:48,519
they're insane because that they just

1105
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,130
happen to miss that part of their our

1106

me you're too stoned I'm not there we'll

1203
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:34,480
keep him on the down-low

1204
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:35,530
so lately guys the hot topic has been

1205
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,579
we're just gonna go on this one for a

1206
00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:38,079
couple of seconds because I wrote it

1207
00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:40,060
down and I just want to be able to cross

1208
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:41,950
it off because I'm a completionist how

1209
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:43,920
do you guys feel about professional

1210
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:46,569
athletes being able to use marijuana

1211
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,769
first in their on season and also in

1212
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:49,510
their offseason it's two different

1213
00:47:47,769 --> 00:47:50,619
subjects you're on the clock and not off

1214
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:51,940
the clock i think when you're with the

1215
00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:53,890
team they kind of own you so we have to

1216
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:55,088
make two separate separate subjects then

1217
00:47:53,889 --> 00:47:56,769
I say that wrong is I'm not good to say

1218
00:47:55,088 --> 00:47:58,500
you don't look like no I don't mean it

1219
00:47:56,769 --> 00:48:01,690
like that bro I do kind of maybe you do

1220
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:03,579
yeah it really depends on your take on I

1221
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:07,420
just you always be careful with that

1222
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:12,760
particular verbage yeah in this case

1223
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:14,470
you're not totally in the wrong they

1224
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:18,550
live under some pretty insane [ __ ]

1225
00:48:14,469 --> 00:48:26,949
regiment yeah you're under seasoned well

1226
00:48:18,550 --> 00:48:29,079
it doesn't their house yeah so alright

1227
00:48:26,949 --> 00:48:30,699
so you're on the clock basically during

1228
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:31,900
the on season the whole season from the

1229
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,819
time season starts from whatever

1230
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:35,410
preseason training times bring whatever

1231
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:37,210
spring training when it starts you're on

1232
00:48:35,409 --> 00:48:38,618
the clock until that Super Bowl or

1233
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,710
whatever your team is [ __ ] finished

1234
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:43,599
do you fail or win right you're on the

1235
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:47,650
clock so should you be able to use

1236
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,359
cannabis to alleviate your pains or for

1237
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:51,940
whatever reason [ __ ] it's a it's a

1238
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:54,848
recreational state the genero protectant

1239
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:58,088
research coming out that's really

1240
00:48:54,849 --> 00:49:01,450
promising it might really help deal with

1241
00:48:58,088 --> 00:49:04,389
concussions brain injuries that kind of

1242
00:49:01,449 --> 00:49:06,309
thing really yeah it might be insanely

1243
00:49:04,389 --> 00:49:08,230
[ __ ] helpful from the only get bashed

1244
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:11,619
in the face for a living rugby players

1245
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:14,079
people like boxers are just taking place

1246
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:15,519
right now so you feel that on their

1247
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,970
offseason is what I'm asking about now

1248
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:21,130
you to consume cannabis medical or

1249
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:23,108
recreational oh for sure yeah on there

1250
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:24,430
during the offseason as much as they

1251
00:49:23,108 --> 00:49:26,588
brought as much as they'd like right

1252
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:29,169
they can they can drink alcohol or only

1253
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:30,759
takes in color okay in any state there

1254
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:32,470
are adults in all 50 states

1255
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,119
if I was King the world would have been

1256
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:36,118
legal for everybody a long time okay

1257
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:42,338
okay so then I'm sure you're gonna say

1258
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:44,769
that yes to this one also do you think

1259
00:49:42,338 --> 00:49:46,509
that these guys and I'll ask about

1260
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:47,340
specific sports after I generalize we'll

1261
00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:48,750
just will kind of narrow

1262
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,010
down do you think that professional

1263
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:52,500
athletes should be able to consume

1264
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:54,510
cannabis on during the on season like

1265
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:57,059
the night after a game maybe the day

1266
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:57,780
before a game maybe what if you're a

1267
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:59,130
better one

1268
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:00,780
what if you're a better player when you

1269
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:06,150
smoke a fat joint what should they be

1270
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:07,980
able to play okay right

1271
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:09,389
but how many other performance-enhancing

1272
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:15,980
drugs are those other football players

1273
00:50:09,389 --> 00:50:18,659
using well see this is so not a joking

1274
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:21,449
well no they're legitimately testing

1275
00:50:18,659 --> 00:50:22,949
people as though it's steroids right and

1276
00:50:21,449 --> 00:50:25,829
that when they're looking for steroids

1277
00:50:22,949 --> 00:50:28,799
they also look for pot is no they're the

1278
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:30,929
same and that's nuts like about it the

1279
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,789
best it's helping you focus on keeping

1280
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:34,679
you from being in pain while you you

1281
00:50:32,789 --> 00:50:46,590
know what I mean it's not making you

1282
00:50:34,679 --> 00:50:48,419
stronger or faster no issues with people

1283
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:50,940
consuming cannabis when they're not at

1284
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:52,349
work okay like there are a lot of people

1285
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,550
who do [ __ ] that's kind of well that's

1286
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,380
why I'm thinking about sports like

1287
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:57,840
football players crash into other people

1288
00:50:55,380 --> 00:50:59,309
with bodies yeah and yeah there's a lot

1289
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,900
of power there like that needs to be

1290
00:50:59,309 --> 00:51:03,539
precisely controlled or somebody's gonna

1291
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:05,099
die right and like I'm down for us to go

1292
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:06,360
watch people kill each other but we need

1293
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:10,650
to give them like swords and just call

1294
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:12,240
it gladiatorial getting football players

1295
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,160
intoxicated and letting them rush to

1296
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,419
each other's not how we get there that's

1297
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:21,000
gonna be one of the things people tweet

1298
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:27,990
about Mike's point and me saying that

1299
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:34,170
people own people I apologize now I

1300
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:37,109
realize what I said sometimes we step in

1301
00:51:34,170 --> 00:51:39,090
the trap words are hard these days yes

1302
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:40,110
I'm politically erect well everything

1303
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:43,500
means eleven things

1304
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:44,849
yes exactly alright so we all think that

1305
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,900
sports athletes the professional

1306
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:46,920
athletes should be able to consume

1307
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,780
cannabis they're allowed to drink

1308
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,430
alcohol if they so choose yeah and in

1309
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,560
Colorado we've pretty much put the same

1310
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:56,789
rules on booze or on the same rules on

1311
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:58,559
cannabis so what they mirror it on yeah

1312
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:59,759
they can most of us can go out after a

1313
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,529
hard day of whatever we do

1314
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,390
and we how many how many other people

1315
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:05,670

1316
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:07,529
damn living like why can't these people

1317

alternative hell great yeah completely

1330
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:39,239
excellent so I mean it didn't have to be

1331
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:42,090
confined to places where you can't be

1332
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:45,089
seen absolutely yeah where you have to

1333
00:52:42,090 --> 00:52:49,230
hide adults like to gather and enjoy in

1334
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:51,690
toxicants with other adults I mean it's

1335
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,880
literally this way it's always been

1336
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:55,829
you're taxing us for us or it give us

1337

street corner or in many cultures this

1344
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:16,829
is where people get together enjoy

1345
00:53:14,130 --> 00:53:18,840
intoxicants and yeah having a place

1346

00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:12,769
[ __ ] all right I don't think we

1459
00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:14,150
have a lot else to say we didn't give

1460
00:57:12,769 --> 00:57:16,550
edibles enough credit edibles are

1461
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:17,869
awesome they're very medicinal they take

1462
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:19,519
a little bit longer that work but when

1463
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:21,049
they do boy they really right you have

1464
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:23,420
to plan a little better without a way

1465
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:25,370
yeah it's smoking so much simpler

1466
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:27,680
because you can titrate your dose really

1467
00:57:25,369 --> 00:57:29,089
really well you know how hard what

1468
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,159
you're to what you just took is gonna

1469
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:32,390
hit you immediately if you want a little

1470
00:57:31,159 --> 00:57:34,119
more you can take a little more if

1471
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:36,679
you're good you're good you know that

1472
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:38,420
with edibles it takes and I want to have

1473
00:57:36,679 --> 00:57:40,579
to kick in and you can't honey drugs

1474
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:43,250
yeah which is a bonus if you can't sleep

1475
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:44,659
eat yourself edibles and then get stoned

1476
00:57:43,250 --> 00:57:45,920
and then try to go to bed and then

1477
00:57:44,659 --> 00:57:47,149
hopefully you're sleeping and those

1478
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,619
edibles will kick in while you're

1479
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:50,780
sleeping and keep you asleep through the

1480
00:57:48,619 --> 00:57:52,940
night that's what I've been doing with

1481
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:55,030
edibles all summer long yes I'll get a

1482
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:58,250
hundred milligram package and eat like

1483
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:01,040
ten milligrams at eight ten milligrams

1484
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:03,139
at nine twenty at ten and twenty at

1485
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:04,969
eleven and then when I go to bed they're

1486
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:08,539
kicking in for the first few hours of a

1487
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:10,789
sleep sweet there you go and then have a

1488
00:58:08,539 --> 00:58:13,039
full night's rest yeah wake up eight

1489
00:58:10,789 --> 00:58:15,259
hours later feeling great so let's

1490
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,699
quickly we've talked about dabs and

1491
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:18,290
smoking dabs and flowers

1492
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:21,019
we've talked about edibles we talked

1493
00:58:18,289 --> 00:58:22,909
about teachers we talked about your vape

1494
00:58:21,019 --> 00:58:25,039
pen there we've kind of left out like

1495
00:58:22,909 --> 00:58:26,899
rubs and creams is all I think that's

1496
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,099
left and I've got one other product that

1497
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:30,019
we can talk about if we have a couple

1498
00:58:28,099 --> 00:58:31,400
seconds but you look like you got

1499
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:33,829
something to say about no I when you

1500
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:36,349
said rubs and creams I've talked to some

1501
00:58:33,829 --> 00:58:38,509
people in my age bracket that are using

1502
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:41,360
some of the creams for arthritis

1503
00:58:38,510 --> 00:58:44,360
and in swear Brian think it's it's it's

1504
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:46,130
the best thing since sliced bread I did

1505
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:47,450
not take them seriously and then a

1506
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:49,660
friend of mine gave me a bottle as a

1507
00:58:47,449 --> 00:58:51,949
sample and I gave somebody a massage

1508
00:58:49,659 --> 00:58:55,149
just from the shoulders to the mid back

1509
00:58:51,949 --> 00:58:58,250
is all she let me do but by then my

1510
00:58:55,150 --> 00:59:00,440
fingers felt fluffy Wow like I was

1511
00:58:58,250 --> 00:59:02,300
wearing balloon gloves so now I take it

1512
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,800
seriously she was like wow that was like

1513
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,420
a huge massage I was like it's that

1514
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:07,400
Apothic and it was Apothic can of pain

1515
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:09,980
cream is what I used and it I definitely

1516
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:12,320
give the pains and saps credit no I did

1517
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:15,019
not before but after that I believe I'm

1518
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:16,880
a believer yeah yeah I had one of the it

1519
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:18,949
was one of the first generation topical

1520
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,660
lotions in Colorado just just random

1521
00:59:18,949 --> 00:59:21,769
lotion in a bottle with like a company's

1522
00:59:20,659 --> 00:59:24,049
stick around I don't remember what the

1523
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:26,090
brand was but I use it for after

1524
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:27,860
trimming to help absorb the rest of the

1525
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:30,110
trichomes off my skin that I can get

1526
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:31,670
washed off I'm gonna work wonderful for

1527
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:34,370
that but it would also help ease the

1528
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:36,530
pain from trimming wow I mean you spend

1529
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:39,259
seven eight hours is room like a madman

1530
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:41,420
your fingers cramp up one hands holding

1531
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:42,800
a little stem all night all day and the

1532
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:45,110
other ones working a pair of scissors

1533
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:46,970
for that whole shift it hurts yeah yeah

1534
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:48,800
that pain cream I mean an hour after I

1535
00:59:46,969 --> 00:59:51,079
used it I felt like I hadn't been at

1536
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:52,460
work although it was great shadow said

1537
00:59:51,079 --> 00:59:56,480
the ladies that trimmed my weed for me

1538
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:59,000
the other night yeah good job so we've

1539
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,320
covered it seems like we've covered 90%

1540
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,690
of the consumption methods have either

1541
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,190
of you guys tried Mike's had some teas

1542
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:07,159
but those work they did have any

1543
01:00:04,190 --> 01:00:09,950
medicinal value uh the teas that I was

1544
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:12,859
really into on most of that I mean the

1545
01:00:09,949 --> 01:00:15,049
dose was so low and the quality was so

1546
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:16,730
sketchy back then that it was probably

1547
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:19,130
just a good flavored tea that I liked

1548
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:21,139
paying five dollars a bag for okay um

1549
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:23,329
but there's a couple of teas on the

1550
01:00:21,139 --> 01:00:25,219
market that people swear by I haven't

1551
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:27,319
tried them yet I'm still working my way

1552
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:29,599
down the Edible case nice how about a

1553
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:33,110
transdermal patch have you tried one of

1554
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:34,940
those yet I have a friend who did in an

1555
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:38,090
effort to treat fibromyalgia with the

1556
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:40,940
CBD patch and she said it worked but not

1557
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:43,789
as well as smoking okay and she really

1558
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:46,980
likes uh she's got a CBD oil cartridge

1559
01:00:43,789 --> 01:00:50,550
for her vape pen that she really really

1560
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:55,920
I suffer from fibromyalgia myself used

1561
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:57,750
to be on lyrica okay yeah about 9,000

1562
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:59,670
side-effects on the commercial yeah yeah

1563
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:03,199
okay they're all smiling and talking

1564
01:00:59,670 --> 01:01:06,960
about anal drainage and stuff yeah

1565
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:10,230

hip pain at your age like I'm falling

1597

apart it's it's not just like when my

knees really start throbbing it's not

1599
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:30,539
just the knee is the muscles on either

1600
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:32,340
side of it tense up trying to protect it

1601
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:34,019
huh and then you walk a little funny

1602
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:37,230
trying to protect and by the end of the

1603
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:39,659
day everything below your nipples is

1604
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:42,570
sore because it's trying to keep your

1605
01:02:39,659 --> 01:02:44,399
knee from being really sore right and

1606
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:46,619
then living like that for weeks and

1607
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,300
months on end you just become exhausted

1608
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:50,250
and after years you start walking

1609
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:53,220
different you just are you know there

1610
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:54,659
being different it affects you greatly

1611
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:57,269
yeah and when you can't think of

1612
01:02:54,659 --> 01:03:00,349
anything else except pain when it's like

1613
01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:03,199
a high note right between your ears and

1614
01:03:00,349 --> 01:03:05,539
all that you can do is hear that scream

1615
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:10,969
that your mind is giving hey we're hurt

1616
01:03:05,539 --> 01:03:12,829
yeah you know do something sometimes she

1617
01:03:10,969 --> 01:03:14,750
changes it up not enough you can do at

1618
01:03:12,829 --> 01:03:16,849
that point right sometimes it's just you

1619
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:20,239
know sometimes it's just with that curl

1620
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:22,130
up and and invite the bullet until

1621
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:24,889
something you can do to give some relief

1622
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:28,220
you know sometimes heat sometimes cold

1623
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:30,250
sometimes pharmaceutical medicine so

1624
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:34,579
many people go to alcohol for though

1625
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:36,699
that's you know what we've seen since

1626
01:03:34,579 --> 01:03:38,929
the beginning of alcohol right yeah

1627
01:03:36,699 --> 01:03:41,239
people of always I remember my

1628
01:03:38,929 --> 01:03:42,619
grandparents we would talk about they

1629
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:45,469
take their shot and go that's our

1630
01:03:42,619 --> 01:03:48,949
medicine for the night at the end of

1631
01:03:45,469 --> 01:03:50,869
their lives however they wish that at

1632
01:03:48,949 --> 01:03:52,789
least that's what they told me was that

1633
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:54,469
they wish they had quit that earlier and

1634
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:56,449
they yeah yeah and that's one of the

1635
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:58,069
reasons I stopped earlier in my life I'm

1636
01:03:56,449 --> 01:04:01,779
glad you did like the way you are I'm

1637
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:01,780
not sure we'd get along if you drink no

1638
01:04:04,809 --> 01:04:10,039
such good bro I'm sure that I was a lot

1639
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:12,019
like you were when I drink yeah yeah

1640
01:04:10,039 --> 01:04:13,489
yeah we're a lot like each other that we

1641
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:16,610
don't yes absolutely

1642
01:04:13,489 --> 01:04:18,169
fist bump bro God every day so there's

1643
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:19,460
one more way of consumption that I can

1644
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:21,500
think of that we have not talked about

1645
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:25,820
that I have tried Mike's looking at me

1646
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:28,369
like the Lube brought the lube so I work

1647
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:31,490
at I were gonna dispensary and I got

1648
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:32,630
some Lube dude it it's called evos I

1649
01:04:31,489 --> 01:04:34,159
believe there's a couple different

1650
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:36,980
companies Gloria

1651
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:39,109
make it aureus the main one and then we

1652
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:43,039
carry evil okay because I got it from

1653
01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:45,410
the spot dispensary oh I didn't get high

1654
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,590
at all from it but yeah Doug's looking

1655
01:04:45,409 --> 01:04:50,239
at me like that kind of Lube yeah dude

1656
01:04:47,590 --> 01:04:52,010
that's the nice thing about topicals is

1657
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,529
there's not an intoxication with them

1658
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:56,840
right it's just a medical effect so the

1659
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:59,510
instructions said like spray three to

1660
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:04,460
four sprays on her so I went with like

1661
01:04:59,510 --> 01:05:05,840
hate because you know it wasn't spraying

1662
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,579
that much I just like spraying it on

1663
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,100
there and then it totally had sex with

1664
01:05:07,579 --> 01:05:13,759
this chicken it felt warm and tingly and

1665
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:16,750
like hot it was like hotter

1666
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:19,010
normally the temperature was higher and

1667
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:20,690
it took a little more effort to finish

1668
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:22,460
up to tell you the truth like it had to

1669
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:24,409
like wrap it up okay let me try a little

1670
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:26,329
harder I think you did a big review of

1671
01:05:24,409 --> 01:05:28,129
this on a previous show yeah we kind of

1672
01:05:26,329 --> 01:05:29,779
did but we also did a review of what

1673
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:31,460
happens when I smoke too much CBD and I

1674
01:05:29,780 --> 01:05:34,000
can't finish up at all we talked about

1675
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:34,000
that as well

1676
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:40,250
coconut oil and then they infuse it with

1677
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,990
THC they just pretty much think they put

1678
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:43,639
coconut oil in a crock pot throw a bunch

1679
01:05:41,989 --> 01:05:46,099
of bun there and then strain out the bud

1680
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:49,989
what I really think they do would not be

1681
01:05:46,099 --> 01:06:02,210
surprised to find that that's the recipe

1682
01:05:49,989 --> 01:06:04,519
it was just coconut oil it's good for

1683
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:05,840
everything if your hands are all sticky

1684
01:06:04,519 --> 01:06:07,159
and you can't get the resin off your

1685
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:08,600
hands from trimming a little bit of

1686
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:11,179
coconut oil I'll take that [ __ ] right

1687
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:12,230
off real quick yep million in one uses

1688
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:13,460
that's the first one I'll tell you about

1689
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:14,150
some of the other ones you don't even

1690
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,980
want to know

1691
01:06:14,150 --> 01:06:17,119
nope all right so we're gonna start

1692
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:18,409
wrapping up this show I tried to do it

1693
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:21,019
earlier but we've got so much [ __ ] to

1694
01:06:18,409 --> 01:06:23,809
say I think we've covered all ways that

1695
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:26,929
I am familiar with consuming cannabis we

1696
01:06:23,809 --> 01:06:28,880
did touch on on children about people

1697
01:06:26,929 --> 01:06:30,559
coming here because we talked about that

1698
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:32,090
a little bit yeah yeah I just like to

1699
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:34,750
make a quick point because I I know

1700
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:37,700
someone who has a special needs child

1701
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:41,800
seizures multiple times throughout the

1702
01:06:37,699 --> 01:06:45,409
day finally was able to get medication

1703
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:49,010
great and has changed their life yeah

1704
01:06:45,409 --> 01:06:50,929
180 degrees around good I mean if you

1705
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:53,240
don't believe in this stuff you need to

1706
01:06:50,929 --> 01:06:55,219
come and see what it does if you're

1707
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:57,169
worried about the children worry about

1708
01:06:55,219 --> 01:07:01,519
the ones that need this medication and

1709
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:04,869
right get it because it's made this not

1710
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:08,630
just this child's life much happier

1711
01:07:04,869 --> 01:07:10,789
enjoyable productive but if you've ever

1712
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:12,980
been a caregiver of someone who suffers

1713
01:07:10,789 --> 01:07:15,320
from something you realize that that

1714
01:07:12,980 --> 01:07:17,780
ripple expands out there far

1715
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:20,080
Oh far and when you give relief to the

1716
01:07:17,780 --> 01:07:23,000
one that everyone cares so much about

1717
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,039
that ripple expands and gives relief to

1718
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,119
everyone that cares

1719
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:30,070
about them absolutely you know if if

1720
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:31,779
you're a family moving here with a kid

1721
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:34,180
looking for CBD oil or if you're just

1722
01:07:31,780 --> 01:07:36,660
moving here looking for CBD oil take

1723
01:07:34,179 --> 01:07:39,909
your time to hunt down legit product yes

1724
01:07:36,659 --> 01:07:41,469
there are a lot of places we or Jeff

1725
01:07:39,909 --> 01:07:44,679
talked about a news article recently

1726
01:07:41,469 --> 01:07:48,099
that there's hemp extract oil being sent

1727
01:07:44,679 --> 01:07:49,989
from China if you can buy it online and

1728
01:07:48,099 --> 01:07:54,099
have it shipped to you it's not the real

1729
01:07:49,989 --> 01:07:56,319
thing if you can get it outside of a

1730
01:07:54,099 --> 01:07:58,630
dispensary you have to be standing in in

1731
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:01,269
Colorado there's a 50/50 chance it's not

1732
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:02,769
the real thing that's the truth if

1733
01:08:01,269 --> 01:08:04,929
you're lucky and you live in another

1734
01:08:02,769 --> 01:08:08,559
state that has a really solid medical

1735
01:08:04,929 --> 01:08:11,440
marijuana program and lab testing for

1736
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:13,269
cannabinoids is required you should be

1737
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,639
able to get the lab tests right there

1738
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:16,838
with your product you can check and see

1739
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:19,449
what you're buying right there in the

1740
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:21,220
store if you can't be a little sketched

1741
01:08:19,449 --> 01:08:22,750
out that you're buying stuff from a

1742
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:26,048
store that doesn't come with that that

1743
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:27,699
should be standard now with with

1744
01:08:26,048 --> 01:08:30,569
legalization in Colorado if they don't

1745
01:08:27,699 --> 01:08:32,769
have the lab tests they're full of [ __ ]

1746
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:34,359
it's it's just that simple

1747
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:36,460
yeah he's right he's telling the truth

1748
01:08:34,359 --> 01:08:38,140
home if it's legal product in Colorado

1749
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:39,670
you have to have that lab test that if

1750
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:41,588
the store clerk tells you they don't

1751
01:08:39,670 --> 01:08:43,088
have the lab test they're lying yeah

1752
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:44,529
they just want you to see something or

1753
01:08:43,088 --> 01:08:46,899
they don't want to they don't want you

1754
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:49,059
to see there's at least 18 percent THC

1755
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:51,279
or whatever right I'm or they're being

1756
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:53,170
lazy and don't want to grab it but yeah

1757
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:56,769
it's it's standard information now we

1758
01:08:53,170 --> 01:09:00,670
you should be able to find CBD meds in a

1759
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:05,920
range of ratios with THC anywhere from

1760
01:09:00,670 --> 01:09:09,548
like a hundred to one CBD to THC to one

1761
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:11,199
to one and two to one THC to CBD there

1762
01:09:09,548 --> 01:09:12,548
should be a good selection available to

1763
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,529

1764
01:09:12,548 --> 01:09:16,899
find it from a little legitimate dealer

1765
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:18,670

1766
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:19,659
looking for what we've got and finding

1767
