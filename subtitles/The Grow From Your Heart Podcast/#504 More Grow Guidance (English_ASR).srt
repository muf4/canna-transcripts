00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,509

82
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:57,329
grow from your heart at hotmail.com the

83
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,569
first email in today's episode goes a

84
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:02,459
lot like this it says dear Rasta Jeff I

85
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:05,069
have a question but first I would like

86
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:08,459
to tell you why I enjoy listening to

87
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,769
your podcast it says you speak well and

88
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,680
are well-spoken hey thank you that means

89
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,959
a lot to me I try to speak clearly I get

90
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,480
going way too fast for my own good

91
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,910
sometimes my brain travels much more

92
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,590
quickly than my mouth so I try to keep

93
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:24,900
that under control thank you for

94
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:26,459
noticing I'm trying to control my face

95
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:27,779
and make the right sounds I do

96
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:30,839
appreciate that

97
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:33,299
it goes on to say regardless of how much

98
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:36,779
knowledge someone may have I cannot

99
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,840
stand to listen to poor speakers or poor

100
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:42,119
quality audio I completely agree with

101
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,310
that if somebody calls in on a podcast

102
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,840
and I can tell they're on the phone or

103
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,269
if they're calling in on a shitty Skype

104
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:49,259
connection and there's a long delay or

105
00:04:48,269 --> 00:04:50,789
if it sounds like this and they're

106
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,800
talking from the phone behind the

107
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,050
microphone I can't [ __ ] stand it I

108
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,180
will not listen to that show so I agree

109
00:04:55,050 --> 00:05:00,120
with you I think quality audio is very

110
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,800
important I started off in the music

111
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,139
scene in the music industry before I

112
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,819
wanted to be a podcaster actually had

113
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:08,969
another friend who was doing a podcast

114
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,879
and he asked me to be a guest and I

115
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:15,030
actually refused to be a guest on his

116
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,399
show unless he allowed me to produce the

117
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:21,029
episode on which I appeared because

118
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:23,519
until then his show did not sound up to

119
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:25,649
my standards I have a lot of equipment

120
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,539
from the time I spent recording and

121
00:05:25,649 --> 00:05:29,399
producing and participating in the music

122
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,930
industry I used to play drums on the

123
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:33,539
road I've done a lot of music stuff I

124
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:35,579
had a lot of fancy toys so I told my

125
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:37,830
buddy come to my spot let's do your show

126
00:05:35,579 --> 00:05:40,199
here I got really good at recording I

127
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:42,269
made that podcast sound good in my

128
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,430
opinion so I've had a lot of practice

129
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:46,259
and I've come a long way so the short

130
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:49,439
answer to that is I agree with you bro

131
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,360
it's hard to listen to a poor quality

132
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,269
podcast and somebody that doesn't speak

133
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,250
well is even harder for me to listen to

134
00:05:54,269 --> 00:05:58,259
I'm gonna get back on track I told you

135
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,509
that lemon wreath dab got me [ __ ]

136
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:03,120
rambly I'm gonna try to focus for you

137
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:05,430
where are we it says you are very

138
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,680
knowledgeable and he presented well it

139
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:10,620
is obvious you take the time to plan and

140
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,240
lay out the podcast hey that means a lot

141
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,430
to me a lot of people probably don't

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,040
realize that it takes a little bit of

143
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,769
time and effort to actually create a

144
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,540
podcast the ideas have to come from

145
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:23,519
somewhere what am I going to talk about

146
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:25,560
if somebody didn't send me an email to

147
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,228
prompt my brain I don't have a subject

148
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:30,209
I've got to invent a topic I've got to

149
00:06:28,228 --> 00:06:31,918
make an outline then I've got to record

150
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:33,839
it then of course I edit it and I put it

151
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:36,000
up on all the servers it does take a

152
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,978
little bit of effort so thank you for

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,779
noticing that I do take a little bit of

154
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:41,250
time out of my life out of my day to

155
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:43,439
actually lay

156
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,629
the podcasts to make it something they

157
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,550
can be useful for many different

158
00:06:45,629 --> 00:06:48,930
listeners I want everybody to be able to

159
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,819
learn from this and it sounds like I'm

160
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,379
hitting my target let me keep moving

161
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:54,269
because there is a lot more to this

162
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:56,610
message it says you are funny

163
00:06:54,269 --> 00:06:58,829
which makes listening entertaining as

164
00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,319
well as informative I've said this

165
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:04,379
before when I went to school I loved

166
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:06,290
learning but I hated sitting there being

167
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:09,120
bored it felt like I was being lectured

168
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:11,670
many of my teachers did not have any

169
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,680
flavor or style to their teaching

170
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:15,480
they basically opened up a curriculum

171
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,329
book and shot it at us and we were

172
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,280
supposed to absorb it I did have a few

173
00:07:18,329 --> 00:07:22,649
teachers who would take their time and

174
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,419
actually learn their students and figure

175
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:26,639
out how we learn best and find the

176
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,560
obstacles we're experiencing and help us

177
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,229
get over those I had a few very

178
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,079
wonderful teachers but unfortunately

179
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,970
that was not the regular experience most

180
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:38,099
of the time I was bored in school or

181
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:40,110
frustrated in school I felt like I

182
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,390
learned things rather quickly and when

183
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,400
everybody else was catching on I was

184
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:46,079
finding a way to get in trouble so I

185
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,479
hated being in school but I loved

186
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,099
learning when I had entertaining

187
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,490
teachers or teachers that took a moment

188
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:55,500
to connect I really excelled so I feel

189
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,000
like if I sneak a couple of jokes or say

190
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,829
something a little bit silly just to

191
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,389
keep your attention going and kind of

192
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:01,740
it's like throwing you a treat you know

193
00:08:00,389 --> 00:08:03,029
what I mean you've had all this learning

194
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,530
that here's a little snack for your

195
00:08:03,029 --> 00:08:06,478
brain it's a little bit of a reward it

196
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:08,849
makes you smile it makes learning fun

197
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,680
and you want to do it more nobody wants

198
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,120
to be [ __ ] lectured so I try to keep

199
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,439
it a little bit fun that way it keeps

200
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,110
your attention that way you can learn

201
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:18,240
some stuff and have a good time so I do

202
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:19,830
appreciate that you think I'm funny but

203
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:21,689
do not encourage me

204
00:08:19,829 --> 00:08:24,449
I don't need encouragement to be the

205
00:08:21,689 --> 00:08:26,310
class clown I do appreciate all of the

206
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,319
compliments I do appreciate all of the

207
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,709
words of encouragement but let's move to

208
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,360
the question part of this email the

209
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:35,699
question goes like this now for my

210
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,979
question I listened to your series of

211
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,490
grow lessons which were very helpful in

212
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:44,400
episode 73 you discuss a perpetual grow

213
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:48,120
where you are harvesting one plant every

214
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,399
two weeks it says I like this idea but

215
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,740
how do you deal with the light being

216
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:54,720
further or closer to the plants since

217
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,240
they are all different

218
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,670
and that is a very good question so this

219
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,850
listener is listening to episode 73

220
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:05,459
where I did discuss creating a perpetual

221
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:08,310
harvest in a small environment I do

222
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:10,800
believe it was in a 5x5 tent under one

223
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:13,439
light where you've got four seven gallon

224
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,019
pots flowering at all times in that

225
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,000
perpetual scenario you would harvest a

226
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:20,610
seven gallon pot every two weeks and

227
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,769
replace it with a fresh seven gallon pot

228
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:25,050
now this person does raise a very

229
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:27,509
interesting point they ask what do you

230
00:09:25,049 --> 00:09:30,449
do with that brand-new pot that is much

231
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:33,120
smaller and much shorter than the plants

232
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,430
that have been in there for two four six

233
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,779
and eight weeks the light is at the top

234
00:09:35,429 --> 00:09:38,819
of the tent because you've got many

235
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:40,769
plants that have grown really tall what

236
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:43,440
do I do with this shorter plant that

237
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,299
hasn't had time to grow in the situation

238
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,460
I was talking about the light is not

239
00:09:45,299 --> 00:09:49,229
movable the light needs to remain at the

240
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:51,180
very top of the tent because we've got

241
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,090
plants that are fully mature in that

242
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:55,679
room so the light cannot be adjusted

243
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,960
that means we've got to work from the

244
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,639
bottom we can't move the light down so

245
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,400
we have either got to move the floor up

246
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:05,340
or figure out a way to raise the plant

247
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:07,919
so let's raise the plant a very common

248
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:10,259
way to lift plants up off the ground is

249
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,599
to get another pot the same size as the

250
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,059
pot you're using and simply flip it

251
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,250
upside down use it as a table and set

252
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:19,139
the pot right on top of that now a seven

253
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:22,470
gallon pot is probably going to lift you

254
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:24,720
up somewhere between 12 16 maybe even 18

255
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,790
inches just depending on the depth and

256
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,830
diameter of the seven gallon pot you've

257
00:10:26,789 --> 00:10:32,250
chosen to buy so that's going to raise

258
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:34,530
your plant up at least 12 maybe 14 16

259
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:36,929
maybe 18 inches and that should be

260
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:38,939
sufficient because that plan is going to

261
00:10:36,929 --> 00:10:41,579
begin to grow rapidly and it's only

262
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,100
going to be the smallest plant in the

263
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,870
room for two weeks so hopefully after

264
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,120
two weeks you can take that one off the

265
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,250
pot set it on the floor and the next one

266
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,889
that comes in can go on that inverted

267
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,309
pot so that is a very easy affordable

268
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:58,350
and safe way to raise your new plant up

269
00:10:56,309 --> 00:11:00,209
a little bit higher and get it closer to

270
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,920
the light and if you think about it

271
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:03,990
you've got one seven gallon pot upside

272
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,759
down that's probably will say sixteen

273
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,740
inches tall you've got another seven

274
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,278
gallon pot on top of that that's another

275
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,620
six

276
00:11:08,278 --> 00:11:12,360
inches at that point we are getting

277
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,850
close to three feet off the ground

278
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,769
before we've got any plant coming out of

279
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:18,509
the container if you're in a tent

280
00:11:16,769 --> 00:11:20,639
you've probably only got six and a half

281
00:11:18,509 --> 00:11:22,649
maybe seven feet worth of vertical

282
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,019
height minus your light so you're

283
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:27,749
already getting that plant plenty close

284
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,028
to the light in my opinion so that is a

285
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:33,420
very affordable and very effective way

286
00:11:30,028 --> 00:11:34,980
to raise your plant about 16 inches and

287
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:36,958
get it closer to the light

288
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,579
get it up there to the top of the canopy

289
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:40,229
and I understand that you want to get

290
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:41,909
that light to all of your plants but you

291
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,009
are going to have a little bit of a

292
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,610
difference that you cannot fight that's

293
00:11:44,009 --> 00:11:46,379
okay

294
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,629
those big butted plants are going to get

295
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:50,789
more light your smaller plants are going

296
00:11:48,629 --> 00:11:52,829
to get less light that is just fine in

297
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:55,139
that five by five tent if you've got a

298
00:11:52,828 --> 00:11:56,609
six hundred or a thousand watt light you

299
00:11:55,139 --> 00:11:58,799
will be pumping out enough light

300
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:00,600
throughout that tiny reflective space

301
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,849
where all of the plants should get

302
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,769
enough light to be happy and if you feel

303
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,990
like you may need to defoliate or move

304
00:12:04,769 --> 00:12:09,089
some branches over a certain way don't

305
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:11,009
be afraid to D foliate strategically

306
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:13,379
don't be afraid to bottom and lollipop

307
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:15,000
strategically if a leaf is blocking a

308
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:16,680
bud site feel free to take it out of

309
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,480
there eventually you'll learn how to

310
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:20,250
snap and pop the stems and just move

311
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,720
them the way you need them right out of

312
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:23,220
the way you'll be able to shape and

313
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,079
structure your plants the way you want

314
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,360
we will talk more about shaping and

315
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,549
structuring our plants in a future

316
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,399
episode alright let's wrap up this email

317
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:36,000

want their name said this one comes from

328
00:12:54,568 --> 00:13:00,479
our friend Trent and it goes just like

329
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:02,578
at this it says hey Rasta Jeff I'm a

330
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,069
longtime listener and I've learned a lot

331
00:13:02,578 --> 00:13:06,838
from you hey thank you for listening and

332
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:09,958
I'm glad you were learning from the show

333
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,579
it goes on to say I greatly appreciate

334
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:14,729
all of the info you give to our

335
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:17,159
community I do have one question I was

336
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:19,379
hoping you could help me with I just

337
00:13:17,159 --> 00:13:21,839
started to flower in my tent and I'm

338
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,090
looking into what I want to grow for my

339
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,100
to run I definitely want to grow

340
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:26,790
something from your line hey thank you

341
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,490
I'm honored

342
00:13:26,789 --> 00:13:32,099
it also says but I want to make sure my

343
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:35,250
environment is right for the seeds I buy

344
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,139
hey that is very smart of you to have

345
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:39,809
some forethought to make sure you get

346
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,120
the appropriate seeds for your grow

347
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:43,919
space many people just see some seeds

348
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,960
they see a strain they see some hype

349
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,519
they spend their money they get the

350
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,620
seeds they try to grow it their grow and

351
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,990
they go this does not work for what I

352
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:54,179
thought I was going to do so I'm really

353
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,250
proud of you for thinking about this in

354
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:58,409
advance and actually reaching out to the

355
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,879
guy who makes the seeds to get some

356
00:13:58,409 --> 00:14:02,549
guidance that's really smart of you I

357
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,639
wish everybody had the foresight you

358
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:08,969
were using now it goes on to say I'm in

359
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:12,990
a four by four tent with a 260 watt

360
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:17,700
quantum board and a rapid LED grow mal 5

361
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:19,590
V 3 2x2 do-it-yourself kit honestly most

362
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,540
of that is abbreviated and I'm kind of

363
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,879
proud of myself for nailing that on the

364
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,159
first try or at least I think I got it

365
00:14:23,879 --> 00:14:28,950
on the first try so our friend Trent is

366
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,839
growing in a 4x4 tent he's got two LED

367
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:32,879
lights in there I honestly don't know

368
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,470
about those two lights I don't know how

369
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,330
much light that is we're going to act

370
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:38,550
like that's enough light for the room it

371
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:40,680
goes on to say my tent is exhausted to

372
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:43,740
another part of my house so you're able

373
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,329
to move the humidity and heat away from

374
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:48,240
the plants hopefully you've got a carbon

375
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:51,750
filter in there it also says I grow in

376
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:54,360
an amended soil mix of cocoa perlite

377
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,429
worm castings and a bag of super soil

378
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,950
and ocean forests that sounds like a

379
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:01,019
great mix it says I don't use nutrients

380
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,280
and tell flour with all that stuff

381
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:04,230
you've got in there I think that's gonna

382
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,000
work we've got amended soil I don't know

383
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,440
the amendments but it sounds like you

384
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,629
probably put a lot in there you got

385
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,040
cocoa pearlite worm castings oh the bag

386
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:12,779
of super soil will get you through there

387
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,480
and the ocean forests will help you out

388
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:17,459
no nutrients until flower you may get a

389
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,930
better performance out of the veg plants

390
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:21,330
if you added a few things but if it's

391
00:15:18,929 --> 00:15:24,209
working for you keep doing that then it

392
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:26,970
says IU's nectar of the Gods nutrients

393
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:29,160
it focuses its regimen with a pH between

394
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,950
six one and six five that's gonna work

395
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:34,259
for you it also focuses on using calcium

396
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:35,550
as the main source of everything through

397
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,528
veg and through flour

398
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:39,419
I'm not familiar with how that line is

399
00:15:37,528 --> 00:15:41,220
made I just know that it is quality I've

400
00:15:39,419 --> 00:15:43,169
seen some great outcomes with it I don't

401
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:44,519
know any details about how they make it

402
00:15:43,169 --> 00:15:46,679
it sounds like you know enough and its

403
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:51,060
quality for you so keep doing that it

404
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:54,000
says there is 52 inches from my soil to

405
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:56,338
my lights however I use scrog Nets all

406
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,379
right so you can grow some semi longer

407
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:00,750
growing things with that much space 52

408
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:03,838
inches from the soil to the lights is

409
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,220
just over 4 feet so without those scrog

410
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,990
Nets you're gonna have to flip something

411
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,940
about a foot and a half two feet tall

412
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,799
which is not bad if you top it once you

413
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,329
can get a nice bush or if you're using

414
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,159
that strong net like you talked about

415
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:16,199
maybe you let it grow about a third

416
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:17,669
maybe halfway up and then flip it don't

417
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,140
let it go too tall because you will

418
00:16:17,669 --> 00:16:21,299
start getting close to the lights if

419
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,850
you're using one of my strains but let's

420
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:27,479
keep talking more about your environment

421
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:30,209
it says my temps at night are 76 degrees

422
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,339
and 84 degrees during the day I can

423
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:35,489
control the humidity with my humidifier

424
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,709
and dehumidifier I was hoping with all

425
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:40,440
of this information maybe we could

426
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:42,059
figure out a strain to grow I'm really

427
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:44,399
interested in doing a bit of phenol

428
00:16:42,059 --> 00:16:46,919
hunting to narrow down to the best 4 to

429
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:50,250
grow out so I would probably need like a

430
00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:53,009
5 to 10 pack and I would prefer fins as

431
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:54,389
well I hope to hear from you soon your

432
00:16:53,009 --> 00:16:56,159
friend Trent

433
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,958
all right Trent its ends like you've got

434
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,149
a pretty nice environment you don't have

435
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:02,819
too much of a day and night swing the

436
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:05,970
only major limiting factor here is that

437
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,919
52 inches from the soil to the lights

438
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:09,808
that is not much space for the way I

439
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,669
like to grow it sounds like you have

440
00:17:09,808 --> 00:17:14,039
figured it out by using these scrog Nets

441
00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:17,309
you were looking for recommendations

442
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:20,308
from my line you also indicated that you

443
00:17:17,308 --> 00:17:22,289
would prefer feminized seeds so let's

444
00:17:20,308 --> 00:17:25,529
talk briefly about some things I would

445
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:28,529
suggest for your grow space let's start

446
00:17:25,529 --> 00:17:30,599
off with feminized recommendations if I

447
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:33,660
were to recommend a couple of feminized

448
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,689
seeds for your space I would start off

449
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,190
with the orange gasm I think orange gasm

450
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:40,740
would work very well in your space

451
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:42,720
because it is a shorter and squatter

452
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,730
your plant you don't have a lot of

453
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,769
height so you do need a plant that

454
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:49,470
doesn't get too tall and orange gasm

455
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:51,628
will fit that bill it also will

456
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,129
a little bit earlier so you don't have

457
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:54,839
to worry about it stretching for that

458
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:57,569
extra week or two

459
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:59,388
another feminized seed I would recommend

460
00:17:57,569 --> 00:18:02,939
for your grow is the Michelangelo

461
00:17:59,388 --> 00:18:05,369
Michelangelo is quite similar to the Sun

462
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,679
kiss because it has that same Platinum

463
00:18:05,369 --> 00:18:10,500
tangi female plant in the mix the

464
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,019
difference is the orange gasm is made

465
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,000
with a golden goat reversed female and

466
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:18,870
the Michelangelo is made with a

467
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,058
blueberry cookies reversed female both

468
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:23,579
of those are feminized both of them are

469
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:26,278
going to offer very orange candy

470
00:18:23,579 --> 00:18:28,528
dominant turps the Sun kiss is going to

471
00:18:26,278 --> 00:18:31,079
be more orange and possibly grapefruit

472
00:18:28,528 --> 00:18:33,480
II the Michelangelo is going to be

473
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:36,148
oranges and some sort of candy and

474
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,339
skittle e-type flavors those strains are

475
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:40,319
both very forgiving and very easy to

476
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:42,869
grow and I think it would work very well

477
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,450
in your temperatures and with your

478
00:18:42,869 --> 00:18:48,869
nutrient mix and in your space

479
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:51,720
another feminized cross that I think may

480
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:54,538
work well for you is the golden goat if

481
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:56,909
you are able to scrog it properly the

482
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:58,079
golden goat will perform very well in

483
00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:00,000
that environment

484
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,668
I love golden goat in a commercial

485
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,950
setting because it reacts very well to

486
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:06,778
being netted down it makes a lot of

487
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:09,120
branches and it loves that type of

488
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:11,220
training in the description of your room

489
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,589
you said the room hits 84 degrees which

490
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,710
mean you may have a possible spike of 85

491
00:19:13,589 --> 00:19:19,319
or 86 on occasion the golden goat will

492
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:21,210
handle temperature spikes it does not

493
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:23,460
get mad at you if it gets a little bit

494
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:25,340
hot in your grow room so the golden goat

495
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,048
may work for that high temperature

496
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:30,388
environment you also indicated that this

497
00:19:28,048 --> 00:19:31,888
would be your winter run so maybe you'll

498
00:19:30,388 --> 00:19:34,199
be able to push it and keep it nice and

499
00:19:31,888 --> 00:19:36,089
cool in there but just in case that

500
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,308
golden goat if it grows too close to the

501
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:40,439
light it may be able to tolerate those

502
00:19:38,308 --> 00:19:42,000
higher temperatures so those are the

503
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,298
three that I would recommend if you want

504
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,490
to stick with feminised seeds from my

505
00:19:45,298 --> 00:19:49,378
line I feel like the lemon Geoffrey may

506
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:51,720
get too tall on you in that space

507
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:53,428
if you don't scrog it and also it does

508
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,829
get a little bit long so you may get a

509
00:19:53,429 --> 00:19:57,690
little bit of space between your buds it

510
00:19:55,829 --> 00:20:00,509
may not be ideal for the scrog

511
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:02,419
environment with such a low type of

512
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:04,489
situation I would prefer

513
00:20:02,419 --> 00:20:05,960
two or three layers of sprog nets for

514
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:08,509
the lemon Geoffrey because it is going

515
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,159
to get long really quickly but I do

516
00:20:08,509 --> 00:20:12,499
think you would have great success with

517
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,269
golden go feminized seeds I think you

518
00:20:12,499 --> 00:20:16,069
would have great success with Sunkist

519
00:20:14,269 --> 00:20:18,798
and I also think you would have great

520
00:20:16,069 --> 00:20:21,138
success with Michelangelo seeds in that

521
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,569
grow now let's talk about a few things

522
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:26,418
you could do if you don't want to run

523
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:28,189
feminized seeds the number one

524
00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:29,690
recommendation from my line I would

525
00:20:28,190 --> 00:20:33,019
suggest if you're going to go with the

526
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:36,080
regular seed would be prana prana stays

527
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:38,269
nice and short nice and squat nice and

528
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,759
bushy you can spread it out real far and

529
00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:42,739
she doesn't mind being stretched and

530
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,720
scrubbed and trained out she'll actually

531
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:47,569
respond very well to that type of

532
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,339
treatment prana actually finishes quite

533
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:51,499
early you may find a phenotype that

534
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:53,628
finishes at the end of week seven maybe

535
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:55,819
at the end of week eight the longest

536
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:58,099
they should go is nine weeks so I think

537
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:58,908
prana would work beautifully in your

538
00:20:58,099 --> 00:21:02,778
environment

539
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:05,539
I can also recommend morning do morning

540
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:08,028
do likes to be strong morning do likes

541
00:21:05,538 --> 00:21:10,460
to be stretched out she will produce big

542
00:21:08,028 --> 00:21:12,528
fat chunky buds but they won't get super

543
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:15,350
tall and stretchy on you so it will work

544
00:21:12,528 --> 00:21:17,419
very well in that scrog environment I do

545
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:19,278
recommend with most of my strains if

546
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:21,470
you're gonna do a scrog in that

547
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:23,419
fifty-two inch space I would put the

548
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:25,819
first net about a third of the way down

549
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:28,220
and then put that next net probably half

550
00:21:25,819 --> 00:21:30,019
way or maybe a little bit higher up than

551
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:31,879
half way so that you've got some support

552
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,769
I would like to see two layers of scrog

553
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:36,288
net in that environment if that's at all

554
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:38,329
possible the first one is a spreader the

555
00:21:36,288 --> 00:21:41,028
second one acts as a support and then

556
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:43,699
try to fill that entire environment with

557
00:21:41,028 --> 00:21:45,858
giant chunky colas and my third

558
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,749
recommendation for your environment if

559
00:21:45,858 --> 00:21:50,509
we are not going to do a feminized seed

560
00:21:47,749 --> 00:21:53,028
would be Sun kiss Sun kiss is the

561
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:55,099
Platinum tangi to arise it does like to

562
00:21:53,028 --> 00:21:57,499
stay nice and short and squat and it

563
00:21:55,099 --> 00:22:00,019
puts off that wonderful orange aroma it

564
00:21:57,499 --> 00:22:02,089
is very similar to the orange gasm it is

565
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:04,249
very similar to the Michelangelo because

566
00:22:02,089 --> 00:22:06,230
it's got that platinum tangi mom in

567
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:08,210
there you can tell I really enjoy

568
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:10,069
breeding to the Platinum tangi big shout

569
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:11,450
out to Maddie and Spence from the garden

570
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:13,819
of Weeden they are the ones who made the

571
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,669
Platinum tan G that I love so much but

572
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:19,278
that plant makes short squat bushy

573
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:20,749
spring and it is very easy to grow so

574
00:22:19,278 --> 00:22:22,308
that's why I breed with it that's why I

575
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:24,350
work with it so much and that's why I

576
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:26,388
recommend it so much for this type of

577
00:22:24,349 --> 00:22:28,488
situation so if you're going to run

578
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:31,278
regular seeds I would recommend the

579
00:22:28,489 --> 00:22:33,319
prana the morning dew and the Sun kiss

580
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,898
if you're not a super experienced grower

581
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,849
and you want a really easy grow I would

582
00:22:35,898 --> 00:22:39,498
go with one of those fem lines and I

583
00:22:37,849 --> 00:22:41,599
would go with one of the orange dominant

584
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:44,509
ones either the Michelangelo or the

585
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:46,668
orange gasm if you want to run regular

586
00:22:44,509 --> 00:22:48,889
seeds and you want a really easy grow I

587
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:51,049
would recommend that Sun kiss if you're

588
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:53,089
an experienced grower I would recommend

589
00:22:51,048 --> 00:22:55,158
maybe trying that golden goat if you

590
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:57,648
want to go with regular seeds then you

591
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,139
can try the prana or maybe the morning

592
00:22:57,648 --> 00:23:01,699
dew or maybe the Sun kiss the morning

593
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:03,769
dew is probably going to be the most

594
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,350
challenging plant out of all of those

595
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:08,628
the Sun kiss and the morning dew should

596
00:23:06,349 --> 00:23:10,759
be quite easy to grow I will tell you

597
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:12,738
now that if you grow the prana or the

598
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:14,899
morning dew and that type of environment

599
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:17,419
be prepared to do some defoliation

600
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:19,518
because both of those plants get quite

601
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:22,730
large leaves and you'll want to pull off

602
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,319
some of those big hand sized leaves to

603
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:27,618
keep the airflow and the light

604
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:29,358
penetration optimal in your tight space

605
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:31,069
all right Trent I want to thank you for

606
00:23:29,358 --> 00:23:33,319
