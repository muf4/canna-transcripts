promised

207
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:36,159
myself most of that's the dab i just

208
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,639
took

209
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,120
um part of that's the the support it's

i truly appreciate it mike appreciates

214
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:50,000
it uh we were joking before the show i

215
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,918
made a joke on another episode that mike

216
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,879
spends the patreon funding on his kids

217
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:55,519
and he goes buddy

218
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,879
you couldn't be more right so true super

219
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:57,918
funny yeah the kids are getting spoiled

220
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,279
because of you guys so

221
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,560
uh the kids i'm not gonna say their

222
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,079
names we'll keep their names private on

223
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,720
the show but those two little guys

224
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:06,240
are sending you guys uh sticky fist

225
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,759
bumps

226
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,160
right if you're wondering where i am

227
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,038
it's it's uh small children

228
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,400
are exhausting yeah yeah that's why he's

229
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,399
not on the show that's also why he's

230
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:18,079
hidden when it's that's why we've got

231
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,638
him hidden away in a small dark space

232
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:20,639
right now

233
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,879
he's just sequestered from the family

234
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,560
for a moment so he can get some time

235
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,918
and if you're not on video this is sort

236
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,079
of a weird

237
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,240
moment of the show but the background

238
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,680
behind me is flat black so i really just

239
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,800
do look like a floating head right now

240
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,918
on this completely do

241
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,000
you've been called the floating head in

242
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,598
the videos uh i am learning more about

243
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
video production probably worse

244
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:41,759
we'll get mike up to speed i have been

245
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,519
using uh some of my patreon

246
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,199
contributions for things to improve the

247
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:45,918
show and once i get my show where i want

248
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,680
it we're gonna get

249
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,120
some of my patreon contributions over

250
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,120
toward mike's area to get his

251
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,319
recording space looking as good as mine

252
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,959
uh we owe it to the

253
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,560
to mike and to the audience here so yeah

254
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,318
we're gonna do that mike this is a good

255
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,918
flow this may turn into a long episode

256
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,560
we did not intend for this long of a

257
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:04,399
show but

258
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,160
i think we took the appropriate dabs

259
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,679
today we're dabbed

260
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,879
i was involved they like it when we

261
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,720
ramble

262
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,479
oh they most certainly do that's going

263
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,319
to be a good one uh mike is this the

264
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:18,000
time of the show where we segue into the

265
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,000
email portion of the podcast you want to

266
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,720
jump right into that part

267
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,240
i think we should we checked off all the

268
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,039
the essentials right we did

269
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,639
any ads we did the shout outs we did the

270
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:30,800
intro song

271
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,399
yeah it's time to talk about the topic

272
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
of the show yeah we covered all the

273
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,599
important stuff we said thank you to the

274
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
people that help us make the show happen

275
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,919
and that is really the important part

276
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,278
we reminded that advertiser and you say

277
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,439
appetizers

278
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,399
appetizers are complete onto the meal

279
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,080
all right oh i thought you said

280
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,159
advertisers and i was jokingly saying

281
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,560
appetizers but you did say appetizers

282
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:51,600
i said appetizers come on bro i'm stoned

283
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:54,399
you're gonna make me hungry

284
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,959
um let's focus in here just a little bit

285
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,039
because it's

286
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,639
early to jump off the jumping board uh

287
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,278
the diving board this early into the

288
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,199
show

289
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,399
i've got a great email in front of me do

290
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
they want their name

291
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,278
said it's just letters and numbers

292
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,879
anyway so i'm not gonna say their name

293
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,720
uh it says ross to jeff i listened to

294
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,720
your podcast today and there was a short

295
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
portion on grow safety if you followed

296
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
the show a little while back i've done a

297
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
done a couple of episodes now on keeping

298
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,040
yourself and your grow safe

299
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,159
i don't want you poking your eye i don't

300
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:21,199
want you going to jail i don't want you

301
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,679
burning down the house

302
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,519
so i've done what i can to update you on

303
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,879
ideas of how to keep your grow and your

304
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,320
family and yourself safe

305
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:30,000
while you were growing in the house we

306
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,839
don't need problems in the house so

307
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,519
uh this goes on it says you said

308
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,959
something that i have often thought

309
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,720
about if someone shows up

310
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:38,479
and there is some dank in the air how

311
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,120
would i explain that

312
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,039
[ __ ] away so this person lives

313
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,039
apparently in prohibition land

314
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,319
and they want they've got a good excuse

315
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:47,278
so if somebody knocks on the door and

316
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,959
they say hey bro

317
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,360
we smell cannabis in your house there is

318
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,759
a problem this person has a wonderful in

319
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,200
my opinion what could be a wonderful

320
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,278
excuse and i want some feedback from

321
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,560
mike to see if he thinks this would fly

322
00:09:57,278 --> 00:10:03,360
he said my answer is to have

323
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,078
a quarter or two of hemp buds in the

324
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,680
house

325
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,439
if anyone comes over knocking on the

326
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,679
door about the odor and so

327
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,959
inside or out i hand over the hemp buds

328
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,559
and say sorry sir

329
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,000
i ordered this on the internet here's

330
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,719
the packaging and everything

331
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,440
i was under the impression that cbd hemp

332
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,720
was now

333
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,000
okay i might cost me 50 bucks but i know

334
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,759
someone is paying attention

335
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,600
and it will keep my ass out of jail that

336
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,799
is like a good warning that somebody

337
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,480
knows you're smoking in there and you

338
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,240
need to adjust and adapt and maybe get

339
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,200
rid of some things and maybe stop doing

340
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,600
some [ __ ]

341
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,278
uh it says no one knocking on your door

342
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,959
would have any further reason to believe

343
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,720
it was anything else unless you look

344
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,599
like a stoner high guilty

345
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,040
uh which would be the thing not to do in

346
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,680
prohibition land yeah

347
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,278
i am very blessed and lucky uh to live

348
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,239
here in colorado where i can have these

349
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:49,919
dreadlocks you guys

350
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,440
these dreads are tied up in a nice big

351
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,360
old bundle right now because they do get

352
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,760
ridiculous these things go to

353
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,800
uh my calf region and i am six and a

354
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,000
half feet tall

355
00:10:56,799 --> 00:11:01,838
so these things are a little bit

356
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,679
ridiculous i can't look like this

357
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,360
bro that's absolutely what it is in

358
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,559
georgia florida

359
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:10,240
alabama texas it's all and hey

360
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,159
i said uh i've made some jokes about

361
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,919
texas on a previous show that i was on

362
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,120
i'm sorry texas i still love you guys

363
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,838
there are great people down there in

364
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,879
texas

365
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,600
those were jokes i'm funny laugh with me

366
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:23,120
um but so yeah we can't look like this

367
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,320
in [ __ ] a lot of places mike we're

368
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,919
very blessed that we have

369
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,360
legal cannabis here and i think the

370
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,879
police know that guys that look like you

371
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,399
and i we're not the ones with the other

372
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,278
drugs on us we're the ones with the

373
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,799
cannabis because

374
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:34,240
you can tell the crowds apart i think

375
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:36,078
and cinnamon now there's no need to [ __ ]

376
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,519
with us like that guy's a wheathead

377
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,799
wheat is legal we're gonna go mess with

378
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,440
the other heads because they're the

379
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,559
problems

380
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,920
they'll get the ones going through your

381
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:43,039
trash and [ __ ] trying to break into

382
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,319
your house

383
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,199
um so yeah don't look like a stoner is

384
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,800
rule number one

385
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,800
mike how do you feel about this approach

386
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,559
if we were in let's just pick a state

387
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,639
you i'll let you pick a state so nobody

388
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,879
bashes me for bashing a state

389
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,879
well no that's my my thought on it is

390
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,639
that it really really really really

391
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:04,399
really depends on where you live um

392
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,959
a lot of places have already

393
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,440
preemptively stepped on this excuse for

394
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:11,199
why it smells like herb at your place

395
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,360
and said that smokable hemp isn't

396
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:16,959
allowed even though cbd

397
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,919
or legal hemp sort of is allowed

398
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,399
okay there's uh at least one state

399
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,799
that's

400
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,759
still saying it doesn't matter what the

401
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:27,439
feds say about

402
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:29,360
industrial hemp we say no still um

403
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,120
there are a lot of states who haven't

404
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,560
invested in the technology to

405
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,919
definitively prove

406
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:37,199
high thc cbd no thc

407
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:39,039
so i'm going to cut you off because you

408
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,320
just said something that uh i forgot

409
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,439
what i was going to cut you off for oh

410
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,278
some states

411
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,680
we said colorado said hey fed [ __ ] you

412
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,600
we're going legal other states have said

413
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:49,039
hey [ __ ] you with your cbd we still

414
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
don't want it i didn't realize that that

415
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,838
was a thing

416
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,440
there's opposition just they can oppose

417
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,160
just like we approved the fed that's

418
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,600
pretty cool

419
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,600
i didn't even realize that that was a

420
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
thing sometimes i'm ignorant ignorance

421
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,560
is bliss

422
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:05,839
um but uh

423
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,359
if this ploy has any effect or a

424
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
positive effect

425
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,720
really depends on where you're standing

426
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,480
okay um

427
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:17,278
a lot of places it smells like herb here

428
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,839
is still probable cause for a search on

429
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,879
its own

430
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,839
um so even if you say

431
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:28,240
it smells lit or it smells like this

432
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,160
because of this legal reason at the door

433
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,278
they're going to say it doesn't matter

434
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,199
we still get to search

435
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:34,639
and work right still smells like

436
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,000
cannabis and we need to make sure it's

437
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,959
not cannabis

438
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,198
in places like colorado smell alone is

439
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:44,719
no longer probable cause

440
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:46,639
and so um like unless you're driving and

441
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,079
it smells like burnt joint

442
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,879
but um it's your home it's a grow

443
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,679
situation

444
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,879
at home i had a it's been an interesting

445
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,479
for you i'm going to totally interrupt

446
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:57,919
you and i apologize but that's

447
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,159
that's this is a good thing it's worth

448
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,000
it it's worth it um i have a friend

449
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,278
who was pulled over in the great state

450
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,639
here of colorado

451
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:10,078
and he was not even allegedly he was

452
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,399
straight up smoking a blunt enjoying his

453
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,559
ass

454
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,480
smoking a blunt and he got pulled over

455
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:16,559
and he said i'm smoking a [ __ ] blonde

456
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,079
i'm not even gonna try like and he took

457
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,198
a couple of fat rips off of it and put

458
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:20,879
it in the ashtray and rolled down the

459
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:22,319
window and said what's up officer

460
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,159
and the cop said whoa it smells like

461
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,000
wheat in there what's your hurry and my

462
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,958
buddy goes i'm trying to go to a thing

463
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,480
he's actually going to

464
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:30,799
he was meeting me somewhere it's like

465
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,759
i'm going to a thing and uh

466
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:33,120
trying to get there and the cop goes

467
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,720
yeah we're driving a little bit too fast

468
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,078
to be smoking a [ __ ] blunt you might

469
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,199
want to slow yourself down and gave him

470
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,719
a speeding ticket

471
00:14:37,198 --> 00:14:40,399
and my buddy was like kind of freaking

472
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,920
out and he was all like paranoid and the

473
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,039
cops like you can relax or we know

474
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,240
you're smoking in there but you don't

475
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,639
seem intoxicated

476
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,440
he told him that consumption did not

477
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,360
constitute

478
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
impairment and he's like you seem fine

479
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,919
you're driving too fast you weren't

480
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
swerving you weren't doing anything

481
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,000
wrong

482
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,839
slow it down if you're gonna smoke a

483
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,679
blunt while you're driving and sent him

484
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,600
on his way dude

485
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,120
it's up to the cop how much they want to

486
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,560
[ __ ] with you yeah

487
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,198
um and unfortunately right now

488
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,278
um there's a lot of stories where they

489
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:10,799
choose to [ __ ] with you extra

490
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,439
right there's also plenty of stories

491
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:17,198
where they choose to [ __ ] with you less

492
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,279
um and unfortunately wildly

493
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,719
we're going the same place [ __ ] very

494
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,078
we're headed the same place it depends

495
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,600
on what you look like and where you're

496
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:27,120
located yep

497
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,839
yep um i've been fortunate

498
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,278
i get away with stuff um there's a

499
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,519
reason why we nicknamed you

500
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,120
why i i'm gonna take the honor why i

501
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,799
nicknamed you white mike because you

502
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,399
look like a white guy just a basic

503
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:38,958
general white guy not gonna cause any

504
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,639
problems

505
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,919
also you guys just for an update i call

506
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,600
him white mike because if i'm ever

507
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,838
breaking two rules at a time he will

508
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,440
remind me only break one law at a time

509
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,360
they'd be like hey you're smoking that

510
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,720
blunt and going [ __ ] 90 pick one

511
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,680
either flick the blunt out the window or

512
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,360
go 70

513
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,958
like he'll remind me he's always like

514
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,720
one he's my free

515
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,159
legal guidance he's one of my [ __ ]

516
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,079
best friends on the planet and he's good

517
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:01,600
at [ __ ] psychology and law

518
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,159
that's my white friend over there that's

519
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,879
why mike and i just get to say you can't

520
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,639
give yourself a nickname like you don't

521
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,039
right if it's a real nickname you didn't

522
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,480
have a hand and craft in it

523
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:17,599
um but yeah this uh i

524
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,639
i i just talked to somebody who

525
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:24,240
was busted growing they had a uh

526
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:27,278
an odor control failure um

527
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,720
a passerby alerted the authorities

528
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,879
by the time person got home from work

529
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,440
they had a why the [ __ ] you growing all

530
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:41,519
this weed problem on their doorstep and

531
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,639
they tried to say it was all legal hemp

532
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,560
um luckily

533
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,919
cops don't go to school for lots of

534
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,479
stuff and they

535
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,599
the school they go to isn't real long or

536
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,519
detailed

537
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,879
and so a lot of officers have no [ __ ]

538
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,360
idea what they're looking at or what

539
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,439
they're talking about which has led to

540
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,120
a lot of amusement on my part and

541
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,558
probably in the community's part when we

542
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,160
see a bust

543
00:17:04,558 --> 00:17:07,678
and they're taking the news crew through

544
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,199
the grow house and they point at a

545
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,240
carbon filter and go

546
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,839
this is a co2 generator and then it's

547
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,279
like man the only thing that got right

548
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:17,038
was the lights

549
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:19,759
right i've seen that video by the way

550
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:23,038
that's funny but uh

551
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,119
in practical terms um one of the things

552
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,558
i told that person is if

553
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,159
they took all the plant matter which

554
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,558
they tend to do

555
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,160
they uh they do exactly what you see

556
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:34,000
them do they stuff all the plants in a

557
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,798
bunch of trash bags

558
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,480
and then haul that to an evidence locker

559
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,558
anyone who's grown

560
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
anything knows that when you do that to

561
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,079
a living plant

562
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,400
what you've done is you've killed a

563
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,439
marijuana farm and you've started a mold

564
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,840
farm

565
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,798
so by the time that product gets to a

566
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:55,599
lab can they tell if it's thc or cbd

567
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:57,679
product who the [ __ ] knows

568
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,879
i think varies wildly from state to

569
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,640
state based on

570
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,799
technology i can smell that moldy

571
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,960
[ __ ] dead plant in that bag it's like

572
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:10,879
lawn clippings plus puke

573
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,880
uh-huh and it doesn't take long to mold

574
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,039
out either you take a bunch of plants

575
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,799
stick them in a plastic bag you stick

576
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:18,079
that in the dark you come back a couple

577
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:22,240
of days later you've got a

578
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:24,480
big [ __ ] bag of mold um

579
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,319
and it's the same thing with the the

580
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,640
hemp flour if you say no it smells like

581
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,960
that because it's hemp flower

582
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,919
if you're lucky they take the hemp

583
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,798
flower

584
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,520
or take your word for it if you're not

585
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:37,519
lucky

586
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,679
they send it off to get tested they come

587
00:18:37,519 --> 00:18:41,440
back an hour later with a warrant

588
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,200
i mean we actually got to be careful

589
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,400
does not seem like a good ploy

590
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,160
we have to be careful with the claim

591
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,320
that it's hemp flour because now with

592
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,160
the farm bill and a bunch of hemp acts

593
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,839
you were required to have licensing and

594
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,960
permits to grow to commercially

595
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,959
cultivate hemp

596
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,720
it is almost safer to grow cannabis than

597
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,079
it is to grow hemp so if they come

598
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,360
and you're growing cannabis and they say

599
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,918
is this weed or hemp and you say it's

600
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,359
hemp

601
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,559
they're going to go get the department

602
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,918
of agriculture and you're supposed to

603
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,720
have a [ __ ] license for that and you

604
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
can still

605
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,160
get as hefty of a fine you're not going

606
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,440
to face the jail time but you'll get

607
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,320
fined

608
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:14,240
well i mean this takes me back to one of

609
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:16,960
the things i always recommend is really

610
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,319
know the law in your area

611
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,038
because depending on where you're

612
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:23,038
standing in the u.s you can have

613
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,038
all the cannabis plants you want just at

614
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:26,400
your house other places you can only

615
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,798
have a few

616
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,960
other places the plants have to test a

617
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:34,160
certain way

618
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,319
and who's to say who gets to test what

619
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,759
there's at least one business a fit

620
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,678
going through all kinds of legal

621
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,839
headaches right now because

622
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,160
they bought a shitload of legal hemp

623
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:47,439
seed on the open market

624
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,160
and it wasn't the whole batch that they

625
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,000
got but a

626
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,279
chunk of their seed ended up being high

627
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,240
thc

628
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,000
rather than cbd dominant and so they had

629
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,640
this big field of

630
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
hemp and then one corner of it was a

631
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,200
high thc cannabis

632
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,919
so they're dealing with major headaches

633
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,679
right now

634
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,520
other places are dealing with the exact

635
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,600
same headaches because their [ __ ] tested

636
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,599
at one percent thc

637
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,279
those seed sellers should potentially be

638
00:20:11,599 --> 00:20:14,639
held responsible they knew if they

639
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,399
offered something that wasn't as

640
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,159
advertised there should be some recourse

641
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,159
to the seed sellers

642
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,480
i'm a seed maker i i hold myself

643
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:25,520
responsible for that kind of a claim

644
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,759
if this was a federally legal business

645
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:30,558
operating with normal business practices

646
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,200
all that [ __ ] would just be in place um

647
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:33,918
but it's

648
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,798
not because well that's the second half

649
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,480
of the show right

650
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,240
yep well do you want to work our way

651
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,759
into that mike um

652
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,359
segway yes segway i'm not going to drop

653
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,480
that clip in i haven't used it

654
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,000
if we need it for somewhere here's time

655
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,279
to make a segue uh this is the part

656
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,279
where we're going to let

657
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:51,279
uh mike work his way into a little bit

658
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,399
of politics because it is voting time

659
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:52,960
there's a lot of critical stuff

660
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,798
happening

661
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,360
i've got a platform with an audience and

662
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,679
i feel it is almost my responsibility to

663
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:01,359
educate and inform on other things than

664
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,280
just cannabis this is cannabis related

665
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,158
it's cannabis involved it's important

666
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,720
uh i think i can quit rambling and i can

667
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:08,720
let

668
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,240
mike start rambling a little bit the

669
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,759
first thing i wrote down though bro was

670
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,200
uh political signs

671
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,480
so if you want to tell us your story

672
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,159
about your political science and then

673
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,599
we'll work it into the rest of your your

674
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,880
stuff

675
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,639
um with covid and everybody just being

676
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,280
home most of the time

677
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,200
um like our worlds have kind of

678
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,759
collapsed in on each other

679
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,519
and uh i don't know about y'all but one

680
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:33,119
of the things i do to keep myself sane

681
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,400
and keep the kids sane is

682
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,798
we take little walks around the

683
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,320
neighborhood and not long walks just

684
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,960
around the block and

685
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,558
you know one week one one day we do the

686
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,079
the right side of the block next week we

687
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:46,639
do the left side of the block

688
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,480
kind of loop around and we've watched

689
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,000
the evolution of the political signs

690
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,079
going up and down our street and around

691
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,759
our neighborhood

692
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,918
in this part of town it's really chill

693
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,038
there's not a lot of signage

694
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:02,480
in about maybe two months ago

695
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:04,480
six weeks ago one house on our street

696
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,480
puts out there was no trump sign at

697
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,240
first it started out with two local

698
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,440
conservatives

699
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,759
um so like uh

700
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,360
what is it a senator level and then a

701
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,200
state rep level

702
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,439
sign in the front yard and like two days

703
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,720
later there was a trump sign to go with

704
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,279
it it seemed like he just didn't have

705
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,720
the trump sign yet

706
00:22:23,279 --> 00:22:27,440
and that was the only signs on our

707
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,360
street for a minute and then

708
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,440
i live right across the street from a

709
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,839
military vet

710
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,840
and

711
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:40,558
one day i come home and he's definitely

712
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,120
got where his american flag normally is

713
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,960
there's a trump flag but it's a trump

714
00:22:43,119 --> 00:22:47,359
flag i haven't seen before because it

715
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,919
seems like it's trump on one side

716
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:51,599
american flag on the other and i'm not

717
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,080
great with flag etiquette but

718
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:56,639
immediately my brain was like

719
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,158
wait alarm bells that looks really weird

720
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,799
you should look at that more and figure

721
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,480
out what the hell you're looking at

722
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:07,119
so over the next two days

723
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,960
it goes from trump flag on one side

724
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,918
american flag on the other

725
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,840
to double-side an american flag to

726
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,440
double-sided trump flag

727
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,119
and me and the wife are talking about

728
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,000
this just laughing going

729
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:22,000
is it a husband and wife fighting like

730
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,960
is it going up and coming down does

731
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,038
the guy not sure about his support what

732
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,159
the hell is going on

733
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,519
and what it turns out is it's just badly

734
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,280
hung up

735
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:37,918
and it's a one-sided trump flag and

736
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,960
again just terrible flag etiquette it's

737
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,559
hung up

738
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,240
um overlaid on his american flag he's

739
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:46,240
got the american flag set up on

740
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,159
the front of his house and he's just

741
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,960
clipped the trump flag right next to it

742
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,559
in the same

743
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,159
guide rings and so depending on which

744
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,038
way the wind's flapping

745
00:23:54,159 --> 00:24:00,720
or if it's hanging still it looks all it

746
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:00,720
looks like six different flags at once

747
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:05,679
so at this point in the story there's

748
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,319
the one house down the street with three

749
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,720
little yard signs in the flag

750
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,639
then i go down the street and all of the

751
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,720
houses around the first house

752
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,200
have blind signs out they've surrounded

753
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,200
the dude

754
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:21,440
then two other people on the street put

755
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,559
out biden flags

756
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,038
or not buying flags buying signs then

757
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,158
next morning all of the biden signs are

758
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,079
gone

759
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,880
they just disappeared somebody came

760
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,439
through and stole them all

761
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,200
two days later they're all back and

762
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,240
everybody's doubled up now

763
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,319
nice so i'm waiting to see that happened

764
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
yesterday everybody doubled up

765
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,158
so i'm waiting to see where this goes

766
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,839
between now and the election

767
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,520
like it's just a sad little thing that's

768
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:50,879
my weird little world right now people

769
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:52,480
welcome to it

770
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,760
uh i don't remember if it was you or

771
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,640
another friend that told me that they

772
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,158
watched a neighbor

773
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,240
put some trump signs in the trash can

774
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,679
um i've seen that story on a couple of

775
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,440
different uh

776
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,960
platforms in a couple of different

777
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,400
versions it could have been fake though

778
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,600
and i may have fallen honestly big crap

779
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,880
this election's so bad [ __ ] that like

780
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,639
there's all of it

781
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,640
um i saw one dude and when i saw this

782
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,520
picture i was like

783
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,679
homie's kind of begging for trouble and

784
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:25,599
when i saw the footage of the trouble

785
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,360
that inevitably happened i was like

786
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:29,199
and they had a camera set up to catch it

787
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,158
homie was probably kind of begging for

788
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,759
trouble

789
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,400
but it was a huge like semi trailer

790
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:37,599
like the big full-size semi-trailer

791
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
worth a hay bale

792
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,759
stacked up and then a shitload of biden

793
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:42,000
flags all over it and i don't remember

794
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,798
what

795
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,640
stated it was in but i remember thinking

796
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,440
that's a pretty conservative area for

797
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,400
such a giant biden display

798
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,400
made out of obviously flammable material

799
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,880
seems like a bad idea

800
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,240
and sure [ __ ] a few days later it was on

801
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,840
fire

802
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,640
um so who knows but just in our little

803
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,240
area

804
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,679
it's it's fun just watching the

805
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,919
neighborhood go

806
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,360
my wife ordered a couple of biden flags

807
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,799
and we haven't put them up yet because

808
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,119
we don't want to be

809
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,798
the like we don't want to one-up anybody

810
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,558
and start a thing

811
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:17,759
oh do it it's like christmas we're

812
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,399
sticking to yours we're sticking to the

813
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:22,480
yard sign until the yard sign disappears

814
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,360
if somebody jacks the yard sign all five

815
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,278
flags are going up [ __ ] it

816
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,719
you guys could be like uh like the

817
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:30,480
[ __ ] uh

818
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,839
[ __ ] i lost it in my national lampoon's

819
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,400
christmas vacation you could be like the

820
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:37,119
guy hanging up super lights bro

821
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,919
yeah it's uh it's tough it's such a

822
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:42,558
weird election because i'm not

823
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,080
like i'm not a super fan of of biden i

824
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:46,319
definitely

825
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,240
didn't pick biden in the primaries he

826
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:49,918
was i don't even remember saying my dad

827
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,798
clearly had a phone call it was back

828
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,880
when

829
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,960
all of the candidates were still in um

830
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,080
right after bloomberg got in the race

831
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,278
i was like i don't know who it's gonna

832
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,038
be right now but i know it's not gonna

833
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:00,240
be biden or bloomberg

834
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,000
and we had like an hour-long

835
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,079
conversation about how we were sure it

836
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,679
wasn't gonna be either those candidates

837
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:10,000
oops but uh along this track while we're

838
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,880
talking politics on a weed show

839
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,798
is the last episode i was on was my

840
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,960
legalization primer

841
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,558
and man i don't know if i got too high

842
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
or if my script

843
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:23,440
lost a page but i don't think i told you

844
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,759
all the vote

845
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,880
[ __ ] dude of all the things not to

846
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:31,038
mention

847
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,440
vote vote vote vote

848
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,158
most of the states that have legal

849
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,399
cannabis

850
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,320
recreational legal cannabis we got there

851
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:39,599
because we have a system in place that

852
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:41,839
allows

853
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,038
citizens to put questions directly on

854
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,119
the ballot

855
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:46,960
citizens overcame whatever hurdles are

856
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:48,959
in place to do that

857
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,798
we got the word out we convinced our

858
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,319
parents to vote with us

859
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,798
and we legalized it a lot of places

860
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,759
where

861
00:27:54,798 --> 00:28:00,398
cannabis isn't recreationally legal

862
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,558
you've got to elect people to office

863
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,519
who will do all those first steps for

864
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,158
you

865
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:08,000
and right now that's a pain in the ass

866
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,080
to get done

867
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,839
um presidential candidate wise right now

868
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:18,319
um another reason we're doing a

869
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:21,519
political show on a cannabis podcast

870
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:22,480
both presidential campaigns trump and

871
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,599
biden are now

872
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,200
clear on their marijuana positions

873
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:30,759
um the biden campaign their policy goal

874
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,120
is decrim

875
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:36,960
decriminalization no legalization

876
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,079
no federal legalization they just want

877
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,079
to get the feds out of it

878
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,120
in my mind it's a half step a lot of

879
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:45,679
states have had decrim for a lot of

880
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,678
years

881
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,320
and we arrested a [ __ ] load of people

882
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,960
from marijuana crimes during that time

883
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,398
because decram doesn't mean [ __ ] for

884
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,720
production

885
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,079
um and if you've got a whole ounce on

886
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,798
you they call that

887
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:04,240
attempted deal anyway so right

888
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,240
distribution i mean [ __ ]

889
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,799
yeah if you get caught with 29 grams of

890
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,759
hot sandwich baggies

891
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,319
you're a major drug trafficker under a

892
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,640
decrim model usually so

893
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,398
it's i mean it's a step forward you

894
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,679
can't say it's not

895
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:25,038
but it's not legalization it's not

896
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,679
um like if i was running for president

897
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,398
it wouldn't be

898
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,880
my marijuana policy that's for damn sure

899
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:30,798
but

900
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,440
it's just going to interrupt you and ask

901
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,879
you what your marijuana policy would be

902
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,880
mike

903
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,720
legalization just falls without

904
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,240
legalization just like cigarettes like

905
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,079
other industries

906
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,640
probably not just like cigarettes but

907
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,879
similar um

908
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,159
i finally quit smoking in january after

909
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,080
like 20 something years

910
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,799
congrats bro so um i've been anti

911
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,398
or i'm his anti-tobacco now as i've ever

912
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,319
been in my life

913
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,678
not like violently anti-tobacco or

914
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,038
anything but

915
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,278
i see them at least favorably and

916
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,960
i've never liked that particular

917
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,640
regulation model

918
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,159
it's not bad but it's not good either

919
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:14,000
we can do better i think we've already

920
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,720
done better with colorado's marijuana

921
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,240
model

922
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,880
okay um i wouldn't just

923
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,000
blanket take colorado's model and push

924
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:26,640
it over all the states

925
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:29,278
either um we've definitely made mistakes

926
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,159
oh for sure um some were working to

927
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,440
correct now

928
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,440
some people are gleefully making worse

929
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,038
but uh i think we're better than most

930
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,960
places

931
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:41,119
um and i think if if there was a

932
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,360
presidential candidate right now

933
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:45,199
that said we're gonna push colorado's

934
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,479
model on all 50 states like i'd be

935
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,080
looking to get a tattoo with that

936
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,558
person's name

937
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,480
i'd be so [ __ ] excited where are you

938
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:55,440
gonna put it

939
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,440
i don't know my throat

940
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,759
biden 420 try to crash your neck bro

941
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,840
no it's uh i mean honestly for a long

942
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,960
time

943
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:12,000
uh drug legalization policy

944
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,079
wonk like me voting for biden [ __ ]

945
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,398
hurts i'm not gonna say it doesn't

946
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:20,960
but uh um we've covered their proposal

947
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,479
now let's talk about the opposition yes

948
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:25,840
um

949
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,159
which is weird calling the the party in

950
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:27,759
the

951
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,200
the white house the opposition at all

952
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,158
but uh

953
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,798
um trump has said positive things

954
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,120
towards legalization in the past

955
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:39,599
um he's said lots of positive things

956
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:42,719
about medical marijuana in the past

957
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:44,639
and he's currently sending threatening

958
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,360
cease and desist letters to a medical

959
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,440
marijuana

960
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:52,079
campaign and a legalization campaign

961
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,320
because they're accurately quoting him

962
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,119
threatening them to stop using things he

963
00:31:54,319 --> 00:31:56,639
said

964
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:59,038
that support the cause they're

965
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,360
supporting

966
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:02,319
pretty clear he's anti-cannabis he sided

967
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,558
with

968
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,439
the rest of the right politically here

969
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:09,119
in his

970
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:11,200
anti-cannabis just like we've had

971
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,518
all through american history since the

972
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
late 1800s so

973
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,319
such a weird thing if you're voting

974
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,880
based on just cannabis

975
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,720
there's your sign i like the way you

976
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,200
wrapped that up and made that a peaceful

977
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,399
division if you're voting for cannabis

978
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,519
mike knows who you should vote for i

979
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,119
think you do by now

980
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,679
uh that's really a weird approach to it

981
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:34,239
to send a cease and desist to say

982
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,159
you can't even use my quotes that i said

983
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,399
in your campaign even though what i said

984
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,240
is

985
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:42,079
real like how can you [ __ ] block

986
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,159
somebody's story broke to death

987
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:48,079
check out marijuana moment for in-depth

988
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,000
reporting on this story but uh

989
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:51,678
i saw the headline and i went that's

990
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,359
[ __ ] stupid

991
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,080
yeah like that's that is almost

992
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:58,719
advertising

993
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:01,278
cannabis is insanely popular it's more

994
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,759
advertising for the campaign that was

995
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:04,558
that he's against now that campaign

996
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:06,240
would have gotten

997
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,839
a little bit advertising legs you know

998
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,679
what i mean however much they paid for

999
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,278
now it's got trump money behind it it's

1000
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,960
looking it only would have gotten so far

1001
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:13,519
and fizzled out now it's gotten a whole

1002
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,880
another

1003
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,880
got picked up and re-thrown down the

1004
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,039
field they got a whole other throw

1005
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,919
[ __ ] one reason people like me are

1006
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,119
reading about it

1007
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,000
is because it's so weird medical

1008
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:27,199
marijuana is

1009
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,880
supported by like 60 80 of the people

1010
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,480
depending on which people you're talking

1011
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,360
about it's

1012
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,558
wildly popular i mean it's popular like

1013
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,599
ice cream

1014
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:40,158
yeah it's it's insanely popular

1015
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,678
it's disturbing that it's still illegal

1016
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,120
federally and there's still so many

1017
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,798
restrictions on it despite its

1018
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,439
popularity

1019
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,759
with the voters but it's i mean it's a

1020
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,360
contentious election we're

1021
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:57,519
two weeks out now and to just slap

1022
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:59,519
that many people for no reason none like

1023
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,120
it wasn't like anybody was pointing to

1024
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,120
these quotes and

1025
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:04,798
it wasn't causing a problem for their

1026
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,959
campaign or anything it wasn't even

1027
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:08,639
contentious it wasn't news at all

1028
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,720
until they sent a cease and desist

1029
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,878
letter that was angry and threatening

1030
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,918
and now it's just national news that's

1031
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:16,398
so funny

1032
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,918
yeah that that ad campaign just expanded

1033
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,918
tenfold

1034
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,759
good job shitload of conservative

1035
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,000
cannabis fanatics

1036
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,359
um they love cannabis and they love vote

1037
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,960
republican

1038
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:31,119
and that's gotta suck

1039
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,039
i'm sorry i'm not not even trying to be

1040
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,399
a dick i know a lot of republicans my

1041
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:39,039
i've got republicans in my family

1042
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,159
um i'm liberal about a lot of stuff but

1043
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:40,719
i'm conservative about a lot of stuff

1044
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,440
too

1045
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,158
just not any social issues um like i'm a

1046
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,000
gun nut too

1047
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,240
so dude i wasn't going to bring that up

1048
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,519
i'm all about cannabis and i'm i'm all

1049
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,039
about a lot of things i'm not even going

1050
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,599
to mention but i think if you want to

1051
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:53,918
have a gun

1052
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,039
have a [ __ ] gun like you should have

1053
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,480
all about freedoms

1054
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,000
yeah do the things that you want to do

1055
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,199
that's the thing i like is freedom don't

1056
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,599
[ __ ] with me don't [ __ ] with other

1060
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,960
each other in any other way that's

1061
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,119
[ __ ]

1062

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,480
business my [ __ ] and your business like

1069
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,159
let's have a good time and be ourselves

1070
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,838
what uh i definitely wanted to get on

1071
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:25,838
the show and do

1072
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:26,880
a little here's where the candidates are

1073
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:28,880
at peace for

1074
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:31,760
uh for the girl for the heart community

1075
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,119
and the ire army

1076
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,280
i know you all look to me for some of

1077
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,320
that stuff and i appreciate it

1078
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,519
and if you're on the fence and looking

1079
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,720
for a cannabis reason to vote a or b

1080
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,239
um there you go i think most of the

1081
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,319
audience watching the dreadlocked white

1082
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,239
guy with the cannabis show were already

1083
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,680
uh most of them have probably already

1084
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,838
made their decisions but

1085
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,879
hopefully maybe we encouraged a small

1086
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:56,799
portion of people

1087
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,480
maybe we just divided ourselves from

1088
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,160
some of our friends but either way

1089
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,838
we are who we are hope you enjoyed the

1090
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,199
show uh mike thank you dude thank you

1091
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:03,838
for your contribution to the show the

1092
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,879
community

1093
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:08,400
for what you do you look like you got

1094
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,680
something to say go for it well just

1095
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,760
the group in our community that i

1096
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,118
really reaching out to or the group that

1097
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,160
don't vote

1098
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,320
or the group that hate left and right so

1099
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:25,039
they vote third party or don't vote

1100
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:28,240
at all um or the people that think

1101
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:30,800
everything sucks so why bother like

1102
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,358
it's literally just made up of people

1103
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,960
it's just

1104
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:36,400
us like it's weird to think that if me

1105
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,599
and jeff were a little older and a lot

1106
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,800
less stony

1107
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,838
like we could be senators or

1108
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,320
presidents or yeah i compared the

1109
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,838
justices or the people that say that

1110
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,200
voting doesn't matter

1111
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:50,639
those are the people that if i took you

1112
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:51,598
to a restaurant and i gave you the menu

1113
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,319
and you're like i don't care just bring

1114
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,920
me something

1115
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,599
if i bring you [ __ ] mashed potatoes

1116
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,240
and chicken wings that's what you

1117
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,440
[ __ ] get

1118
00:36:56,239 --> 00:36:58,719
that's what you're stuck with if you

1119
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,079
would have voted you could have looked

1120
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,480
at the menu and maybe

1121
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,320
you could have said i want soup in a

1122
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,920
salad and i could have considered that

1123
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,519
instead you didn't even bother to show

1124
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,079
up and [ __ ] voice your opinion so you

1125
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:10,079
got [ __ ]

1126
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,760
cold mashed potatoes and [ __ ] chicken

1127
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,000
wings dude i hope you're happy being a

1128
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,000
four-year-old at the table

1129
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,039
well it's i mean it's brutal for people

1130
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,719
like like i'm

1131
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:24,159
crazy liberal about a lot of stuff um

1132
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,959
like biden and obama before him are very

1133
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:29,199
center politically like there's a left

1134
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,119
and a right when you talk about politics

1135
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:33,759
and they're smack in the [ __ ] middle

1136
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,760
center um between right and left we

1137
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,440
don't really have a left

1138
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,359
as far as parties are concerned in the

1139
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,400
us we have a center and we have a

1140
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:45,838
far to the right um and over our

1141
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,240
my lifetime our lifetimes we've watched

1142
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:49,599
it go from a little left to center and

1143
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,399
right of center

1144
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,838
to way way right of center and smack

1145
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,358
dead middle

1146
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:59,599
and a lot of that has to do with

1147
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:01,679
young people tend to be more liberal on

1148
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,400
stuff and more left leaning

1149
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:07,358
and just don't vote in primaries and

1150
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,800
small races and small elections

1151
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:12,880
um turnout's getting much better for the

1152
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,400
presidential elections but

1153
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,880
in the primaries it's minimal

1154
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,800
and that's like everybody's like man i

1155
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,519
wish i was voting for bernie

1156
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,880
it's like well dude's been in congress

1157
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:26,719
as long as biden

1158
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,079
you just never built that coalition of

1159
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,439
people that are going to go nuts in the

1160
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,519
primary

1161
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,760
it's that younger voter base we've got

1162
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:35,759
to get out to the other elections

1163
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,480
and it's just not happening right now

1164
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,000
and for the cannabis community

1165
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:45,199
we're so [ __ ] big if we could unify

1166
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:46,880
even for a minute it would change [ __ ]

1167
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,279
globally

1168
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,960
but it's so hard to get us on the same

1169
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,000
page about anything man

1170

1185
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:24,320

just click if you open up one of those

1187
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,800
apps or everybody's on either instagram

1188
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,320
or

1189
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,920
facebook or something on your phone

1190
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,519
every app you open right now on the top

1191
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,440
it's like are you registered to vote

1192
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:36,159
because they want you to participate

1193
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,760
do it it's easy if you're still not

1194
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:39,519
registered to vote it's because you're

1195
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,760
actively ducking it

1196
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:44,159
like it's they're making it as easy as

1197
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,280
it's ever been in our lifetimes

1198
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,559
um i feel for places where i'm watching

1199
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,640
people

1200
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:55,679
wait five six eight eleven hours to vote

1201
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:56,960
even this early and people are showing

1202
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,838
up and wrecking numbers

1203
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,358
all over the country um they're waiting

1204
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,799
in huge lines

1205
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:05,838
and in colorado i think the longest i've

1206
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,039
waited in the last

1207
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,239
10 years to vote is like 15 minutes

1208
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:13,039
and part of that was because the

1209
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:15,519
elevator is slow in the building

1210
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,039
this year it took me about five minutes

1211
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,480
uh open up the ballot

1212
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,318
scribble in some bubbles because i know

1213
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,519
who i'm looking for go in and scribble

1214
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:23,358
all my marks fold it back

1215
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,719
up sign it put it in an envelope and

1216
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:26,078
then a few blocks from my house there's

1217
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:27,679
a little uh

1218
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,440
unfortunately bro they took a big trash

1219
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:30,078
can and [ __ ] put a lid on it poked a

1220
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,240
hole in it

1221
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,680
and that is the official ballot box uh

1222
00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:36,399
before you put your ballots

1223
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:36,719
but you drop them all in there uh yeah

1224
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,838
so

1225
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:39,199
it took me just a couple minutes and

1226
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:40,799
drove up jumped out of the car and i

1227
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:42,559
threw it in the collection box man yep

1228
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,760
took a couple more it's more secure than

1229
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:45,759
it looks

1230
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,520
yeah yeah it's much more secure than it

1231
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,960
looks took two with me so that some

1232
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,719
other people didn't have to go out and

1233
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,079
face covered conditions so they could

1234
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,719
just stay on the couch and watch the

1235
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,880
game

1236
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:56,000
so i got three ballots delivered all in

1237
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,119
one move yeah

1238
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,039
i was gonna say if you guys are out

1239
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,400
there and you need to vote uh go or if

1240
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,920

1241
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,800
vote go pick them up take them to vote

1242
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,318
help them to do it

1243
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,519
a lot of us got ballots in the mail just

1244
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:07,279
go over to their house and help them

1245
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,559
fill that [ __ ] out make it fun

1246
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,839
uh teach them and if you don't vote you

1247
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,159
don't get to [ __ ] and complain about

1248
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:15,358
how things are that's just how it is

1249
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,559
yeah it's like literally if you if you

1250
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:18,838
say that it sucks so you don't

1251
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,000
participate like you're the reason it

1252
00:41:18,838 --> 00:41:23,119
sucks

1253
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,679
it's it's your choices it's people not

1254
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,680
voting

1255
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,279
are why shitty people stay in elected

1256
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,078
office forever

1257
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,880
um it's because familiarity is

1258
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:34,160
comforting

1259
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,200
and people just don't vote in nor

1260
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:39,199
in the numbers they need to it's bananas

1261
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:41,358
like

1262
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,559
our country seeks out other countries

1263
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:44,318
when they vote

1264
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,358
and we put it on the news and we clap

1265
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:50,079
and applaud when they vote

1266
00:41:47,358 --> 00:41:51,759
but we don't go turn out to vote it's so

there's some local [ __ ] that you're like

1321
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,838
i don't even know what the

1322
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,440
[ __ ] that means you don't just skip it

1323
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,119
it's not a test in school

1324
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,400
just you can vote for the president and

1325
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,280
whoever else you want that you're

1326
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,280
comfortable with and

1327
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,880
there's like 170 [ __ ] bubbles on

1328
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,079
there fill out five of them you'll be

1329
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,200
okay

1330
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,760
there were two people locally this round

1331
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:45,358
that i do not like as people and i do

1332
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,880
not like these candidates who were

1333
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,039
running unopposed

1334
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,000
and so they didn't get a vote for me

1335
00:43:49,039 --> 00:43:51,679
exactly um

1336
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,400
they're running on a post it doesn't

1337
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:57,519
matter there's nobody to vote against

1338
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:59,440
but uh they don't get my vote and on

1339
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,440
election night they're going to see it

1340
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,720
because they're good they report it if

1341
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,920
you watch the news it's called an

1342
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:08,078
undervote

1343
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:11,200
and uh they they list it for like

1344
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:14,000
um say for example biden voters

1345
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,439
in in our area the people down the

1346
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,760
ticket democrat

1347
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,440
if they get less votes than biden did

1348
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,960
they listed as an undervote

1349
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,240
and so it can be like jeff got a

1350
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,159
thousand votes mike only got 740

1351
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,318
and it'll say it underneath that i'm

1352
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,159
pointed out is an undervote

1353
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:31,920
so yeah [ __ ] them that's my little dig

1354
00:44:30,159 --> 00:44:33,519
to them nice

1355
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,680
you could have just wrote my name in the

1356
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,838
in the opposition spot and voted for me

1357
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,838

1364
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,400
heavily cannabis oriented if you've made

1365
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,240
it this far you probably

1366
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,240
aren't too concerned about that uh and i

1367

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,720

1414
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,760
in 720 so i'm giving him 720 and not 710

purpose

1417
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:29,838
uh but uh just slapping it together

1418
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,920
there since you're a 311 fan i'm

1419

that was just the thing i thought you

1421

should that's one of the new tiers

1422
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,719
that's going in i was i have a little

1423
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,078
list planned out of different stuff i

1424
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:41,838

1425
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,599

a new car from the ground up you

1436
00:46:58,639 --> 00:47:01,679
wouldn't see that car until it had

1437
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,440
nitrous in it and i was [ __ ] flying

1438
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:04,719
down the track would be the debut

1439
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:07,119
unless it doesn't have nitrous and

1440
