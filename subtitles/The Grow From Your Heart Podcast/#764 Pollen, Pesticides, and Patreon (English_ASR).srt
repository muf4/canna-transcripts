focus i [ __ ] am dude i am also

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,878
something i'm going to notice and

65
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,640
mention after covid dabs are wrecking me

66
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,639
oh my goodness when i take a little dab

67
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,279
or a medium dab or a big dab

68
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,639
it feels so so incredibly dabblicious

69
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,280
i'm getting lit from the dabs right i'm

70
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:43,679
just rambling now let's get into uh the

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
main part of this podcast here i did say

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,159
that i had some patreon messages here in

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,160
front of me this one comes from our

74
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:54,479
friend s c dung slinger and it goes a

75
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,479
little bit like this it says hey buddy

76
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:59,280
could you send the patreons an advanced

77
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,439
text when you add drops to i redirect i

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,598
listen to all of the podcasts and ig but

79
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,000
i don't do discord when i found out

80
00:03:03,598 --> 00:03:08,560
about i redirect and all that stuff i

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,479
would have enter uh let's see it it's uh

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,959
your your autocorrect blasted you out

83
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:14,719
here uh it was already gone by the time

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,080
you saw it was available i'm not sure

85
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,359
what autocorrect turned your sentence

86
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,879
into it doesn't make sense to me but

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,879
we'll not deal with that here on the

88
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,079
show it says i know you have stuff i

89
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,000
know you don't have a staff like the

90
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,000
dude grow show but they send the

91
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,680
patreons a text every time they post

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,199
anything to the dgc patreons um so what

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,920
our friend here is talking about is i

94
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:36,560
have added iriedirect.com

95
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,079
to my lineup iriegenetics.com in the

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,000
middle of the webpage there is a tab

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,400
that says direct or you can simply click

98
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,919
or simply type in i redirect it will get

99
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
you right there that is where you can

100
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,919
get irie genetics you can get the

101
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
regular seeds the feminized seeds a lot

102
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:51,359
of new stuff a lot of older stuff is

103
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,120
available there

104
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,080
so what my friend is asking for is for

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,560
when i post new items on i redirect is

106
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,319
that i let the patreon members know that

107
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,759
there is new stuff up there so that they

108
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,479
can get a jump on it that is a great

109
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:06,719
request that's a great question yes i

110
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:08,399
will do my best to start doing that like

111
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,519
you said i don't have a staff it's just

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
me doing

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,280
99 of this work i get some help here and

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
there are some things i feel comfortable

115
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
with but honestly i like to do most of

116
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,720
it by myself it lets me know it's

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,319
getting done correctly if there's a

118
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,280
mistake i blame it on me i fix it

119
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,519
quickly

120
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,079
things will happen but i do most of it

121
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,959
by myself also i don't

122
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:31,039
i don't advertise on the patreon and the

123
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:32,638
discord and as much as i could i don't

124
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,560
advertise online as much as i could

125
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,319
because that's not really what i'm there

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,079
for people know that i exist people know

127
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:40,560
the company is established the seeds are

128
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,000
available i'm on discord and patreon to

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,319
kind of hang out with the crew to hang

130
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,079
out with the people part of the to be a

131
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,478
part of the community not there just to

132
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,918
advertise i do throw my advertising out

133
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:52,000
what kind of business would i be if i

134
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,839
didn't that's a big part of social media

135
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,360
a big part of why i'm there but i try

136
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,959
not to bombard you with like hey buy

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
seeds hey buy seeds you know they're

138
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,038
there but i do appreciate the request

139
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,360
that i let you know the seeds are there

140
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:07,038
yes i will let you know when i put new

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,919
beans on the iredirect.com

142
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:12,879
website also uh the patrons are going to

143
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,719
get exclusives and discounts i know that

144
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,240
for a long time you guys were

145
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,919
asking for deals on seeds through

146
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,600
patreon i can't do it directly through

147
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:21,519
patreon because patreon doesn't agree

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
with that what i can do is i can give

149
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,359
you coupon codes where you can go to my

150
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,079
website where the beans are available i

151
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680

152
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,279
do the coupon codes i can help you out

153
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,759
there so in the future there will be

154
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,959
exclu exclusives and there will also be

155
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,680

208
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,079
just tried not to lose my train of

209
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,000
thought is really what's going on but i

210
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:25,758
can't keep up my own pace i don't have

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,680
enough air uh

212
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,840
the vid got me bro i apologize i'm not

213

214
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:32,159
that's why i sound like i'm out of

215
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,159
breath and i'm trying to get through the

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,520
show all right

217
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,599
excuse me for the throat clearing not

218
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,598

00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,719
comes from they don't even say their

220
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,439
name but i'm not gonna say her name

221
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,360
because you didn't put your name on here

222
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,279
uh the message says hey rosta jeff

223
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,598
what's up bro good to meet you says i

224
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,279
live right near the beach that sounds

225
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,120
like a good time until we read the

226
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,598
message it says i see that my early

227
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,519
flowering plants were pollinated that's

228
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,360
a bummer um

229
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,560
maybe they were pollinated i would go

230
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,759
check and squeeze it a little bit and

231
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,598
see if there's seeds in there those

232
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,160
could just be swollen brax a lot of

233
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,560
people assume sometimes that a swollen

234
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
bract is a pollinated plant ah go give

235
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,800
it a squeeze that could be just a

236
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,478
swollen calyx a swollen bract up there

237
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,759
go check it out i could be completely

238
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:17,519
wrong i haven't seen your girl i don't

239
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,080
have any pictures i'm hoping for the

240
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:22,959
best it goes on it says do you think it

241
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,439
is a bad idea growing outside living

242
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:28,079
right near the beach or a tourist

243
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,240
destination so you live uh

244
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:32,478
near the beach or a tourist destination

245
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,399
and you're saying uh anybody could pass

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,120
a hemp farm on the way

247
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,639
to

248
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,240
said beach and then you think that

249
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,360
they're gonna pass the hemp farm and

250
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,200
then they're gonna bring the pollen to

251
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,240
your girl on accident as they travel

252
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,440
that is

253
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,919
um

254
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,399
less likely than my suspicion my

255
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,159
suspicion is that it is probably wind

256
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,320
there's probably somebody else growing

257
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,240
in your area you're not the only person

258
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,399
who got the idea to grow some ganja this

259
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,959
year and there is probably somebody else

260
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,080
growing hemp or cannabis within a few

261
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:04,239
miles of your cultivation site hemp uh

262
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,800
hemp and cannabis it's the same pollen

263
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,560
pollen can travel for quite a distance

264
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:11,759
in the wind and it can pollinate your

265
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,319
plants uh so it was probably when

266
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:16,159
somebody in your four or five mile

267
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,160
radius probably has a male plant

268
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,319
whichever the way into travels wherever

269
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,360
you are you could be in another country

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,120
you could be a different part of the

271
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
world but the wind is probably going

272
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,799
this way there's probably somebody with

273
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:28,719
a male that way and you're down this way

274
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,719
and the pollen is just going that way i

275
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,639
don't suspect it's people

276
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
going to a hemp farm and getting pollen

277
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,080
on them and then passing through your

278
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,639
neighborhood that doesn't seem it's

279
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,800
possible it could be more likely it

280
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,919
would be pollinators birds bees things

281
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,519
like that

282
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:45,919
and the wind is probably the number one

283
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,240
culprit there um or it could just be

284
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,559
weird genetics or something went crazy

285
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,159
in the grow also but my assumption i

286
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,719
think i've talked enough about that one

287
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,958
i think there's a male plant within the

288
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,680
four or five mile radius of your plant

289
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:01,439
and it's simply skeet skeetily deeded on

290
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,559
your plant i don't think that it was

291
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,240
tourist let me answer the question

292
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,879
because there was a specific part do i

293
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,799
think uh that it's risky let me dial

294
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,078
that in and not just ramble past it do

295
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,639
you think it's a bad idea growing

296
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:13,679
outside living near the beach uh no but

297
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,360
you're gonna have to these are the kind

298
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,519
of things that we're going to

299
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,278
have to deal with as the nation the

300
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,720
entire country is starting to legalize

301
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,720
cannabis there are way more states that

302
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
have legal cannabis than illegal

303
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,278
cannabis

304
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,480
this is a an agricultural issue that um

305
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,159
we're gonna have to deal with when

306
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,240
people are growing and their own

307
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,759
personal grows and some a lot of people

308
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,039
out there don't know how to identify a

309
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,039
male a lot of people don't even think

310
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,078
about identifying a male

311
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,759
some people

312
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:41,519
don't do the way that i think it should

313
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,799
be done in test to plant indoors and

314
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,560
then grow it outdoors they don't all

315
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,399
have that opportunity so they're going

316
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,039
to be males outdoors wherever people are

317
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,519
cultivating males will happen and this

318
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,879
is going to happen in occulta in a in an

319
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,078
agriculture and

320
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,720
let me try that again i'm not even going

321
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:59,679
to edit that in an agricultural

322
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,278
environment like in farmland uh back in

323
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:02,879
the day before cannabis came about i

324
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:04,720
feel like they forgot about this when we

325
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,399
started zoning for cannabis here in

326
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,000
colorado they would make sure that

327
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,159
certain crops are certain distances

328
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,759
apart so that this guy can't pollinate

329
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,759
this guy's crop and this guy can't

330
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,200
pollinate this guy's crop they'd keep

331
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,159
them so many miles apart i think it was

332
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,440
like 2.4 miles or one point i obviously

333
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:20,639
don't remember the exact number but

334
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,399
there was a distance they would put

335
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,480
farms apart where they couldn't cause

336
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,839
problems for each other seems like we

337
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
totally forgot that when it came to

338
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,160
cannabis a lot of new people out there a

339
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,079

355
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,199

356
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,039
your other favorites all right that's a

357
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,920

products do i like to use i often work

359
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,159
in commercial cultivation facilities

360
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,759
i've also got a personal grow i'd also

361
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,799
do a lot of consulting for friends and

362
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,278
family

363
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,439
most of what i'm going to talk about

364
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,159
are products that are approved and

365
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,240
regulated by the colorado marijuana

366
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,639
enforcement division and also the

367
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,959
colorado department of agriculture and

368
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,200
also the colorado department of public

369
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:38,559
health and environment i do not know the

370
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:40,800
rules the regulations the laws the fine

371
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,679
print where you are i can only speak on

372
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,919
my area and honestly i didn't re these

373
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,759
rules change so rapidly and frequently

374
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,759
here that some of the products on my

375
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:51,600
list could have been banned since i

376
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,838
blinked after i wrote this i could have

377
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,278
came from the computer sat here they

378
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
could have sent out an email saying hey

379
00:12:55,278 --> 00:12:58,480
you can no longer use some of the stuff

380
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:59,919
on your list that's just how the

381
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,680
industry goes right now it's how it's

382
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,360
going to be we're evolving we're

383
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:04,958
adjusting and adapting when they find

384
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,879
out there's a problem with the product

385
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,319
i'm happy to adjust find a new product

386
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:09,278
to use for that so what i'm going to

387
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,440
tell you

388
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:13,439
is what i recommend for

389
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,320
my personal facilities my commercial

390
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,680
facilities in the state of colorado

391
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,278
you're going to have to make your own

392
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,319
personal decisions when it comes to

393
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,320
pesticides what level of toxicity do you

394
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
want in your facility

395
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
a lot of people want to stay organic a

396
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
lot of people don't care if they're

397
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,879
using nuclear war in their grow

398
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,958
it's all chemicals no matter how organic

399
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:38,159
you go no matter how abrasive of a

400
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,599
product you use it is all chemicals uh

401
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,600
people like to stick with the buzzword

402
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,519
organic but then i remind them that

403
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,278
cyanide is organic does that make it

404
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,039
okay to you and then they get flustered

405
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:49,120
with me but keep in mind that you're the

406
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,799
one making the ethical decisions in this

407
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,399
grow so if you want to use something

408
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,078
that may stick around in that plant that

409
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,159
could cause harm to somebody don't share

410
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,838
it don't sell it smoke it yourself but

411
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:59,759
if you're going to share stuff use

412
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,760
things that are more uh health conscious

413
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,000
to your consumers also the big hippie in

414
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,159
me is going to remind you to be

415
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,519
conscious of the environment don't

416
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,679
destroy the earth don't destroy the

417
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,679
planet that small patch of land right

418
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,198
there is yours right now but everything

419
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:15,278
around it is other people's the part

420
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,759
above it below it other people and in a

421
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:19,519
few years it will be somebody else's so

422
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:21,360

protective equipment when you're

440
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,120
applying a pesticide when you're getting

441
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,639
it off the shelf have your eye

442
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,120
protection and gloves on when you start

443
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,600
mixing it up have your long sleeves so

444
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,720
on your pesticide container

445
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,959
if you grab the container there's a

446
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,839
little book that folds out inside that

447
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,679
book it will tell you the recommended

448
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,519
clothing or personal protective

449
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,278
equipment the minimum personal

450
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,799
protective equipment required for that

451
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:20,799
pesticide please wear that

452
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,198
also inside of that booklet you will

453
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,120
find what is known as the re-entry

454
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,278
interval what that means is from the

455
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,120
time you spray it this is how long you

456
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:30,480
have got to wait before you can go back

457
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,560
in that environment they don't want you

458
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
to get contaminated if you're spraying

459
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,599
you're creating air bubbles there's a

460
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,198
mist in the room you don't want the

461
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,360
misty part in your lungs and you don't

462
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,439
want the wet fresh pesticide off the

463
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,680
plants on your skin in your eyes and

464
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,759
your body now you're contaminated let's

465
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,239
not do that to ourselves honor that

466
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,800
re-entry interval something i'm going to

467
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,720
add if you are in an indoor environment

468
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:56,078
which means your house inside your house

469
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,480
inside of a cultivation facility a

470
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,559
greenhouse may not be uh fall under this

471
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,560
category if you're in an indoor enclosed

472
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,278
environment or the sun is not getting

473
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:07,679
into there i recommend that you increase

474
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:10,078
your re-entry interval by a minimum of

475
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,319
two hours i would recommend four hours

476
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,799
my reason for this is i mentioned the

477
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,759
sun a moment ago most of the time the

478
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:19,599
sun the wind the environment will break

479
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,278
down a lot of the pesticides which you

480
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,519
have applied to the plants nature can

481
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,439
happen better outside we are in an

482
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,039
indoor environment there's no wind we do

483
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,560
have fans but it's just moving it around

484
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:31,278
the room it's not traveling anywhere

485
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,799
necessarily then we've got no sun in

486
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,159
there to break down that pesticide the

487
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:36,719
light's not going to do the same thing

488
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:39,519
the same the sun is magic so give

489
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,680
yourself two to four more hours of

490
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,159
re-entry interval time before you enter

491
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,879
that room after applying a pesticide

492
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,120
application i recommend uh applying a

493
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,480
pesticide right as the lights go out or

494
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,078
right after the lights go you can open

495
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,278
it up and spray spray them they're not

496
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,879
going to mess anything up if you're just

497
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,639
in there for one or two minutes hit them

498
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,039
with the pesticide spray zip it back up

499
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,480
close it back up whatever do it right as

500
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,319
the lights go out then you've got at

501
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,839
least eight 12 hours before you're going

502
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,279
to be in there again so they've got

503
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,400
plenty of time to dry up then when you

504
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,000
go in there again look at them they

505
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,839
should look super happy

506
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,519
sometimes if i've applied an oily

507
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,000
pesticide or something that is really

508
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,599
abrasive i will go in and just hose the

509
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,838
plants down with just fresh water i'll

510
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,519
get my pump sprayer or my paint spray or

511
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:22,078
whatever i'm doing and just spray the

512
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,639
plants down with clean ph balanced water

513
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:26,000
just to wash off that extra pesticide i

514
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,600
just give it a little bit of a rinse

515
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,079
i'll turn off the lights give it a spray

516
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,558
let them dry turn the lights back on

517
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,240
business as usual keep rocking so we

518
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,480
talked about re-entry interval we talked

519
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,720
about pesticide we talked about your

520
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,558
ethics we talked about not sharing uh

521
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,798
contaminated products with other people

522
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:44,639
smoke whatever you want bro if you're

523
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,639
gonna [ __ ] smoke it by yourself if

524
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,240
it's not going anywhere you can spray

525
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,759
whatever you i don't recommend it it's

526
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,599
not what i would do but you can do

527
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:53,519
whatever you want if you've got to get

528
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:54,879
rid of the bugs just don't share that

529
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,279
[ __ ]

530
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,600
ah we make medical marijuana was our

531
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,359
goal here not make others sick make

532
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,359
other people sick marijuana keep that in

533
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,038
mind the people are already sick they

534
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,719
already have a compromised immune system

535
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,000
possibly they could have cancer they

536
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,200
could have other conditions and you want

537
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,440
to give them something to make them

538
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,038
better not sicker that's your goal don't

539
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,679
be that guy now let's actually talk

540
00:18:13,038 --> 00:18:19,919
about some of the pesticides that i will

541
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,240
recommend my strategy all depends on um

542
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,080
the space the environment the room the

543
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,359
type the time of the year what am i

544
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:29,359
going to be facing as a problem as a a

545
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,038
bug what's my problem in this room what

546
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,038
am i trying to get rid of

547
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,960
uh we all know that most of the time

548
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,879
we're trying to get rid of spider mites

549
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,558
thrips fungus gnats white flies um those

550
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,919
are most and powdery mildew also is a

551
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,558
very common thing that we're mostly

552
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,120
trying to get rid of or keep away from

553
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,639
our grow i work in a lot of commercial

554
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,798
environments a lot of big spaces in

555
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,080
colorado where they get a lot of spider

556
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:53,440
mites it's like they're just passing

557
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:54,960
around the mites it's the trim crews

558
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,798
that are bringing them around i suspect

559
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
i can't prove it but they're the only

560
00:18:56,798 --> 00:18:59,759
new people coming and going it's the

561
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,120
trim crew bringing the spider mites

562
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,200
shout out to the trim crew i still love

563
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:04,719
you but um we got a lot of mites here

564
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
and we get a lot of powdery mildew so i

565
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
know how to beat that very well a lot of

566
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
people are getting rusted mites i can

567
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:12,080
destroy that the fungus gnats thrips

568
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,798
white flies that's amateur hour we can

569
00:19:12,079 --> 00:19:16,879
get rid of that [ __ ] so i really treat

570
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,119
to prevent spider mites powdery mildew

571
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:21,600
things like that the way that i do it is

572
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,319
i like to have a

573
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:26,079
yellow sticky trap every uh three to six

574
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:28,480
feet ish in the garden so if i got those

575
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,439
six foot by five foot trays i usually

576
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,880
put two to three sticky traps per tray

577
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,880
down kind of low

578
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,240
we do a lot of lollipopping between the

579
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,240
pot and the

580
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,839
start of the plant is about 12 to 18

581
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,440
inches depending on the strain and how

582
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:43,439
long we [ __ ] veg

583
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,440
uh in that area i will hang yellow

584
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,600
sticky traps the bugs love to go in that

585
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,038
area then i may put some up higher also

586
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,000
but i definitely get down there by the

587
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,480
legs

588
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,359
those are not in any way designed to

589
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,000
eradicate or remove or eliminate a bug

590
00:19:55,359 --> 00:20:00,240
those are there to indicate the presence

591
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,640
of a pest those say hey dude there's

592
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,640
these black sticky things all over here

593
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,240
count them see how many there were you

594
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,000
saw them on the first break before you

595
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,440
went to break check on them before you

596
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,440
go to lunch and check on them at third

597
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,798
break then if we need to up our game we

598
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,279
know we've got bugs in there so the

599
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,279
yellow sticky traps are my first line of

600
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,918
defense my second line of defense is

601
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,599
just myself and the grotechs looking

602
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,320
just use your eyes when you're in there

603
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:25,599
watering defoliating popping twisting

604
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,720
taking up the trash whatever you're

605
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,119
doing just look at the plants

606
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,960
occasionally do you see signs of spider

607
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,558
mites do you see thrip damage do you see

608
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,798
anything that indicates hey there are

609
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,720
bugs so the first way to get rid of and

610
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,038
prevent them is just to scout for them

611
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,640
and have some sort of alarm system those

612
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,679
yellow sticky traps let me know that

613
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:46,640
they are there now let's talk about um

614
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,600
what i like to apply what i like to do

615
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,120
is i generally apply pesticides on a

616
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,519
monday it's just something that's easy

617
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:54,959
to keep in mind every monday we do apply

618
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,480
a pesticide

619
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,759
if i know that the season is coming

620
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,079
where the mites are going to get strong

621
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,839
or the fungus gnats get real strong or

622
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,359
if another facility has bugs or

623
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,678
something like that then i will increase

624
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,319
to monday and thursday

625
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,240
depending on which bugs i'm facing uh if

626
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,240
i'm doing a preventative or if i'm doing

627
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,720
an eradication spray or if i'm doing a

628
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,599
holy [ __ ] spray that tells me which

629
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,360
products i'm going to use i do rotate

630
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:21,199
i do like to rotate the products i will

631
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,279
use two or three products together at

632
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,120
one time also i'll mix them in this pump

633
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,879
sprayer and i'll spray two or three

634
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:28,399
products at a time

635
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,159
make sure you rotate that's a very

636
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,798
important thing is to rotate if you hit

637
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,960
them with one product today and the same

638
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,639
product tomorrow by day three they're

639
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,919
ready for it it's not gonna even matter

640
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,240
they're just gonna get stronger you're

641
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,240
gonna make super mites so i recommend to

642
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,798
rotate a product if you can afford one

643
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,319
two maybe three good products spray two

644
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,480
products on day one and hit them with

645
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,918
the third product on the next spray and

646
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,440
then two different products two

647
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,679
different combos on the next time just

648
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,679
keep switching it up somehow so they got

649
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,159
a new way to try to figure it out

650
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,000
understand the mode of attack how does

651
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,760
this product work on the bug i am

652
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
treating also the first thing is

653
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,879
identify the pest which you're trying to

654
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
get rid of what are you trying to fight

655
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,120
if you don't even know that you'll never

656
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,038
win identify the bug then think about

657
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,038
multiple methods of how to destroy that

658
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,640
bug first of all make an undesirable

659
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:16,079
environment if they don't like being

660
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,840
there if the leaves are sticky if the

661
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:19,519
leaves are wet if the leaves are oily

662
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:21,439
they don't want to be around then attack

663
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:23,599
them a couple of ways some of these

664
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,360
products make them forget to eat the

665
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,959
bugs just walk around and they're like i

666
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,359
should be doing something

667
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,519
they don't eat they die some of these

668
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:33,279
products make a mushroom grow out this

669
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:34,798
little they eat this little bacteria and

670
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,399
it goes inside of the mushroom or inside

671
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:37,918
of the bug and it grows out of them and

672
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,679
makes a giant mushroom and they die and

673
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,960
then the mushrooms decompose it's kind

674
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,880
of cool to see the little pictures and

675
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,960
videos of that happening but understand

676
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,400
the uh the methods and mode of attack

677
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,240
some just stop them from being able to

678
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,919
reproduce so that's cool you got them

679
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,599
they can't eat they can't reproduce and

680
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,520
now we're blowing them up with mushrooms

681
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,918
and we made it sticky think about

682
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:57,918
multiple modes of attack and then also

683
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,919
think about not letting them build

684
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,159
resistance now we're gonna kind of just

685
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,960
focus in on a list of products that i

686
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,640
wrote down uh identify your bug

687
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,120
i didn't understand the pesticide you're

688
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,799
using and apply with purpose and rotate

689
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,279
your pesticide

690
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:15,119
now um let's just talk about some of the

691
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,279
products that i wrote down i like a

692
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,079
product called pyganic i also like

693
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:22,158
evergreen those are both pyrethrin-based

694
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:24,000
very similar products but very different

695
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,240
application rates

696
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,919
i like as a max and as a troll i think

697
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,359
as a max is banned in the commercial

698
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,280
facility

699
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:32,558
excuse me for the burps i also do like a

700
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,480
product called

701
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,960
venerate venerate is a very strong

702
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,798
product be careful with that one i like

703
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
botana garden max let me tell you what i

704
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:43,440
use these for let me back up

705
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,038
pyganic evergreen azatrol venerate those

706
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,200
are good for almost everything but

707
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,720
especially spider mites

708
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,960
botanic garden max i will use the

709
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,600
botanic guard max as a spray for fighter

710
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,960
spider mites uh fungus gnats and then i

711
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:59,359
will use it as a soil dredge for fungus

712
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,200
gnats or white flies also the gigantic

713
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:03,519
and evergreen those make a great soil

714
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,200
dredge as well for fungus gnats and

715
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:06,558
white flies when you're treating for

716
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,120
white flies

717
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,519
i recommend you do a soil dredge and a

718
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,038
spray application at the same time

719
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,119
because if you spray one and don't do

720
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,480
the other they just move they go hang

721
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,759
out in the other spot they go you [ __ ]

722
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
up the soil we'll go to the leaves you

723
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:20,640
spray the leaves they go to the soil

724
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,480
you've got to do both when you're

725
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,200
messing with the white flies for white

726
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,000
flies i recommend monterey garden spray

727
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,000
with spinosad spinosad is a bacteria

728
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,400
made in the bottom of a whiskey barrel

729
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,519
and it will work very well on your white

730
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,080
flies i also like a product called cease

731
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:41,278
cease is a good product i like smite and

732
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:44,158
banish however if you use smite and or

733
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,400
banish rinse your plants off before the

734
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,919
lights come back on those products will

735
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,679
cause photo toxicity um i also like a

736
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,440
product called regalia that's good to

737
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,759
keep away the powdery mildew and a lot

738
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,080
of pests in an outdoor grow i would use

739
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,119
a lot of regalia i also like double

740
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,960
nickel

741
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,000
anything with spin assad

742
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:06,159
grandivo's a great product triac 70 is

743
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,679
like one of my last lines of defense if

744
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,919
everything else didn't do it we'll mix

745
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,159
in some tri-act there are other products

746
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,759
that are more abrasive more aggressive

747
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,000
i'm not going to talk about them here

748
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,359
today i don't want you to use them if

749
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,759
you want to

750
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:22,240
do your thing it's your grow it's your

751
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:25,278
ethics but i would not recommend it

752
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,759
another great product if you've got soil

753
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:30,400
bound problems like white flies fungus

754
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,558
gnats and you want to drench that soil

755
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,480
something that works really good is

756
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:36,558
mosquito bits

757
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,120
like your local hardware shop maybe

758
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,519
target definitely home depot lowe's they

759
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,119
sell things called mosquito dunks they

760
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,879
look like little it's a red package with

761
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:46,719
yellow writing they look like little

762
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,440
shitty donuts in a package there are six

763
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,120
of them small six shitty donuts i will

764
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,519
take one of those and crush it up into

765
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,000
like a very fine dust and then put that

766
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,440
in my reservoir with my water and water

767
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,880
the plants with that you may see some of

768
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,759
the chunks floating around that's just

769
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,080
fine

770
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:04,158
inside of those mosquito bits is a

771
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:06,798
beneficial bacteria beneficial to the

772
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,400
plants not so beneficial to the fungus

773
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,639
gnats and white flies it'll wipe them

774
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,759
out so give them a soil dredge with fung

775
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
with the

776
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,798
fungus now what is it called the

801
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,839
i said this but granulated sulfur is a

802
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,159
great product for getting rid of a lot

803
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:13,519
of pests

804
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,200
now that i've told you products that i

805
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,558
do use let me tell you something that i

806
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,080
do not use i do not recommend neem oil i

807
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,079
don't like neem oil in the garden it

808
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:24,000
tastes like [ __ ] it doesn't go away it

809
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,558
makes the plants taste terrible and i

810
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,278
also don't like to use botanical oils

811
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:31,038
like hippie oil sprays rosemary oregano

812
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:33,119
oil all that stuff i don't do that in

813
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,798
the garden why not because a lot of the

814
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,879
stuff that we grow turns into

815
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,158
concentrates we make hash out of it and

816
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,159
you can see when you're making a

817
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,480
concentrate you can see those oily

818
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,080
pesticides float to the top i did just

819
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,200
tell you a bunch of stuff to spray on

820
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:47,678
the plant that's going to make them

821
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,200
sticky but you're going to apply it way

822
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,399
early they're going to last long enough

823
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
to where you don't have to apply it

824
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,398
again and they will be gone they'll be

825
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,319
broken down evaporated dissipated and

826
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,798
gone away from the plant before it is

827
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:00,798
harvest time dry cure smoke that [ __ ]

828
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,720
will all be gone by then but those

829
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:05,038
hippie botanical oils they just leave

830
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,880
that flavor i can taste the mint i can

831
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,200
taste weird [ __ ] and the concentrates in

832
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,120
the flowers i can taste it when i get

833
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,679
certain products so i don't recommend

834
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:16,398
that sort of stuff no botanical oils ah

835
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,640
none of that neem oil stick with ria and

836
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,199
my this is my opinion my recommendation

837
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,120
stick with the real

838
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,200
agriculturally recommended pesticide

839
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,278
application if you want to really

840
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,278
strategically get rid of your pests if

841
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:31,278
you guys want to use the hippie oils do

842
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:34,398
that also something i do really like

843
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,079
another uh completely flipped option a

844
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:38,639
whole b-side too using all these

845
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,480
pesticides is why not use some sort of

846
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,960
predator mites you can release

847
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,038
swarovskis hypoasmus miles persimilis

848
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,480
cucumaris green lace wings i know i went

849
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,798
really fast on that

850
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,720
but rove beetles all those guys will

851
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,240
really really help you out

852
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,679
in your garden

853
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,759
and they are harmless that way you don't

854
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,038
have to smoke oils that way you don't

855
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:58,798
have to spray things you do have to

856
00:28:57,038 --> 00:28:59,919
disperse the bugs if you're growing in

857
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,158
your home a lot of people don't like

858
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:03,600
that but for a commercial grow i greatly

859
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,159
highly recommend

860
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:10,319
aggressive predator bugs once again

861
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:13,919
swarskis persimilis hypoaspis miles rove

862
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:15,519
beetles cucumeris um what else did i say

863
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,960
green lace wings get

864
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,960
get the green lace wings that are on the

865
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,038
cards and they are just about to hatch

866
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,640
they turn into little [ __ ] alligators

867
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:24,480
and those things will eat all of the

868
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,919
bugs in your grow

869
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,319
