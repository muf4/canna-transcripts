00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,189

Kreischer at comedy works I was exciting

40
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,959
I haven't been that excited for a comedy

41
00:01:33,728 --> 00:01:36,879
show in a little while Bert's been

42
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,719
really popular lately he didn't really

43
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:42,219
hyped up he did not disappoint Bert was

44
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,478

46
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,409
comedian he is known as the Machine he

47
00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:49,210
does a bit about the machine

48
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:51,039
I encourage you as soon as you get done

49
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,568
listening to my podcast to go to youtube

50
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:54,700

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,340
Royal Treatment at Comedy Works Bert

57
00:02:04,269 --> 00:02:09,008
came out and did about 40 minutes of

58
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,299
material and then after 40 minutes he

59
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:13,089
revealed to the crowd that he was

60
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:14,980
recording his special that night and he

61
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,090
is going to edit down the recording the

62
00:02:14,979 --> 00:02:18,429
show that he did he's gonna edit that

63
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,979
that down and that will be he's hoping

64
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,569
to sell the show to Netflix he actually

65
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:24,340
brought his own film crew he paid for it

66
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,659
all out of his pocket and he recorded

67
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,280
the entire show Oh

68
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:29,229
out of his pocket with his friends and

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,569
his own crew nobody paid for it and he's

70
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:33,369
going to sell the special to Netflix so

71
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:36,430
hopefully you guys will be able to watch

72
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,140
this show on Netflix it'll probably be

73
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,310
like a year before that happens honestly

74
00:02:38,139 --> 00:02:40,929
with the way all the paperwork and [ __ ]

75
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,680
happens and editing and all that but

76
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:45,760
eventually you'll get to see that on

77
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,560
Netflix we knew something was going on

78
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:48,608
because uh there was a camera there

79
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,829
there's a big camera there were

80
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:52,000
microphones and [ __ ] which is an odd for

81
00:02:50,829 --> 00:02:53,019
Comedy Works that's kind of a regular

82
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,239
thing but there was a little more

83
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,739
production than usual but usually if

84
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,140
somebody's doing a special I saw the

85
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,719
taping of Joe Rogan special at the same

86
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,189
event the same venue Joe Rogan recorded

87
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:05,469
his special Rocky Mountain High

88
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:07,750
he works and I went to that and it was

89
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,129
really uptight they had everybody taking

90
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,919
off their hats who couldn't wear shirts

91
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:14,439
with logos it was a really uptight kind

92
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,269
of intense experience and the recording

93
00:03:14,439 --> 00:03:18,099
for Bert's show was just a just normal

94
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:19,360
comedy show come on in and get rowdy and

95
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,939
so that was really cool it was way

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,770
better way smoother way less stressful

97
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,629
you were able to enjoy the show more it

98
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:26,800
was a little better so yeah he recorded

99
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:28,569
a special you guys will be able to see

100
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,280
it he did about 40 minutes of material

101
00:03:28,569 --> 00:03:31,959
then he announced that he was doing the

102
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,340
special and recording then he looked at

103
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,659
a notebook and he's like [ __ ] I got to

104
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,280
do these couple of bits cuz he had to

105
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,500
get all his material in so he did a

106
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,849
couple of bits and then he like kind of

107
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,129
freestyled for a few minutes that felt

108
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:43,539
like VIN he said alright you guys

109
00:03:42,129 --> 00:03:46,719
[ __ ] ready and he did the Machine

110
00:03:43,539 --> 00:03:47,859
story and honestly he felt like he was

111
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,169
rushing through the machine story

112
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,610
everything else was [ __ ] hilarious I

113
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:53,109
laughed so hard I thought I was gonna

114
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,550
poop myself once or twice I thought I

115
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,590
was gonna pee myself my cheeks were

116
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:58,420
hurting my stomach was hurting after so

117
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,550
much laughter your head will start to

118
00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,139
hurt I was I had laughed my ass off so

119
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:04,210
by the time he got to the Machine story

120
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:05,589
I think he saw the waitresses dropping

121
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,379
checks II know it's time to speed it up

122
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,840
so he's speeding up he crushed it some

123
00:04:08,379 --> 00:04:12,579
of my favorite parts uh he was telling

124
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,170
he would be telling stories and telling

125
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:15,850
jokes that I've heard and then he would

126
00:04:14,169 --> 00:04:18,639
just have random sidebars and just go

127
00:04:15,849 --> 00:04:21,189
off on a on a random sidebar he was

128
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,379
telling a story about having to go to a

129
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:25,180
and I'm not gonna do the joke and he

130
00:04:23,379 --> 00:04:27,310
justice he had to go to a meeting at

131
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,840
school for one of his students and he

132
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:30,370
woke up and he thought he grabbed two

133
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:33,039
diet cokes and put them in his hoodie

134
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:34,209
pocket and went to the school he was in

135
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,040
the meeting and he reached in his hoodie

136
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:37,989
pocket he pulled one out cracked it open

137
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,910
took a slam of it and realized it's a

138
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:41,139
Coors Light not a diet coke so that's

139
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:42,970
the kind of stories that this man tells

140
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:44,319
at his comedy show it was [ __ ]

141
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,330

142
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:48,759

166
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,840
was super kind to me so a huge shout out

167
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,840
to mr. Burt [ __ ] christ sure the

168
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,399
machine Frank Castillo comedy works and

169
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,529
my buddy Baker

170
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:45,060
there was also an opening act his name

171
00:05:43,529 --> 00:05:46,859
was Elliott I did not catch his last

172
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,329
name every time an opening acts has

173
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,710
their name they say it like my name is

174
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:51,120
Elliott booba and it was good to see you

175
00:05:49,709 --> 00:05:52,829
and he'd never catch their [ __ ] full

176
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,569
name so I don't know what his last name

177
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:56,189
was he was hilarious

178
00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:58,530
somebody said he looks like a young John

179
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,978
Elway and he took offense to it sorry

180
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:02,369
dude

181
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:04,408
that [ __ ] was accurate another funny

182
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,519
part on the show Bert Kreischer was

183
00:06:04,408 --> 00:06:07,469
talking about trying to keep his

184
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,848
daughters innocent and he believes that

185
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,710
once a daughter does not believe in

186
00:06:08,848 --> 00:06:13,408
Santa Claus is about the same time when

187
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:15,029
she starts sucking a dick so I had the

188
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:16,709
lovely always lovely always beautiful

189
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:18,359
miss Jenny Beth on my arm sitting right

190
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,739
next to me and we were front row of

191
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,419
course at comedy works because we do

192
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,949
have the VIP love there and Bert

193
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:24,538
Kreischer looked at Ginny and said you

194
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,788
ever suck a dick and she of course

195
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,288
nodded her head yes and Bert replied

196
00:06:26,788 --> 00:06:29,908
with you believe in Santa and she of

197
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,990
course nodded her head no and Bert said

198
00:06:29,908 --> 00:06:32,038
case in point

199
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,650
so I thought it's pretty funny that

200
00:06:32,038 --> 00:06:36,329
Jenny got to be the example I thought it

201
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:37,848
was extra funny to choose the example of

202
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:39,750
sucking dick and not believing in Santa

203
00:06:37,848 --> 00:06:41,038
all right let's move forward before I

204
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:44,430
get myself into any trouble with this

205
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:45,959
conversation let's talk about what else

206
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,430
went on lately there was a big fight

207
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,680
there anybody hear about this fight a

208
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:51,060
boxing match I watched it I did not pay

209
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,430
to watch it I wouldn't pay to watch that

210
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,780
it was I only watched it cuz the hype

211
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,840
and I was curious I didn't want to feel

212
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:59,668
left out I had made predictions I

213
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,168
predicted everybody could say they made

214
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:02,579
predictions Rex it already happened I

215
00:07:01,168 --> 00:07:04,228
can say I said nobody seen it happen no

216
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:05,668
I predicted that if it went further than

217
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,959
four or five rounds that Connor would

218
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:08,728
get tired and put his hands down and get

219
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,779
punched in the head and that's basically

220
00:07:08,728 --> 00:07:10,978
what happened I'm not trying to say I

221
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:12,839
was psychic it was just that was the

222
00:07:10,978 --> 00:07:14,129
never seen that dude go for very long

223
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:15,568
and I've seen the other dude go for a

224
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,848
long [ __ ] time so I need to wear him

225
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:19,169
out I thought he might be dangerous if

226
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:20,728
he hit him if McGregor would have hit

227
00:07:19,168 --> 00:07:21,089
him it might hurt him he didn't do [ __ ]

228
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:22,918
to me

229
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:24,239
so hope you guys enjoyed the fight I

230
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:25,500
hope somebody want a bunch of [ __ ]

231
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,908
money out there I know a lot of people

232
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,209
were gambling on it I hope you were one

233
00:07:26,908 --> 00:07:31,870
of the people that took home

234
00:07:28,209 --> 00:07:34,239
a big fat paycheck on that fight it was

235
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,439
overhyped in my opinion overhyped I was

236
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,848
not impressed and glad I didn't paper

237
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:38,649
paint money to watch it glad I didn't go

238
00:07:36,848 --> 00:07:40,800
anywhere to watch it I've got a friend

239
00:07:38,649 --> 00:07:44,288
who broadcasted it on periscope live

240
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,939

00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:35,649

00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:37,088
and comprehensive and I'm glad you find

267

it awesome so thank you I appreciate the

268
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,930
compliments and I'm happy to answer your

269
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,668
question about flushing it goes like

270
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,528
this I've listened to your flush and

271
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:46,659
cure episodes multiple times high and

272
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:49,328
low maybe I'm looking too far into this

273
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:51,490
I'm using three gallon pots you say to

274
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,199
run three times fresh water the size of

275
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,539
the pot which would be nine gallons in

276
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,700
my setup question is should I be run

277
00:08:55,539 --> 00:09:00,159
running nine gallons of water total or

278
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:02,259
nine gallons on my bi-weekly water and

279
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:05,230
then he continues with I'm running Fox

280
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:07,360
Farm Ocean forest soil so let's talk for

281
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:10,420
a second about flushing and why we want

282
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,759
to flush and what flushing does the

283
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:14,769
point of flushing is to remove excess

284
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:16,419
nutrients from the buds from the plants

285
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:18,549
so that when you cut them down the

286
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:20,769
plants don't taste like [ __ ] they don't

287
00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:22,659
burn like [ __ ] you just want to move the

288
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:24,309
mobile nutrients out of the plant it's

289
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:25,539
gonna make the plants burn much more

290
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:26,769
smoothly it's gonna make them taste

291
00:09:25,539 --> 00:09:28,240
better it's gonna make them more

292
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:30,159
appealing they will smell better if

293
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,539
you've ever tried to roll a joint and

294
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,338
you lit a joint and smoked it and it

295
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:35,289
wouldn't burn right or the ashes got

296
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:37,660
black and chunky and became little coals

297
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:39,159
that herb was probably not properly

298
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:40,449
flushed it could have been flushed a

299
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:42,669
little longer or

300
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:45,070
more heavily now what flushing will do

301
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:47,379
is you want to pour enough water through

302
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,760
your soil to clean out the nutrients

303
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:50,559
that are in that soil you want to get

304
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:52,870
rid of all the nitrogen phosphorous

305
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,609
potassium calcium magnesium there are

306
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,440
sixteen elements in there that you need

307
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,539
to wash out you don't want that [ __ ]

308
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:00,190
left in your plants so the idea is to

309
00:09:58,539 --> 00:10:01,299
rinse the soil enough to where that is

310
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:03,220
not left in there

311
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:05,559
and then at the same time you need to

312
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:07,540
give the plant plenty of time to

313
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:09,339
metabolize which you want it to drink up

314
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,929
that water and metabolize all the

315
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:12,460
nutrients that are left in there so

316
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:14,109
you'll start seeing the leaves turn

317
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,759
golden yellow that's telling you I'm

318
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:17,350
running out of nitrogen you'll start

319
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,539
seeing things start going purple and

320
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,250
silver colors and red and oranges that's

321
00:10:19,539 --> 00:10:23,529
telling me that all those nutrients are

322
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,529
being sucked out of the leaves and the

323
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:28,839
plants are now ready to harvest now

324
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,220
ideally with most soil applications

325
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,470
you're gonna want to give your plants

326
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,840
ten to fourteen maybe even twenty days

327
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,250
to a flush time depending on how heavily

328
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,560
you've been feeding them and what is

329
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:41,110
left in your soil if you're using cocoa

330
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,419
or hydroponic mediums you can go much

331
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,700
less time sometimes seven days is enough

332
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:47,709
ten days is usually plenty if you're in

333
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,450
cocoa you will really see the plants

334
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:51,730
flush out quickly if you're in cocoa and

335
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:53,860
you start feeding it just PhD water PhD

336
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,269
like six four six five after three or

337
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,830
four or four or five feedings of that

338
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:58,899
you will see the plants start reacting

339
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,040
and telling you hey I'm adding nutrients

340
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:02,019
what the [ __ ] is going on

341
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:04,240
because cocoa doesn't hold much nutrient

342
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:06,009
either it is about rockwool now you guys

343
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,750
that are using a super soil or a living

344
00:11:06,009 --> 00:11:09,610
soil or no-till this does not apply to

345
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,840
you because the organic stuff that

346
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,669
you're putting in there the plant is

347
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,680
only gonna take up what it wants and

348
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:16,569
it's not going to have unnecessary stuff

349
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:18,009
in there and like sub cool says you've

350
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:20,530
been flushing the whole time if you're

351
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:22,330
feeding your plants super soil you mixed

352
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:23,799
up a batch of super soil you put the

353
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,509
plant in there when it was little and it

354
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:27,129
has been eating all of those nutrients

355
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:28,960
the entire time and it has converted

356
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:31,019
those nutrients into big healthy plants

357
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,580
big healthy stalks big fat juicy

358
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,889
resinous trichome laden buds that smell

359
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,450
like [ __ ] candy and amazingness so

360
00:11:35,889 --> 00:11:39,490
all of those nutrients and amendments

361
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,290
have probably been eaten up you can

362
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:43,720
probably tell by the way the plants

363
00:11:41,289 --> 00:11:44,829
acting if you put too much nutrient in

364
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,750
there when you mixed it up and made the

365
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:48,400
soil too rich you either burn the plant

366
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,960
early or it's gonna take a little too

367
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,189
long to eat up all those nutrients

368
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:52,220
you're gonna have to run a little extra

369
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,230
water through it

370
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,120
most of you guys doing the super soil

371
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,430
the living soils the no-till [ __ ]

372
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,320
there's no need for you to flush now

373
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:02,329
let's get kind of more to the point of

374
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,250
this listeners question he wants to know

375
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,350
since I'm using a three gallon pot and

376
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,879
you recommended that I use three times

377
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:09,710
the amount of water do I need to run

378
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,710
nine gallons of water through this pot

379
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:14,060
to consider it flushed I feel like

380
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:16,610
running nine gallons of water through

381
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:18,709
your three gallon pot is going to flood

382
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,360
your plants and drown them and make them

383
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:22,730
droopy and make them look like [ __ ] and

384
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,200
really make them angry especially if

385
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:26,120
you're using a plastic pot if you've got

386
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,680
air pots or net pots that may work for

387
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,240
you but if you're using a plastic pot

388
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,620
that's definitely gonna drown your

389
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,090
plants and also you're gonna have a lot

390
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,070
of runoff if you do that that you're

391
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:37,370
going to have to deal with my advice

392
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:40,040
would be to run pH daughter pH balanced

393
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:42,440
about six for adjusted pH to about six

394
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,599
for run enough of that through the plant

395
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,190
until it's really running out of the

396
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,110
bottom you want to see water coming out

397
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,300
of the bottom of the pot maybe pour it

398
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:51,620
until like half a gallon comes out or

399
00:12:50,299 --> 00:12:53,419
pour and then wait because it's gonna

400
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,710
take a minute pour a gallon of water in

401
00:12:53,419 --> 00:12:56,539
there wait a little bit see how much

402
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:58,070
comes out if you don't get a half a

403
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:59,360
gallon of water at the bottom pour a

404
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,830
little bit more and wait until you've

405
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,330
got about a half a gallon out of the

406
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,310
bottom of the plant they should be

407
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:06,379
really saturated at that time and they

408
00:13:04,309 --> 00:13:08,179
shouldn't be over watered and then you

409
00:13:06,379 --> 00:13:10,129
want to let them dry almost completely

410
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:11,569
let them get to where they're like tree

411
00:13:10,129 --> 00:13:13,490
like they're kind of looking like they

412
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,410
need water that give them water at that

413
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,299
point and soak them up again until they

414
00:13:15,409 --> 00:13:19,699
start running off and do this over the

415
00:13:17,299 --> 00:13:21,079
next 14 days and you'll probably be able

416
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,310
to get nine gallons of water through

417
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,830
there if you do one and a half gallons

418
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:26,929
of water that's gonna be four or five

419
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,850
times that should work out if your water

420
00:13:26,929 --> 00:13:31,189
in every three days that should work out

421
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,960
just about right you know I do remember

422
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,550
having the theory that you should run

423
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,509
three times the amount of water through

424
00:13:34,549 --> 00:13:37,189
your pot but now that we're talking

425
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:38,659
about it that seems a little excessive

426
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:40,340
and maybe I'm gonna change my mind

427
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:42,409
maybe you just need double if you

428
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,940
haven't been fertilizing super heavily

429
00:13:42,409 --> 00:13:47,000
and you're taking care of your plants I

430
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:48,770
think two times the amount of water six

431
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,629
gallons should do you so let's think

432
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:52,159
about this your water on the first time

433
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:54,320
you're gonna do a gallon and a half of

434
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,459
water ish so that's one then the second

435
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,950
time you'll do another gallon and a half

436
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:59,300
that's two or that makes three and then

437
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,940
if you do that two more times it gives

438
00:13:59,299 --> 00:14:03,379
you six gallons and over 14 days you

439
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,780
should be able to get four solid

440
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:07,419
waterings in there

441
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:09,909
so that should make sense now the main

442
00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:12,399
thing you don't have to go buy a certain

443
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:17,019
amount of water if you have an EC meter

444
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:19,090
or a ppm meter get some of the water

445
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,669
that comes out of that pot and measure

446
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:23,350
the PPM's of that water and you want to

447
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:25,449
get it as low as you can you want it if

448
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:26,320
you're going by excuse the throat

449
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,180
clearing there if you're going by

450
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,300
electrical conductivity you want to get

451
00:14:28,179 --> 00:14:33,519
it down into the like 1.1 1.2 range

452
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:34,689
that's kind of where you want it that

453
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,819
means there's not a lot of stuff in

454
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:38,080
there now one thing that keeps ticking

455
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,030
in the back of my head is I'm talking

456
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,340
and it's reminding me say this if you

457
00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:45,250
don't have some pearlite or some sort of

458
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:47,200
aeration in your soil it's easy to drown

459
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:48,909
the plants with too much water so keep

460
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,500
that in mind if you've got compacted

461
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:51,909
soil that you didn't add anything to in

462
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,289
it I think this guy said he's using Fox

463
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:55,089
farm so you should be okay you've got

464
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:57,279
decently fluffy soil just pay attention

465
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:58,420
to how much water is in there pay

466
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,799
attention to how long it takes him to

467
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:02,049
dry out you don't want to drown these

468
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:03,909
plants if you did not put any aeration

469
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:05,349
in with your Coco you need to be more

470
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:07,449
careful about how much water you use I

471
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:09,759
believe in using a lot of perlite use

472
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,370
more perlite ah you need aeration the

473
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,620
roots love oxygen they can handle more

474
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:16,750
waterings they'll dry out more evenly I

475
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:18,399
really think you should have some good

476
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,049
perlite in there so if you don't have

477
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,509
some sort of aeration be careful cuz you

478
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:24,370
can drown the plants with too much water

479
00:15:22,509 --> 00:15:26,529
so flush them out

480
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,419
smart pick a date think about your

481
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:30,699
harvest date say you want to harvest on

482
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:32,199
the 14th that means on the first you

483
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,610
need to get in there and pour like a

484
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,580
gallon a half of water through each

485
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,430
gallon pot let it dry up probably take 4

486
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:42,370
or 5 days do the same thing let it dry

487
00:15:39,429 --> 00:15:44,169
up probably take 4 or 5 days do the same

488
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,820
thing now you're it like what 12 to 15

489
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:47,319
days now you're up here on the 14th or

490
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:49,600
15th it's time to cut down your pot your

491
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,980
leaves are starting to look gold they're

492
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,300
starting to get a little bit droopy they

493
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,220
might be a little bit crispy that's how

494
00:15:52,299 --> 00:15:56,169
you know there's no nutrients left in

495
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,300
there so when you dry it if you cure it

496
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:59,889
properly you put in a jar do all that

497
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,569
stuff that's a whole nother episode when

498
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:03,819
you smoke it this stuff should leave a

499
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:06,070
nice white ash it shouldn't burn your

500
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:09,460
throat it shouldn't be funky at all if

501
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,839
you properly flush your cannabis so that

502
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,759
was the long answer I guess the short

503
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,320
answer is no you don't need to run all 9

504
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,059
or in this case we're gonna say 6

505
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,910
gallons of water through that pot at one

506
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,589
time

507
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:20,719
is better to stretch it out over a

508
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:22,879
couple of weeks you say your bi-weekly

509
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,230
water so that will work perfectly

510
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,899
stretch it out

511
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,700
flush them out they will thank you you

512
00:16:26,899 --> 00:16:29,929
will thank me for it it will be well

513
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,850
worth your time and energy I don't know

514
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:33,949
why people don't flush more because if

515
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:35,480
you think about it flushing is free it

516
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,160
doesn't cost anything about water you're

517
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,570
already gonna water the plants usually

518
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:40,339
you would put nutrients in there that

519
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:42,080
start making it cost money and I know

520
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,310
water does cost something but it's next

521
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,590
to nothing compared to all the other

522
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,759
[ __ ] you pay for so just give them water

523
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,740
you just have to keep them alive for

524
00:16:46,759 --> 00:16:51,620
another 14 days is all you have to do

525
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:54,289
it's not that challenging flush your

526
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,840
plants also here's a little hint reduce

527
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:57,409
the lights by an hour or two while

528
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,850
you're flushing

529
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:00,829
if you just want to speed them up a

530
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,379
little bit turn the lights down instead

531
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:05,210
of 12 12 go maybe 10 14 at the end of

532
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:06,349
flower for that last week you might see

533
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:08,390
some differences that you're happy with

534
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,980
I think you will like it it also save

535
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,540
you some money under on your electrical

536
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,640
bill

537
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:15,109
that's just my advice all right I want

538
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,450
to address another topic just something

539
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:18,829
random I was somewhere and people were

540
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:20,240
just talking about random things and I

541
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,699
heard this as a topic and I thought I

542
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,720
should talk about that on the podcast

543
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,850
somebody was taking dabs and they were

544
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,960
trying to hold their dabs in as long as

545
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:28,429
they couldn't as like why do you hold

546
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,840
your dad so long that's not good for you

547
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,850
and they're like man it's just like

548
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,230
smoking weed when you take a big hit you

549
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,909
got to hold it in so you get everything

550
00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,160
so you get as high as you could get off

551
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:39,259
that hit and honestly you guys I don't

552
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:40,910
believe that to be accurate at all I

553
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:43,099
think holding in your smoke whether it's

554
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,230
a DAB whether it's a joint whether it's

555
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:46,909
a bong hit holding in any kind of smoke

556
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,829
cannot be good for you you're putting

557
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:51,230
pressure on your lungs unnecessary

558
00:17:48,829 --> 00:17:53,629
pressure your lungs are basically little

559
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,039
bags that fill up and empty with air and

560
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:56,660
they got little sensitive parts in there

561
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,829
I'm not a doctor but I know my lungs are

562
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,570
sensitive and I could feel the pressure

563
00:17:57,829 --> 00:18:00,829
when I take when I used to take a bong

564
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:02,329
hit try to hold it you feel your heart

565
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:04,009
start racing your blood pressure go up

566
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:04,819
and [ __ ] that's because your lungs are

567
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:06,799
freaking out

568
00:18:04,819 --> 00:18:09,710
you are not getting higher you were

569
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,240
giving yourself an increased risk of

570
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:13,759
getting chronic obstructive pulmonary

571
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:16,009
disorder also known as COPD holding

572
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,629
smoke is a huge contributing factor to

573
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:18,859
that disorder

574
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,360
it's a condition where you feel like

575
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,139
you're drowning all the time you can't

576
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:23,149
breathe properly

577
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,560
you can't exhale properly and it's

578
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,910
[ __ ] scary from what I've heard I

579
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,109
have not experienced it I know people

580
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,240
who have talked about it I know somebody

581
00:18:27,109 --> 00:18:30,359
that's experienced it it's not a fun

582
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,460
thing so

583
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:33,839
quit stressing your lungs unnecessarily

584
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,819
and people are gonna argue and say but

585
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,308
you get higher if you hold it no you

586
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:40,798
don't you may get a head rush you get a

587
00:18:38,308 --> 00:18:42,240
lack of oxygen your heart races but

588
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:44,308
you're not getting more cannabinoids

589
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,159
from holding in your head your lungs are

590
00:18:44,308 --> 00:18:48,690
a mucous membrane I feel like the smoke

591
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:50,700
hits your lungs and anything that's

592
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:52,679
gonna get in goes in and what doesn't

593
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,269
coats your lungs it stays right there

594
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,970
I've said this on the podcast before

595
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:58,500
when I take a gigantic dab and I'm not

596
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,850
bragging this is just how I like to do

597
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,099
things and I don't have a lot of time

598
00:18:59,849 --> 00:19:04,079
and this is just my preferred method I

599
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:06,178
like to take about a half gram dad I'm

600
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:07,678
not joking if you hang out with me you

601
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,179
will testify people are gonna he [ __ ]

602
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,429
takes a half gram debt I take a half

603
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:13,889
gram to have on a regular basis I feel

604
00:19:11,429 --> 00:19:16,200
like that half gram dad gets me really

605
00:19:13,888 --> 00:19:18,599
super medicated for a few minutes I get

606
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,429
medicinal value and I also get really

607
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:22,109
high from it which sometimes is what I'm

608
00:19:20,429 --> 00:19:25,139
going for but when I'm done with the

609
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:27,359
high I still have this layer of oily

610
00:19:25,138 --> 00:19:30,109
hash permeating my lungs and I feel like

611
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:32,819
it's a slow-release capsule my lungs are

612
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:35,219
dissolving and absorbing the

613
00:19:32,819 --> 00:19:37,288
cannabinoids from this hash as it melts

614
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,700
into my lungs as it's available because

615
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:40,558
my lungs can't get it all at once I

616
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,210
think it just sits there and so I don't

617
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,099
see a need to hold in that smoke in my

618
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:45,509
lungs and put so much pressure on there

619
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,980
when I can just get the smoke in there

620
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:48,690
and let it work like the filter that it

621
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:51,450
is okay imagine if you blew smoke

622
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,980
through any kind of filter I will just

623
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,360
say get a paper towel fold a paper towel

624
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:56,429
into four pieces and blow your smoke

625
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:59,009
through it it's gonna leave some [ __ ] on

626
00:19:56,429 --> 00:20:00,630
all four layers your lungs gathered that

627
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:03,179
[ __ ] more quickly than the paper towel

628
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,740
does your lungs are natural they're part

629
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,298
of your body they will break down that

630
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,888
[ __ ] and you will receive it just like

631
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:09,028
you're supposed to over time

632
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:11,278
you can't scrape it out of the paper

633
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:12,839
towel but your lungs will kind of clean

634
00:20:11,278 --> 00:20:15,109
themselves and absorb it this is my

635
00:20:12,839 --> 00:20:17,609
belief I'm not a doctor so I think

636
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:19,408
holding your smoke is a bad idea I think

637
00:20:17,609 --> 00:20:20,939
you're gonna [ __ ] up your lungs I think

638
00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,679
there's no reason to do that I think

639
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:25,380
you're getting it all when you exhale

640
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:26,610
and that smoke passes your lungs it just

641
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,870
went through the filters and gathered

642
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:29,129
all the [ __ ] that you need and then when

643
00:20:27,869 --> 00:20:30,509
you blow it out you're just blowing out

644
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:32,490
all the [ __ ] that you don't need there's

645
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:34,230
no reason to keep in all that bad part

646
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:36,210
you're smoking or cinnamon you're

647
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,308
smoking soot you're smoking green leafy

648
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:40,110
matter you're not trying to consume

649
00:20:38,308 --> 00:20:42,298
green leaves you're trying to consume

650
00:20:40,109 --> 00:20:43,589
cannabinoids that's the part you want it

651
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:45,599
probably Terps

652
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:47,459
that's the partner trying to get in so

653
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:49,079
just get the Terps get the cannabinoids

654
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,579
get that into your lungs and get the

655
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:52,439
rest of that [ __ ] out of there into the

656
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:53,759
air you don't need to hold your hit so

657
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,620
long and if you want to argue with me I

658
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,450
would love to hear your reasonable

659
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:58,829
argument as an adult don't just [ __ ] at

660
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,360
me if you've got some supporting

661
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:01,769
evidence I would love to hear it

662
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,329
you can send me an email it's a girl

663
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:04,589
from your heart at hotmail.com if you

664
00:21:03,329 --> 00:21:06,599
feel like I'm wrong on this matter

665
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:09,209
please do correct me I would like to

666
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:10,939
hear your information also let's talk

667
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:15,269
about something else that bothers me I

668
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:18,269
have been buying some hash that has the

669
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:20,549
consistency of maybe cake batter or soft

670
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:22,500
cheese cake and it's delicious hash and

671
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:24,509
I offered some to a couple of people and

672
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,130
they said why do you smoke that unpurged

673
00:21:24,509 --> 00:21:28,680
[ __ ] and I was like what are you talking

674
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:31,890
about unpurged for some reason people

675
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:36,299
are under the impression that waxes and

676
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:39,360
batters and other type consistencies are

677
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:41,430
not purged they think that it's got to

678
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,129
shatter to be purged or it's got to be

679
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:46,740
live resin or it's not purged that is

680
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:48,990
not bright at all I just want to correct

681
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:51,839
that the waxes the batter's they are all

682
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:54,750
purged people seem to think that it is

683
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,730
battery because there is still solvent

684
00:21:54,750 --> 00:22:00,089
in there let me back up a little bit the

685
00:21:56,730 --> 00:22:02,250
hash I'm smoking is BHO it's butane

686
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:04,049
honey oil when we first started making

687
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,460
it everybody wanted it to shatter if

688
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:07,200
it's shattered that was the best you can

689
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:09,870
get people learned how to heat it and

690
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,819
whip it you just basically whip it just

691
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:13,379
like you would whip up cake batter or

692
00:22:11,819 --> 00:22:15,119
something you try to make it fluffy you

693
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:17,600
put air in it and that gives it a waxy

694
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,309
texture you have to purge it either way

695
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,230
they will make the shatter then they

696
00:22:20,309 --> 00:22:24,240
purge the shatter then they whip it to

697
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,400
turn it into other consistencies so you

698
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,930
guys are thinking that my batters and

699
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,060
the waxes that I'm getting from places

700
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:32,460
are not purged you were wrong stop

701
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,829
spreading that [ __ ] please please

702
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,210
it's purged I can't promise you that the

703
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:38,099
stuff you're getting purged or that

704
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,720
you're buying off the street or wherever

705
00:22:38,099 --> 00:22:40,829
you're getting it is purged cuz I'm not

706
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,299
in your neighborhood I don't know what

707
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:44,519
you're smoking but the stuff that's

708
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:45,720
coming from the dispensaries if it came

709
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:48,420
from the dispensary it had to pass a

710
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,370
test so it is purged please stop saying

711
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,620
wax isn't purged that's my main point

712
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:54,269
and while I'm at it I've got one more

713
00:22:52,619 --> 00:22:56,028
thing I want to rant about and then we

714
00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:58,908
will wrap up this podcast

715
00:22:56,028 --> 00:23:00,219
be careful with buzzwords I see a lot of

716
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:03,710
people talking about the word organic

717
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:05,690
organic is awesome organic [ __ ] is great

718
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,340
I would prefer organic vegetables over

719
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:10,519
non-organic vegetables if I had the

720
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:13,459
option I want to remind you that cyanide

721
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:15,138
is organic so just because people say

722
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,479
this product is organic or this

723
00:23:15,138 --> 00:23:19,488
pesticide is organic doesn't mean it's

724
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,409
harmless it doesn't mean it's gentle it

725
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:24,139
doesn't mean it's safe it doesn't mean

726
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:27,619
that you can consume it without any

727
00:23:24,138 --> 00:23:29,628
worry some organic compounds are just as

728
00:23:27,618 --> 00:23:33,079
dangerous and just as harmful as

729
00:23:29,628 --> 00:23:35,358
man-made chemicals if not more dangerous

730
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:37,548
and more harmful so my point is be

731
00:23:35,358 --> 00:23:39,319
careful with buzzwords you guys people

732
00:23:37,548 --> 00:23:41,658
can say these plants were treated with

733
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:43,999
only organic products and you can still

734
00:23:41,659 --> 00:23:45,739
be at risk the bottle of pesticide you

735
00:23:43,999 --> 00:23:47,538
are considering purchasing can be

736
00:23:45,739 --> 00:23:49,519
labeled organic and it can still be

737
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:51,169
dangerous just because something says

738
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,969
organic doesn't mean you can go in your

739
00:23:51,169 --> 00:23:55,669
grow room and spray the [ __ ] without

740
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:57,409
some sort of protection okay even if it

741
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:59,269
says organic please read the label a

742
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:01,549
little more carefully if you're using an

743
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:03,048
organic pesticide check out what kind of

744
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:05,418
personal protective equipment you need

745
00:24:03,048 --> 00:24:06,679
to be wearing my main point here was

746
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:08,450
that we're all falling for the word

747
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:10,339
organic and we're spending extra money

748
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,929
for organic things and we're trusting

749
00:24:10,338 --> 00:24:14,808
things because of that Organic stamp

750
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:16,580
because of that Omri stamp I want to

751
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:18,858
remind you that you still need to read

752
00:24:16,579 --> 00:24:21,918
the label don't trust anybody don't

753
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:23,269
trust any labels check for yourself know

754
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,559
what you're spraying on your products

755
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:26,419
know what you're eating this doesn't

756
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:30,079
just apply to cannabis this applies to

757
00:24:26,419 --> 00:24:31,249
everything with the word organic on it

758
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,449
all right that's my public service

759
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:34,098
announcement because I care about you

760
