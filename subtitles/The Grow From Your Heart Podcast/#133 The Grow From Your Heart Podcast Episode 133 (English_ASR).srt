motivation on Instagram Brent I got to

109
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:27,739
meet him at a secret session he had some

110
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,879
of this THC disel it

111
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:35,360
um Jeff is a walk and always take such

112
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:38,120
big dabs and he took a nice chunk glob

113
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,000
of this THC discipline and you just

114
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:43,879
watched his whole face change and that

115
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,168
was it he was like super stoned

116
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:47,689
I mean don't get me wrong Jeff was still

117
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:49,549
dabbing Jeff was still like you know

118
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:51,589
smoking it was assessed he's not gonna

119
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:53,300
look like a wimp but I mean like he you

120
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:56,119
could just see it all over his face that

121
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:59,569
that dab changed his level for the whole

122
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,370
night and like that was it I kind of

123
00:04:59,569 --> 00:05:03,590
remember that I remember being like hey

124
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,598
give me a fatty gloppy because I love

125
00:05:03,589 --> 00:05:07,429
some distillate you can pull the fattest

126
00:05:05,598 --> 00:05:10,098
so we should kind of try to describe

127
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:12,800
what distillate is so they take co2 hat

128
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:15,079
they and a hash maker will take co2 hash

129
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,550
hash that's made with co2 oftentimes

130
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:18,620
it's kind of black and goopy sometimes

131
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,389
it comes out kind of gold but then they

132
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,908
do what I think is fractal distillation

133
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:24,408
is what I think it's called and it it

134
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:25,939
could be done with steam it could be

135
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:27,110
done I'm not sure how a lot of companies

136
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:29,389
do it all the companies have their own

137
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,550
proprietary method but they pretty much

138
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:34,939
distill this product and they give you

139
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:37,900
pure THC with terpenes put back in or

140
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:39,709
some of the companies actually put in

141
00:05:37,899 --> 00:05:41,658
terpenes that are purchased from other

142
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:44,000
products they're derive from other

143
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:45,589
products but what this guy had was just

144
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,829
pure cannabis with cannabis terpenes in

145
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:47,689
it

146
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:49,968
cannabis terpenoids and so it's all pure

147
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:53,478
it's just super pure its THC and turps

148
00:05:49,968 --> 00:05:55,699
and you can take the biggest freaking

149
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,680
dabs and you don't choke yeah my lungs

150
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,810
feel like they got a little little smoke

151
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,129
in them I was like oh yeah my lungs got

152
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,848
some smoke and I blew it out and there

153
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:06,500
was a cloud yeah I'm not gonna cough but

154
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:09,110
I could definitely feel yeah you can

155
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,379
feel the face go a little bounce from

156
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:16,360
white to red to white to red

157
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:18,519
that's the usual yeah that raw THC

158
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,129
distillate was just out of this world

159
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:23,349
actually he gifted Chris and I that and

160
00:06:21,129 --> 00:06:25,000
the added terpenes one and Chris can't

161
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,390
remember which Terp Ian was added to it

162
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,230

163

of things here Mike and I and Lindsay

00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:07,629
Mike and I have lived here for a

182
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,000
long-ass time we've seen this cannabis

183
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:11,379
industry change we thought all the the

184
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,670
raids and all the cannabis [ __ ] has gone

185
00:07:11,379 --> 00:07:14,290
away --lens he's been here for a while

186
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,090
she hasn't seen any cannabis trouble the

187
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:18,610
time that she's been here no and then in

188
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:19,629
the past how many weeks Mike is seven

189
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:22,720
seven weeks

190
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:24,610
how many raids eighteen now eighteen

191
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
raids in seven weeks in well they're all

192
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:28,569
they're not like stores or licensed

193
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,530
facilities or anything they're private

194
00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:34,420
groves that are way over their legal

195
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,039
plant count way over that legal plant

196
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,540
count I saw him pulling a whole bunch of

197
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,870
plants out of one guy's garage on the

198
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,939
news though the number 18 only have like

199
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,370
50 plants but a couple of them before

200
00:07:42,939 --> 00:07:49,149
that were in the the several hundred or

201
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:51,120
like 1200 1500 there I read somewhere

202
00:07:49,149 --> 00:07:54,069
that a lot of these girls are connected

203
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,470
there was another set of raids up in

204
00:07:54,069 --> 00:07:58,480
spring thirteen doesn't count that we're

205
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:01,930
all connected in like El Paso in Denver

206
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:04,360
County the our laws didn't change the

207
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,009
black market anywhere else and so

208
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,480
there's still a bunch of black market

209
00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:09,039
growers that are sitting around all

210
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,500
winter going where's the place where I

211
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,319
think I can hide and no one will notice

212
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,790
me growing marijuana and apparently like

213
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,620
if you're sitting in Florida all we're

214
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,760
thinking that the answer is Colorado

215
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:20,319
because there's a shitload of people

216
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:22,569
from Florida getting busted growing a

217
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,310
shitload of plants here yeah most of the

218
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,589
raids happen to people yeah they happen

219
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,240
to be

220
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,589
yeah so where are you from over there

221
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,569
miss Lindsay missed the traveling stoner

222
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:33,799
I was born in Jersey so I guess I'll

223
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:39,019
claim that today like I never tell

224
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:40,459
people I'm from Jersey I've made a

225
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:42,350
couple of friends that are recent

226
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,210
arrivals and Colorado like over the last

227
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:45,680
year to have four so from Florida and

228
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:47,389
I've told all of them like you know if

229
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,489
you're growing wheat make sure your

230
00:08:47,389 --> 00:08:51,019
plant count is spot the [ __ ] on because

231
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:52,370
it's only a matter of time before our

232
00:08:51,019 --> 00:09:00,350
sheriff knocks on your door and is like

233
00:08:52,370 --> 00:09:02,560
I hear you're from Florida well there's

234
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:05,389
a couple of things that work here like

235
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:09,829
all the busts are in the same area and

236
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:11,629
if you ask me because all the the press

237
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,340
stories all say the same thing a citizen

238
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:16,879
complaint was called in the sheriff's

239
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:18,410
went out to check confirmed the

240
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,120
suspicion that there was marijuana being

241
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:21,589
grown there checked the plant counts

242
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,620
found a shitload of plants and no

243
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,480
paperwork and arrested the recent

244
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,549
arrival from Florida like there's like

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,090
18 grows and like 15 of a match that

246
00:09:28,549 --> 00:09:34,039
exact layout and so I think it's the

247
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:35,570
anti-pop people that have that that are

248
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:37,549
working on that ballot initiative most

249
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:39,140
of them live out Pablo West I think

250
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:42,289
you're just driving around looking at

251
00:09:39,139 --> 00:09:44,840
new house or looking at houses for vents

252
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:47,839
and the stink of weed and they're just

253
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:49,850
calling on everything they find they're

254
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,410
not reporting on all the grows that are

255
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,090
perfectly legal where they knock on the

256
00:09:51,409 --> 00:09:55,699
door and the dude's like I totally grow

257
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,950
marijuana here it's on 2% legal I have

258
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,170
blank number of plants and X number of

259
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:01,670
paperwork sheets here's everything to

260
00:10:00,169 --> 00:10:04,250
confirm what I'm legally allowed to have

261
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:06,889
come take a look here's what's I've got

262
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,340
you can confirm it's all correct - have

263
00:10:06,889 --> 00:10:10,039
a nice day

264
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:11,870
yeah he's trying to leave having a small

265
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,939
grow isn't a big deal right now no

266
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:15,080
having a little grow isn't an issue at

267
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,960
all they're not messing with the

268
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,780
businesses they're not because that

269
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:22,550
happens in a lot of states it's just the

270
00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:23,990
home grows that are way out of

271
00:10:22,549 --> 00:10:27,639
compliance with that law do you think

272
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:29,990
they're using electricity bills defined

273
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:32,059
just like yep I was gonna say they're

274
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,320
looking at that then they have a lot of

275
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:34,639
angles but at the end of the day when it

276
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,900
comes down to is that if you come out

277
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,819
here please do it legally get the name

278
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:42,399
work do I have listened to so many

279
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:44,800
podcasts of you to sit here and say do

280
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,019
it the right way stop you know stop

281
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:49,629
China you're making our community look

282
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,579
bad you're making us look like we are

283
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:53,830
trying to break the laws and trying to

284
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,720
get away with this none of us in the

285
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:57,370
community are trying to I have not

286
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,290
started growing yet since I have come

287
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:01,690
out here because my paperwork is not in

288
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:03,819
order yet I'd love to be growing I'd

289
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:06,370
love to have a whole you know two rooms

290
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,800
going but it's not gonna happen right

291
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,200
like I need to get my paperwork in line

292
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,569
first and I can grow six legally as a

293
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,250
Colorado resident I can't be a hypocrite

294
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,870
I know there was a time where I was

295
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:20,019
moving and shaking and doing [ __ ] that

296
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:21,549
should not be spoken of on a podcast but

297
00:11:20,019 --> 00:11:24,429
we've told some hypothetical stories of

298
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:25,599
my past so if you're if you are hustling

299
00:11:24,429 --> 00:11:26,859
on the black market doing your thing

300
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,290
we're not a hater we're not managed to

301
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,430
do your thing do what you got to do but

302
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:31,809
eventually there's gonna come a time

303
00:11:30,429 --> 00:11:34,750
when you gotta start to think about

304
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:36,669
shifting to the legal market there's a

305
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,919
difference between making money to

306
00:11:36,669 --> 00:11:40,750
survive and being greedy and having

307
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:42,399
these huge grows that these people are

308
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,100
getting busted for and that's the issue

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:48,100
it's it's these huge commercial grows in

310
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,529
houses for no reason like you're all

311
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,750
gonna go and sell that in another so you

312
00:11:50,529 --> 00:11:54,730
know like I mean if you really think

313
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,289
about it it's just so stupid like this

314
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:01,090
is why they were in the national parks

315
00:11:56,289 --> 00:12:03,069
ten years ago and they hide anywhere

316
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:05,860
they think they can hide it's and

317
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,810
they're trying to hide in Colorado they

318
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:09,970
just they don't realize how well

319
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:12,069
publicized the rules are have been here

320
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:14,889
because they're not publicized anywhere

321
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:17,080
else like New Mexico Florida Kansas none

322
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:19,569
of these places care about what the

323
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:21,370
zoning rules are for the shops or what

324
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:23,230
the home grill rules are in each city

325
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,879
and county so none of that [ __ ] makes

326
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,050
the paper just as weeds legal and

327
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,600
they're allowed to grow their own how

328
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:30,729
strange and so they think oh I can move

329
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,460
to Colorado I can go to the gross store

330
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:35,769
I can throw down the 18 grand or

331
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:39,730
whatever I've managed to save up on grow

332
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:41,740
equipment rent a house pull a crop or to

333
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:44,830
drive it all back to Florida and bam

334
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:48,279
I've got four on our grand and they just

335
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,870
don't see how insane that plan is like

336
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,289
the gross stores gonna sell you all that

337
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,779
[ __ ] no problem

338
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:55,250
the when you plug it all in you're gonna

339
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:57,110
have to have the power company come out

340
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,820
by the time the power company's done

341
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:01,100
upgrading you all your neighbors want to

342
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,990
know what the [ __ ] you're doing as soon

343
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:06,470
as it smells like weed which is gonna be

344
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:07,730
about what eight weeks later um one of

345
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:09,860
them's gonna call the sheriff and go

346
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:11,539
would you knock on this bucks door yeah

347
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,000
he had some guy building some [ __ ] their

348
00:13:11,539 --> 00:13:15,769
new electricity watch them carrying a

349
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,019
bunch of [ __ ] now it reeks I'm pretty

350
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:19,789
sure he's got an illegal operation yeah

351
00:13:18,019 --> 00:13:21,439
and this is all assuming you don't have

352
00:13:19,789 --> 00:13:23,569
a landlord that's gonna be checking on

353
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,640
everything and all of that jazz as well

354
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:27,710
do a couple of these guys were like just

355
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:29,240
showed up right at a house went to

356
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:32,629
bought some ply board it's sort of ply

357
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,220
boarding over exterior windows like one

358
00:13:32,629 --> 00:13:37,639
dude had a pit bull chained to a window

359
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:40,970
well like these idiots in the most

360
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:44,149
extreme sense because I mean if you

361
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:46,759
think about it you could move here grow

362
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:49,759
even your six plant just being here as

363
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:51,799
an adult limit and if you were dumb

364
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,750
enough to take the risk to move that

365
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:57,139
back to Florida just that small or

366
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:59,779
harvest you could still make a fair

367
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:01,399
living like it wouldn't be extravagant

368
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,519
you wouldn't be rolling back and forth

369
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:06,289
in a brand-new Escalade but I mean you

370
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:08,600
could make enough to pay your rent and

371
00:14:06,289 --> 00:14:09,949
pay your bills but they're trying to do

372
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,899
hundreds of plants because they're

373
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,340
stupid and greedy and they think no

374
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:17,259
one's gonna notice here and it's that's

375
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,519
just so insane like it's a neighborhood

376
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:20,600
even if you do get it harvested and

377
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,039
dried and cured you're gonna get pulled

378
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,990
the [ __ ] over as soon as you cross it

379
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:26,360
again a couple of them got busted

380
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,730
halfway to where they were headed

381
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,289
because they just turn signal violation

382
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,580
hundreds of pounds of weed in the car

383
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:33,079
smells like hundreds of pounds of weed

384
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,030
in the car

385
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,620
y'all know how bad your quarter-ounce

386
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:39,919
stinks on the way home from picking it

387
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:41,690
up like magnify that by a hundred pounds

388
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:44,149
yeah because you guys aren't being smart

389
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,590
and vacuum-sealing it and like doing it

390
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,269
the right way you're just putting it in

391
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,680
trash bags and throwing it in the back

392
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:56,600
and praying to God you'll make it their

393
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:58,959
bags is the gangster way to carry double

394
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,060
bag that [ __ ] only be five

395
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,500
my little friend that's not real tall he

396
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:04,209
used to give me the trash bag the clear

397
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,919
trash bags full yeah back in the day

398
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:12,100
that hypothetically happened from you

399
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:13,779
know that allegedly it's just insane the

400
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:15,310
days of coming up and grown big

401
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:16,929
ridiculous amounts of cannabis in

402
00:15:15,309 --> 00:15:18,519
Colorado maybe come into it and here

403
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:20,620
it's still possible if you're gung ho

404
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:21,730
you got to be smart about it but be

405
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,899
careful you guys if you're gonna come

406
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,970
here from another state and think you're

407
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:26,350
gonna set up shop read the rules get get

408
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:27,730
really familiar with the rules be

409
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:29,710
careful the two parts of this that

410
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:31,149
pissed me off the most is like a now we

411
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:34,900
got to pay to send these folks to jail

412
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:37,840
and be there [ __ ] up our reputation

413
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:40,329
and they're giving a whole bunch of fire

414
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,629
to the anti-pop people and they didn't

415
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:45,700
need to fire they they've lost two years

416
00:15:43,629 --> 00:15:48,730
in a row every time they smoke up they

417
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,530
got told [ __ ] off and they're really

418
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,740
really angry they don't need fuel for

419
00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:56,110
that fire yeah 18 busts in seven weeks

420
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:58,060
like Jules

421
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:01,300
in every single one of them is out in

422
00:15:58,059 --> 00:16:03,279
public 'le um I mean you've lived here

423
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:07,750
for how long public hasn't report [ __ ]

424
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:11,250
um and all of a sudden we've got 18

425
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:13,330
successful patro tips in seven weeks

426
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:16,620
like there's some weird [ __ ] going on

427
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:18,700
right now and people didn't see coming

428
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,750
so if you're growing up webelo be

429
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:24,940
careful that's that's Colorado ID right

430
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:26,799
now like gearing up for the election we

431
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,360
got a new president coming in everywhere

432
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:29,679
away everywhere if you're growing

433
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,940
everywhere you're on get your [ __ ]

434
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:32,529
cleaned up now is a good time to think

435
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,840
about it if you if you're a medical

436
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,000
marijuana grower if you've got a plant

437
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,830
count count your [ __ ] plants go

438
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,149
consider like go get one under your

439
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:41,470
plant count so that if some [ __ ] goes

440
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:43,750
wrong and you break off a branch and it

441
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,029
looks like an extra plan on accident go

442
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,500
check your gram wait get to your perfect

443
00:16:46,029 --> 00:16:49,360
gram weight and then roll up a fat joint

444
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,000
and smoking so you're a fat joint

445
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,379
underneath your gram limit I just go get

446
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,179
your [ __ ] in order my clique to me like

447
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:56,590
that's that's no that's really good I

448
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,689
had that thought the other day I was

449
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:01,600
I've got a nice hash pile going right

450
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:03,760
now and I was like hmm like I can't even

451
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,900
take this like when I move technically

452
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,730
I'll have to break the law

453
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,019
moving this from house one to house too

454
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,480
because I'm not supposed to have that

455
00:17:08,019 --> 00:17:11,220
much [ __ ] out in the world I'm how over

456
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,939
my grand

457
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,828
it wait how much weight you've got it

458
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,329
can we talk about tricks ninja plant

459
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,279
count in your medical marijuana card can

460
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,990
we talk about no no but just

461
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,639
theoretically just for the legal rules

462
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:25,409
because at the same time I was thinking

463
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,538
about needing to go get my card again

464
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:30,210
like a lot of this applies to us too

465
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:32,579
like we're not special right we've got

466
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,460

Mike you were talking about some

555
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:09,839
political stuff is why we've got you

556
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:12,269
here oh it's just the one thing I wanted

557
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,490
to throw in right now is uh a lot of

558
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:17,668
people are focused on the November

559
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:22,220
election as they should be yay for

560
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,220
paying attention good for you but

561
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:26,730
podcast the other night where he was

562
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,298
like really mean to the listeners and

563
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:29,298
you're like to hear

564
00:21:30,309 --> 00:21:35,960
but there's primary elections too in

565
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:39,230
everybody's area in these matter and no

566
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,809
one ever turns out for these um the

567
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:44,180
example down here is this November we

568
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:47,599
might be voting to ban the recreational

569
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:50,900
marijuana industry however before we

570
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:54,469
even get to that vote possibly happening

571
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:55,790
there will be election election primary

572
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,610
election that are that sorry about that

573
00:21:55,789 --> 00:22:00,379
space the word a primary election down

574
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:02,389
here will reelect people like city

575
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,150
councilman and County Commissioners in

576
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:07,640
the local judge and maybe there'll be a

577
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:09,530
couple of small local issues they get

578
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,990
handled like city or county why what are

579
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:15,559
you going to run for ah nothing in this

580
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:17,480
round but if two people down here

581
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:19,099
happened to get elected instead of the

582
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,069
two people that currently have this job

583
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:24,319
getting reelected retail marijuana could

584
00:22:22,069 --> 00:22:26,299
go away anyway because the number of Pro

585
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,519
and anti marijuana votes would swing

586
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:33,319
that far with just two people getting

587
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:35,809
swapped out so there's a lot going on

588
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:37,339
politically in everyone's area that they

589
00:22:35,809 --> 00:22:40,849
need to be paying attention to right now

590
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:42,079
and right now is the time to go find out

591
00:22:40,849 --> 00:22:44,659
if you're registered to vote

592
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:46,879
go find out how that works in your area

593
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,080
in Colorado it's awesome they just mail

594
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,180
it to your house you don't have to do

595
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:52,490
anything but check the mail when it

596
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:54,140
shows up you fill it out you take it to

597
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:55,759
a drop-off point you get the sticker

598
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,700
that says I voted and you get to be

599
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,740
awesome for like the whole next year

600
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,180
it's really that simple in other places

601
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:05,120
it's a little harder you got to go stand

602
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:06,799
in line but do it like figure out how to

603
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:08,629
do it now is the time to figure out how

604
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,789
to do it I know it's not till November I

605
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:12,560
know that's a long time away I know a

606
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:17,740
lot of you were like I just planted my

607
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,740
outdoor fuck-off like after harvest

608
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,180
right now like the elections not so

609
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,460
November why pay attention I'm not

610
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:28,009
saying I'm not telling them to [ __ ] off

611
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,299
I'm saying that I'm thinking there's no

612
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:30,890
they don't want to pay attention to

613
00:23:29,299 --> 00:23:34,129
politics yet because that's just months

614
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:36,380
and months away like but now's the time

615
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,730
to get registered now is the time to

616
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:39,600
start paying attention to what's going

617
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,069
on in your area and start

618
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,668
to making sure you've done what you need

619
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:46,349
to do to actually vote I'm sick of the

620
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:49,230
marijuana community just being a

621
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:52,558
non-existent entity politically like we

622
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,660
outnumber Christians think about the

623
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,308
number of Christians that annoy you

624
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:58,500
constantly because they're doing [ __ ]

625
00:23:56,308 --> 00:24:00,210
politically think about how powerful

626
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,250
that particular group of people is in

627
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:07,440
the United States we outnumber NRA

628
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:09,450
members by five times and that's just

629
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,429
the DA's estimate for how many people

630
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:16,590
smoke pot in the u.s. there are more pot

631
00:24:11,429 --> 00:24:19,769
smokers than gun toters yep Wow don't

632
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:21,538
matter at all politically why because we

633
00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:22,679
don't show up I got no hatred for

634
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:25,169
anybody with a gun if I said that

635
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:26,788
condescendingly anybody carries a

636
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:29,490
firearm when you think about how much

637
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:31,650
influence the NRA wields and then you

638
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,019
look up the actual number of NRA members

639
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:37,019
and their actual operating budget it's

640
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:39,359
terrifying how a group that small can be

641
00:24:37,019 --> 00:24:41,579
that influential if we were just to get

642
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,849
a little bit organized or at least just

643
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:48,089
all show up on Election Day we could

644
00:24:44,849 --> 00:24:51,538
have a serious Authority coast-to-coast

645
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:53,399
but we don't and we definitely those of

646
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:57,140
us that do show up don't show up unified

647
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:59,220
even a little bit and I'm yeah I'm

648

pushing your listeners get out get out

649

we need so we all we all will take a

650
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,940
party bus anywhere if you put a dab rig

651
00:25:03,779 --> 00:25:08,250
on a bus oh yeah and a bhag on a bus

652
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,630
right put some Rasta man with dreadlocks

653
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,190
and some reggae music

654
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,390
Rasta man driving at reggae music

655
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:13,590
playing real light and you paint a red

656
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:15,150
gold and green people get on there and

657
00:25:13,589 --> 00:25:16,619
smoke some [ __ ] hash and smoke some

658
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:20,220
joints and have a good ass social time

659
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:21,689
Boop let's let's get one of those and

660
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,120
pick up stoners and driving them to

661
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:28,288
polling places to get them to vote it's

662
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:30,569
not an unheard of idea I'm hoping a

663
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:32,730
couple of the industry players do

664
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:35,038
something similar yes somebody somebody

665
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,679
that doesn't work a lot and have a

666
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,298
podcast and drive too much already help

667
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:45,169
me out with this put together like some

668
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:45,168
buses did you like a show this is real

669
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:53,099
like Denver that would totally fly I

670
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:56,970
think something like blow that might not

671
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:58,829
get away with driving them smoking them

672
00:25:56,970 --> 00:26:01,470
out while you drive them requires a lot

673
00:25:58,829 --> 00:26:03,720
of extra insurance and a much much

674
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,910
larger vehicle but every election

675
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,710
there's groups that grab vans and go

676
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:09,120
bust seniors and other people that love

677
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,740
to vote and have trouble sometimes

678
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,719
getting to the polling station I'm

679
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,609
taking the seniors often vote though

680
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,900
whatever way they want them to vote like

681
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,409
they'll go round up those people on

682
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:21,560
signal

683
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:21,560
free joint if you if you vote I think

684
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,829
but just giving them a ride that's

685
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,360
helping someone perform their civic duty

686
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:34,289
I'd love to see someone getting legal

687
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,519
trouble for that that would be an

688
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:41,369
awesome court case yeah get involved

689
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:42,839
start googling after the show you could

690
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:44,429
do it right now where you listen if

691
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:47,369
you're at work you could in your cubicle

692
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:51,240
the bosses have behind you just [ __ ]

693
00:26:47,369 --> 00:26:53,039
guns ready you just wanted to know what

694
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,170
Election Day was so you could think

695
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,089
about requesting it off because civic

696
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,440
pride is important to you or if you're

697
00:26:57,089 --> 00:27:01,799
at work just go to the bathroom act like

698
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:09,509
you're taking a dump come back out until

699
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:16,950
all of your friends about it that's a

700
00:27:09,509 --> 00:27:19,559
good one Instagram

701
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:23,000
do you know how big that that place is

702
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:29,099
like not even a viable way to hide like

703
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,089
viable not liable drop a pin in there

704
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:33,990
and they'd hear that

705
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:35,399
let's go weird again I think something

706
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,140
that Mike said on the last podcast

707
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:39,180
though that's really important to say

708
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,460
again though is that a lot of people

709
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,880
this year up for re-election and if we

710
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,100
get the right people in the right seats

711
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,720
we could be looking at this moving a lot

712
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,399
faster than we really thought it was

713
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:54,000
going to we're already at the breaking

714
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,730
point we're at 24 or 25 including

715
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,269
one for medical it looks like it's gonna

716
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:59,499
be 25 here in a minute

717
00:27:58,269 --> 00:28:02,200
that count Pennsylvania since

718
00:27:59,499 --> 00:28:04,749
Pennsylvania sleepless that's horrible

719
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:06,729
okay so 24 plus DC so we're still

720
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:08,829
looking at 25 we're at the halfway mark

721
00:28:06,729 --> 00:28:10,269
we're you know and it's funny because my

722
00:28:08,829 --> 00:28:13,739
dad said something really interesting to

723
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:16,479
me the other day that at this point in

724
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:20,679
gay marriage it had already steamrolled

725
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:21,759
and it went across all 50 so maybe we

726
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:26,429
just have to hold on for a little bit

727
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,429
longer showed up in big groups and voted

728
00:28:47,788 --> 00:28:52,538
yes yes yes you're blushing before you

729
00:28:51,368 --> 00:29:00,638
can push more who cares

730
00:28:52,538 --> 00:29:05,138
keep blush and they can't see our friend

731
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:07,748
yep I know I I just want to motivate you

732
00:29:05,138 --> 00:29:09,848
yeah Mike doesn't mean to be no Mike

733
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:11,679
does mean to be motivating inspiring he

734
00:29:09,848 --> 00:29:13,958
wants you to go out and vote ah there is

735
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,929
a chance that we could lose recreational

736
00:29:13,959 --> 00:29:17,709
cannabis in Pueblo Colorado yep that's

737
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:19,659
tremendous

738
00:29:17,709 --> 00:29:22,389
politics and public opinion work on a

739
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:24,479
pendulum if you look at your history we

740
00:29:22,388 --> 00:29:28,078
swing from liberal to conservative

741
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:32,379
socially and so social issues like this

742
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:35,048
can swing back quickly in the early 70s

743
00:29:32,378 --> 00:29:37,658
we had a president that was thinking

744
00:29:35,048 --> 00:29:39,219
about legalizing marijuana nationally we

745
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:41,469
had a number of states that have passed

746
00:29:39,219 --> 00:29:43,149
medical marijuana laws does anybody

747
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:45,429
remember these when we were children

748
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:47,858
no because the [ __ ] eighties happened

749
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:50,229
and public opinion swung back the other

750
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:51,848
way hard we decided to do a war on drugs

751
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:56,469
instead of legalization and we all know

752
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:58,388
how that played out and had a couple of

753
00:29:56,469 --> 00:30:02,440
candidates stayed in the election or

754
00:29:58,388 --> 00:30:04,028
done better running up to this point we

755
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,950
could still have candidates that were

756
00:30:04,028 --> 00:30:07,990
promising to send the military to stop

757
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:11,558
Colorado's weed stores

758
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:14,440
like that's a reality in 2016 that we

759
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:16,480
have a major popular well-funded

760
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:17,860
candidate for the highest office in the

761
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,389
land who's talking about sending the

762
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:21,459
army to shut down the weed stores in

763
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:22,959
Colorado you guys working the retail

764
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,669
what are you gonna do one day when a

765
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:31,720
tank rolls up into the [ __ ] parking

766
00:30:24,669 --> 00:30:33,820
lot Springs so like I don't know if I I

767
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,440
guess if it goes away for good yeah

768
00:30:33,819 --> 00:30:37,210
they're there first in the spring people

769
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,850
are already in the spring when the tank

770
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,470
shows up I'm gonna stop worrying about

771
00:30:39,849 --> 00:30:42,939
the consumption on site rule take it

772
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,850
down real quick and bounce with my new

773
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:51,308
ring as much hash as I can carry s

774
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:52,868
speaking a new rig yeah I think I would

775
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,220
just have to look over and be like my

776
00:30:52,868 --> 00:30:56,558
bad hun inserts

777
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:59,440
exactly like set up a station real quick

778
00:30:56,558 --> 00:31:09,339
and be like so who wants a job I'm gonna

779
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:10,720
go outside and yell at the tank I don't

780
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:12,428
think they think that I don't think

781
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,749
they'd be surprised those like who wants

782
00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:15,278
to help me carry all the stuff that we

783
00:31:13,749 --> 00:31:17,850
can carry out this window that's on the

784
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,970
other side of the building from the tank

785
00:31:17,849 --> 00:31:20,969
