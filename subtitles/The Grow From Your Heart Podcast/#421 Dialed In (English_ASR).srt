me what 4/20 means to them there were a

62
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,310
few that didn't make it to the show

63
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:30,870
because you guys are pot heads and you

64

didn't send them to me until the day of

65
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:35,159
4/20 I had already recorded the show

00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:56,669
episode that really means a lot to me to

76
00:02:54,689 --> 00:02:59,939
get all the listener responses and

77
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:02,280
listener reactions also the show crushed

78
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,379
it on iTunes and stitcher in the past

79
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,479
couple of weeks in the rankings I get

80
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,310
emails letting me know where I stand in

81
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,619
the rankings on iTunes and in stitcher

82
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,360
and we were doing extremely well and the

83
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,300
lifestyle and health category on

84
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,220
stitcher we were in the low 50s we hit

85
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,410
about 69 at one point but we got about

86
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,530
45 and 50 for quite a while there and

87
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:25,079
then on iTunes we were ranked 44 in the

88
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,419
education category on iTunes and that is

89
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,510
big because iTunes is the number one

90
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:32,759
podcast provider so we were number 44 in

91
00:03:30,509 --> 00:03:34,169
a specific category there I was proud of

92
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:34,949
that so big thanks to everybody who is

93
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:36,659

94
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:38,549

reposting since well I was on the dude

98
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,039
Gro show the podcast has been blowing up

99
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:49,650
so big thank you to everybody for all

100
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:51,629
the support all right I do have a topic

101
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,129
of this podcast in this episode I'm

102
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:55,019
going to talk about a phrase we keep

103
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:57,120
hearing in the cannabis industry in the

104
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,430
cannabis community amongst growers and

105
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,719
that is the phrase dialed in what does

106
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:04,890
it mean to have your grow dial Dan

107
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:06,449
everybody thinks they have an idea of

108
00:04:04,889 --> 00:04:07,919
what the phrase dialed and means you

109
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:10,709
think you know what it means to have

110
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,958
your garden dialed in at this point in

111
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,449
the cannabis growing game we have access

112
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,009
to so many monitoring devices that we

113
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:18,988
should be able to tell what is happening

114
00:04:17,009 --> 00:04:20,909
in our garden at all times

115
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,459
we should almost always be able to tell

116
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,830
the temperature the humidity are the

117
00:04:23,459 --> 00:04:27,609
lights off or on at this point in

118
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:29,889
technology we are able to monitor

119
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:31,720
most of the critical aspects of our grow

120
00:04:29,889 --> 00:04:33,579
room through a handheld device or a

121
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,500
computer it is really easy to buy

122
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:37,839
something and set it up and have full

123
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,750
access to monitor your garden at all

124
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,179
times so in that aspect it is really

125
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,310
easy to get your lights your temperature

126
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:47,918
your humidity everything in that area

127
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,389
dialed in we can get the room cycling

128
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,639
beautifully that is not a challenge

129
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:53,019
anymore or at least it shouldn't be the

130
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:54,848
light should come off and on as

131
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:56,620
scheduled the temperature should stay

132
00:04:54,848 --> 00:04:58,060
right where we need it the humidity

133
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,139
should stay right where we need it if we

134
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,569
learn how to set up our equipment

135
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:04,538
properly this should not be a challenge

136
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:07,150
to get the room dialed in the thing I

137
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:10,329
think many growers are overlooking is

138
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:13,538
that we want to actually dial in the

139
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:16,029
room for the plants what I see happening

140
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:18,189
now a lot of people are buying these

141
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:19,869
fancy monitors and we're getting it set

142
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:22,060
up on our phone and now we're able to

143
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:24,158
sit at work or sit wherever we are all

144
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,990
day and stress out over the garden

145
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:28,000
because we can watch these numbers and

146
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,590
graphs move up and down on our phone and

147
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,288
tell us what is happening in the grow

148
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,848
most of us have not had access to this

149
00:05:32,288 --> 00:05:36,218
type of information throughout the day

150
00:05:33,848 --> 00:05:39,550
until very recently so what I see

151
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:42,218
happening is many growers are stressing

152
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,468
really hard over the numbers on their

153
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:48,310
monitoring devices and we are forgetting

154
00:05:44,468 --> 00:05:50,288
that the plants are the boss yes there

155
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,180
are goals we would like to get the room

156
00:05:50,288 --> 00:05:53,318
in a certain temperature threshold we

157
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,079
would like to get the room within a

158
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,848
certain humidity threshold we certainly

159
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:59,288
need the lights to come off and on at a

160
00:05:57,848 --> 00:06:02,800
scheduled time that's when we can't

161
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:04,838
really [ __ ] with but these are plants we

162
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,360
need to keep in mind that no matter what

163
00:06:04,838 --> 00:06:09,728
the monitors tell us the plants are the

164
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
boss yes there is a gauge that says the

165
00:06:09,728 --> 00:06:13,718
VPD should be between here and here but

166
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:16,299
if the plants aren't happy when you get

167
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:18,310
that VPD between here and here you're

168
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,860
[ __ ] wrong those monitors do not

169
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,319
matter unless they match with the plants

170
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:25,569
so I love all of the technology I love

171
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:28,088
all of the monitors I started growing

172
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:30,939
long before I had access to that and I

173
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:32,769
was killing it way before I had any of

174
00:06:30,939 --> 00:06:36,278
those monitors you know what I was using

175
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:38,439
for a monitor the plants the plants give

176
00:06:36,278 --> 00:06:41,019
me all of the signals that I need by

177
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,420
watching those plants I can see is it

178
00:06:41,019 --> 00:06:43,519
too high

179
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:45,680
here is it too cold in here was it too

180
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,449
dry in here was it too humid in here do

181
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,250
these plants need water is there

182
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:52,579
something going on I can tell by looking

183
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,500
I am not disrespecting or knocking these

184
00:06:52,579 --> 00:06:55,939
monitors I love the monitors I've got

185
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,800
monitors hung up in most of my

186
00:06:55,939 --> 00:07:00,110
facilities the most common monitor that

187
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,879
I use is the PIO grill unit monitor I've

188
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:03,470
got a peel minder unit in my favorite

189
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,569
room I've got a peel minder unit in my

190
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,940
breeding room I use the peel minder

191
00:07:05,569 --> 00:07:10,459
because it tells me what's going on when

192
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:12,259
I'm away the thing I use those monitors

193
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:14,209
for the most is to let me know if

194
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:16,730
something goes wrong with my equipment

195
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:19,039
while I am gone then I can react

196
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:20,810
accordingly I can get online I can make

197
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,310
something else trigger off or trigger on

198
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:23,899
I can diagnose the problem and figure

199
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:25,759
out what didn't happen or did happen

200
00:07:23,899 --> 00:07:27,799
then I can correct that from being while

201
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,389
I'm away from the grow or I know hey I

202
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,920
need to end this party and get home and

203
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:32,329
fix that grow or hey I need to end this

204
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,949
party and get out to that facility out

205
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:35,839
on the other side of town as quickly as

206
00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:37,759
possible because this monitor is beeping

207
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,169
and saying hey something went wrong that

208
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,089
is my favorite function of those

209
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:43,550
monitors they are great for getting a

210
00:07:41,089 --> 00:07:46,279
room set up and dialed in notice I said

211
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,530
getting the room dialed in again the

212
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,569
plants are the boss if you've got the

213
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:53,149
room let's think about it this way and

214
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:54,379
I'm going to generalize greatly here and

215
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:56,750
I'm going to piss somebody off by doing

216
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:58,279
so but just go with me I've got a

217
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,500
thermostat right there on the wall

218
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,289
science likes to say that if I set that

219
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:05,600
thermostat between 68 and 70 degrees

220
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:08,150
humans will be at a very comfortable

221
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:10,310
desired temperature I promise you that

222
00:08:08,149 --> 00:08:12,589
if I set that thermostat at 68 degrees

223
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,240
every female in this house is going to

224
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:17,179
come and crank it up to 72 because

225
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,980
they're [ __ ] cold in general women

226
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:22,699
run a little bit cooler than men from

227
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,650
what I've noticed also heavy people you

228
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,420
got a fat friend notice they're sweaty

229
00:08:24,649 --> 00:08:28,429
fat people tend to run a little hot

230
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,530
there are women in the house there are

231
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,080
fat people in the house my skinny ass is

232
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:35,000
in the house 68 degrees just isn't gonna

233
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,950
happen in the summer here it takes a lot

234
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,169
of electricity to get this house to 68

235
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,270
degrees also I think everybody here

236
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,978
knows the 68 degrees just isn't the

237
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:44,809
actual comfortable temperature the

238
00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:46,970
ladies are gonna want it around 72 the

239
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:50,179
big guys gonna want it around 65 I'm

240
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:51,830
happy probably right around 74 we all

241
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:53,250
just adjust and we accept it because

242
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:55,019
that's what we've got in the room

243
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,028
now that is what you were doing to your

244
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:58,980
plants in the grow room you're saying

245
00:08:57,028 --> 00:09:00,809
hey this is what my equipment does this

246
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,188
is what science does this is what Rasta

247
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:04,229
Jeff said the temperature should be on

248
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:06,000
the podcast so you are a happy plant

249
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,649
because you were within this temperature

250
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,120
you were within this humidity range and

251
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:11,669
I fed you this many PPM's

252
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,350
that plant is happy that is not accurate

253
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:15,688
you've got to develop a relationship

254
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:18,269
with each individual cultivar and

255
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:21,870
establish what that cult of our wants

256
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:23,310
and dial it in for that plant I kind of

257
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,810
make a joke like as having a girlfriend

258
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:26,969
you've got to learn it

259
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:29,128
each girlfriend is different if you have

260
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,329
one girlfriend she probably loves a

261
00:09:29,129 --> 00:09:32,459
different kind of food than whatever

262
00:09:30,328 --> 00:09:33,958
other girlfriend you got across town and

263
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:35,338
here's the other important part you

264
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:37,198
can't put them both in the same room and

265
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,149
make them happy that's not gonna work

266
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:41,099
your plants are probably the same way

267
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:42,990
you've got to keep them in the

268
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,680
environment in which they like so I

269
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,269
recommend mono cropping one strain until

270
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:50,519
you get it dialed in I would work with

271
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:52,110
one strain pick a strain fall in love

272
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:54,629
with it develop a relationship with that

273
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,310
plant figure out what it likes instead

274
00:09:54,629 --> 00:09:58,289
of trying to grow four or five different

275
00:09:56,309 --> 00:10:00,659
strains in a room and having the room

276
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:02,879
work for everything grow one strain in

277
00:10:00,659 --> 00:10:04,740
there learn that plant beautifully what

278
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,688
is it like how much nitrogen does it

279
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,009
take how much cal-mag does it want is

280
00:10:06,688 --> 00:10:09,808
there something you can do late and

281
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,730
flower early and flower to it that makes

282
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:13,799
it really excel makes it really stand

283
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,509
out you might not know that kind of

284
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:17,008
stuff about that cultivar if you've got

285
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:18,209
it mixed in a room with seven or eight

286
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,649
different plants and you're feeding them

287
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:20,969
all the same thing you're giving them

288
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:23,039
all the same conditions

289
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:25,709
you can't experiment so you can't ever

290
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,688
dial in one plant you've got the room

291
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,578
dialed in to make the group happy but

292
00:10:27,688 --> 00:10:32,399
you're never going to get one individual

293
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:33,448
plant to reach its maximum potential now

294
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,370
I do understand that there are

295
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:36,990
commercial environments trust me I grow

296
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:39,299
in a lot of commercial environments your

297
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:41,188
responsibility at that time is to select

298
00:10:39,299 --> 00:10:43,409
cultivars that grow with very similar

299
00:10:41,188 --> 00:10:44,938
conditions put them in tables where you

300
00:10:43,409 --> 00:10:46,980
can run the feed through that table in

301
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:48,838
one way maybe run the table on this feed

302
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,159
another way there's group the plants to

303
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,019
where they work well together you've got

304
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,448
to develop relationships with each

305
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,730
cultivar that takes time that takes

306
00:10:54,448 --> 00:10:58,289
multiple grow cycles you have to grow in

307
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:59,879
at least two or three times in my

308
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:02,519
opinion to learn anything about the

309
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:04,649
plant the first time who knows if

310
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:06,740
anything is a fluke that is one time

311
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:09,110
science doesn't care about one timers

312
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:11,120
one time is a fluke no matter what you

313
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,070
ask science it just happened once prove

314
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,589
it repeat it that is the the job the

315
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:17,420
goal the second time if you see oh it

316
00:11:15,589 --> 00:11:19,430
didn't like nitrogen last time or this

317
00:11:17,419 --> 00:11:21,528
time or hey I got nitrogen deficient

318
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:23,028
last time and this time now instead of

319
00:11:21,528 --> 00:11:24,740
getting frustrated with this cultivar I

320
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:27,200
know that on the third grow I need to

321
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:29,360
boost up the nitrogen late in veg so

322
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,370
that it is available early in flower and

323
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,930
then also continue that nitrogen feed a

324
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:34,610
little later through the flowering

325
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:37,009
process than I did and the previous

326
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:39,440
grows and that will help me to not get

327
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:40,970
nitrogen deficient early and flower you

328
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,250
learn things like that if you grow a

329
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:44,990
cultivar repeatedly so if you're a new

330
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,509
grower if you're an experienced grower

331
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,220
it is still an ideal thing to learn the

332
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:51,049
plants individually develop a

333
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,940
relationship with the cultivar you were

334
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:55,278
working with if you can isolate one

335
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,810
cultivar and cut however many clones you

336
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,088
need to fill the room and just run a

337
00:11:56,809 --> 00:12:01,399
room of that cultivar that is the way to

338
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:03,380
learn it do it two or three times get it

339
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:05,000
dialed in these plants are from many

340
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:07,639
different parts of the world and we have

341
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,799
bred plants from the farthest parts of

342
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:11,509
the world we can from point A to point B

343
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:13,370
the farthest distance we can get them we

344
00:12:11,509 --> 00:12:15,679
have bred those plants together so we've

345
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:17,629
created many different requirements and

346
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,069
desires for these plants they want

347
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:20,450
generally the same things but like I

348
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,810
said they're going to want different

349
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:25,900
things so it will be very strained

350
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:28,549
specific you also will find it is very

351
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:31,309
phenotype specific you may get two seeds

352
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:33,500
from the same pack that create plants

353
00:12:31,309 --> 00:12:35,208
that want completely different feeds now

354
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,980
think about if we cross two plants let's

355
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:38,778
just say if we cross I'm gonna pick

356
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,980
something that we all know let's say Kim

357
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:42,259
dog and then what something way

358
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,759
different Angie and I'm just grabbing

359
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:45,559
strains out of midair if we cross Kim

360
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:47,240
dog and tangi we're gonna get some

361
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,009
plants that are very Kim dog and some

362
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,810
plants that are very tangi and those

363
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:53,059
plants want to be fed very differently

364
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:55,549
so you may find that feeding and

365
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:57,469
different traits different requirements

366
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:59,719
of your plants are different based on

367
00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:02,060
different phenotypes within specific

368
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,040
strains now let's talk about a few of

369
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:06,229
the details that you can really dial in

370
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:08,539
with your plants and as we do this keep

371
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,050
in mind if you dial in a specific

372
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:14,659
cultivar in your environment even in

373
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:16,669
your room if you've got room a and room

374
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:19,069
B in the same facility things may be

375
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:20,219
different in different sections of those

376
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:21,930
rooms and things will

377
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:24,240
absolutely be different in the two rooms

378
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:25,739
it's really hard to mimic exact

379
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,629
conditions and also in large rooms

380
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,889
you're going to get microclimates we'll

381
00:13:27,629 --> 00:13:31,320
talk about those types of things in

382
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:34,019
future episodes but the things we can

383
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:36,090
dial in if I take a clone if I could

384
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,350
have clone if I cut 20 clones off of my

385
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,730
favorite plant let's just say we're

386
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,560
gonna cut a bunch of clones off of my

387
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:42,420
storm shadow plant so we've got a bunch

388
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,009
of clones I'm gonna put five of them and

389
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,990
room a I'm gonna put five of them in

390
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:48,600
room B I'm gonna give five to you and

391
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,330
I'm gonna give five to Jessie those

392
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:52,350
plants Jessie's five are gonna look all

393
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,450
the same if he puts them in the same

394
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,889
room your five are gonna look the same

395
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,690
if you put them in the same room all the

396
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:59,279
ones I put in different rooms the ones

397
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:00,660
in the same room will look the same the

398
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,120
different rooms we may see slight

399
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:05,129
variation just because of very slight

400
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,230
differences in the room so when I talk

401
00:14:05,129 --> 00:14:09,330
about getting a room dialed in it may be

402
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,670
when you take this cultivar somewhere

403
00:14:09,330 --> 00:14:13,740
else it may perform differently just

404
00:14:11,669 --> 00:14:14,759
within different very slight differences

405
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,169
in the room if they've got a different

406
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:18,389
type of light you're gonna see different

407
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:19,979
performance if they're augmenting co2

408
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:21,600
you're gonna see a different performance

409
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:24,000
but let's talk about the things that we

410
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,700
can dial in in our grow room for our

411
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,679
plants with our plants to maximize the

412
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,320
potential of this plant in these

413
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:33,089
expensive rooms we're building so one of

414
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,280
the things we really need to dial in is

415
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:38,040
flowering time a lot of people like to

416
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,949
say this plant takes this many days pay

417
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:41,879
attention it's going to be different

418
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:43,800
don't believe the guy that grew up

419
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,919
before you use that as a guideline if he

420
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:49,139
says it's a take 63 days around day 58

421
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,329
start paying really close attention give

422
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:52,980
that plant maybe seventy days pay

423
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,690
attention to the plant that dude that

424
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,480
grew up before you and told you it takes

425
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,160
63 days is not a trichome head he does

426
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,129
not get to decide when the try comes a

427
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,509
ripe your scope your eyes that is what

428
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:05,100
decides one of those try comes a ripe

429
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:07,710
get in there and look see when it's done

430
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,170
so flowering time we can really dial

431
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,730
that in in a commercial environment it's

432
00:15:10,169 --> 00:15:13,559
less likely that you're gonna dial in

433
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:15,360
the flowering time we like to pick

434
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,739
things that take nine weeks you put them

435
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,180
in a room you run all the nine week

436
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,669
strains together they come down at day

437
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:22,529
sixty-three that's how that goes and a

438
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,689
smaller Bowtique grow and a craft grow

439
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:26,159
is what we like to call it now we're

440
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,050
more able to dial in these types of

441
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:30,269
things so flowering time is something

442
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:33,179
you should absolutely nail get that to

443
00:15:30,269 --> 00:15:34,009
the perfect day also dial in the flush

444
00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:35,479
when you do

445
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,370
that's going to take a couple of

446
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,159
flowering cycles because you need to

447
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,379
learn exactly how long the plants finish

448
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,299
then you need to adjust your flush time

449
00:15:42,379 --> 00:15:46,429
to that so that you can feed to the

450
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:48,079
maximum feed point and flush to the

451
00:15:46,429 --> 00:15:49,729
perfect flush time so you have to learn

452
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,500
exactly how long they take to flower

453
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:53,450
that means you got to run the same

454
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,370
cultivar two or three times to get to

455
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,980
that point the other things we need to

456
00:15:55,370 --> 00:16:00,799
dial in perfectly Colt of our specific

457
00:15:57,980 --> 00:16:02,960
are the VPD during the day and the night

458
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,939
you're gonna have two different desired

459
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,110
VP DS for these plants pay attention to

460
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,970
what they do whether they look like

461
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:09,470
right when they wake up go in there

462
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,970
right when the lights come on watch

463
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:13,129
those plants see what they're telling

464
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:14,840
you you've got monitors to tell you what

465
00:16:13,129 --> 00:16:17,000
the temperature and humidity were

466
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:18,560
overnight so you can look at that and as

467
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,450
soon as the lights go on walk in there

468
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,009
look at the plants now you know what the

469
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,870
temp in humidity was you see how they

470
00:16:22,009 --> 00:16:26,090
reacted you can adjust from there as

471
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,220
necessary you can use your monitors

472
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:29,930
during the day to tell you what the VPD

473
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,060
the temperature and the humidity are in

474
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:34,250
that room but you also need to watch the

475
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:35,929
plants are there tako leaves if the

476
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,970
leaves are talked going up it's possibly

477
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:39,529
too hot are the leaves drooping and

478
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:41,509
acting kind of weird it could be too

479
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:43,579
humid in there pay attention to the

480
00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:45,860
plants and use the info from your

481
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:48,080
monitors to make an educated decision

482
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,840
and then dial in the equipment to work

483
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:52,670
for the plant we want the plant to be

484
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:54,320
the boss the plant is the queen in there

485
00:16:52,669 --> 00:16:56,179
we've got to make the Queen happy you're

486
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,160
the king your job now is to make that

487
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:00,079
Queen happy and you've got to do that by

488
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,149
dialing in all of the equipment so

489
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:04,430
another thing you can think about are

490
00:17:02,149 --> 00:17:06,680
the nutrients some of these plants are

491
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,150
going to want completely different diets

492
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,590
than the other plants look at the people

493
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,509
around you there might be three or four

494
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,339
people in the room near you are you guys

495
00:17:11,509 --> 00:17:14,180
all going to agree on the same exact

496
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:17,119
meal for lunch

497
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,710
probably not the plants are the same way

498
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,449
if you've got three or four strains in

499
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:22,130
that room they probably want three or

500
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,769
four different meals just slightly

501
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:26,840
different yes from a commercial aspect

502
00:17:24,769 --> 00:17:28,430
we can feed them all the same thing and

503
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:31,159
it will work we will get impressive

504
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,960
results but imagine if I broke that room

505
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,120
down that has nine different plants in

506
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,039
there and I isolated it to just two

507
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,289
different strains and I was running one

508
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,299
table with one strain and one table with

509
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,920
another strain and I'd ran those for

510
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,349
like three months and I've got several

511
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,850
crops under my belt of these strains

512
00:17:45,349 --> 00:17:47,569
specifically and I've taken a lot of

513
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:49,849
notes

514
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:51,378
I can make those plants that much better

515
00:17:49,849 --> 00:17:53,418
I could pull that much more weight I can

516
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:55,248
get that much more harvest I can get

517
00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:57,649
that much more potency I can probably

518
00:17:55,249 --> 00:18:00,440
get another bonus if I do this correctly

519
00:17:57,648 --> 00:18:02,209
so learn the plants dial them in does

520
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,399
your specific cultivar need more

521
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,129
nitrogen golden goat I know golden goat

522
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:08,689
can use more macro and micronutrients

523
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,528
she just eats through the nutrients

524
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,389
early in flower

525
00:18:09,528 --> 00:18:13,099
so boost her up and feed her heavily

526
00:18:11,388 --> 00:18:14,959
there are some things that if you feed

527
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,949
her as hard as golden goat he will roast

528
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,899
the [ __ ] out of it

529
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,700
so you can't put that plant and golden

530
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:21,949
goat on the same table it simply will

531
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,840
not work it is always a good idea to

532
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:25,609
keep Girl Scout cookie and cookie

533
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,499
dominant crosses on the same table

534
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:29,960
together because they like to be fed a

535
00:18:27,499 --> 00:18:32,749
lower pH and a very specific feeding

536
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,669
keep your og cush [ __ ] together because

537
00:18:32,749 --> 00:18:36,200
it likes a little extra calmac little

538
00:18:34,669 --> 00:18:38,479
things that you will learn by working

539
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,950
with cultivars over time but you can't

540
00:18:38,479 --> 00:18:41,929
really learn that by grouping them

541
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,819
together so you can learn to adjust the

542
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:45,950
nutrients to something want more cal-mag

543
00:18:43,819 --> 00:18:47,538
does it want more phosphorous does it

544
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,319
need more potassium you can learn that

545
00:18:47,538 --> 00:18:50,720
sort of stuff

546
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,908
you need to learn possibly how much and

547
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,098
how often do specific cultivars want

548
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:57,320
water let's talk about the golden goat

549
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:59,418
again she likes to drink bro that plant

550
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:01,548
has got fish roots that you could just

551
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:02,538
water it you can't overwater a golden

552
00:19:01,548 --> 00:19:04,009
goat plant you could throw it in the

553
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:06,378
[ __ ] lake and let it float and it

554
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,839
will drink the lake on the other hand

555
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:11,778
there is a plant that is called cookie

556
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:13,459
rack that if you give it two drops to

557
00:19:11,778 --> 00:19:14,989
much water it gets droopy and it gets

558
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,340
all finicky and it starts acting like a

559
00:19:14,989 --> 00:19:19,009
little [ __ ] for like two or three days

560
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:21,138
and it that's just the difference in two

561
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:22,909
plants completely different genetics the

562
00:19:21,138 --> 00:19:24,498
plants look completely different you

563
00:19:22,909 --> 00:19:26,359
can't put them on the same table with an

564
00:19:24,499 --> 00:19:28,038
auto feed system because you're either

565
00:19:26,358 --> 00:19:30,019
going to completely drown the cookie

566
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:31,548
rack or you're going to starve and dry

567
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:33,378
out the golden goat so you've got to

568
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,888
learn that those go on two different

569
00:19:33,378 --> 00:19:35,778
tables

570
00:19:33,888 --> 00:19:37,278
you can't run them together or the trick

571
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:38,749
is if some [ __ ] does put them in the

572
00:19:37,278 --> 00:19:40,128
same room I put two drippers and the

573
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:41,868
golden goat so it gets twice as much

574
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:43,098
that's the way around that but you don't

575
00:19:41,868 --> 00:19:45,319
want to have to [ __ ] with that you want

576
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:47,388
it to be easy you want to grow to not be

577
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:49,460
a pain in the ass so learn the cultivars

578
00:19:47,388 --> 00:19:51,439
and that way you know that that golden

579
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,329
goat is a lush you can plan ahead I'm

580
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,830
going to need to water a little extra

581
00:19:53,329 --> 00:19:56,418
because I'm growing golden goat and she

582
00:19:54,829 --> 00:19:58,519
just wants to drink it up and drink it

583
00:19:56,419 --> 00:19:59,809
up also that golden goat probably may

584
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:01,670
want a little higher temperature than

585
00:19:59,808 --> 00:20:03,109
that cook or a humidity then that could

586
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:04,880
right the cookie wreck doesn't want it

587
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:06,829
as humid it's got a little whiter leaves

588
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,540
it's probably gonna get p.m. if you give

589
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:10,399
it that much humidity so those are

590
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:13,279
things to think about cultivar wise that

591
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,509
you can dial in for nutrients cal-mag is

592
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:16,399
always something you got to pay

593
00:20:14,509 --> 00:20:18,500
attention to that is cultivar specific

594
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,300
watering how often how much water that

595
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,119
is going to be cultivar specific that is

596
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:26,109
also very medium specific pot size

597
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:28,669
specific but is plant specific mostly

598
00:20:26,109 --> 00:20:30,740
let's talk about things like defoliating

599
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:33,170
topping and training things like that

600
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,839
are very strain and cultivar and

601
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:37,700
phenotype specific if you take as many

602
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,409
leaves off of the golden goat as you

603
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,450
took off of that cookie rack you would

604
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:43,100
piss off the golden goat there are some

605
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,049
strains you can strip them butt-naked

606
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:47,329
and in three days they're spitting out

607
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:49,339
way more leaves than they ever had there

608
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,599
are some if you strip them to naked the

609
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:52,039
leaves don't ever come back and the

610
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:54,230
plants look sparse and shitty through

611
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:56,710
the entire grow cycle you have got to

612
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,210
learn which plants can tolerate this and

613
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:00,620
sometimes here's my suggestion and it

614
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,720
scares the [ __ ] out of people but here's

615
00:21:00,619 --> 00:21:04,129
the way to learn how many plants do you

616
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,470
have how many of those need to come out

617
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,330
top notch do what you normally do with

618
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,950
those so that those work for you

619
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:12,049
perfectly you know the outcome don't

620
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,360
mess with those dedicate a couple of

621
00:21:12,049 --> 00:21:16,819
plants to experiments if you can let's

622
00:21:14,359 --> 00:21:19,099
not go crazy with them but let's try

623
00:21:16,819 --> 00:21:20,329
something new if those two plants in the

624
00:21:19,099 --> 00:21:22,129
back of the room are gonna get grown in

625
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:24,559
the normal way let's take one of the

626
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:26,690
plants up front and defoliants a out of

627
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,250
it let's go super hard and then at the

628
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,140
end of the grow let's weigh everything

629
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:32,390
and see if that one that weedy foliated

630
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:34,310
weighs less or more than the one that we

631
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,900
didn't defoliate then we've got another

632
00:21:34,309 --> 00:21:37,099
plant if you've got four maybe you got

633
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,259
another plant in the front you can play

634
00:21:37,099 --> 00:21:41,359
with and do another experiment to maybe

635
00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:42,589
feed it a little extra something or a

636
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,409
little less something or do something

637
00:21:42,589 --> 00:21:47,449
weird to it and see compare that to the

638
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:49,160
other plants and then we can see if the

639
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,170
weight is different if the potency is

640
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,580
different in the final outcome the only

641
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:55,130
way we're gonna learn things is by

642
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:56,869
growing a strain repeatedly and by

643
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,300
having some sort of a control group so

644
00:21:56,869 --> 00:22:01,129
take some notes have like a standard way

645
00:21:59,299 --> 00:22:02,869
that you normally grow then pick a

646
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,850
couple of plants and do some weird [ __ ]

647
00:22:02,869 --> 00:22:06,589
to them and see how they react that is

648
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:08,359
the only way you're going to become a

649
00:22:06,589 --> 00:22:10,609
better grower that's the best way to

650
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:12,949
become established and build a

651
00:22:10,609 --> 00:22:14,869
relationship with each cultivar so

652
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:15,410
things like defoliating and topping and

653
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,539
train

654
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,460
twisting and working him into the net

655
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,049
things like that bottoming lollies

656
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,210
popping those are all gonna be very

657
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:26,149
strange specific type of things that you

658
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:27,049
have to learn things like let's say the

659
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:29,390
Grateful dog

660
00:22:27,049 --> 00:22:31,099
I don't bottom it as much because the

661
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,259
bottom buds get kind of nice and dense

662
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:34,490
on there maybe the lemon Geoffrey I

663
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:36,079
would bottom that a little bit because

664
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:37,670
those little bottom buds get a little

665
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:39,769
bit airy at the very base of the stock

666
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,420
so I will just treat them different when

667
00:22:39,769 --> 00:22:43,910
it comes to bottoming and lolli popping

668
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,650
strawberry starburst makes big giant

669
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:46,910
buds up top so I take a lot off the

670
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:49,160
bottom because I don't need it I already

671
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,410
know it's gonna be huge up top I also

672
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,420
know exactly how much to defoliate that

673
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,460
strawberry starburst to make it go Kapow

674
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,600
because if you Deeley fit too much you

675
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:58,460
kind of slow her down

676
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:00,859
if you delete for too early if you give

677
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:03,049
her time to get a little bit too leafy

678
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:04,639
and then defoliator kind of nice she'll

679
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,109
keep growing as soon as those leaves

680
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,820
come back take them off again

681
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:09,169
don't go stripping her like level 10

682
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:11,000
right away because it'll stop her from

683
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:12,769
growing you got to give her five level

684
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,839
two strips and she'll keep going for you

685
00:23:12,769 --> 00:23:16,519
it's just small things like that that

686
00:23:14,839 --> 00:23:17,809
you will learn it's just like hanging

687
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:19,430
out with people they've all got a

688
00:23:17,809 --> 00:23:21,169
relationship they've all got different

689
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:23,750
needs and when you meet those needs if

690
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:25,519
each person each plant we can help all

691
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:27,769
of them reach their maximum potential

692
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:29,629
and as a grower as a farmer that it that

693
00:23:27,769 --> 00:23:31,309
should be one of our goals if you're

694
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,600
completely satisfied and happy with the

695
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:34,159
way that your crop is coming out keep

696
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:35,929
doing it but if you'd like to push your

697
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:38,509
crop your goal your garden to the next

698
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:40,610
level let's get it dialed in let's stop

699
00:23:38,509 --> 00:23:42,589
worrying about the gauges and the meters

700
00:23:40,609 --> 00:23:45,019
those are awesome those really help us

701
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:48,589
out but they're not the boss the plants

702
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:50,240
are the boss so let's pay just as much

703
00:23:48,589 --> 00:23:52,129
attention to the meters and let's pay a

704
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,660
little bit more attention let's go back

705
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:55,940
to the old school and pay attention to

706
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,860
the plants the leaves the soil

707
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,390
everything involved in the plant is

708
00:23:57,859 --> 00:24:01,819
going to tell you what is actually

709
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:03,530
happening with that plant the meters

710
00:24:01,819 --> 00:24:04,909
tell you what's going on in the room the

711
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:06,829
plant will tell you what's happening

712
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,600
with the plant a joke I made earlier

713
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:09,859
trying to figure out what is wrong with

714
00:24:08,599 --> 00:24:11,629
your girlfriend by looking at her

715
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:13,369
facebook status is never going to work

716
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,710
you have to sit down and ask your

717
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:17,659
girlfriend what is wrong the plants are

718
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,759
the same way the monitors won't tell you

719
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,560
look at the plants sit down and ask them

720
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,420
what's wrong and they're going to tell

721
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,190
you pay attention to the garden pay

722
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:27,740
attention to meters most importantly

723
