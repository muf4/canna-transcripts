00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,899
I'm here with what I am gonna call a

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,910
Thursday quickie I am out of throwback

15
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:37,100
Thursday episodes so until I generate a

16
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,929
bunch of content I'm going to try to

17
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,489
throw out these Thursday quickies I

18
00:00:38,929 --> 00:00:42,229
can't promise you a quickie every week

19
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:44,390
but when we get to one you'll be glad

20
00:00:42,229 --> 00:00:46,038
you showed up now since I'm all caught

21
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,960
up on the throwback Thursday episodes

22
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,789
I'm going to work extra hard at getting

23
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,160
the YouTube channel caught up that's

24
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:54,050
where all the old content will be stored

25
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,119
the thing about the throwback Thursday

26
00:00:54,049 --> 00:00:59,268
episodes was iTunes will only allow me

27
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:01,549
100 episodes in my feed I felt like some

28
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:03,649
of my really valuable content was within

29
00:01:01,549 --> 00:01:05,780
my first hundred episodes that got

30
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,670
pushed out of the feed so I wanted a

31
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,480
place for the old content to be

32
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,340
accessible

33
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,439
I made that the throwback Thursday

34
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,630
episodes unfortunately that's just

35
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,480
pushing new content out of the feed it's

36
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:20,060
just perpetuating the problem so YouTube

37
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,090
does not limit me on how many uploads

38
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,370
and videos I post so I can put all 300

39
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,930
of episodes up there I've only got 288

40
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:29,480
now we're working toward 300 I'll be

41
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,280
able to put all 300 all 500 up there it

42
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,710
won't be a problem it's just going to

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,090
take me time to get them up so they will

44
00:01:33,709 --> 00:01:36,739
be archived on YouTube

45
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,630
we'll start getting fresh content coming

46
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:40,339
out to you guys I'm not going to promise

47
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:42,289
these Thursday episodes every week but

48
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,049
like I said when I get to it it will be

49
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:47,660
worth checking out so that's where we

50
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,009
are for now with the Thursday situation

51
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,689
welcome to the show you guys thanks

52
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,010
again for joining me I like to share

53
00:01:50,689 --> 00:01:53,629
what I'm smoking on at the start of the

54
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:55,969
podcast that's kind of a tradition here

55
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:56,989
I am a big fan of the apothecary

56
00:01:55,969 --> 00:01:59,150
extracts lately

57
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:00,469
I have got myself some Titan oh gee I'm

58
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,060
gonna crack this open and give it a

59
00:02:00,469 --> 00:02:03,739
sniffer

60
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:06,019
it smells like OG has it smells exactly

61
00:02:03,739 --> 00:02:09,919
like what you'd expect an OG to smell

62
00:02:06,019 --> 00:02:11,509
like it smells like I always say coffee

63
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,219
I think og has a little bit of coffee

64
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:16,079
there's a little bit of chocolate to it

65
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,759
and then there is a silky-smooth

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
undertone that I cannot identify

67
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:25,190
that's really nice it's kind of Bubba

68
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,930
cushy it's got sort of a bubba kush sort

69
00:02:25,189 --> 00:02:28,219
of a smell kind of a pre 98 bubba cush

70
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:29,270
if you've ever smoked that it's sort of

71
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:32,359
what it smells like but I've got the

72
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,640
Titan og batter I keep describing the

73
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,120
texture of the batter as battery it

74
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:39,949
looks like aa thick butter or soft

75
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,569
cheese cake or cake batter and just

76
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:43,280
scooped a gram of it perfectly into the

77
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,680
center of this container and then I've

78
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,569
been taking the Titan og and then I like

79
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,370
to take the Titan og batter and I've got

80
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:51,379
some blue ghost high cannabinoid

81
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:53,090
full-spectrum I said hi cannabinoid I

82
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,769
really went in on that word a high

83
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:56,180
cannabinoid full-spectrum extract

84
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,280
crystals and I like to take the batter

85
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:59,689
get a nice chunky sized dab and then

86
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,189
just dip it into the crystals and pick

87
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:04,099
up a couple of crystals to go with it

88
00:03:01,189 --> 00:03:06,050
and then dab that all together and the

89
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,060
lung expansion the head hi it's been a

90
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:09,320
great hi I like the crystals don't have

91
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,229
a lot of flavor but they have a lot of

92
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,419
THC so the mix is really nice for me but

93
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,399
that's what I'm dabbing on today also

94
00:03:14,419 --> 00:03:17,809
been dabbing on some of the sour clem of

95
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,909
course that is almost gone so I've been

96
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:22,159
going in on that and then I'm finishing

97
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:24,889
up the garden of Weeden Sour Diesel

98
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,650
batter as well I've been smoking a lot

99
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:29,359
of variety excuse the throat clearing

100
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,640
you guys I apologize for that it's all

101
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,020
the concentrates I've been dabbing did I

102
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:34,069
mention that this podcast is brought to

103
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,330
you by our friends at the hella dank

104
00:03:34,069 --> 00:03:37,009
seed bank that's right if you need some

105
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:40,160
IRA genetics seeds check out the hell a

106
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:42,139
dank seed bank at dank seed dot store

107
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,879
let's move forward I was just talking

108
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:45,259
about batter right somebody said

109
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:46,459
something about batter to me the other

110
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:48,439
day they're like I don't know why you

111
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:50,870
smoked that batter I would prefer my

112
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,909
concentrates to be purged and I paused

113
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,209
and the look on my face said what the

114
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:58,489
[ __ ] you guys if you are buying batters

115
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:02,539
from a reputable dispensary in Colorado

116
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:05,300
or even most likely on the black market

117
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:06,769
the batters are better purged than some

118
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,410
of the shatters or some of the other

119
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,030
other concentrates now I don't know how

120
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,979
everybody makes their concentrates but

121
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,439
this is kind of how a batter is made a

122
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:17,209
batter comes from the way that they're

123
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,918
doing it at apothecary as they're

124
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:21,949
starting with their ambrosia

125
00:04:18,918 --> 00:04:23,359
which is their premiere product the

126
00:04:21,949 --> 00:04:25,039
ambrosia is basically the high

127
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,810
cannabinoid full-spectrum extract

128
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,910
crystals with high terpene full-spectrum

129
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:30,589
extract turps poured into it and they

130
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:32,360
mix it at their ratios and it's

131
00:04:30,589 --> 00:04:34,399
beautiful it's crystal e it's chirpy I

132
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,439
don't buy it myself because I don't

133
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,000
want the Terp soup at the bottom it's

134
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,219
hard to scrape it up I'd rather get the

135
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,500
batter where it all comes with me in one

136
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,810
chunk but they take the ambrosia and

137
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,149
they'll take a portion of the ambrosia

138
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,589
and then they whip it they will not tell

139
00:04:47,149 --> 00:04:50,359
me how it's whipped they won't tell me

140
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:52,728
their technique I've seen it done

141
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:55,000
several different ways a lot of guys use

142
00:04:52,728 --> 00:04:57,500
a glass wand and you heat the

143
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,910
concentrate and you just whip it like a

144
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,680
whisk with your wrist with the glass

145
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,910
wand you just whip the [ __ ] out of it

146
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,769
with that glass one you let your wrist

147
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,630
get floppy and just whisk it and all

148
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:07,698
you're doing is adding air to it now

149
00:05:05,629 --> 00:05:09,709
think about if you have a product like

150
00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:11,478
ambrosia which is a quality product in

151
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:13,609
Colorado we have lab testing that shows

152
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,389
residuals if you have too many residual

153
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,319
PPM's

154
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:20,478
of a gas of a hydrocarbon which is what

155
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,189
butane would be if there are too many

156
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,599
residuals of that hydrocarbon of the

157
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,969
butane in there you're not allowed to

158
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,550
sell the product so the ambrosia passes

159
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:30,110
the test already then they take that and

160
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:32,180
they whip the [ __ ] out of it to turn it

161
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,310
into batter when you're whipping it and

162
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,259
putting all that oxygen into it don't

163
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,639
you think they're gonna let out any more

164
00:05:36,259 --> 00:05:39,500
butane that would have been in there

165
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,199
that would release that also the

166
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:44,750
batter's actually test cleaner for

167
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:47,120
residual ppm s than the shatters and the

168
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,819
Ambrosia's and that's gonna be true most

169
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,319
of the time and they also seem to be it

170
00:05:49,819 --> 00:05:53,329
brings out the Terps a little bit when

171
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,839
you put that air into it it brings out

172
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:56,089
the Terps

173
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,549
I am NOT a scientist I have nothing to

174
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:59,209
base this on except my own thought

175
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,800
process

176
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:03,560
there's no reading there's no influence

177
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,509
here when you crack open wine or beer

178
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,399
when the air when you pour it into a

179
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,288
certain glass they serve alcoholic

180
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:12,079
beverages in certain shaped glasses to

181
00:06:09,288 --> 00:06:14,449
create certain air flows and I think

182
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,668
that airflow mixing in with the

183
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:18,379
concentrate enhances the terpenes

184
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:20,810
there's something about the way you whip

185
00:06:18,379 --> 00:06:22,879
it and had the oxygen in there it makes

186
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,199
it more aromatic and that's just my

187
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,839
opinion I don't know the science behind

188
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,030
it so it is purged and it also tastes

189
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:31,739
really good and I really like the way

190
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:34,229
the batter's expand on the lungs

191
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:36,420
so if you seem to think that batters are

192
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:38,520
not purged most of the time they are

193
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,540
better purged I'm gonna segue into

194
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:45,240
another part here I've been smoking pho

195
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,090
which is propane honey oil and this

196
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,550
stuff is purged but something about the

197
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:53,909
propane honey oil I talked about I enjoy

198
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:57,210
the lung expansion on the batter I do

199
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:00,150
not like the way the pho makes my lungs

200
00:06:57,209 --> 00:07:03,539
feel after I take a big dab a medium dab

201
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:05,519
a small dab of pho it feels like an

202
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:07,470
elephant is sitting on my chest it feels

203
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,479
like I'm in some jujitsu hold that I do

204
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,680
not want to [ __ ] be in and I want to

205
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:13,170
tap out it hurts

206
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,120
I don't like smoking pho I've got to

207
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,890
I've got about a gram left and I'll

208
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,009
smoke it because I bought it and it gets

209
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:21,990
me high as giraffe [ __ ] but I will not

210
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:24,420
buy more and I'll probably pass on

211
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,730
propane honey oil dads should somebody

212
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:28,230
offer them to me it's just I don't it

213
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:30,509
feels like I'm drowning when I smoke

214
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:33,000
that [ __ ] I don't like it I can smoke a

215
00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:34,920
gram dab of good BHO if you gave me a

216
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,720
half gram dab of shatter right now I

217
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,160
might cough a little bit because I've

218
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,590
been dabbing all dinh I've been talking

219
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,510
and I'm kind of dehydrated but a half

220
00:07:40,589 --> 00:07:45,899
gram dab wouldn't hurt my feelings of

221
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:48,269
some shatter of BHO butane honey oil but

222
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:50,459
a half gram dab of propane honey oil

223
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:52,379
would [ __ ] kill me I wouldn't be able

224
00:07:50,459 --> 00:07:53,939
to talk for an hour and it wouldn't be

225
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,709
the high it would just be the lung

226
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,939
pressure and the lack of oxygen I

227
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:00,689
wouldn't be able to inhale and exhale

228
00:07:56,939 --> 00:08:01,800
properly it just feels so heavy and

229
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,689
that's even when it's clean

230
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,400
I don't know why but that's just

231
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:07,560
something that I've mentioned so the

232
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:09,989
batter is purged you guys and Pho makes

233
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,610
my lungs heavy that's the summary of

234
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,960
what I just rambled about so it's a

235
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,639
Thursday quickie I'm gonna move quickly

236
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,959
through the topics I've just got a

237
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,349
couple of bullet points that I want to

238
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,549
talk about something I noticed and that

239
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:22,470
I've wanted to talk about a lot of

240
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,170
people water their plants not

241
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,760
incorrectly but in a way that is maybe

242
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,819
inefficient and there's a better way you

243
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:31,439
could do it a lot of people aim for the

244
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:33,990
center of the pot when they water a

245
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,210
plant they get a pitcher of water or the

246
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,440
hose the water one or whatever or maybe

247
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,090
they're using one of those fancy water

248
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,290
cans from Target with a flower painted

249
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,670
on the side and it's got your mom's name

250
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:43,649
printed on it but whatever you're

251
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:44,870
watering with they aim for the center of

252
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,569
the pot with

253
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:49,399
is not a good idea it would be better if

254
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:52,010
you delivered the water to the outer

255
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:53,329
edge of the pot and when your plants are

256
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:54,559
little yeah you should probably water

257
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,790
the middle where the plants and where

258
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,549
the roots are but when your plants are

259
00:08:55,789 --> 00:09:00,019
large and they have grown to meet the

260
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,219
size pot that they are in when the roots

261
00:09:00,019 --> 00:09:03,199
are filling the pot in which they are

262
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,839
sitting you should water the outer edge

263
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,270
the outer area with more water and then

264
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,339
less water toward the middle the reason

265
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:12,559
for that is that insides gonna get

266
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:14,480
saturated and it's gonna stay wet in

267
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,879
there longer and those roots are gonna

268
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,620
find water the water is gonna be right

269
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,809
there in the middle the roots will grow

270
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,759
it will stretch they will look for water

271
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:24,229
if you water that outer edge they'll go

272
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,789
out there and get that water if you keep

273
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,200
flooding the inside those roots will

274
00:09:25,789 --> 00:09:28,969
just stay there and get bored and get

275
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,770
stagnant you got to make them work water

276
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:32,149
the outside and the roots will go out to

277
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,620
the outside you'll get your nutrients

278
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:35,509
out to the outside by watering it out

279
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:37,190
there you'll get water out there those

280
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,559
roots will go out there also you'll

281
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:40,910
develop a larger root system and a

282
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:42,889
bigger root system will make a bigger

283
00:09:40,909 --> 00:09:45,079
happier more productive plant and I

284
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:46,580
think that's what we want overall so

285
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,650
stop watering directly in the middle

286
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,450
water toward the outer edge if you've

287
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:53,208
got a bad habit of watering directly in

288
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:55,640
the middle our friend mr. spliff taught

289
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:56,989
us to make little pyramids little domes

290
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:58,490
in the middle of the plant grab some

291
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,110
dirt and just make a little cone right

292
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,519
around the trunk of the plant and that

293
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,110
way when you do water all the water runs

294
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,789
away from the trunk and it runs out to

295
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:06,379
the outer edge of the pot then it sinks

296
00:10:04,789 --> 00:10:07,879
down in there and then it gets the outer

297
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:09,559
edge wet and then those roots have

298
00:10:07,879 --> 00:10:11,028
nutrients and water out there at the

299
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,109
outer edge and they'll grow and then you

300
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:13,338
don't flood the middle of the pot

301
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:15,019
because the middle of the pots gonna

302
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:17,420
stay soggy a little bit longer that

303
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:19,789
outer edge is gonna dry up so get it wet

304
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:21,019
if you actually look at the shape of a

305
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:22,639
cannabis plant and the way that the

306
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:23,958
leaves work how many times have you

307
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,699
tried to water the plant when you're in

308
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,319
the grow room and you're kneeling down

309
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,879
and you've got your watering device and

310
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,830
you keep hitting the leaves with the

311
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,240
water and it pushes the leaves out to

312
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:35,420
the outer edge of the pot or even onto

313
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,009
the floor in my opinion cannabis plants

314
00:10:35,419 --> 00:10:38,569
are sort of shaped like an umbrella and

315
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:40,850
the way that the leaves work is sort of

316
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:42,740
umbrella like the water will land on the

317
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,600
leaf and the leaf will Bend down just

318
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:46,100
enough to let that water drip off onto

319
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,570
the next leaf and that leaf bends and

320
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,000
that leaf bends and as it does it it

321
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:51,560
pushes the water outward like I just

322
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,419
spread my arms like you can see it it

323
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,578
pushes the water outward with each leaf

324
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,990
as it falls it moves further and further

325
00:10:55,578 --> 00:10:57,789
from the center of the plant until it

326
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,370
hits the ground

327
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:01,839
and then it lands and I bet if the water

328
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,220
makes a nice little ring around the

329
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,410
cannabis plant I bet if you stood

330
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,389
directly above a lot of trees and

331
00:11:05,409 --> 00:11:09,339
watched water fall you'd see a nice ring

332
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,990
around a lot of trees and I bet that's

333
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,600
where the most productive root system is

334
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:15,730
in those trees is right around that

335
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,850
perimeter where the rain is allowed to

336
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,170
fall so keep in mind your cannabis

337
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:21,790
plants are shaped like an umbrella they

338
00:11:20,169 --> 00:11:24,279
probably want that water to get spread

339
00:11:21,789 --> 00:11:27,759
out like that also cannabis roots seem

340
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:29,259
to prefer wider spaces then deeper

341
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,389
spaces so if you can give it a wider

342
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:32,950
space it'll grow wider your plan will

343
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:34,360
have I mean just imagine if you spread

344
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,530
your legs you can hold your balance

345
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,600
better than if you put your feet

346
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:40,149
together so you could grow wider if you

347
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,820
could spread your feet further so water

348
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:44,199
the outer perimeter of the pot that's

349
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:45,310
what I'm getting at all right one more

350
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,660
quick thing and then we're gonna end

351
00:11:45,309 --> 00:11:48,789
this quickie I'm giving you a warning

352
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:51,129
I'm almost done ladies and gentlemen it

353
00:11:48,789 --> 00:11:54,039
is illegal in the state of Colorado to

354
00:11:51,129 --> 00:11:56,710
take your cannabis on federal property

355
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:58,929
federal property like a state park you

356
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:01,240
cannot go in a state park with your

357
00:11:58,929 --> 00:12:03,250
medical or recreational cannabis even if

358
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,620
you are an adult if you've got cannabis

359
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,450
and you go to the Pueblo reservoir or

360
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,730
any other reservoir I'm just trying to

361
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,950
think of random state parks you cannot

362
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:14,500
go to Muller State Park you cannot go to

363
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,900
Golden Gate Canyon State Park unit you

364
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,970
cannot go to Garden of the Gods with

365
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:20,860
medical or recreational cannabis on you

366
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:23,259
if you are caught in possession of

367
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:25,269
medical or recreational cannabis with or

368
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:26,529
without a medical marijuana card you

369
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,120
will be charged with the illegal

370
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:30,629
possession of cannabis because that is

371
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,279
federal land and cannabis is not

372
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:35,919
federally legal it is only legal in the

373
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,230
state of Colorado by state law federal

374
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,000
law supersedes that especially when you

375
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:42,310
were on federal land you were playing by

376
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,220
their rules and their laws so if you

377
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:46,899
come to Colorado and you want to go get

378
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,850
some cannabis and you want to go see

379
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:52,389
some sights make sure that you do not

380
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:55,810
end up on federal land do not go to a

381
00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:59,019
state park do not go to a university do

382
00:12:55,809 --> 00:13:01,059
not go to a military base all of the of

383
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:02,529
course if we you'd probably be paranoid

384
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:04,779
to take your cannabis on your military

385
00:13:02,529 --> 00:13:08,740
base but we have a friend of the podcast

386
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:11,470
who her husband is part of Fort Carson

387
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,629
the military base in Colorado Springs

388
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,660
she is a well-known cannabis patient an

389
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:18,549
advocate she has to be very careful not

390
00:13:16,659 --> 00:13:21,189
to take her medical and recreational

391
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:23,289
cannabis on to the base when she goes

392
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,270
with her husband so she has to keep that

393
00:13:23,289 --> 00:13:27,819
in mind I actually have another friend

394
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:30,069
who had to write a letter to his

395
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,480
higher-up I can't remember the the rank

396
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,310
I apologize for being ignorant in

397
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,769
military ranks he had to write a letter

398
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:37,359
and apologize and request permission to

399
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:40,179
still be allowed to hang out with his

400
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,820
friends on the base because he was

401
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:44,169
caught with medical marijuana he was

402
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,330
lucky that he had his medical marijuana

403
00:13:44,169 --> 00:13:47,620
recommendation with him he was lucky

404
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,139
that he'd been outspoken about his

405
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:53,200
medical marijuana activism and his PTSD

406
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:54,879
experiences in the past or it may not

407
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,890
have worked out so well for my friend

408
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,840
but they did have some compassion for

409
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,480
him and they let him go but he had to

410
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,759
write a letter and apologize and request

411
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,860
permission to go back on to the base and

412
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,840
promise to never bring his medical

413
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,350
marijuana or his recreational marijuana

414
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:13,000
back to the base ever again and so he's

415
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:15,639
very careful not to because they will

416
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,649
arrest him next time so you guys be very

417
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:19,360
careful if you're going to a reservoir

418
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:21,610
to do some jet skiing some boating

419
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,740
please do not take your cannabis if you

420
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,990
do be [ __ ] careful because if they

421
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,519
catch you with it you were on federal

422
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,590
land I don't know what they can do to

423
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,329
you you will certainly be charged with

424
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,340
illegal possession of cannabis if you're

425
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:34,900
not old enough if you're not 21 you may

426
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,060
be a minor in possession if you're not

427
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:39,009
18 you may be a minor in possession of

428
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:41,109
cannabis I don't know what could happen

429
00:14:39,009 --> 00:14:42,669
to you on federal land I wish Mike were

430
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,050
here but it would be awkward having a

431
00:14:42,669 --> 00:14:46,329
