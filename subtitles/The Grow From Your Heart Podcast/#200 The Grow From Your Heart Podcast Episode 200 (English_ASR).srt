46
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:56,789
we've been recording this podcast for

47
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,819
what I believe has been approximately

48
00:01:56,789 --> 00:02:00,810
two years so it's a great celebration

49
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,950
thank you for listening everybody thanks

50
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,840
for being here for 4/20 I hope you're

51
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,759
smoking on something take some time to

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,780
roll up a joint roll up a blunt if

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,219
that's what you got to do I'm not really

54
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:10,259
a big fan of blunts I think we grow

55
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:11,549
really quality cannabis and then watch

56
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,529
you guys grind it up and put into a

57
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:15,810
blunt it's kind of heartbreaking that

58
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,430
blunt tastes like [ __ ] to me here grape

59
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,170
flavored blunt wrap what the [ __ ] is

60
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,459
with that those berry flavored blunt

61
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:22,109
wrap that you guys are smoking it smells

62
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:23,909
terrible it makes my lips feel funky

63
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:25,380
cannot deal with that I don't know how

64
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:26,729
you guys do it but if you're smoking to

65
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:29,069
pull out more power to you go for it and

66
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:31,319
do it smoke that blunt just not for me

67
00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:32,759
I bet hopefully I know people gonna say

68
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,139
but you run butane over your weed and

69
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:35,639
destroy it you're right turns it into

70
00:02:34,139 --> 00:02:38,750
golden sweet shatter that doesn't taste

71
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:40,768
like funky like I'm smoking incense

72
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:42,419
whatever you're doing smoke a blow with

73
00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:43,909

74
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,929

76
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:49,530

asking to buy me a new car what I am

131
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:37,250
trying to do is offset the cost of my

132
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,870
website it does cost me a little bit of

133
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:41,389
money to have a website which is where I

134
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,579
hosted the show honestly you guys my

135
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:46,219
website sucks it's a mess it's terrible

136
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,479
I am NOT a web guy I haven't put any

137
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,570
time or energy or effort into that

138
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:52,430
website it is there kind of it's nothing

139
00:04:50,569 --> 00:04:54,290
impressive I apologize I'm embarrassed

140
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,550
but I don't have the resources or the I

141
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,890
don't know how to do that and I'm not

142
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,480
going to take the time to learn it'll

143
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:01,849
get fixed my buddy that does it's been

144
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,850
tied up he's a new dad he'll get to it

145
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,800
yeah but anyway so the website hosts the

146
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,330
podcast the podcast is then dumped into

147
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,180
all of the other services like iTunes

148
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:12,319
stitcher pod Bay Feedburner wherever

149
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,000
else it goes it goes to a lot of places

150
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,769
so people can listen to it but it does

151
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,540
cost money to have the website so the

152
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:19,370
funds that you guys contribute to my

153
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,629
patreon go directly to my PayPal and

154
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,310
then that goes directly to my web

155
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:24,740
hosting and it covers the cost of my web

156
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,300
hosting once the web hosting is covered

157
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,470
what I will do with the funds I'm making

158
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,939

221
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,719

231
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,270
grows crew for the relationship that

232
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:06,949
we've built I think it's really cool

233
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:09,109
that we've got two podcasts serving two

234
00:08:06,949 --> 00:08:11,149
different audiences and one joint

235
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,169
audience and there's no I don't feel

236
00:08:11,149 --> 00:08:13,699
intimidated by them they're not

237
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:15,079
intimidated by me it's [ __ ] awesome

238
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:16,189
that we've built this community and this

239
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,990
connection in this bond

240
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:20,240
let's get back on tracks I'm high as

241
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,850
[ __ ] second place in the dude gross cup

242
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,699
was purple elephant grown by a guy who

243
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:27,470
calls himself stony Jack 420 so shout

244
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:29,209
out to stony Jack 420 with the purple

245
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,190
elephant they said that the difference

246
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:34,189
in second and third place was actually

247
00:08:31,189 --> 00:08:35,960
one vote there were 35 and 34 votes for

248
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:37,940
second and third place so one vote split

249
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,250
it up so if you go to a cannabis event

250
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,750
and you were able to vote just like in

251
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:44,330
politics [ __ ] vote cuz your vote

252
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,950
counts I might not have a third place

253
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,870
winning strain if you would have voted

254
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,040
differently that's how it goes so one

255
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,409
vote is all it would have taken to knock

256
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,759
me out of there not me personally I bred

257
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,588
the strain I can't take too much credit

258
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,490
I made the seeds once those seeds left I

259
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:57,710
don't know what happened to him

260
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:01,370
apparently Cole grew the [ __ ] out of it

261
00:08:57,710 --> 00:09:03,860
good work so first place first place got

262
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,259
over 50 votes that it was everybody's

263
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,450
favorite strain first place was a strain

264
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:10,970
called Brandywine grown by a person who

265
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,680
calls himself van rip ster I have not

266
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,529

297
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,829
want to ask everybody that's listening I

298
00:10:17,509 --> 00:10:20,089

299
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:21,078
start rambling you never know how it

300
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:23,269

episode short but yeah that might not

302
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:26,179
happen I want to know what you're

303
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:27,769
listening to when you're smoking down

304
00:10:26,179 --> 00:10:30,528
what kind of music do you like to jam

305
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:32,240

306
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:34,188

308
00:10:34,188 --> 00:10:39,469
of course I'm a huge Grateful Dead fan I

309
00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,329
like any of the Grateful Dead stuff all

310
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,028
of the Grateful Dead stuff mostly but

311
00:10:41,328 --> 00:10:46,309
stuff from like 1977 is kind of my

312
00:10:44,028 --> 00:10:49,100
favorite if you're a deadhead the Betty

313
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:50,958
boards for a May of 77 the North East

314
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,720

315
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:57,528
[ __ ] ever 72 is good some of that

316
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,480
acoustic stuff from 72 the West Coast

317
00:10:57,528 --> 00:11:00,889

318
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,438
the Grateful Dead obviously you guys I'm

319
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:04,850
a [ __ ] Grateful Dead fan 72 74 77

320
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:07,909
that's my favorite Grateful Dead [ __ ]

321
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,259
right there but then I think if somebody

322
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,850
asked me what my favorite band was I

323
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:12,050
would probably have to flip a coin that

324
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,519
day and see what kind of mood I'm in

325
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:15,769
it's either fish or the Grateful Dead

326
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,299
I'm a huge fish fan also so when I'm

327
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,509
gettin blazed I like to listen to fish

328
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:23,659
the Grateful Dead or good reggae and

329
00:11:20,509 --> 00:11:26,600
honestly when I was younger I was a huge

330
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:29,568
metalhead I liked the UH not not super

331
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,069
heavy meant well yeah I got it I dabbled

332
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:33,559
into the super heavy [ __ ] for a little

333
00:11:31,068 --> 00:11:35,899
while but uh I was into like Metallica

334
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,729
Pantera Megadeth stuff like that kind of

335
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:39,708
into the Pearl Jam side of stuff but

336
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,720
more on the metal less grungy side the

337
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:43,129
more metal side of stuff so occasionally

338
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,559
when we're working at the grow and

339
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:47,299
things are draggin yesterday morning

340
00:11:45,558 --> 00:11:49,208
everybody had a hard time kitten [ __ ]

341
00:11:47,299 --> 00:11:52,099
started so I fired up Metallica radio

342
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:54,289
and just the kick drum and cymbals and

343
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,028
snare drum [ __ ] going everybody was

344
00:11:54,289 --> 00:11:57,769
working at an acceptable pace after a

345
00:11:56,028 --> 00:11:59,149
couple of songs so that's what I like to

346
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:00,589
listen to if I need to get it fired up

347
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:01,850
which isn't very often if I really need

348
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:03,889
to get moving I'll put on mo

349
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:05,480
I think mo is like super high-energy

350
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,930
maybe some government mule if I need to

351
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,778
wake the

352
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:11,019
but so I really rambled about music fish

353
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:13,580
mo the Grateful Dead ah

354
00:12:11,019 --> 00:12:15,980
reggae music of course widespread panic

355
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:17,389
occasionally I just listened to a lot of

356
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,700
panic it's just missed a logic to me I

357

and blazed for 4/20 you guys I've been

429
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:34,889
rambling for like 15 minutes I usually

430
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:36,240
stop and take a drink and take a couple

431
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:38,460
of dabs right about now but I think I'm

432
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,370
just gonna wish everybody a happy 4/20

433
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,870
and I am going to take a couple of dabs

434
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,299
while the music plays and I hope you

435
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:47,039
were dabbing with me I would take a fat

436
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,359
dab right now while we're recording but

437
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,769
I'm gonna COFF and it's just gonna be

438
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:51,060
kind of a waste of recording space so

439
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,279
know that when I hit play on the ending

440
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:56,459
music that I'm taking fat dabs and that

441
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,509
it's time for you to give your mom a hug

442
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,620
I didn't even thought about what song

443
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:00,659
I'm gonna play at the end here I think

444
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,460
we're gonna play ganja farmer by Marlon

445
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:03,990
Asher it seems like a very appropriate

446
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,879
song and I bet I could find it on my

447
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,070
phone pretty quickly to make it happen I

448
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:10,019
am recording a video also I'm not gonna

449
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,490
record the video I probably will not

450
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:13,590
record the audio unless I [ __ ] up right

451
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,840
now trying to find this song which I'm

452

455
00:15:19,049 --> 00:15:25,049
