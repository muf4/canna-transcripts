00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:23,670
what I'm smoking today

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,650
I've been taking dabs of Starr dog

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,539
ambrosia from our friends at apothecary

12
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:32,519
the label says 64.7% THC and a total of

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,890
seventy six point four total

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,420
cannabinoids I always love star dog it

15
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,250
is one of my favorite strains to grow

16
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,020
it's one of my favorite strains to take

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,939
photos of it is always one of my

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,010
favorite strains to smoke I love the

19
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,049
aroma I love the flavor and I always

20
00:00:44,009 --> 00:00:47,729
love that nice head buzz from the star

21
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,468
dogs so today I'm taking dabs of star

22
00:00:47,729 --> 00:00:52,859
dog I feel like that will make for a

23
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:54,780
great podcast this episode is going to

24
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:56,460
be another grow lesson if you've been

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,920
following along you know I've been doing

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,808
a long series of grow lessons we started

27
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,489
by setting a goal for our garden we

28
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:04,079
found a right place for our garden we

29
00:01:02,488 --> 00:01:06,239
selected and purchased the appropriate

30
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,609
equipment at this point in the grow we

31
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:11,069
are past week one a flower and we are

32
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:13,140
entering week two of the flowering phase

33
00:01:11,069 --> 00:01:15,209
this episode will highlight weeks two

34
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,609
and three or days eight through twenty

35
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:19,079
one of the flowering phase if you feel

36
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,489
like you need a better foundation and

37
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:23,009
you haven't been listening to the show I

38
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:24,989
recommend you head back to episode 351

39
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,780
and start on the grow lessons in episode

40
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,368
351 if you've been following along and

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,920
you feel like you're up to speed let's

42
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:33,450
jump right into a grow lesson in this

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,219
episode we're going to focus on weeks

44
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,219
two and three of the flowering phase

45
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,289
also known as days 8 through 21 before

46
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,929
we get there let's recap a little bit of

47
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,450
the previous episode in the last episode

48
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,090
we changed our timer to 12 hours on and

49
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,659
12 hours off to initiate flower we are

50
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,770
now seven days into the flowering phase

51
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:54,840
hopefully at this point you have not

52
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:56,908
over fertilized or ran into any pH

53
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,590
issues with your garden hopefully at

54
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:01,049
this point you have not interrupted the

55
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,969
dark cycle at all interrupting that dark

56
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,009
cycle will disrupt the flowering phase

57
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:08,128
and throw your plants into shock and

58
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:09,899
possibly cause hermaphrodites hopefully

59
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,239
the garden has remained pests and

60
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,159
pathogens free so if everything is on

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,610
the right track

62
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:19,219
let's move in to week 2 or day 8 of the

63
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,780
flowering phase at this stage of the

64
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,849
flowering process we're not going to

65
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,530
notice much change from the vegetative

66
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,210
cycle you may notice a little bit of

67
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:27,259
stretch the plants may have taken off

68
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,719
they're starting to get a little bit

69
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:31,909
taller on you some of your plants may be

70
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:33,800
showing pre flower some of your plants

71
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:35,810
may start indicating sex around this

72
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,850
time don't stress if they are not

73
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:40,039
showing you sex yet we still have plenty

74
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:41,900
of time but the main thing you're going

75
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:44,150
to see at this point is stretch those

76
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,890
plants are starting to grow taller that

77
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,569
is okay that's exactly what we're

78
00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:49,429
expecting for the first three weeks

79
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:52,009
we're going to see a lot of stretching

80
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:54,260
happening to these plants now we will

81
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:56,539
probably start seeing pre flower and bud

82
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:58,609
sets starting to develop around a 10 or

83
00:02:56,539 --> 00:03:00,650
12 we will definitely have little

84
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:03,020
dandelion looking bud sets popping up

85
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:04,789
around day 14 so things are about to

86
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:06,890
start getting very exciting in our

87
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:08,750
garden now let's talk about the

88
00:03:06,889 --> 00:03:10,819
environment and conditions in our grow

89
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,400
room during weeks two and three of the

90
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:15,919
flowering phase at this stage of

91
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,319
flowering during the day I try to aim

92
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:21,349
between 70 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit for

93
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,840
my daytime temperature I also aim for 40

94
00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:26,030
to 50 percent relative humidity for my

95
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,789
daytime temperature now let's talk about

96
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:30,949
nighttime temperatures in the night time

97
00:03:28,789 --> 00:03:33,650
I like to have my temperature between 60

98
00:03:30,949 --> 00:03:36,469
and 70 degrees Fahrenheit I also aim for

99
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:39,530
40 to 50% humidity during my nighttime

100
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:41,629
cycle at this stage of flowering now I

101
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,270
want to remind you try not to have more

102
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:46,609
than a 10 degree temperature difference

103
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,980
in your day and nighttime cycle that is

104
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,350
called your diurnal temperature

105
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:53,719
variation try to keep that less than 10

106
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:55,370
degrees too much of a drastic swing from

107
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:57,319
day to night temperature will start

108
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:59,300
causing your plants to grow slowly they

109
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,400
will get stagnant they will slow down it

110
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,219
will not be happy also this will

111
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,900
encourage powdery mildew so let's aim to

112
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:08,959
keep that temperature within 10 degrees

113
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,459
from the day and night cycles something

114
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,810
we should add into our flower room that

115
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,479
I've been overlooking on previous

116
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,459
episodes is more fans we need more

117
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:18,829
airflow as we are entering the flowering

118
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,699
stage we are going to develop big fat

119
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,219
chunky buds

120
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:24,319
we need more airflow once we have those

121
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,090
buds in the room we're going to have a

122
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,659
lot of moisture we're gonna have big fat

123
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:28,699
chunky

124
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,680
Budds those buds will act like a sponge

125
00:04:28,699 --> 00:04:32,180
if there is too much moisture so we need

126
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,519
to blow some air around the room and

127
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,290
keep that moisture moving I feel like a

128
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:37,939
little bit of wind and airflow is really

129
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:39,680
good for the plants it makes them active

130
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:41,480
I feel like some wind and a little bit

131
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,220
of pressure makes the stalks more robust

132
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:45,530
it makes them want to stand up on their

133
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,880
own a little better imagine if I shove

134
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:48,589
you a little bit you would spread your

135
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,969
feet for a little more balance I think a

136
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:51,289
little bit of wind it makes the plants

137
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,450
want to spread their feet for a little

138
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,670
bit more balance so add a little bit of

139
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:57,469
wind and airflow to the garden don't go

140
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,640
crazy we don't need a wind tunnel and

141
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:01,160
there we're not trying to dry out the

142
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,019
plants we just want the air moving if

143
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:04,970
some of your leaves start looking dry

144
00:05:03,019 --> 00:05:06,680
and leathery and kind of potato-chip

145
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:08,780
like they're probably getting beat up by

146
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,209
that fan too much you were ruining the

147
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:13,099
VPD around those leaves in that

148
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:15,169
condition just reduce the wind just a

149
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:17,510
little bit but it's never a bad idea to

150
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,250
have some airflow in your grow if you

151
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:21,439
notice your grow room is consistently

152
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:23,600
too humid it may be time to invest in a

153
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:26,089
dehumidifier or maybe a larger

154
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,670
dehumidifier or possibly add some sort

155
00:05:26,089 --> 00:05:30,500
of extraction fan to remove that humid

156
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:32,150
air from the room and replace it with

157
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,490
fresh air if you do add an extraction

158
00:05:32,149 --> 00:05:36,109
fan keep in mind that as the air gets

159
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,060
sucked out of the room it is also going

160
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,189
to try to draw air into the room through

161
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,540
every open opportunity most of the time

162
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:43,160
you're going to get air pulled into the

163
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,080
room underneath the door most of us

164
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,120
don't seal the bottom of the door well

165
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:49,370
enough I feel like that is a great place

166
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,860
for fresh air to come in as long as the

167
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,600
air coming in is clean if that air is

168
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,699
coming from within your house it is

169
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,860
probably safe if that crack leads to

170
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:59,779
outside I would cover that up and find a

171
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,580
safer source for the air that's just

172
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:03,289
going to bring in bugs it's going to

173
00:06:01,579 --> 00:06:05,449
bring in whatever is by that door if

174
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,430
it's powdery mildew if it's just dirt

175
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:09,009
and dust it's going to suck all of that

176
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:11,449
right under the door into your grow room

177
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:13,159
so as soon as you cut a hole for an

178
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,990
extraction fan start thinking about

179
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,150
where the air is going to come in when

180
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,710
you start blowing that air out if you

181
00:06:17,149 --> 00:06:20,750
cut a hole in a wall and add an

182
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:23,500
extraction fan and blow that air out of

183
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,939
the room it may create a whistling noise

184
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,490
underneath the door from all the air

185
00:06:25,939 --> 00:06:30,469
flowing underneath that door if it

186
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,290
creates a big whistling noise you may

187
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:35,690
need to add a passive hole for air to go

188
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:37,610
into the room this just depends on the

189
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:39,829
size of the extraction fan that you set

190
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,430
up if you put a little 4-inch extraction

191
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,870
fan

192
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:42,889
you'll definitely pull enough air under

193
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,019
the door you don't need to make any

194
00:06:42,889 --> 00:06:47,000
passive holes if you go setting up an

195
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:48,919
8-inch vortex fan in there and you're

196
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,509
just blowing air out of that room first

197
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:52,610
of all I recommend a carbon filter on

198
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:54,740
that extraction fan that's going out you

199
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,990
need to filter that air but also you may

200
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,030
need to make about a 4-inch hole to

201
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:01,189
allow air to get into that room somehow

202
00:06:59,029 --> 00:07:04,009
you are sucking all of the air out you

203
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:06,050
need to allow fresh air in cutting holes

204
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,060
in walls and adding extraction fans can

205
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,280
lead to a lot of problems think about

206
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,189
this very carefully before you go this

207
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,659
route also if you're using co2 you may

208
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:16,040
want to think about this option because

209
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,600
then you're going to fill the room with

210
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,370
co2 and then you're just gonna use that

211
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,629
exhaust fan to suck the co2 right out of

212
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,699
the room you're kind of blowing your

213
00:07:20,629 --> 00:07:24,829
expensive gas right out the window

214
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:26,810
literally I've kind of opened up the

215
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:28,879
conversation for negative pressure

216
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,649
versus positive pressure in a grow room

217
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,990
environment but I feel like that is a

218
00:07:30,649 --> 00:07:34,699
lesson for the future I will write a

219
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,650
note and we will talk about that in a

220
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:38,719
future episode let's get a little bit

221
00:07:36,649 --> 00:07:40,669
more on track with this grow lesson and

222
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,040
focus let's talk a little bit about the

223
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,830
nutrients we may need at this phase of

224
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:47,629
the flowering cycle during this part of

225
00:07:45,829 --> 00:07:49,909
flowering we are mainly focusing on a

226
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:52,370
smooth transition from the vegetative

227
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,689
stage to the flowering phase at this

228
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,360
point in flowering we are mainly

229
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:58,790
focusing on a smooth transition from the

230
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,819
veg stage to the flowering stage of our

231
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:05,600
plant cycle week 2 is very similar to

232
00:08:01,819 --> 00:08:08,360
week 1 we will mainly focus on our NPK

233
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,090
we need a low nitrogen high phosphorous

234
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,670
high potassium diet at this stage I said

235
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:16,849
earlier abandon the veg bottle and start

236
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:18,890
using the bloom bottle also we need

237
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,800
cal-mag at this stage we also need

238
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:24,259
potassium silicates in my opinion I also

239
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,270
like to add a Maiko product some sort of

240
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:29,990
root product is always good at this

241
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:33,409
stage also enzymes and carbs are great

242
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,320
for week 2 as we work toward week 3 I

243
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:38,389
like to increase my carbohydrates the

244
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,490
plants are getting bud set at this point

245
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:42,409
they're going to start taking off I like

246
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:44,090
having some sugars in there to feed the

247
00:08:42,409 --> 00:08:45,620
microbes and then I like having the

248
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,629
carbs and the sugars in there to give

249
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,149
the plants energy that will encourage

250
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:51,919
rapid growth so at the beginning of week

251
00:08:50,149 --> 00:08:54,110
3 I will start increasing my

252
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:56,088
carbohydrate feeding just a little

253
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,730
bit and it will slowly increase that

254
00:08:56,089 --> 00:09:00,529
through the flowering phase now we don't

255
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,700
need to add a bloom booster yet we are

256
00:09:00,528 --> 00:09:03,528
not quite there yet

257
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,899
so let's just focus on getting these

258
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:07,759
plants through the stretch phase and get

259
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,649
the bud sites developed and then when we

260
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,069
work on the next lesson we will start

261
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:15,049
adding bloom boosters now we are rapidly

262
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,390
running out of time for pesticide

263
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:20,269
applications we need to do a very

264
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:22,129
thorough pest scouting and see what

265
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,839
we've got in the grow we may have thrips

266
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:25,519
we may have spider mites we could have

267
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
fungus gnats we could have white flies

268
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,240
there could be a myriad of problems

269
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,149
popping up at this point in the grow

270
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:34,430
let's do an inspection and find out what

271
00:09:32,149 --> 00:09:37,549
we're dealing with if you find any pests

272
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:40,278
now is one of your last times to apply a

273
00:09:37,549 --> 00:09:43,309
sprayed pesticide I don't like to spray

274
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:45,528
anything after day 14 if you've got an

275
00:09:43,309 --> 00:09:47,659
obvious problem we may extend that just

276
00:09:45,528 --> 00:09:49,309
a few days with very specific products

277
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:53,028
but I really don't like to spray

278
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:55,429
anything past day 14 so let's do a quick

279
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:58,490
scouting let's identify any problems we

280
00:09:55,429 --> 00:10:00,469
may have and let's spray before day 14

281
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,110
approaches at this point we're at day 8

282
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:05,839
so we can get two or three solid

283
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,419
pesticide spray applications in if they

284
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,120
are required if you don't identify any

285
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:13,789
pests I may still suggest a preventative

286
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,060
spray around day 14 just to make sure

287
00:10:13,789 --> 00:10:19,338
nothing pops up now is the time to get

288
00:10:17,059 --> 00:10:21,049
in there and identify pests and work

289
00:10:19,339 --> 00:10:23,329
really hard at getting rid of them

290
00:10:21,049 --> 00:10:25,849
before we move deeper into the flowering

291
00:10:23,328 --> 00:10:28,879
phase and we really limit ourselves on

292
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,528
pesticide applications this is also a

293
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:32,269
good time to start ordering your

294
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:35,059
predator bugs if you are going to use

295
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:37,610
biologicals as your pesticide treatment

296
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:39,828
if you plan on using biologicals think

297
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:42,320
about your spray applications and use a

298
00:10:39,828 --> 00:10:44,149
strategy that will not cause harm to

299
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,370
your beneficials when they do arrive

300
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:49,159
there are pesticides that you can apply

301
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:51,528
to your plants today and you can release

302
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:53,419
beneficial insects tomorrow and they

303
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:55,519
will work together if you apply the

304
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:57,289
proper pesticide you will not kill your

305
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,209
beneficials you will have to do some

306
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,799
research on the pesticide and the

307
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:03,259
beneficials and see if they get along

308
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:05,419
some of the pesticides are based on

309
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:07,700
pyrethrum some of them are based on neem

310
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:10,459
some of them are beneficial

311
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:13,220
and bacteria those beneficial fungus and

312
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,960
bacteria may not kill or disrupt your

313
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,149
predator bugs but it will make the

314
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:19,129
environment uncomfortable for the spider

315
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:21,319
mites because they intend to eat those

316
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:23,659
leaves the Predators are going to eat

317
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,670
the spider mites not the leaves so they

318
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:27,949
may be able to survive with certain

319
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:29,990
pesticides it's your responsibility as

320
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:32,180
the grower to do the research on the

321
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,730
pesticide you're going to apply and also

322
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:36,709
do research on the predator bugs which

323
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,470
you plan to use in your integrated pest

324
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:41,870
management strategy and find out if they

325
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,029
can work together some of the newer

326
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:46,970
pesticide and fungicide products

327
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:49,639
actually advertise safe for beneficials

328
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,470
or well not harm beneficials that is

329
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:53,269
saying that they recommend that product

330
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:55,700
in a garden that is also using

331
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:57,860
beneficial insects as a form of pest

332
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,629
management so let's get on top of pest

333
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,700
management let's do some scouting and if

334
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:03,200
you see anything now is the time to work

335
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,030
on getting rid of that before we get

336
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,860
deeper into flower now while you're

337
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:09,110
scouting for pests that is a great time

338
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,120
to keep an eye out for male plants if

339
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:13,519
you are growing from seed you've got the

340
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,560
opportunity to find males in your garden

341
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,419
you've also got the opportunity to find

342
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:20,209
hermaphrodites in the garden and you may

343
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:22,519
also find some mutants in your flowering

344
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:25,040
room the male plants are going to start

345
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:27,049
popping up around day ten they usually

346
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:29,509
open up and start dropping pollen right

347
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:31,609
around day 14 so we've got a very small

348
00:12:29,509 --> 00:12:33,470
window of time to discover these males

349
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,529
and get them out of the room before they

350
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:38,120
cause problems don't be lazy when it

351
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:39,709
comes to pooling males out of your

352
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,419
garden if you've got a small garden if

353
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,340
you've got a large garden you need to

354
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:46,189
look at every single plant and pull

355
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:47,540
every single male out of that grow you

356
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,270
also need to pay very close attention

357
00:12:47,539 --> 00:12:51,980
for hermaphrodites when you're checking

358
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:54,769
for males and hermaphrodites on new

359
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:56,750
plants check in several spots on each

360
00:12:54,769 --> 00:12:59,120
plant the top may not reveal

361
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,769
hermaphrodite traits down lower we're

362
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,159
not getting a lot of light penetration

363
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:06,079
those plants may show intersex traits

364
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,779
you may get male flowers popping up in

365
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,030
your female buds lower on the plant pay

366
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,620
close attention to the entire plant I

367
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:14,539
feel like I gave a pretty good

368
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:16,429
description of what a male plant looks

369
00:13:14,539 --> 00:13:18,919
like and what a female plant looks like

370
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:21,979
on a previous podcast but I do encourage

371
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:23,360
you to google male and female cannabis

372
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,000
plants and see what they look like

373
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,560
before the time comes that way when

374
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,659
you've got a boy in the garden you are

375
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:31,669
sure and you've got confidence and you

376
00:13:29,659 --> 00:13:33,769
can remove that male plant from your

377
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:36,079
garden confidently and know you are not

378
00:13:33,769 --> 00:13:37,970
going to cause any problems you want to

379
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,190
find the boys before the pollen sacks

380
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:42,019
start opening let's talk about what

381
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,030
happens if you find a boy and one of

382
00:13:42,019 --> 00:13:45,889
those sacks is starting to open the

383
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:48,559
first thing I would do is spray it with

384
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:50,389
water water deactivates pollen spray

385
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,869
that pollen with water you'll shut it

386
00:13:50,389 --> 00:13:53,360
down

387
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:55,789
also spray the girls with water if

388
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,379
you've got clean water around just spray

389
00:13:55,789 --> 00:13:58,639
some water on the plants yes I said we

390
00:13:57,379 --> 00:13:59,059
don't want to spray plants that are in

391
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,769
flower

392
00:13:59,059 --> 00:14:02,509
I'd rather get them a little bit wet at

393
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:04,429
this point then I would rather get

394
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:06,319
pollen on them also this is just water

395
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:08,029
there's no pesticide in here the plants

396
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,570
would get hit with rain it would get hit

397
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:10,610
with Dew

398
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:12,200
this is going to be just fine spray them

399
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:14,210
with some water that will deactivate the

400
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,220
pollen it will also make the plants

401
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,990
unable to receive the pollen at that

402
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,330
point you can either cut down that male

403
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,549
plant or you can slide up trash bag

404
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:24,889
right over it like a condom then cut it

405
00:14:22,549 --> 00:14:26,179
then get it out of the room is try not

406
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:28,069
to spread that pollen

407
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:29,689
I know we've sprayed it with water but

408
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,580
as you bump it around it's gonna open up

409
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,740
more pollens gonna come out do your best

410
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:35,690
not to spread that stuff hit it with

411
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,549
water put the trash bag over it either

412
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,070
take the whole plant including the dirt

413
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:42,049
out of the grow or cut it at the base

414
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,110
and just get that plant out of there as

415
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:47,209
soon as possible leaving a male plant in

416
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,460
the grow room for too long will result

417
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:51,650
in a seeded crop most of us are aiming

418
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:53,389
for a seedless crop if you were growing

419
00:14:51,649 --> 00:14:54,620
a crop for a commercial reason and

420
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:57,409
you're trying to put it out on the black

421
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,139
market a couple of seeds will ruin the

422
00:14:57,409 --> 00:15:02,149
value of your entire crop so don't be

423
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,889
lazy keep your eye out for males know

424
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:05,750
what males look like and get them out of

425
00:15:03,889 --> 00:15:07,819
the garden also keep an eye out for

426
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,889
hermaphrodites and get them out of the

427
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,960
garden once we are past weeks two and

428
00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,970
three you cannot get lazy if you're

429
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,680
growing from seed just because they look

430
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,690
like females you've still got the

431
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,699
opportunity for a hermaphrodite to pop

432
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:22,190
up all the way through the flowering

433
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,470
cycle it may not show itself until week

434
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,900
nine it may not show itself until week

435
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:29,180
ten but you need to see it if it does

436
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:31,189
happen I've said earlier if it pops up

437
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,169
late in flower it may not be a big deal

438
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:35,120
it is too late for the plants to receive

439
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:35,870
pollen it won't make any seeds that late

440
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,580
in the flower

441
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:40,070
and most of the time if they throw a

442
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,560
male flower past week seven or eight

443
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:44,330
they're usually sterile male flowers

444
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,579
that will not contain any pollen so

445
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,350
there's not much to worry about but if

446
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,200
you're getting hermaphrodites early in

447
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,820
flower they must be removed from the

448
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,589
garden all right we've got our

449
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,510
environment dialed in we know what to

450
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:58,160
feed our plants we are scouting for

451
00:15:56,509 --> 00:16:00,528
pests we have applied our final

452
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,778
pesticide application we have considered

453
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:04,820
releasing predator mites we know how to

454
00:16:02,778 --> 00:16:06,710
look for males and hermaphrodites we are

455
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,390
on the look for trouble we're looking

456
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,150
for bugs we're looking for males we're

457
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:13,278
looking for Herms now let's talk about a

458
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:15,528
few things we can do to improve the

459
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:17,720
quality of our garden this early in the

460
00:16:15,528 --> 00:16:20,000
flowering phase if you're running a

461
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,639
trellis or a scrog net now is a good

462
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,080
time to continue working those buds into

463
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,360
the net you can still work those

464
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,430
branches into the net I would stop doing

465
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,320
it probably toward the end of week three

466
00:16:28,429 --> 00:16:32,209
but you've still got time if you've got

467
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,010
a branch that's popping up too high feel

468
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:35,540
free to give it a little crack bend it

469
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:37,700
down under the net and work it into the

470
00:16:35,539 --> 00:16:39,469
canopy we can keep working on a nice

471
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,750
even canopy all the way through the end

472
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,310
of week three so let's keep popping them

473
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,289
let's keep twisting them and working

474
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:47,659
them into the canopy let's talk a little

475
00:16:45,289 --> 00:16:49,250
bit about popping and twisting I've

476
00:16:47,659 --> 00:16:51,259
talked a lot about popping and twisting

477
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,360
in the beginning of flower I continue to

478
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:56,240
do this all the way through weeks four

479
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,769
and five I will pop every stem right at

480
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,778
the beginning of flower give it about

481
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:01,789
two weeks to heal up and go back and do

482
00:16:59,778 --> 00:17:04,730
it again give it about two weeks to heal

483
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:06,558
up and go back and do it again so grab

484
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:08,689
the base of the stock grab it with your

485
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,490
other hand and twist your top hand and

486
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:12,529
as you twist you'll hear a little pop

487
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,838
that's exactly what you're looking for

488
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:17,000
as that heals it will create a knuckle

489
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:18,948
that knuckle will make a strong spot in

490
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,170
the plant I like to do that tour the

491
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:22,970
entire plant is covered in knuckles it

492
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:24,949
looks really knurled and I feel like

493
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:27,049
that that plant is very productive it's

494
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:29,210
got a nice thick stalk that can hold a

495
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,980
lot of weight it can hold fat buds it's

496
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,019
also got nice thick stalks that can move

497
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:35,120
a lot of water which can carry a lot of

498
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:37,819
nutrients so I feel like it is a very

499
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:40,369
beneficial thing to crack all of the

500
00:17:37,819 --> 00:17:41,720
stems so continue working your plants

501
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:43,699
into the trellis if you're using a

502
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,579
trellis continue cracking and popping

503
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:49,080
the sticks to make robust plants I also

504
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:50,428
like to do a bit of lolli popping if

505
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:52,500
you've got some crappy branches on the

506
00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:54,659
bottom of the plant feel free to remove

507
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,278
them if you've got branches that come

508
00:17:54,659 --> 00:17:58,230
off the very bottom of the plant and

509
00:17:56,278 --> 00:18:00,599
reach up toward the top and those top

510
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:03,028
branches the tops have potential to

511
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,158
create good usable buds you can clean up

512
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:07,648
the bottom suckers off of that long

513
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:09,480
branch and keep that arm and grow but at

514
00:18:07,648 --> 00:18:10,979
the end of the arm and take off all that

515
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,409
little crap at the bottom of it that you

516
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,169
don't need it is very common to see

517
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:17,490
plants that are 3 and 4 feet tall that

518
00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:19,230
are completely naked

519
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,640
for the first 18 inches of the very

520
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,409
bottom it's just a bunch of sticks

521
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,788
coming out of the pot you don't have any

522
00:18:22,409 --> 00:18:25,230
foliage you don't have any little

523
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:28,288
branches you don't have any tiny bud

524
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:30,210
sites for 18 inches to maybe even 2 feet

525
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:32,099
off the ground depending on the growers

526
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,230
environment and the growers style and

527
00:18:32,099 --> 00:18:35,668
what type of lights they are using so

528
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:37,409
feel free to get in there and cut out

529
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,360
any shitty branches that aren't going to

530
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,220
be productive and feel free to clean up

531
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,129
all that stuff real down-low on the

532
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,808
plant that's not going to get any light

533
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,850
when harvest time comes we're going to

534
00:18:45,808 --> 00:18:50,129
have to trim everything we cut down if

535
00:18:47,849 --> 00:18:52,288
you cut all that little fluffy crap off

536
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,309
the plant you don't have to trim it now

537
00:18:52,288 --> 00:18:54,960
you're saying yeah I could have used

538
00:18:53,308 --> 00:18:56,940
that for concentrates or something right

539
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,679
if you cut it all off the bottom we can

540
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,740
move that energy right up to the top of

541
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:03,090
the plant instead of growing that crappy

542
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,250
little fluff at the bottom we just

543
00:19:03,089 --> 00:19:07,199
basically moved that up to that top Cola

544
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,869
to make all those top buds just that

545
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,389
much heavier that much fatter that much

546
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:14,158
more density so clean up any crap on the

547
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:16,079
bottom that may be slowing your plants

548
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:18,028
down and move that energy right up to

549
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:21,629
the top now another thing I find

550
00:19:18,028 --> 00:19:23,099
advantageous is defoliation there's a

551
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,980
lot of debate in the cannabis industry

552
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:28,829
about how to do foliate what level to do

553
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,899
foliate and when to defoliate I like to

554
00:19:28,829 --> 00:19:33,058
do kind of a hard defoliation right at

555
00:19:30,898 --> 00:19:35,369
the start of flower if there is a large

556
00:19:33,058 --> 00:19:37,619
leaf shadowing another branch or

557
00:19:35,369 --> 00:19:39,839
shadowing another bud site I will remove

558
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:41,518
that leaf without question then I'll go

559
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,189
through the grow and anything with the

560
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,740
purple pee daeul gets removed at the

561
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:48,538
very start of flower I do this in a

562
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,880
commercial environment for several

563
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:53,460
reasons removing all of those extra

564
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,559
leaves removes opportunity there are

565
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,690
less places for pests to hide and there

566
00:19:55,558 --> 00:20:01,379
are less places for pathogens to hang

567
00:19:57,690 --> 00:20:03,900
out so remove the opportunities also

568
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,330
is humidity in the room about as many

569
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,280
leaves doing as much transpiration and

570
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:10,109
respiration there's a little bit less

571
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:12,059
moisture in the room so it makes it

572
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:14,579
easier to balance the humidity in the

573
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:17,369
room I also think a well-timed

574
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:20,279
well-executed defoliation will increase

575
00:20:17,369 --> 00:20:21,689
the vigor of our plants now a lot of

576
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:23,129
people will say you don't want to pull

577
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:24,630
off the leaves because that's where the

578
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,510
sugars are stored and they're going to

579
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:29,340
use that for nutrients and energy but we

580
00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:30,960
are feeding the [ __ ] out of these plants

581
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:32,730
they don't need to use anything that is

582
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,650
stored we are pouring expensive

583
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:37,680
nutrients into these plants on a daily

584
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:39,810
basis don't worry about the stuff stored

585
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,299
in those leaves we're gonna replace that

586
00:20:39,809 --> 00:20:44,190
right away another argument to the

587
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:46,379
defoliation is that those leaves are

588
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:48,660
used as solar panels and they need to be

589
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,000
there yes they do but there is a point

590
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,070
where sometimes a leaf is blocking a bud

591
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,569
site where if you remove that leaf it

592
00:20:53,069 --> 00:20:56,849
would be more beneficial to put the

593
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:59,399
light closer to the bud then on that big

594
00:20:56,849 --> 00:21:02,250
ol solar leaf so selectively remove your

595
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,200
leaves if you're new at defoliating go

596
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:06,420
in and just tear off a few leaves and

597
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,580
see how the plants react then the next

598
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:11,370
time take off a few more and see how the

599
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:14,609
plants react this will be very strain

600
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:17,069
dependent sativa leaning strains won't

601
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:20,579
react as well as indica leaning strains

602
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:22,769
will react to heavy defoliation another

603
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:25,109
thing I'll recommend is leave those two

604
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:27,720
leaves at the top of the bud you'll have

605
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:29,219
one bud your main top sticking up then

606
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,200
at the top of that there are two leaves

607
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:32,640
sticking out when you look in the grow

608
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,980
room you'll see the two leaves I'm

609
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,410
talking about I like to leave those on

610
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,759
every plant those two mains that are

611
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,740
sticking out of the top of the main bud

612
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:43,440
I like to leave those until late in

613
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:46,710
flower but quite often those will be the

614
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,590
only large leaves I leave on every plant

615
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,569
so I recommend a semi heavy defoliation

616
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:53,549
here at the beginning of flower then

617
00:21:51,569 --> 00:21:56,179
we'll do it again around week four and

618
00:21:53,549 --> 00:21:58,680
we'll do it again around week six

619
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,350
defoliating and cracking and twisting

620
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:03,390
and working into trellis work is kind of

621
00:22:01,349 --> 00:22:06,059
an art you will have to get good at this

622
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:09,060
over time which will require confidence

623
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,669
so don't be scared just get in there and

624
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:14,869
learn how to do it you are going to make

625
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:17,058
mistakes I have made countless mistakes

626
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:19,039
in my own Gro I've made mistakes in

627
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:20,869
commercial grows I have made tiny

628
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,089
mistakes and I have made huge mistakes

629
00:22:20,869 --> 00:22:26,389
but you know what that's how I became a

630
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:29,959
good grower experience includes mistakes

631
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:32,180
don't be afraid to make mistakes this is

632
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,789
not the last crop you are going to grow

633
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,039
this is a practice crop the next one

634
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:38,839
will be your pro crop don't act like

635
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,879
these plants are the last plants are

636
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:43,579
ever going to get to touch this is your

637
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,290
first time this is your second time have

638
00:22:43,579 --> 00:22:47,240
some confidence build some confidence

639
00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:48,889
let's just get in there and break some

640
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,230
[ __ ] and ruin some [ __ ] so that you can

641
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,420
see what can go wrong then the next grow

642
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:55,279
will be really easy so don't be afraid

643
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:57,019
to wreak some [ __ ] don't be afraid

644
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,170
because some problems that's how you

645
00:22:57,019 --> 00:23:02,240
learn things if every grow goes smoothly

646
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:04,160
for you you're going to think growing is

647
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,319
easy and you're not gonna learn anything

648
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,029
then your ego is gonna get in the way

649
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,889
and that's when you're really gonna run

650
00:23:08,029 --> 00:23:12,230
into problems and then you will have no

651
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:14,059
idea how to solve them so my point is

652
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:15,860
don't be scared just get in there and

653
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:18,109
play with the plants you may kill one

654
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:20,269
you may kill two but you will learn what

655
00:23:18,109 --> 00:23:22,789
they can take these plants are way more

656
00:23:20,269 --> 00:23:24,470
resilient than you would imagine if this

657
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:26,240
is your first grow if this is your

658
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:27,350
second grow you're probably touching

659
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,259
those plants like there are delicate

660
00:23:27,349 --> 00:23:31,849
little babies when you see me in a

661
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:34,039
commercial environment you're going to

662
00:23:31,849 --> 00:23:36,169
think I am an abusive odor to these

663
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,269
plants but then at the end you will see

664
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:40,460
the highest quality most beautiful buds

665
00:23:38,269 --> 00:23:41,900
come out of these plants that I kind of

666
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,299
beat up through their whole life I

667
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,460
really care for the plants I really have

668
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,349
a passion for the garden sometimes I'm

669
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:50,299
going really fast and I don't have time

670
00:23:48,349 --> 00:23:52,399
for [ __ ] and I need to get a lot of

671
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:54,079
stuff done in a small amount of time and

672
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,580
sometimes I get a little rough and

673
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,740
sometimes it looks like I'm being

674
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:59,990
aggressive and I am but at the end of

675
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:01,970
the day the plants show me that they

676
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,740
were satisfied with what I did these

677
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,569
plants are used to being outside growing

678
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,220
on a hill these plants are used to being

679
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:09,200
stuck in one place and can't walk away

680
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:10,880
when [ __ ] gets weird they've been in the

681
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,679
wind they've been in the rain they've

682
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,840
been beat up by Nature some of them

683
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,750
probably got peed on by a goat cannabis

684
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:19,639
plants are amazingly resilient plants

685
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,140
and they can take some abuse so lets

686
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,640
abuse them let's beat them up a little

687
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:23,750
bit and see what they can take because I

688
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,120
think when we push them to their limits

689
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,950
that's when we see their full potential

690
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:29,329
so don't be afraid to get in there and

691
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:31,909
break some [ __ ] you guys this is not

692
00:24:29,329 --> 00:24:33,888
going to be your last crop I understand

693
00:24:31,909 --> 00:24:35,899
that seeds and clones are very expensive

694
00:24:33,888 --> 00:24:38,058
and that this crop means a lot to you

695
00:24:35,898 --> 00:24:40,759
but if you can take one plant and

696
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:42,829
dedicate it to experiments you can learn

697
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:45,859
a whole lot from that one plant and

698
00:24:42,829 --> 00:24:47,689
still produce a very viable crop so if

699
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:49,250
you're new and defoliation if you're new

700
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:51,380
at popping and twisting if you're new at

701
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,359
cracking the stems maybe just pick one

702
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,278
plant be fully at the crap out of one

703
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,648
plant and then don't do the others and

704
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,869
pay attention to what happens something

705
00:24:57,648 --> 00:25:01,908
very important to note here take a lot

706
00:24:59,869 --> 00:25:04,278
of notes when you're doing experiments

707
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:06,200
like this write down what you did to

708
00:25:04,278 --> 00:25:08,329
plant a write down what you did to plant

709
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,788
B and then take great notes of the

710
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:13,099
outcome that is a great way to have

711
00:25:10,788 --> 00:25:14,480
documentation to find out if the

712
00:25:13,099 --> 00:25:16,939
techniques and methods you were using

713
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,038
work for your garden and work for you

714
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:21,139
and work for the specific strain which

715
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,869
you are growing I've said it before but

716
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:26,719
most of us growers are also consumers

717
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:29,599
which means sometimes we may forget some

718
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,909
details write some [ __ ] down and you

719
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:34,009
will not forget that way when the end

720
00:25:31,909 --> 00:25:36,799
comes and plant B is way better than

721
00:25:34,009 --> 00:25:38,990
plant a you know exactly what you did to

722
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:41,960
make plant B stand out from the crowd

723
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:44,149
then we can repeat that then we can

724
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,058
improve upon that and have a better

725
00:25:44,148 --> 00:25:48,768
garden each and every time so feel free

726
00:25:47,058 --> 00:25:50,298
to experiment with one or two plants in

727
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:52,759
the garden until you develop confidence

728
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:55,278
and while you're experimenting make sure

729
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:56,509
to take notes now the next thing I want

730
00:25:55,278 --> 00:25:59,659
to talk about before we start wrapping

731
00:25:56,509 --> 00:26:01,579
up the show is bulbs and lighting as we

732
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:04,370
approach the third week of flower it is

733
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:06,349
time to remove our metal halide bulb and

734
00:26:04,369 --> 00:26:09,319
start using the high-pressure sodium

735
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:11,148
bulb if you're using an LED it's time to

736
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:14,509
switch from the blue to the more red

737
00:26:11,148 --> 00:26:16,518
spectrum if that is an option I like to

738
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:19,129
leave my veg bulbs in for the first

739
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:21,769
couple of weeks of flower because I find

740
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:24,049
it helps reduce the stretch for the

741
00:26:21,769 --> 00:26:26,298
first 21 days of flower our plants are

742
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:28,220
going to take off and stretch extremely

743
00:26:26,298 --> 00:26:30,589
fast they're going to get really tall

744
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,450
proper nutrients will help reduce the

745
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,388
stretch the right amount of phosphorus

746
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,399
and potassium will reduce the stretch

747
00:26:34,388 --> 00:26:39,378
also I feel like keeping in the blue

748
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:41,279
light the metal halide light for the

749
00:26:39,378 --> 00:26:43,919
first two weeks of flower will

750
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,680
help keep the plants short and squat and

751
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:49,320
bushy now we are approaching the end of

752
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:51,810
the stretch phase it is time to swap out

753
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,579
that blue bulb for the yellow orange

754
00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:55,740
reddish bulb which would be the

755
00:26:53,579 --> 00:26:57,659
high-pressure sodium so if you have not

756
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,670
already changed out your bulb or hit the

757
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:02,460
switch on your led to change into the

758
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,470
flowering mode now is the time to swap

759
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,799
out those bulbs or hit that switch I

760
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:10,620
wouldn't wait any later than day 21 to

761
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:12,180
change my flowering spectrum any later

762
00:27:10,619 --> 00:27:14,309
than that we start hitting a point of

763
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,650
diminishing returns we do reduce the

764
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:18,569
stretch but we also reduce the bulking

765
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,640
when it comes time to develop buds

766
00:27:18,569 --> 00:27:23,339
all right podcast rolled I feel like we

767
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,780
are caught up on weeks 2 &amp; 3 we've got

768
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:27,000
our nutrients covered we've got our

769
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:29,009
environment dialed in we've added a fan

770
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,930
we have applied our final pesticide

771
00:27:29,009 --> 00:27:33,000
applications we have released our

772
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,039
predators if we're going to do so we're

773
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,690
going to continue popping the stems

774
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,700
we're gonna continue working the tall

775
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:41,549
plants into the trellis we're going to

776
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:43,529
keep deep foliated hopefully you have

777
00:27:41,549 --> 00:27:45,629
selected a plant to do some experiments

778
00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:48,329
on and you were taking good notes we are

779
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:50,550
well into the flowering cycle we do need

780
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:53,759
to continue keeping our eyes open for

781
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:56,940
males and hermaphrodites and mutants as

782
00:27:53,759 --> 00:27:58,379
well as pests and pathogens hopefully we

783
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,390
haven't made any nutrient mistakes

784
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:02,280
hopefully we haven't had any pH issues

785
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:03,750
if we haven't had any light leaks we're

786
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,579
developing bud set it looks like

787
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,039
dandelions forming on the tips of all of

788
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:09,509
our plants hopefully we have removed all

789
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:10,769
of the males from the room we're still

790
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:13,529
keeping an eye out for males and

791
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:15,240
hermaphrodites and mutants now as long

792
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:17,430
as we don't run into any equipment

793
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,829
failures or human errors we are well on

794
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:22,019
our way to a great harvest

795
00:28:19,829 --> 00:28:23,909
all right podcast world I feel like that

796
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:27,779
is a great spot to wrap up this lesson

797
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:30,120
on weeks 2 &amp; 3 or days 8 through 21 of

798
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:32,099
the flowering phase I want to thank you
