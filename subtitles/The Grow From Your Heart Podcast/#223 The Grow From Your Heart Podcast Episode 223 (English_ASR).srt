new strain name i bred Flo to arise and

34
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,428

00:01:29,718 --> 00:01:33,528
me straight names I've gotten a lot of

36

great contributions there have been some

37
00:01:33,528 --> 00:01:36,168
really good ones I'm not gonna read any

of them off because I don't want to read

39
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:39,349
some and not read some and just feel

40
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,968
like I'm leaving people out but I feel

41
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:44,380
like I've got a good idea of what that

42
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:46,519
strain will be called when it's released

43
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:48,138

outstanding audio equipment yes I have

127
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,259
got some tremendous gear I've got

128
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,478
several different ways to record my main

129
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,419
setup is a spaceship looking device over

130
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,399
here some insight into that I guess I

131
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:49,019
used to be a drummer I'm still a drummer

132
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,549
but I used to be a traveling drummer and

133
00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:53,848
a recording drummer my job was to play

134
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:57,870
the damn drums I am using a Macky 1402

135
00:04:53,848 --> 00:05:00,839
VL z3 mixer it was purchased to be my

136
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:02,579
drum mixer this used to be this was on

137
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,098
stage for several shows the drums would

138
00:05:02,579 --> 00:05:06,719
be plugged into this the mics run mics

139
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:08,819
to the drums and then plug those into

140
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,440
this you know plug-in drums I know the

141
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:12,598
mic cords would run to this mixer I

142
00:05:10,439 --> 00:05:13,800
would mix all the sound with this mixer

143
00:05:12,598 --> 00:05:15,598
right here then run it to my in-ear

144
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,978
monitors and then run that out to the

145
00:05:15,598 --> 00:05:19,079
house mix and I would run all the other

146
00:05:16,978 --> 00:05:20,550
instruments into here and run them in my

147
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:22,500
in-ear monitor so that I could hear them

148
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,848
as I wanted I can control my own monitor

149
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,089
mix I never had to deal with the sound

150
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:28,680
guy blowing out my ears ah it was much

151
00:05:27,089 --> 00:05:31,408
easier that way but so I've got the

152
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,870
Mackie the Mackie runs to a dbx

153
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:36,959
compressor and then the dbx compressor

154
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,209
runs to a task cam the u.s. 1200 USB

155
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,589
which runs into the macbook so yes there

156
00:05:39,209 --> 00:05:42,508
are some stuff going on to make it sound

157
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:44,429
pretty good we've got a pretty nice

158
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:46,229
preamps in the Mackie and then the

159
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,939
tascam I do

160
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:49,228
it's got preamps in it that sound pretty

161
00:05:47,939 --> 00:05:50,069
good and then I turn up the gain just a

162
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:52,529
little bit right there

163
00:05:50,069 --> 00:05:53,968
and then I used the dbx to kind of just

164
00:05:52,529 --> 00:05:55,679
filter out all the noise and make it

165
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:57,269
sound smooth so thanks for the audio

166
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,769
compliment that's how I do it a lot of

167
00:05:57,269 --> 00:06:02,579
people ask how I make the show sound so

168
00:05:58,769 --> 00:06:03,810
good that's how it's a task cam USB 1200

169
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:05,370
a dbx compressor

170
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,769
I've also got a livewire power

171
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,168
conditioner in here just because I'm

172
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:12,089
that's part of my recording setup and my

173
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:13,408
traveling tour set up and all that [ __ ]

174
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:15,598
I'm used to seeing it so I put it in

175
00:06:13,408 --> 00:06:17,189
here when I set this up and gives me

176
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:18,899
another spot honestly I use that plug

177
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:20,310
for the power conditioner i plug in my

178
00:06:18,899 --> 00:06:22,109
iphone right there a whole bunch so it's

179
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,490
super damn convenient anyway that's how

180
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,408
the show sounds so good then I run it

181
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:27,750
into GarageBand it's just going into the

182
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:30,269
old GarageBand GarageBand 6 nice and

183
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,949
easy to edit at the end I don't do

184
00:06:30,269 --> 00:06:33,329
anything to it to make it sound better

185
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:34,379
at the end it doesn't get ran through

186
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,180
anything I could run it through

187
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:37,348
levelizer or something like that but I

188
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,459
don't I just let it go

189
00:06:37,348 --> 00:06:39,629
just like it isn't post-its

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,080

00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:20,299
that means when you're trimming and

327
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:22,338
you've just been trimming and trimming

328
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:24,019
and trimming for hours we've got people

329
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,179
that we paid a trim and they trim for

330
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:28,188
eight hours a day and that looks like

331
00:11:26,178 --> 00:11:29,778
Jail so with if you're in trim jail or

332
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:31,759
if you're driving driving is where I

333
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:34,399
listen to most of my podcasts or if

334
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:36,470

welcome

for sharing the knowledge I I don't feel

339
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:45,979
like it would be safe to learn this much

340
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,629
and not spread it somehow that's like my

341
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:49,730
return I've been given a couple of gifts

342
00:11:47,629 --> 00:11:50,659

star reviews up here alright you guys

365
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,659
let's move forward with the show a

366
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:34,159
little bit at the top of the show I told

367
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:37,188
you that I was going to talk a little

368
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:40,338
bit about 7/10 and the meaning and of

369
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:42,828
course the origin of the phrase 7/10 if

370
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:45,829
you don't know what 710 is 710 is the

371
00:12:42,828 --> 00:12:48,588
dad smoker holiday 7/10 is when you're

372
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:51,769
supposed to smoke hash 7/10 is the new

373
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:54,350
4/20 that's a phrase coined by my friend

374
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:57,318
Adam ill he always says 7/10 is the new

375
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,720
4/20 and I agree with him so what is

376
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,669
7/10 all about I'll take a few seconds

377
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,459
here and explain it to you obviously if

378
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:08,208
you turn the number 710 upside down it

379
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:11,208
says oil so 7/10 became the time to

380
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:14,599
smoke oil that's that's fairly obvious

381
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:15,739
so everybody was smoking weed at 4:20

382
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,269
and then all the

383
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,639
hache craze came along and everyone

384
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:21,049
started taking dabs and so somebody and

385
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,809
we'll talk about who in just a couple of

386
00:13:21,049 --> 00:13:25,729
seconds somebody decided that 7:10 since

387
00:13:23,809 --> 00:13:27,859
it was oil upside-down 710 in the

388
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,019
evening or if you're like me 710 in the

389
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,210
morning or both if you're like me I

390
00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:32,949
guess was the best time to smoke some

391
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:37,100
dabs

392
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:39,259
so 7:10 upside down or oil upside down

393
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,560
is 710 that's pretty much where it

394
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:45,830
originated now one thing I can tell you

395
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:49,279
is that 710 is not the temperature of

396
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,840
your email a lot of people said 710 is

397
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,000
the perfect temp for your email it may

398
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:54,830
be for your email but it is not for all

399
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,409
emails and I'm gonna rant for a second

400
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:59,180
on why think about this you've got an

401
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:01,819
email with the box with a number on it

402
00:13:59,179 --> 00:14:04,009
that is sending something down a cable

403
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,830
to a coil that is attached to a nail

404
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:09,019
that has got to heat up now your box

405
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,180
that has a number on it doesn't know if

406
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:13,189
you just put that coil on a quartz nail

407
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:15,259
on a titanium nail or if you wrapped it

408
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,750
around your finger all it knows is that

409
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:20,720
that coil needs to heat up to about a

410
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,879
specific temperature range there is not

411
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,279
in most emails that I am aware of there

412
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:27,649
is not a thermostat in that coil it is

413
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,839
sending a frequency an amount of

414
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:31,669
electricity through that coil and that

415
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,220
much power at the end of it is causing

416
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:36,349
that much heat it is not it's not like a

417
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:39,019
range on your stereo it's not a specific

418
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:40,610
measurement it's just like you know that

419
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:42,829
when your car when you turn the car

420
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:44,750
stereo up to 23 it sounds good if you go

421
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:46,220
up to like 29 it starts to crackle a

422
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,029
little bit when you hit 32 it sounds

423
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,290
like total [ __ ]

424
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:52,699
so each email will have its own

425
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:55,730
adjusting range where it will be perfect

426
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:58,040
and not all of them will dial in at 710

427
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:00,289
my email that I use from giddy up in the

428
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:01,939
Gmail depending on which nail I put on

429
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:04,819
it I need to adjust it anywhere from

430
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,270
around 600 to 800 if I use the

431
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:10,100
highly-educated the and which one is

432
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:12,919
that it's the H nail it's just the old

433
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,710
school email insert if I use that one ah

434
00:15:12,919 --> 00:15:17,899
that one I need to put it down in the

435
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:20,030
like 650s if I use the new one with a

436
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:21,799
quartz dish in that big titanium shroud

437
00:15:20,029 --> 00:15:24,199
I have to crank that [ __ ] up

438
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,569
closer to 800 because all the extra

439
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:29,000
stuff the bit the nail head is much

440
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,540
bigger so your box your email box

441
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,089
doesn't know

442
00:15:29,539 --> 00:15:34,189
know the surface on the the temperature

443
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:36,199
on the surface of the nail so that is

444
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:38,329
not true a lot of people think that 710

445
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:39,649
is the center the temperature on the

446
00:15:38,328 --> 00:15:41,208
surface of the nail that's inaccurate

447
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:43,009
sorry I stuttered so many times trying

448
00:15:41,208 --> 00:15:46,250
to say that I think I got my point

449
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:49,009
across so that is not what 710 means

450
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,620
what 710 means is oil upside down and

451
00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,169
it's time to take a dab now let's talk a

452
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,698
little bit how it originated I want to

453
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:58,429
give a shout out to somebody I feel is

454
00:15:55,698 --> 00:16:01,159
highly responsible for many advances in

455
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:03,588
our current hash culture in the 7-10

456
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:06,860
movement in dab culture and our ability

457
00:16:03,589 --> 00:16:09,740
to smoke dabs a true innovator he's a

458
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:12,528
musical artist he makes titanium nails

459
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:14,509
he now makes quartz nails he was the

460
00:16:12,528 --> 00:16:17,389
originator of the email of course I owe

461
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:19,730
a huge shout out to task rock of highly

462
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:22,850
educated titanium big shout out much

463
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:25,370

464
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:28,129
rock and the guy from health Stone glass

465
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,339
and the guy from BHO clothing came up

466
00:16:28,129 --> 00:16:35,028
with the idea for 710 and task rock is

467
00:16:31,339 --> 00:16:37,279
the person who coined the phrase 710 so

468
00:16:35,028 --> 00:16:39,318
a big shot at the task happy 7/10 to

531
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:12,429
couple of days ago ladies and gentlemen

532
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:15,980
a lot of us use pesticides in our garden

533
00:19:12,429 --> 00:19:17,890
if you work in Colorado Washington or

534
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:21,349
Oregon or any of the states that have

535
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:23,509
regulated legalized cannabis grows there

536
00:19:21,349 --> 00:19:26,539
are lists of pesticides that you are and

537
00:19:23,509 --> 00:19:28,039
are not allowed to use now those

538
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,200
pesticides have been approved or

539
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:32,629
disapproved for multiple reasons

540
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:36,169
mainly anything approved for tobacco has

541
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,179
been approved for use on cannabis among

542
00:19:36,169 --> 00:19:42,500
amongst the things that have been

543
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:44,600
approved for cannabis is as a trawl you

544
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,398
were allowed to use as a trawl and a

545
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:49,969
recreational grow if used a prop

546
00:19:46,398 --> 00:19:51,529
appropriately excuse me I'm trying to

547
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:52,860
cough off that dab without coughing into

548
00:19:51,529 --> 00:19:56,038
the mic too much

549
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:58,168
okay so as the trawl we've trusted and

550
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,298
has a trawl we trust in the Department

551
00:19:58,169 --> 00:20:01,860

552
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:04,589
in these companies to put things in the

553
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:08,099

refrain from using it Oregon Department

587
00:21:24,808 --> 00:21:28,589
of Agriculture's actions came following

588
00:21:26,638 --> 00:21:31,168
an investigation of the product and

589
00:21:28,589 --> 00:21:33,148
laboratory analysis found the presence

590
00:21:31,169 --> 00:21:34,769
of the pesticide active ingredients and

591
00:21:33,148 --> 00:21:39,538
there's a bunch of words in here I'm a

592
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:44,750

claw claw pepero sclera peripheral i'm

595
00:21:48,778 --> 00:21:51,148
gonna try you guys i'm gonna sound this

596
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,778
out like it did in school

597
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:56,518
clora pie riff boasts chlorpyrifos

598

601
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:03,149
know what that is to tell you the honest

602
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:06,089
truth but none of which were listed on

603
00:22:03,148 --> 00:22:09,569
either product label so we are trusting

604
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:11,939
companies to package to make a product

605
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:14,189
and package a product and print a label

606
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,590
on the product and be honest with us and

607
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:18,210
tell us what they are selling us we rely

608
00:22:16,589 --> 00:22:19,859
on them for that because we've been take

609
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,110
these products that are approved by the

610
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:25,158
Department of Agriculture and we apply

611
00:22:22,109 --> 00:22:28,339
them to our plants then they are tested

612
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:31,200
because they are tested by the meb and

613
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:33,209
private labs test these plants before I

614
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,798
so if I work in a commercial girl I'm

615
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,259
sure you guys know that by now I am the

616
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,440
production the cultivation manager for

617
00:22:37,259 --> 00:22:45,629
Three Rivers dispensary Three Rivers

618
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:48,360
Development I apply pesticides to plants

619
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:50,220
with worker protection safety training I

620
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:52,319
am pesticide safety trained I understand

621
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,950
what I'm doing I understand when and how

622
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:58,379
to apply a pesticide I applied these

623
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:02,190
pesticides to my crops before I am

624
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:05,130
allowed to pass these crops from my grow

625
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:07,860
to the retail end they must be tested by

626
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:10,528
a laboratory for pesticide residuals for

627
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:13,528
mold residuals for contaminants for they

628
00:23:10,528 --> 00:23:15,390
test for so much [ __ ] now they are going

629
00:23:13,528 --> 00:23:17,640
to find because of this company lied

630
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,559
they're going to find things that I

631
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,450
can't pronounce that are not allowed to

632
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:23,428
be in there because this company put

633
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:26,069
them in the bottle and did not say that

634
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:28,320
it was there so now there are going to

635
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:31,109
be crops that will have to be destroyed

636
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,879
and there will be businesses that don't

637
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:34,798
make money there will be patients that

638
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,409
don't get medicine this is gonna just

639
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,240
[ __ ] up a lot of that's gonna snowball

640
00:23:37,409 --> 00:23:40,919
this isn't just one small thing this

641
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,750
company the company that made the

642
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:44,909
pesticide isn't gonna be the only one to

643
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:47,429
get [ __ ] and honestly the patients

644
00:23:44,909 --> 00:23:49,140
that consumed any of the medicine that

645
00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:51,419
was sprayed with this by the people that

646
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,759
did not know it was in there they're

647
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,500
really the ones getting [ __ ] so

648
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:56,700
there's more to this pesticide advisory

649
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,130
newsletter that went out and I'll

650
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,319
continue to read it I think I stopped

651
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:04,289
right about here in an in an abundance

652
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,210
of caution a statewide stop sale use or

653
00:24:04,288 --> 00:24:08,339
removal order has been issued by the

654
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,829
Oregon Department of Agriculture to pbi

655
00:24:08,339 --> 00:24:12,148
Gordon Corporation of Kansas City the

656
00:24:10,829 --> 00:24:14,609
order calls for the company to

657
00:24:12,148 --> 00:24:16,288
immediately cease all sales offers of

658
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:16,709
sale or other distribution of the

659
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,388
product

660
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,850
in Oregon so they can no longer sell

661
00:24:18,388 --> 00:24:22,888
this product in Oregon I honestly think

662
00:24:20,849 --> 00:24:25,138
it's been banned in the Colorado amed

663
00:24:22,888 --> 00:24:27,209
use for quite a while anyway I haven't

664
00:24:25,138 --> 00:24:28,979
seen as a trawl in a grow I haven't used

665
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:31,230
as a trawl on a grow in quite a while I

666
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:33,179
think as a Max in Evergreen have been

667
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,769

668

00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:46,499
about how to use it it is very cost

673
00:24:44,579 --> 00:24:48,868

680
00:25:01,128 --> 00:25:07,019

682
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:10,378
on with this letter it also says

683
00:25:08,339 --> 00:25:11,908
retailers and the general public in

684
00:25:10,378 --> 00:25:14,189
possession of as at all products

685
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:16,769
manufactured by PBR Gordon Corporation

686
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:19,919
are advised not to sell offer for sale

687
00:25:16,769 --> 00:25:21,659
or distribute them Oda will be working

688
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:23,759
with the manufacturer to determine the

689
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:25,759
appropriate disposition of product that

690
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,169
is currently in commerce or with growers

691
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:30,028
OTAs investigation will proceed to

692
00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:31,799
address violations of Oregon's pesticide

693
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:34,019
law which include misbranding of a

694
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:36,418
pesticide product adulteration of a

695
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:38,368
pesticide product and making false or

696
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,009
misleading claims about a pesticide

697
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:42,990
product for additional information and

698
00:25:41,009 --> 00:25:44,220
there is a number to contact the Oregon

699
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,048
Department of Agriculture I'm not gonna

700
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,879
give out their phone number here at my

701
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:51,359
podcast that may result in trolling and

702
00:25:47,878 --> 00:25:52,678
we don't need that but ladies and

703
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,538
gentlemen if you're using as a trawl

704
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,940
because you think it is semi safe and

705
00:25:54,538 --> 00:25:57,929
it's much more gentle than a lot of

706
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,730
products that are out there I would

707
00:25:57,929 --> 00:26:01,710
recommend as a trawl before a lot of

708
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:03,450
things if you're using as a trawl you

709
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:05,730
may want to reconsider if you've got a

710
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,679
whole bunch of it I might not want to

711
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,720
use it for a little while until they get

712
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,519
this figured out and find out which

713
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,710
batches were adulterated

714
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:14,909
I know pesticides are expensive and if

715
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:16,679
you've got a bunch of this stuff for

716
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:19,049
your commercial girl or whatever it's

717
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:21,360
gonna be hard to set that money aside

718
00:26:19,048 --> 00:26:22,679
and buy another product but you've got

719
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:24,148
some thinking to do and if you're in

720
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,590
Oregon you can't use it at all

721
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:27,479
and if you're in Colorado I don't think

722
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:30,028
you're able to use it if you're using as

723
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,589
a trawl and you can't replace it just

724
00:26:30,028 --> 00:26:32,960
run

725
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,609
soon and when you do run out by a Xamax

726
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,929
that's and just don't buy anymore as a

727
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:38,509
child no matter what state you're in I

728
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,500
wouldn't risk it because you're thinking

729
00:26:38,509 --> 00:26:42,109
you're giving one thing and they're

730
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:45,079
selling you another don't risk it just

731
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:47,028
go get a Xamax or evergreen or get them

732
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:48,589
both and switch between asthmatics and

733
00:26:47,028 --> 00:26:50,659
evergreen and that'll really solve your

734
00:26:48,589 --> 00:26:52,399
problem anyway it's always a good idea

735
00:26:50,659 --> 00:26:53,630
to switch up pesticides anyway because

736
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,730
your bugs will start building a

737
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:57,080
resistance so if you hit them one day

738
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,490
with a Xamax and then you hit him the

739
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:59,689
next time with evergreen and then you

740
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,490
hit him with that as a max the next time

741
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,778
they're not gonna know what to just do

742
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,970
so you're just gonna hit him with

743
00:27:02,778 --> 00:27:06,980
multiple modes they'll get the least

744
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,450
resistance and then your pesticides will

745
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,429
continue to work so that's my advice

746
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,288
you're rid of the as a trawl bison has a

747
00:27:10,429 --> 00:27:14,298
max by a little bit of evergreen and

748
00:27:12,288 --> 00:27:15,890
then you'll be clear and then also try

749
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:18,950
some uh grande Evo in the mix there

750
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:20,570
you should be pest free hopefully all

751
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:22,610
the other products we're trusting are

752
00:27:20,569 --> 00:27:24,319
putting in the bottle what we think

753
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:26,629
they're putting in there because this is

754
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,970
a little this is the second time we've

755
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:30,919
heard about a product being adulterated

756
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,169
and making people fail tests so

757
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,538
hopefully it doesn't happen again if you

758
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:37,220
were in the pesticide industry stop

759
00:27:35,538 --> 00:27:38,690
[ __ ] around come on quit lying to us

760
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:41,028
I'm sure there are huge fines and [ __ ]

761
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,600
involved in this because this is uh it

762
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:46,548
says on the bottom include misbranding

763
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:48,769
of a pesticide product adulteration of a

764
00:27:46,548 --> 00:27:50,450
pressed pesticide product and making

765
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:52,339
false or misleading claims about a

766
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:53,798
pesticide product that sounds like

767
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:55,970
important [ __ ] that could probably be

768
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:57,980
some federal [ __ ] but I don't know

769
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:01,519
anyway let's move away from that and

770
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:03,079

00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,720
I was hoping you would be able to steer

810
00:29:17,619 --> 00:29:23,019
us in the right direction as far as

811
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:25,509
areas to avoid and possibly areas to

812
00:29:23,019 --> 00:29:27,940
look into all right now it's hard to

813
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:29,680
give honest advice and opinions about a

814
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,570
place when you've got negative things to

815
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,830
say and you've got to live here and I'm

816
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:34,480
sure that a lot of people already know

817
00:29:32,829 --> 00:29:36,250
what I'm gonna say so we'll get right to

818
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,140
it if you come here and you plan to move

819
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:40,180
here I would not recommend you move to

820
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:42,190
the east side every towns got it's

821
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:44,500
shitty side and the east side has a

822
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:46,539
reputation for being the shitty side of

823
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,099
town so yes there are good things on the

824
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:50,230
east side we've got a really cool skate

825
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:52,299
park there is good [ __ ] over there but

826
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,309
certain parts of the east side you do

827
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:56,529
not want to [ __ ] around in there are

828
00:29:54,309 --> 00:29:59,440
also parts of the west side that I would

829
00:29:56,529 --> 00:30:01,180
not recommend you [ __ ] around in other

830
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,490
than that most of the town is pretty

831
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,920
cool it kind of depends on your

832
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,930
preference and your income and if you're

833
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,340
trying to buy or if you're trying to

834
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:12,039
rent it kind of depends on what you're

835
00:30:09,339 --> 00:30:14,919
looking to do if you want to be right

836
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:16,569
downtown that's not too bad it's going

837
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,039
to be a little more expensive and you're

838
00:30:16,569 --> 00:30:19,659
not gonna have any parking but that's

839
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:21,609
how it goes wherever you live downtown

840
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,610
so that's an option if you want to be

841
00:30:21,609 --> 00:30:27,250
away from the people I would recommend

842
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:29,619
Pueblo County like unincorporated Pueblo

843
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,140
County the grow rules are different

844
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:34,989
taxes are cheaper if you want something

845
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,670
a little more it's kind of a little more

846
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:39,910
privacy a little newer a little more

847
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:41,470
modern there's another City it is 15

848
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:43,300
minutes west of Pueblo and it's called

849
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:46,420
Pueblo West that's a cool little spot

850
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:48,220
you can get really big giant houses out

851
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,779
there with a little more space it's a

852
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,610
little more expensive than Pueblo but

853
00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:54,369
it's also cleaner safer and nicer

854
00:30:51,609 --> 00:30:56,979
there's less traffic and it's more of a

855
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:59,589
little upscale kind of a vibe amore

856
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,120
if kind of a community one thing I can

857
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:03,879
complain about pueblos is there's no

858
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,250
[ __ ] food here around nine o'clock if

859
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,960
you're hungry after 8:30 nine maybe ten

860
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:09,789
o'clock good luck

861
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,340
there's no food to be had here there are

862
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:13,720
those shitty burrito places those places

863
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:16,029
that they have everywhere the Mexican

864
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,140
food places that are open late but if

865
00:31:16,029 --> 00:31:19,359
you're like me you don't really prefer

866
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,590
that there's one place around here that

867
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,899
I will eat at this a little Mexican

868
00:31:20,589 --> 00:31:24,369
place it closes at nine o'clock so most

869
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:27,940
of the food shuts down there's not a lot

870
00:31:24,369 --> 00:31:29,319
of good food chains here that's it but

871
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,640
they're coming those things are coming a

872
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:32,289
lot of people talk a lot of [ __ ] about

873
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,059
Pueblo Colorado but it is really

874
00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:35,918
changing and cannabis is really putting

875
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,960
a big change on this place cannabis

876
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,059
brings business business brings money

877
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,250
money brings people people bring more

878
00:31:40,058 --> 00:31:44,349
money it's making a huge change here but

879
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:46,359
anyway I would stay off the east side if

880
00:31:44,349 --> 00:31:49,000
you're trying to move here as parts of

881
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:51,178
the West siders shitty decent places the

882
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:53,558
south side is pretty cool it's mellow

883
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:55,330
Regency is not a bad area it's

884
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:57,369
affordable the houses are a good size

885
00:31:55,329 --> 00:31:58,750
it's not too far from schools and

886
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:00,369
shopping and everything it's right off

887
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:02,079
of Pueblo Boulevard so you can get

888
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:05,289
everywhere quickly it's not too far from

889
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,480
I 25 and highway 50 Regency is a pretty

890
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:09,759
decent area

891
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,410
um I think University Park on the north

892
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,269
side is a pretty nice area it's a little

893
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,160
more expensive the north side is cool El

894
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:16,869
Camino on the south side if you're

895
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:19,298
looking to buy a house El Camino is a

896
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:20,558
good area to buy a semi large house

897
00:32:19,298 --> 00:32:22,750
right now because a lot of people are

898
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,548
moving out and they're upgrading to

899
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,980
larger houses leaving the houses in El

900
00:32:24,548 --> 00:32:29,168
Camino available I talked about Pueblo

901
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,819
West I talked about the county those are

902
00:32:29,169 --> 00:32:33,759
the notes I wrote down for housing

903
00:32:30,819 --> 00:32:35,889
recommendations in Pueblo if Pablo is

904
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,450
too small a lot of people feel trapped

905
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,890
in a small town like this there's not a

906
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,750
lot of food here there's not a lot of

907
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,190
options here it's kind of uh it's an

908
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,319
older town with a different type of

909
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:45,720
mentality that is evolving it's getting

910
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:48,009
there but it's not quite there yet

911
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,419
people ask me why I don't leave here

912
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,279
it's because I'm proud of it and I see

913
00:32:49,419 --> 00:32:52,720
potential and I see what's coming and

914
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,789
I've been here for so long that I feel

915
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,450
like I can't abandon the city that let

916
00:32:54,789 --> 00:33:00,789
me be me I've Forrest as a person here I

917
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:02,620
really became what I am here in Pueblo

918
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:04,089
Colorado so I can't abandon this place

919
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:06,099
I'm watching it becomes something and

920
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:07,569
I'm proud of this little place but if

921
00:33:06,099 --> 00:33:09,789
it's not for you I understand that if

922
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:10,839
it's too small for you if it's too it's

923
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,430
not your thing I get that

924
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:14,439
a lot of people leave here there's a

925
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:16,120
slightly aggressive vibe here we've got

926
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,980
a steel mill and [ __ ] like that

927
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:20,169
it's just a different vibe it's it's a

928
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,150
hard working steel toe boots leather

929
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:24,759
jacket kind of a vibe here with a lot of

930
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:26,500
the community so it's not for a lot of

931
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:29,920
people if you're into a bigger city

932
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,930
Colorado Springs is really cool it's a

933
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,820
little more military vibe but it's got

934
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,890
more stuff you can get food after nine

935
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:37,419
o'clock it's got all of the restaurants

936
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,780
you can think of they're there all the

937
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,070
stores they're all there a lot of the

938
00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:45,339
Pueblo stores are kind of we get the

939
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:47,409
smaller version of all the stores but

940
00:33:45,339 --> 00:33:49,929
that's just that's just small [ __ ]

941
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:52,300
complaints anyway let me move on with

942
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:54,100
this email because there's more to it he

943
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:55,990
also says also while there's no shortage

944
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:58,209
of dispensaries where I'll be the last

945
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:59,950
time I visited quality varied widely

946
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:01,809
from location to location

947
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:05,559
well it's your current recommendation

948
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:07,299
for best quality well obviously since I

949
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,190
work for Three Rivers I'm going to say

950
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:11,769
that I would recommend you go to Three

951
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,690
Rivers in Pueblo Colorado and you shop

952
00:34:11,769 --> 00:34:14,829
on the recreational side excuse me I'm

953
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:17,470
trying to burp into the microphone again

954
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:18,940
hey when you walk into Three Rivers you

955
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:20,649
can go left or you can go right there

956
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,630
are two windows to walk to the left

957
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:23,829
window is recreational the right window

958
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:26,559
is medical if you don't have a medical

959
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:28,150
card anybody 21 and over with an ID can

960
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:30,759
shop over there on the recreational side

961
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:32,590
there is great product there that

962
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:34,180
product is not grown in my facility that

963
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:36,130
product is grown by a good friend of

964
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:37,899
mine and I trust that product I know who

965
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,190
grows that I know how it's grown it's

966
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,079
grown with the same methods and

967
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,240
techniques as my grow just in another

968
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:45,369
building so I would recommend three

969
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:48,569
rivers that's in Pueblo if you can't

970
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:51,609
make it to Pueblo I would check out the

971
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:53,440
recreational side of kind love in Denver

972
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:54,910
that's one of the best dispensaries I

973
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,619
honestly don't have a lot of other

974
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:58,449
recommendations in Denver because I

975
00:34:56,619 --> 00:35:00,670
don't shop at dispensaries I don't go to

976
00:34:58,449 --> 00:35:02,889
a lot of dispensaries because I'm mostly

977
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,809
self defit self self deficient is almost

978
00:35:02,889 --> 00:35:06,429
what I said I'm mostly self-sufficient

979
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:08,259
and I don't have to do a lot of shopping

980
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:11,259
if I do shopping I just go buy extracts

981
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:14,410
and I usually go to apothecary for that

982
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,270
ah but quality will vary and that's one

983
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:18,399
strange thing is from batch to batch

984
00:35:16,269 --> 00:35:20,530
from vendor to vendor stuff will be so

985
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,809
different sometimes and sometimes it's

986
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:24,180
hard to predict so I think your best bet

987
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:26,039
would be to go to

988
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:28,519
three rivers and go to the recreational

989
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:31,588
side there or go to kind love in Denver

990
00:35:28,519 --> 00:35:34,889
and get products there because in

991
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:36,690
Colorado Springs it is all medical

992
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:37,858
product it looks like you're gonna be in

993
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,690
Boulder your email says that you're

994
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:42,328
going to Boulder I am not too familiar

995
00:35:39,690 --> 00:35:44,670
with dispensaries in Boulder I would

996
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:46,589
recommend going to weed Maps download

997
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:47,970
weed maps on your phone open up weed

998
00:35:46,588 --> 00:35:49,529
maps and check out the reviews on

999
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:50,939
dispensaries and then if there's a

1000
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:52,470
certain strain you're looking for or

1001
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:55,230
something maybe that'll help you decide

1002
00:35:52,469 --> 00:35:57,209
which dispensary to go to but often

1003
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:58,800
times you can tell when you drive by a

1004
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:01,829
dispensary if it's somewhere you want to

1005
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,289
go here's a weird if you get a feeling

1006
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:06,630
at a dispensary like [ __ ] this place or

1007
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:08,009
oh I don't know you don't have to shop

1008
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:10,619
there you can leave there are a lot more

1009
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:12,869
to go to so you'll get a feeling that's

1010
00:36:10,619 --> 00:36:15,000
usually it's just like the same way that

1011
00:36:12,869 --> 00:36:16,650
people choose their liquor stores or

1012
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,568
their bar that they drink at or whatever

1013
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:19,230
we choose our dispensaries very

1014
00:36:18,568 --> 00:36:21,269
similarly

1015
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:22,650
you just get a vibe you go in you either

1016
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:24,210
love it or hate it and if you love it

1017
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,119
you go back if you hate it you don't go

1018
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,500
back so check them out don't go into one

1019
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,088
and don't be afraid to walk out without

1020
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,858
spending anything should be alright man

1021
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:33,808
I don't see what I was looking for and

1022
00:36:31,858 --> 00:36:35,489
they may act weird to you they may act

1023
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:37,890
like you wasted their time but you did

1024
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:39,149
not waste anybody's time you found out

1025
00:36:37,889 --> 00:36:40,379
what you needed to find out which is

1026
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:42,108
their products or not what you need

1027
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,430
you're not required to spend anything

1028
00:36:42,108 --> 00:36:46,469
you don't you're not expected to spend

1029
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:48,179
money if you go to Target or Walmart you

1030
00:36:46,469 --> 00:36:49,529
can walk in and not find what you want

1031
00:36:48,179 --> 00:36:52,019
and then you can leave you can do the

1032
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:53,430
same thing at the dispensary so while

1033
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:54,949
you're in Boulder check them out Gillen

1034
00:36:53,429 --> 00:36:57,118
weed maps get some recommendations

1035
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:59,460
alright there's more to the email he

1036
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,309
says assuming I get a Colorado license

1037
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:04,409
right away how long is the process for

1038
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:06,839
getting a medical marijuana card so when

1039
00:37:04,409 --> 00:37:09,420
you move here you'll get an ID all you

1040
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:11,519
need is that ID and then immediately you

1041
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,470
can go to the marijuana doctor the

1042
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,298
hardest part of that may be setting the

1043
00:37:13,469 --> 00:37:16,709
appointment some places can get you in

1044
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:18,690
right away some doctors are pretty

1045
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:21,119
backed up it just depends on if you can

1046
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:23,190
find a place to get you in some places

1047
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,108
they'll get you in that day if they get

1048
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:27,269
you in that day they will fill out your

1049
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:28,920
paperwork for you online if you can do

1050
00:37:27,269 --> 00:37:30,568
an online registration which I'm sure

1051
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,338
you can it just takes a couple of clicks

1052
00:37:30,568 --> 00:37:34,858
you will have your medical marijuana

1053
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:37,230
card within 48 hours when I did it my

1054
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:37,949
card was approved and I was able to

1055
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:41,159
digitally print

1056
00:37:37,949 --> 00:37:43,739
my renewed card within 24 I was 12 hours

1057
00:37:41,159 --> 00:37:45,420
later honestly I turned it in at like 2

1058
00:37:43,739 --> 00:37:47,309
o'clock in like 2 o'clock that morning I

1059
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,680
got an email saying hey you've got your

1060
00:37:47,309 --> 00:37:52,230
card so it shouldn't be too long I don't

1061
00:37:49,679 --> 00:37:54,868
think for a brand new card registering

1062
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:57,000
online I think it could be like is

1063
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:58,410
quickly from having your license getting

1064
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,539
the doctor appointment may be the hard

1065
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:02,219
part once you see the doc I think 48

1066
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:04,650
hours from there you should have a card

1067
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:06,449
I can't promise you that but for a

1068
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,039
renewal that's all it took for a brand

1069
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:10,949
new card I don't think it should be much

1070
00:38:08,039 --> 00:38:13,230
longer then to wrap up the email our

1071
00:38:10,949 --> 00:38:14,819
friend zombie says obviously I'd love to

1072
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:17,010
