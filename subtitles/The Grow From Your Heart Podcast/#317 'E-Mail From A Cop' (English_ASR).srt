33
00:01:08,078 --> 00:01:12,158
lit up I may have eaten too many edibles

34
00:01:09,998 --> 00:01:14,078
I may have taken too many dads but I am

35
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,118
back on my feet I'm ready to do a

36
00:01:14,078 --> 00:01:17,798
podcast I like to start the episode off

37
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,899
by letting you know what I am dabbing on

38
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,030
today I dabbed a little bit of

39
00:01:19,899 --> 00:01:23,259
everything but what's gonna happen is

40
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,909
I'm gonna tell you about this then I'm

41
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:26,618
gonna press pause and take a DAB and

42
00:01:24,909 --> 00:01:28,539
then we're gonna do a podcast I'm about

43
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:31,328
to take a dab of some stuff called

44
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:32,920
Clementine cookies from viola extracts I

45
00:01:31,328 --> 00:01:35,708
picked this up at doctor's orders on

46
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,990
stem Beach doctor's orders was having a

47
00:01:35,709 --> 00:01:39,459
sale on the green dot black label and I

48
00:01:37,989 --> 00:01:42,669
stopped in for some of the green dot I

49
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:44,319
saw the viola Labs products on sale they

50
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:46,719
had a jar on the counter and it was

51
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,490
called Clementine cookies I took a smell

52
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:50,348
of it and before I could set the jar

53
00:01:48,489 --> 00:01:52,539
down my mouth said I'll take a gram of

54
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:54,189
this please this stuff smells amazing

55
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:56,950
you guys I'm gonna give it a sniff right

56
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:58,778
now and try to describe it to you so I

57
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,668
can certainly smell the Girl Scout

58
00:01:58,778 --> 00:02:02,918
cookies Girl Scout cookies has a

59
00:02:00,668 --> 00:02:05,200
spiciness to it I think it's got a black

60
00:02:02,918 --> 00:02:06,218
pepper kind of a spicy sort of a thing

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,990
that's a little bit of a sharp

62
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:10,299
astringent sort of a smell which is

63
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:11,769
honestly delicious and I love it that is

64
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:13,870
dominant in the aroma of this

65
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:15,370
concentrate but right under that there's

66
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,590
a

67
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,459
this candy sweet bottom from the

68
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,239
Clementine

69
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:26,469
it's like spicy delicious oranges and it

70
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,420
smells amazing the amount of Terps to

71
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:31,539
Crystal's was perfect in here I think it

72
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:33,848
was probably 70% crystals and 30% turps

73
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:36,039
I really like the texture of it the

74
00:02:33,848 --> 00:02:38,348
flavor was super nice the high was

75
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,598
amazing it came on super fast and it

76
00:02:38,348 --> 00:02:42,639
went right to my head right to my eyes

77
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:45,039
it made my eyes feel all droopy I made

78
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:46,899
my head feel all fuzzy I guess I would

79
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,639
describe it more of a stoned

80
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,200
than a high cuz I just wanted to chill

81
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,449
out I just wanted to stare into nothing

82
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:54,068
for a couple of minutes so this was kind

83
00:02:52,449 --> 00:02:56,500
of an impulse buy and I am completely

84
00:02:54,068 --> 00:02:59,619
satisfied with the Clementine cookies

85
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,239
live resin from viola extracts great

86
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:03,158
work you guys now since I've hyped it up

87
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,408
so much I think I'm going to press pause

88
00:03:03,158 --> 00:03:08,669
and take a big fat dab and then we're

89
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:11,259
gonna come back with an email from a cop

90
00:03:08,669 --> 00:03:13,449
all right podcast ruled I am back I am

91
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:15,548
heavily medicated I just took a fat dab

92
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:17,798
of the Clementine cookies live resin

93
00:03:15,549 --> 00:03:19,629
from viola extracts it tastes better

94
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,819
than I remembered and the high went

95
00:03:19,629 --> 00:03:23,680
straight to my brain one thing I did

96
00:03:21,818 --> 00:03:26,469
notice I took the dab off of a rig with

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,049
a smaller mouthpiece I am learning that

98
00:03:26,469 --> 00:03:30,848
I prefer a larger flared out mouthpiece

99
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:32,500
to little of a mouthpiece if you have to

100
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:34,418
make that kissy face with your mouth I

101
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,909
feel like it makes your lips all sticky

102
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:39,219
if you take a large dab so larger

103
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,900
mouthpieces for larger dabs that's my

104
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,598
opinion that's my advice I still want a

105
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,000
small rig but a flared out wider

106
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,500
mouthpiece for Less stickiness in my

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,900
moustache and on my teeth

108
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:52,209
alright you guys I'm obviously heavily

109
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,129
medicated before I took this dab break I

110
00:03:52,209 --> 00:03:56,409
teased that we were gonna read an email

111
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:58,719
from a cop and you might say how do you

112
00:03:56,409 --> 00:04:00,969
know it's from a cop well I was checking

113
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:04,180
my email a few days ago and I saw the

114
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:05,949
subject line greetings from a cop so I

115
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,840
skipped everything else I was working on

116
00:04:05,949 --> 00:04:09,760
and I scrolled right down and I opened

117
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,098
up the email from my new cop friend and

118
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,048
it goes just like this it says hey Rasta

119

everything on stitcher or iTunes I'll

138
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:54,310
keep going with the email it goes like

139
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:56,370
this I wanted to tell you a little bit

140
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,839
about myself and my current situation

141
00:04:56,370 --> 00:05:01,509
first off I will tell you that I am a

142
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:03,909
police officer prior to becoming a cop I

143
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:06,490
used to regularly like everyday smoke

144
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:10,240
cannabis from about 16 to 22 years old

145
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:12,550
at age 22 I decided to stop a series of

146
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,160
positive events led to my becoming an

147
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:17,918
officer I told myself I would never be a

148
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,050
hypocrite I would never arrest or ticket

149
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,389
someone for something that I would do

150
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,699
like smoking weed rolling stop signs

151
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:26,860
driving too fast etc but I would be

152
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,139
happy to arrest people for beating their

153
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,240
wife breaking into houses shooting

154
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:34,150
others abusing children you see where

155
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,098
I'm heading I can honestly say I sleep

156
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:38,560
just fine knowing I don't break my

157
00:05:36,098 --> 00:05:40,269
personal code I kind of feel if more

158
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,550
police officers had this approach to

159
00:05:40,269 --> 00:05:44,709
their job that more people would respect

160
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,360
the police and the community would get

161
00:05:44,709 --> 00:05:49,500
along with the police a little bit

162
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,970
better I don't feel that law enforcement

163
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
understands the long-term effects of

164
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,690
their harassment and some of the things

165
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,360
that they do to the community sometimes

166
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:59,860
a person will have an interaction with

167
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,110
law enforcement and they will receive a

168
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,939
ticket for something that they don't

169
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:05,199
agree with and then they've got to go to

170
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,538
court which means they've got to miss a

171
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,879
day of work or they've got to pay a fine

172
00:06:07,538 --> 00:06:11,288
which means now they're even more behind

173
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:13,930
because not all of us are doing okay

174
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:16,658
financially so those people fall behind

175
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,069
financially they get a fine if you've

176
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:20,019
got the option of paying your car

177
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:21,639
payment or paying your rent or paying

178
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,810
that fine you're gonna pay the rent the

179
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,098
car payment because you don't see what

180
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,389
happens if you don't pay the fine now

181
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:27,399
you've got a bench warrant now you go to

182
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,810
jail while you're in jail you lose your

183
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:30,370
car while you're in jail you lose your

184
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:32,199
job while you lose your job you lose

185
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,899
your house and it begins a spiral of

186
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:35,710
[ __ ] and I don't know if law enforcement

187
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:38,500
realizes what they do to people

188
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:39,629
sometimes and when things could simply

189
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,550
be

190
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:42,930
excused or overlooked if nobody's

191
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,879
hurting anybody I don't see a reason

192
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,379
there's no crime if nobody's getting

193
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,939
hurt if nobody's causing a problem

194
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:50,519
there's no reason to [ __ ] up somebody's

195
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,589
life and so I respect an officer they

196
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:54,689
can use situational awareness and

197
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:56,459
judgment and not cause a problem for

198
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:58,379
somebody so man a lot of respect to you

199
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:00,299
for that thank you I appreciate you for

200
00:06:58,379 --> 00:07:01,920
that not all cops are bad we got to keep

201
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,629
that in mind I want to keep reading the

202
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,600
email because I'm super rambley after

203
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:08,279
the dabs I just took the email goes on

204
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,590
to say about two years ago I had a

205
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:12,599
terrible injury at work fighting a man

206
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,310
that I was arresting after investigating

207
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,580
how he had molested a three year old boy

208
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:21,089
and I have had three major surgeries and

209
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:22,529
five giant needle injections man that's

210
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:24,479
a huge sentence there's a lot of stuff

211
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:26,669
to to absorb in that one so you had a

212
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:29,819
terrible injury at work fighting a man

213
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,379
that you arrested because he had

214
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,259
molested a three-year-old boy so that's

215
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:35,850
a lot of mental stuff to deal with first

216
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:38,009
of all you know that this man was doing

217
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,689
some terribleness and you had to arrest

218
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:41,370
him and then when that went down he

219
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,529
tried to physically fight you where you

220
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,480
got injured and it changed your life and

221
00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:46,829
since then you've had three surgeries

222
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:49,140
probably all three of those are

223
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:53,459
traumatic and five giant needle

224
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,870
injections saying the phrase five giant

225
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:57,000
needle injections makes my toes curl

226
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,530
every time I say it so it sounds like

227
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,879
you've been through a lot man it sounds

228
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:01,259
like you're going through a lot and it

229
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,449
sounds like you were trying to be a good

230
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:05,339
cop so that's terrible that this is sort

231
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:06,870
of the pan you were dealt for being a

232
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:08,789
good cop I want to keep reading your

233
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,189
message it says obviously I was given

234
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:13,470
opiate pain pills like they were candy

235
00:08:11,189 --> 00:08:15,569
and they led me into a deep dark place

236
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:17,220
I've heard this story a lot and I kind

237
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:19,620
of know how that goes it seems like a

238
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,630
lot of people get injured a lot of good

239
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:23,280
folks get injured they go to the doctor

240
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:25,379
they end up getting put on these pills

241
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,839
and it turns their life around it's not

242
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,579
the injury it's not the depression it's

243
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,589
not the change of life it's the pills

244
00:08:29,579 --> 00:08:34,319
that these doctors are giving people it

245
00:08:31,589 --> 00:08:36,509
seems to send them down a dark path he

246
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,640
continues to say really not fun and I'm

247
00:08:36,509 --> 00:08:39,240
glad to be alive on this side of pain

248
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,580
pills

249
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,370
after nearly a year and a half of either

250
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:46,950
24/7 pain or opiate induced stupor

251
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:49,080
I got a CBD vape this is where the story

252
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,690
starts to change you guys I used that

253
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,129
for about a week and decided eff it give

254
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,380
me the real thing

255
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:57,509
so this guy was in pain he was in an

256
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,068
opiate induced stupor

257
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:00,990
this guy wasn't himself anymore he

258
00:08:59,068 --> 00:09:03,269
probably wasn't enjoying life his family

259
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,430
probably wasn't enjoying him he wasn't

260
00:09:03,269 --> 00:09:07,620
happy anymore he was just a zombie

261
00:09:05,429 --> 00:09:09,958
because of these doctors just pumping

262
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,909
him up with pain pills so he got himself

263
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:13,349
a CBD vape and it sounds like it was

264
00:09:11,909 --> 00:09:15,629
working for a little bit and then he

265
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:16,860
decided eff it give me the real thing

266
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:19,230
and that's where he goes on to say

267
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,318
cannabis has literally saved me from

268
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,810
pills cannabis has about the same pain

269
00:09:22,318 --> 00:09:26,549
relieving qualities as pills but

270
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:28,948
cannabis does not leave me depressed

271
00:09:26,549 --> 00:09:32,818
after I can say the biggest side-effect

272
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:34,469
I see is the munchies see the biggest

273
00:09:32,818 --> 00:09:36,299
side effect which isn't even I don't

274
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:38,550
believe in side effect I think that is

275
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:40,139
an effect because you can't separate the

276
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:41,939
effects of something if you just said

277
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:44,009
what does it do to you he says it makes

278
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,019
me stoned it makes me forget things it

279
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:47,459
makes me kind of chill out it also makes

280
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,139
me hungry that's an effect not a side

281
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:53,129
effect in my opinion sorry random rant

282
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:55,198
but the worst effect he got from it was

283
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:56,669
the munchies and for somebody who has

284
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:58,469
been laid up for a little while and

285
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:00,000
who's been in pain and who has been on

286
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:01,470
narcotic pills that are making them a

287
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,269
zombie um

288
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,490
the munchies probably isn't a bad thing

289
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:07,560
you're probably a little emaciated you'd

290
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,169
probably use a couple of snacks honestly

291
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,059
but also he says that the cannabis does

292
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,009
not leave him depressed like the pain

293
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:15,659
pills did and also they're not doing a

294
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:17,068
liver damage they're not doing kidney

295
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:19,169
damage and they're not making you a

296
00:10:17,068 --> 00:10:21,419
zombie they're leaving you functional

297
00:10:19,169 --> 00:10:23,849
you've got the munchies that's not too

298
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:25,588
bad as long as you're not handling those

299
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:27,600
munchies with cartons of Ben and Jerry's

300
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:29,220
ice cream and Snickers bars as long as

301
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,740
you're treating that properly maybe you

302
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,420
got some some avocado slices or some

303
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,159
hard-boiled eggs maybe you got you some

304
00:10:33,419 --> 00:10:36,539
hats on a log maybe you got some celery

305
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,409
and peanut butter with raisins on it

306
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:38,338
like a big kid

307
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:40,379
I don't know hopefully you're doing

308
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,720
something good to take care of those

309
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:44,100
munchies but that's if that's the worst

310
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,540
effect that's coming from it and you're

311
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,310
not getting depressed you're not getting

312
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:48,958
your liver torn up you're not getting

313
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:50,489
your stomach burnt up and you're not

314
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,859
acting like a zombie and you're

315
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,720
functional eat whatever you want to eat

316
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,409
maybe you get you a little gut you're

317
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,750
gonna be alright

318
00:10:55,409 --> 00:10:59,730
he keeps on going and says I recently

319
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,589
started growing my own cannabis I can't

320
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,320
really do much physical activities due

321
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,030
to my injury but I am able to guard it

322
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,820
I really think that growing your own

323
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,149
cannabis is going to help you in so many

324
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,010
ways

325
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:12,870
it'll be very therapeutic because now

326
00:11:11,009 --> 00:11:14,490
you've got something you can do that

327
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:16,500

face it puts some pride in me it makes

385

blame that on the viola extracts here to

403
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:49,379
be quite honest I had a traumatic brain

404

injury a couple maybe three years ago

405
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:53,429
and there were times I couldn't figure

406
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:54,958
out how to tie my shoes there were times

407
00:13:53,429 --> 00:13:56,309
I'd be brushing my teeth and couldn't

408
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,750
figure out why I was standing in the

00:13:56,309 --> 00:13:59,429
kitchen with her in the bathroom see I'm

410

the bathroom with a mouthful of weird

412
00:14:00,659 --> 00:14:04,469
[ __ ] there were times when the thought

413
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:06,028
of ending everything would pass through

414
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,320
my mind but I knew that it was just cuz

415
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:09,809

00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:24,389
about law enforcement my question is now

450
00:15:21,778 --> 00:15:26,129
that you have personally experienced the

451
00:15:24,389 --> 00:15:29,220
healing qualities and properties of

452
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:32,028
cannabis are you going to or have you

453
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:34,009
been educating your fellow on for

454
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:35,750
have you been advocating in any way

455
00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,549
saying hey guys we may be looking at

456
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,490
this all wrong have you done anything

457
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:42,919
like that um it's not your duty you've

458
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,839
done your duty trust me but it would be

459
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:46,819
cool if you could say some things like

460
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,920
that to some of your cop friends maybe

461
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,449
don't even approach them maybe just

462
00:15:48,919 --> 00:15:51,528
bring it up you know when you're at

463
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:52,250

message on Instagram and somebody was

482
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,500
asking me what is the difference in the

483
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:36,349
way that medical and recreational

484
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,360
cannabis are grown here in Colorado they

485
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,639
said what's the difference if any and my

486
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,649
answer was pretty simple I said there's

487
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,500
no difference you guys a lot of people

488
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:47,629
think that medical marijuana is grown in

489
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:50,740
some fancy laboratory and it's done in

490
00:16:47,629 --> 00:16:52,970
some magical mythical way but honestly

491
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:56,659
medical marijuana and recreational

492
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:58,940
marijuana in Colorado are grown in very

493
00:16:56,659 --> 00:17:01,429
similar facilities I can speak from

494
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,709
experience I am the lead cultivator for

495
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:05,838
Three Rivers I run their medical

496
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:08,000
marijuana facility and I run their

497
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,009
recreational marijuana facility there

498
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,078
are two different buildings but they are

499
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:12,558
simply across the parking lot from each

500
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,539
other

501
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:16,548
okay it's building right here building

502
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:18,168
right here I run from one building to

503
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:21,769
the other all day taking care of two

504
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:24,199
different groves now they are the same

505
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:26,568
strains of plants but they are not the

506
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:28,880
same plants the plants in the medical

507
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:30,619
grow cannot enter the recreational grow

508
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,900
the plants at the recreational grow

509
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:34,849
cannot enter the medical grow they are

510
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,620
to be kept separate at all times it is

511
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:38,449
two different business licenses with two

512
00:17:36,619 --> 00:17:40,668
different names two different entities

513
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:42,259
just owned by the same people so I

514
00:17:40,669 --> 00:17:43,450
bounce back and forth and run both of

515
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:45,730
them now

516
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:48,130
now as for the facilities the buildings

517
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:52,179
are constructed and designed fairly

518
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:55,179
similarly we're using long tables from

519
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:57,370
Midwest as at Midwest hydro or Midwest

520
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:59,350
greenhouse supply some company like that

521
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,479
makes long rolling tables we've got

522
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:03,398
those tables in both facilities we've

523
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:05,620
got double-ended Gavita lights in both

524
00:18:03,398 --> 00:18:07,268
facilities we've got giant HVAC in both

525
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:09,428
facilities we've got the auto water

526
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:12,788
system in both facilities both

527
00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:15,100
facilities are fed the exact same mix we

528
00:18:12,788 --> 00:18:16,839
don't buy this brand of nutrients for

529
00:18:15,099 --> 00:18:18,939
this facility in this brand of nutrients

530
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:20,678
for this facility we buy a whole [ __ ]

531
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:23,139
ton and put it in the warehouse and then

532
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:26,620
divide it up amongst each grow as needed

533
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:28,629
so it's the same tables the same lights

534
00:18:26,619 --> 00:18:30,879
it's the same nutrients it's the same

535
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:33,820
master grower it's the same grow Tech's

536
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,940
it's the same trimmers it is the same

537
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:39,460
trellis technique it is mostly the same

538
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,679
genetics so when a grow is started in

539
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,240
Colorado depending on how it started the

540
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:47,019
plants have to come from somewhere right

541
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,990
if the license if the recreational

542
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:53,079
license is spawned from an existing

543
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:55,179
medical marijuana license there is an

544
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:58,599
opportunity for a one-time plant

545
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:01,028
transfer so that means if I own a

546
00:18:58,599 --> 00:19:02,888
medical marijuana facility and I would

547
00:19:01,028 --> 00:19:05,319
like to convert my medical marijuana to

548
00:19:02,888 --> 00:19:06,939
have a recreational marijuana side of my

549
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:08,528
store which means everybody can shop

550
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,600
they're not just Colorado medical

551
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:14,138
patients I would be allowed to do a

552
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:16,148
one-time transfer to my grow which means

553
00:19:14,138 --> 00:19:19,148
I would be allowed to take a clone of

554
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:21,129
everything or 50 clones of everything in

555
00:19:19,148 --> 00:19:22,719
the grow so I could go down my genetic

556
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:24,789
list I could get a rise I could get

557
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,798
blueberry headband I could get platinum

558
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:28,569
Tandy go get a clone of everything they

559
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,250
have to go in the computer properly and

560
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:32,500
they have to be manifested and

561
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:34,839
transferred through the computer system

562
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,609
and then legally transferred from one

563
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:38,319
grow to the other once they're at the

564
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:40,538
other girl they have to be received in a

565
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,548
computer system and unloaded and tagged

566
00:19:40,538 --> 00:19:45,579
properly so you're allowed to do that

567
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:49,240
one time when a new facility opens so

568
00:19:45,579 --> 00:19:51,069
it's the same genetics we're taking the

569
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,069
genetics from the medical marijuana

570
00:19:51,069 --> 00:19:56,019
facility and manifesting them over to

571
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,019
the recreational facility it's the same

572
00:19:56,019 --> 00:19:59,690
plants now we're

573
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:01,069
we'll just say platinum tangi will say

574
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,558
sour tan because we don't have platinum

575
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:05,089
tangi at the retro will say sour 10g

576
00:20:03,558 --> 00:20:07,908
we've got sour tangi at the medical

577
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:10,699
marijuana grow hypothetically if we were

578
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:12,890
to open another recreational grow that

579
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,778
spawned off of our medical license we

580
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,090
could just cut clones of that sour tangi

581
00:20:14,778 --> 00:20:19,640
put them in the computer make a manifest

582
00:20:17,089 --> 00:20:22,339
for transfer transfer them receive that

583
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,919
transfer and now we've legally got that

584
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:27,408
sour tangi clone in the garden at our

585
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,940
new recreational facility now that's not

586
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:30,140
exactly what happened with Three Rivers

587
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,120
or anything but I mean that's

588
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,830
hypothetically how it works that's how

589
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:36,048
the clones are spread from one facility

590
00:20:33,829 --> 00:20:38,990
to another there are other options to do

591
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:40,908
it um we can sell clones if three rivers

592
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:43,159
either the medical or the recreational

593
00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:45,020
grow wanted to sell a clone we could set

594
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,179
up a business deal with another facility

595
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:49,429
we could sell them trays of clones they

596
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,778
could take 50 to 500 clones of whatever

597
00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:52,640
they wanted of our genetics we could

598
00:20:50,778 --> 00:20:53,750
pass it right along to them if that was

599
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,730
something we do we don't really sell

600
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,009
clones but that's where the genetics

601
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,569
come from you guys the Medical Marijuana

602
00:20:58,009 --> 00:21:01,640
clones and the recreational marijuana

603
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:03,769
clones are the same plants they just

604
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:05,149
have different colored tags the medical

605
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:07,099
marijuana facilities and the

606
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:09,079
recreational marijuana facilities are

607
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,788
basically the same things they just have

608
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:12,829
different colored plant tags and they're

609
00:21:10,788 --> 00:21:14,929
taxed differently and sold in different

610
00:21:12,829 --> 00:21:16,939
stores we're using the same exact

611
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:19,548
nutrients I'm putting the same exact

612
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,340
amount of care the same pesticides are

613
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:23,929
allowed on both products the marijuana

614
00:21:22,339 --> 00:21:25,129
enforcement division the Colorado

615
00:21:23,929 --> 00:21:26,480
Department of Public Health and

616
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,549
Environment and the Colorado Department

617
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,409
of Agriculture have all agreed on a

618
00:21:28,548 --> 00:21:32,569
certain set of pesticides we are and are

619
00:21:30,409 --> 00:21:34,429
not allowed to use those are the same

620
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:36,678
for both facilities so I don't have to

621
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:38,028
make pesticide plans of attack for

622
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:40,190
different facilities I could just use my

623
00:21:38,028 --> 00:21:41,808
same idea over here as I use over there

624
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,759
so I guess the short answer to that

625
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:45,470
question of what's the difference

626
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:48,200
between the way medical and recreational

627
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:50,509
marijuana are grown in Colorado of the

628
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,880
main difference is taxes that's the only

629
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:54,319
difference they are taxed differently

630
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,049
recreational marijuana is taxed much

631
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:59,450
higher than medical marijuana other than

632
00:21:57,048 --> 00:22:01,460
the taxes it's the same plant it's the

633
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:03,740
same nutrients the same lights the same

634
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:05,659
tables the same pesticides it's all the

635
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,788
same stuff I don't do anything

636
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:09,860
differently in the medical grow than I

637
00:22:07,788 --> 00:22:10,490
do in the recreational girl I don't go

638
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:11,899
over to one

639
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,120
would say ooh this is going to this

640
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:15,980
store let's do it differently I treat

641
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,619
all of them the same I love each plant

642
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:20,990
the same I make them all the best I can

643
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:23,149
I trellis them down I pop and crack the

644
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:25,039
sticks I D foliate them I'd treat them

645
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,160
all the same so the only difference

646
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:31,670
really is the taxes now with that being

647
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,370
said every store is going to have a

648
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:36,740
different level of quality every grow is

649
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:39,439
going to have a different standard every

650
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:42,349
trim company every trim crew is going to

651
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,929
have a different standard and a level of

652
00:22:42,349 --> 00:22:47,839
quality of trimming so keep that in mind

653
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:50,660
if you go to one store and they've got

654
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:53,000
hairy buds that are untrimmed and super

655
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,580
dry check another store because they may

656
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:58,220
have perfectly dried and cured buds that

657
00:22:55,579 --> 00:23:00,769
are beautifully trimmed don't judge all

658
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,049
of Colorado by one or two dispensaries

659
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:05,210
please shop around when you come here

660
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,829
but if you're coming from out of state

661
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:08,360
please don't feel like you're getting

662
00:23:06,829 --> 00:23:09,980
slighted please don't feel like you're

663
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:11,689
getting skipped on the quality products

664
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,579
just because you're not buying a medical

665
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:16,279
marijuana product you're getting the

666
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:18,409
same exact quality as you would get if

667
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:20,839
you were a Colorado medical marijuana

668
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:23,660
patient the next thing I want to talk

669
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:26,389
about was inspired by my friend mama

670
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:29,090
bear dabs on Instagram a young lady

671
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:31,220

672
00:23:29,089 --> 00:23:33,529
cannabis industry and Lucy had great

673

down any trainings or certifications

732
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,660
you've got um I would always recommend

733
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:44,509
getting a key badge if you're going for

734
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:46,580
a badge and you can afford it get a key

735
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:48,379
badge there's no reason not to get the

736
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:49,909
key badge a support badge is great that

737
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,550
gets you in the door but that's all that

738
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:55,070
does I need a key badge on premises at

739
00:25:52,549 --> 00:25:56,720
all times if I am in the commercial grow

740
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:58,399
and I want to go to the recreational

741
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,380
grow I've got to make sure there's a key

742
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,540
badge there keeping an eye on everybody

743
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,550
because I can't leave a bunch of support

744
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:07,730
badges in the room without a key badge

745
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:09,769
on sight it is simply illegal um if you

746
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,870
have worker protection safety training

747
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:14,000
document that if you haven't had worker

748
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:16,069
protection safety training I would learn

749
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,319
how to get worker protection safety

750
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:20,379
training in the state of Colorado so

751
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:23,210
that you can put that on your resume

752
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:25,100
also if you are a pesticide applicator

753
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:28,509
or you've had Department of Agriculture

754
00:26:25,099 --> 00:26:30,889
pesticide training list that if you have

755
00:26:28,509 --> 00:26:32,779
respirator training or respirators

756
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:34,370
certifications maybe you were a fireman

757
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,349
in the past maybe you worked with paints

758
00:26:34,369 --> 00:26:37,849
or something if you know how to use

759
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:39,859
where clean

760
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:41,899
safely remove a respirator and you've

761
00:26:39,859 --> 00:26:43,639
got a little card from the the doctor

762
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,230
that does respirator training you've

763
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,419
already got a reason to be hired because

764
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,190
that's one less thing I have to pay to

765
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:51,770
have you trained and certified on if

766
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:54,169
you've got HVAC training you are golden

767
00:26:51,769 --> 00:26:56,960
if you've gone to any HVAC school put

768
00:26:54,169 --> 00:26:59,210
that on your resume if you were an

769
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,620
electrician and not just if you're some

770
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:02,450
sort of journeyman if you've got paper

771
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:04,489
if you've got some sort of card that

772
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:06,679
says I have HVAC training or I have

773
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,538
electrical training put that down

774
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:11,509
because we want to know that sort of

775
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:13,190
stuff we've got seven flower rooms and

776
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:14,629
that means there are seven air

777
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:16,159
conditioners which means there are

778
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,720
probably ten air conditioners because

779
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,450
we've got veg rooms and a couple other

780
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,308
things now if you're a grow tech you're

781
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,259
worth a little bit of money to us you

782
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:26,089
can make some good money hourly but if

783
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:27,980
you're a grow tech and you're an HVAC

784
00:27:26,089 --> 00:27:29,359
tech and my air conditioner goes down

785
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:31,069
and I don't have to call somebody from

786
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,469
another service I can say hey bro

787
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:35,210
the HVAC in room C just went down I'll

788
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,769
take over watering for you can you run

789
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:38,750
outside and see what's going on with the

790
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:41,029
HVAC and then I don't have to have the

791
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,829
outside service come who charges by the

792
00:27:41,029 --> 00:27:45,109
visit and they charge a whole lot of

793
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,000
money just to come look if they show up

794
00:27:45,109 --> 00:27:49,339
and get out of the truck it costs money

795
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:52,130
a lot of money and we would be able to

796
00:27:49,339 --> 00:27:54,288
pay an employee a dollar or two extra

797
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:56,419
per hour to have you as part of the

798
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:58,460
staff and have you on-site so when that

799
00:27:56,419 --> 00:28:00,590
HVAC does go wrong you're already there

800
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:03,019
I don't even have to call anybody you

801
00:28:00,589 --> 00:28:04,548
just walk out there you fix it put that

802
00:28:03,019 --> 00:28:06,950
on the resume so I know you've got that

803
00:28:04,548 --> 00:28:09,679
ability you're already moving up toward

804
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:11,630
the top also write down each machine

805
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,100

809
00:28:18,349 --> 00:28:22,879

819
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:42,890
controller that people may have

820
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,659
overlooked I've got a lot of experience

821
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:46,880
with it just putting that on the resume

822
00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:49,850
that's one more thing I can do but other

823
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,789
people might not be able to do I am

824
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:53,528
familiar with the smart bees I know

825
00:28:51,788 --> 00:28:55,089
to set up the Smart B units I know how

826
00:28:53,528 --> 00:28:57,159
to install them I know how to program

827
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:59,259
them I'm very familiar with smart B

828
00:28:57,159 --> 00:29:01,989
technology so that's another thing that

829
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:04,509
is on my resume I am very familiar with

830
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:06,548
the link for systems I have setup link

831
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:08,409
for systems in multiple facilities I

832
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:10,749
have done troubleshooting with link for

833
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:12,999
systems I have been on tech support with

834
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:15,249
link for before I've got a relationship

835
00:29:12,999 --> 00:29:17,440
with link for I know how to use their

836
00:29:15,249 --> 00:29:19,659
products those are really difficult

837
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,220
machines if you're new with them I don't

838
00:29:19,659 --> 00:29:23,289
need to be trained on that I'm already

839
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,598
worth a little bit more money um

840
00:29:23,288 --> 00:29:27,788
maybe you've been trained in bio track

841
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:29,769
if you know how to use bio track that's

842
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:31,329
that's three weeks of training we don't

843
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:32,769
have to give you bio track is a little

844
00:29:31,329 --> 00:29:34,418
[ __ ] it takes a lot of time to learn

845
00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:37,269
that if you already know how to do that

846
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:40,200
we're saving a lot of time metric

847
00:29:37,269 --> 00:29:42,788
everything in the Colorado Marijuana

848
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,369
regulated business goes through a thing

849
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:47,348
called metric if you've been trained or

850
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:49,388
are familiar with not a metric system

851
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:50,829
that's cool too but metric is a computer

852
00:29:49,388 --> 00:29:53,408
system if you've been trained or you're

853
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:55,089
familiar with that put that down put how

854
00:29:53,409 --> 00:29:56,979
long you have been playing with metric

855
00:29:55,089 --> 00:29:59,079
and put your abilities in metric what

856
00:29:56,979 --> 00:30:00,220
you know and if you've done it a lot you

857
00:29:59,079 --> 00:30:02,589
know what you need to put down to

858
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,569
impress us write that stuff down in your

859
00:30:02,589 --> 00:30:06,249
resume and that makes you more valuable

860
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:08,108
if I don't have to train you in metric

861
00:30:06,249 --> 00:30:09,788
you're already more hireable they're

862
00:30:08,108 --> 00:30:11,499
already worth more money there's less

863
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:13,868
training to be done you're already more

864
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:15,220
valuable employee another thing I

865
00:30:13,868 --> 00:30:17,589
recommend that you can put on your

866
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:21,429
resume is attend all of the metric

867
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:24,158
classes if you go to METAR see.com is

868
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:27,159
all I think it is it's metric comm they

869
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,739
are a multi-state service so if you have

870
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:32,470
regulated cannabis in your state there

871
00:30:29,739 --> 00:30:34,749
is probably a metric program they will

872
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:37,149
offer classes a lot of the times you

873
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:40,269
have to have your marijuana Enforcement

874
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:42,819
Division badge to log into there I'm not

875
00:30:40,269 --> 00:30:44,858
sure how each state is once you get your

876
00:30:42,819 --> 00:30:46,839
badge you can login and you can start

877
00:30:44,858 --> 00:30:49,178
taking metric classes you may be able to

878
00:30:46,839 --> 00:30:51,908
take bud tending classes or grow tech

879
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:55,090
classes locally or online without having

880
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:57,039
a badge take those classes document them

881
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:59,470
write them down add them to your resume

882
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,569
the more you know the less I have to

883
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,919
train you the more valuable you are if

884
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:05,200
you can walk into the Grove and start

885
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:05,740
working today without shadowing me for

886
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,150
four or five

887
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:09,308
days without having to follow Brian

888
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:11,140
around and learn all of Ryan's tricks if

889
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:13,329
you can just come in and work you were

890
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,240
more valuable you were saving us a lot

891
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:18,519
of time so write down all of that stuff

892
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,380
on your resume make sure we know who and

893
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:22,509

pounds I had one guy tell me I can

924

guarantee you 3 pounds every day dog I

925

pulled out like a half a pound five days

927
00:32:31,569 --> 00:32:35,049
in a row guess where he works now not at

928
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,879
three rivers I don't know where he works

929
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:38,889
he lied to me he told me he could do

930
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,230
more than he could do I believed him I

931
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:43,509
hired him he [ __ ] failed he got fired

932
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,009
he was a good dude he was a good worker

933
00:32:43,509 --> 00:32:46,599
if you would have said bro I could

934
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:48,519
probably crank out a half a pound a day

935
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:49,928
anybody came into the facility and

936
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:51,759
cranked out a half a pound a day guess

937
00:32:49,929 --> 00:32:53,230
what he would have met his quota he

938
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,490
would have met his standards he would

939
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,130
not have been a bullshitter and he'd

940
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:58,990
still have a job so don't lie if you can

941
00:32:57,130 --> 00:33:01,600
only trim a half a pound today tell me

942
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,789
currently I only can do a half a pound a

943
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,769
day we'll find you tips and tricks we'll

944
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:07,808
get you to a pound and a half a day you

945
00:33:05,769 --> 00:33:09,369
just got to not lie to me if you go to

946
00:33:07,808 --> 00:33:11,200
karate class and you say I'm a black

947
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:13,689
belt and I find out you're a purple ball

948
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,279
I'm gonna kick your ass because you lied

949
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,620
to me if you come into my grow and you

950
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,629
say I can trim half a pound a day I'm

951
00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:20,919
gonna teach you how to be a [ __ ]

952
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,540
black belt and trim a pound and a half

953
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,080
if you come in and say I can trim two

954
00:33:22,539 --> 00:33:25,779
pounds

955
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:28,869
I expect two pounds from you every day

956
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:30,819
that's a goal you set that was your goal

957
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:32,619
that you that was your expectation why'd

958
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:34,089
you lie to me you could have set 1/4

959
00:33:32,619 --> 00:33:35,799
pound and then you could have said I

960
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:36,819
could probably do 1/4 pound and you

961
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:37,629
would've came in and trimmed half a

962
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:39,579
pound I would have thought you were a

963
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,280
[ __ ] rock star so don't lie to

964
00:33:39,579 --> 00:33:44,289
anybody on your resume don't lie to get

965
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:45,579
the job because we're gonna find out if

966
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:47,170
you say I know how to do all this stuff

967
00:33:45,579 --> 00:33:49,059
we're gonna take you in the grow and

968
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:50,380
we're gonna say do all this stuff and

969
00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:51,669
you're gonna be mixing nutrients and I'm

970
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,740
gonna say what's the pH and you're gonna

971
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,080
go how do I check the pH we're gonna

972
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:57,730
know that you lied so don't lie don't

973
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,740
over promise always under-promise

974
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:00,970
over-deliver that's something I could

975
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,980
definitely say it would be a good idea

976
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:04,630
on your resume but don't set

977
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:07,509
expectations that you're not going to

978
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:10,570
meet because that is the best way to get

979
00:34:07,509 --> 00:34:12,159
fired way quickly in a growth facility

980
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,539
all right so let's review really quickly

981
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,690
and then we're gonna start wrapping this

982
00:34:13,539 --> 00:34:18,340
podcast up list all of your skills list

983
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:20,769
any equipment you've been trained on and

984
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:22,300
list all of your certifications I would

985
00:34:20,769 --> 00:34:24,369
highly recommend to getting a key badge

986
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,679
if you're going to work in the grow I

987
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:28,418
would recommend either worker protection

988
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:31,720
safety training before you're even hired

989
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:33,759
or a pesticide applicator license

990
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,730
through the Department of Ag it's one

991
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,409
test it's affordable and you can do it

992
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:40,570
also if you're gonna do that

993
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,369
get respirators certified if you're

994
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:44,080
going to apply pesticides in Colorado

995
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:45,969
and a medical or recreational grow

996
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,639
you're required to wear a respirator

997
00:34:45,969 --> 00:34:50,648
anybody wearing that respirator needs a

998
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,720
respirator certification it's really

999
00:34:50,648 --> 00:34:54,789
easy it'd cost a few bucks you go to a

1000
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,888
doctor you take the respirator that you

1001
00:34:54,789 --> 00:34:58,420
plan on using you wear that respirator

1002
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:59,860
they make sure that you can put it's a

1003
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,510
fit test as what it is they want to make

1004
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,800
sure you can put it on right they want

1005
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:04,570
to make sure you take it off safely

1006
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,950
because when you take it off you got

1007
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:07,840
your gloves on you've got this dirty

1008
00:35:05,949 --> 00:35:08,829
respirator with pesticides on it they

1009
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,300
want to make sure you're gonna take it

1010
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:11,920
off in a manner that you're not going to

1011
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,510
spread the pesticides to your eyes or

1012
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,210
skin um

1013
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,390
so be respirators certified if you've

1014
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,220
got any HVAC or electrical training

1015
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:23,019

1016
