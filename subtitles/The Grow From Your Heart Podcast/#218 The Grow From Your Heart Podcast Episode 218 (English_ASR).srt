277
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,759
trying to get you to listen to the

278
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,580
podcast for a little while you seem to

279
00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,809
be reluctant to hear me on the show but

280
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,460
thanks for listening his comment was

281
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:38,679
left on stitcher and he said I really

282
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,960

283
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:44,019
and he left that comment on episode 51

284
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:47,080
our CBD episode which featured Angela

285

287
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,330
give a huge shout out to Angela for

288
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,159
letting me post that entire show without

289
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:55,990
editing anything that was really cool of

290
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,949
her some of what she said there was kind

291
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,509
of personal and could have been

292
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,640
embarrassing but she's a badass chick

293
00:09:58,509 --> 00:10:01,720
she's a badass woman she deserves more

294
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,970
respect than being called the chick

295
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,620
she's a badass woman and she let me post

296
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,120
the entire conversation without a single

297
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:08,669
edit so that's really cool thank you I

298
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,310
hope you're listening to this episode

299
00:10:08,669 --> 00:10:14,529
all right so that was the stitcher and

300
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:15,789
in or an iTunes comment so I had a

301
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:16,990
little bit of a brain fart there I

302
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,669
really appreciate you guys leaving

303
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,759
comments it shows me that you are

304
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:23,079
listening to the show and if you hate

305
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,819
the show you can leave a comment because

306
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,370
I haven't gotten a shitty comment yet

307
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,200
and did people does not do that do you

308
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,960
just not you probably skipped it and

309
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,670
don't even want to listen if you review

310
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,379
but it makes me feel good that people

311
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:36,759
like it and give me lots of good stars

312
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:38,350
please leave me a review you guys

313
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:40,269
because what that does is it boost me up

314
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,100
in the iTunes and in the stitcher

315
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:43,329
rankings and then more people see the

316
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:45,159
show and then the more people see the

317
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,110
show the more listened and then the more

318
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,730
people grow better cannabis and the more

319
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:51,039
people have a better education about

320
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:53,080
cannabis then we can dispel a lot of the

321
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:55,000
stupid myths and rumors and then we can

322
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:57,070
legalize cannabis worldwide that's

323
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,950
that's or I think that's our goal for

324
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:01,120
now is to legalize it and grow the best

325
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,460
we can those are our two main objectives

326
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,929
if we're gonna assign ourselves main

327
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,430
goals that's it grow the best cannabis

328
00:11:04,929 --> 00:11:09,588
we can and legalize this [ __ ]

00:11:07,429 --> 00:11:11,778
all right I'm really rambley today which

330
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:14,200
is good because I'm by myself I think

331
00:11:11,778 --> 00:11:17,240
it's time to get into some news articles

332
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,000
our first article has nothing to do with

333
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,399
cannabis well it loosely has something

334
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,659
to do with cannabis it's something that

335
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,120
is personal to me and I found it very

336
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,809
entertaining the remaining members of

337
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,549

the answer is almost unbelievable this

361
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:18,399
is the part I wanted to talk about has a

362
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:21,199
note on the events website mentions that

363
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,899
60,000 plus envelopes were received so

364
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,070
far which is handling by the company

365
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:27,019
that's handling their mail order

366
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,778
fulfillment so the tickets only went on

367
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:31,549
sale through mail order which is only

368
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:32,958
the people that know what's up are going

369
00:12:31,549 --> 00:12:34,909
to be able to order the mail order this

370
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,399
isn't like a publicly known thing you

371
00:12:34,909 --> 00:12:40,009
got to kind of be on the inside

372
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,980
they got 60,000 requests just from the

373
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:44,958
mail order that is amazing that's crazy

397
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:38,149
discovered in a bag of weed that was

398
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,589
bought on a Grateful Dead parking lot at

399
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,879
a Grateful Dead show that's where Kim

400
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:42,290
dog came from so if there weren't these

401
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:42,828
silly hippies traveling around being

402
00:13:42,289 --> 00:13:44,929
dead heads

403
00:13:42,828 --> 00:13:46,250
Kim dog would not exist and a lot of the

404
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:48,948
strains that we work with now would not

405
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:50,570
exist most of my lineup would not exist

406
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:54,588
because a lot of my stuff is crossed

407
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:57,800
with Kim talk anyway news article here

408
00:13:54,589 --> 00:13:59,540

409

411
00:14:02,139 --> 00:14:08,870

412
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:10,698
4 um it says new regulations on pot

413

415
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:15,860
children and one adults about the

416
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,360
potency of marijuana edibles the laws

417
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:18,980
being put into place by the Colorado

418
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,810
Department of Revenue the agency is

419
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,759
hoping to prevent problems that have put

420
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:25,250
Colorado's budding retail pot industry

421
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:27,649
under scrutiny and there's a picture of

422
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,360
this African student they're trying to

423
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:32,089
blame a lot of this on him I'll keep

424
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,550
reading last year African student and

425
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:37,310
African and African student in Wyoming

426
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:38,419
Levi I'm just gonna say Levi Tomba so

427
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,549
I'm not sure how to pronounce that

428
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:43,219
Levi Tomba died after eating an entire

429
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:45,859
marijuana infused cookie and jumping off

430
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,839
a hotel balcony there have also been

431
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:50,449
several cases of children mistaking pot

432
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,010
for candy that means some changes for

433
00:14:50,448 --> 00:14:53,719
edibles including placing marijuana

434
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:55,970
infused candy and baked goods in

435
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,680
childproof packaging each individual

436
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,139
square of chocolate must be marked

437
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:01,458
according to how potent it is so you

438
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:03,948
guys back in the day when you would buy

439
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:05,088
I can't even pick a brand because I

440
00:15:03,948 --> 00:15:06,620
don't want to like seeing a lot of brand

441
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:08,329
back in the day when you'd buy a large

442
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,919
edible of a candy bar it would be the

443
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:12,078
size of your normal candy bar that you

444
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,099
buy at the gas station or wherever at

445
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,289
the grocery store wherever you get your

446
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,790
candy bar right you would buy that one

447
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,049
candy bar and it would just look it

448
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:19,909
would be it would be in a wrapper that

449
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,528
was plainly marked this is a ganja candy

450
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:24,169
bar but then once you open it you can't

451
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:25,939
tell it all and now every single piece

452
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:27,740
they have made a mold that you pour your

453
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:29,510
chocolate into not you but the companies

454
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:31,459
they pour their chocolate into there

455
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:32,750
and it may it divides it for you into

456
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,669
little squares and they're showing a

457
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:36,198
picture of it the whole candy bar is a

458
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:39,229
hundred milligrams but now they've

459
00:15:36,198 --> 00:15:42,109
divided it into ten little squares and

460
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,269
they're all labeled ten milligrams THC

461
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:45,769
for each little square so no it's it's a

462
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:48,799
little better because sometimes when you

463
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:50,179
buy edibles you don't remember if what

464
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,269
you bought or you don't remember which

465
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:54,528
is which or sometimes it's hard to tell

466
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:56,269
if this is a third or if this is a

467
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:57,708
quarter so now these guys have really

468
00:15:56,269 --> 00:16:00,049
made it nice and easy for you I'll keep

469
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:02,448
reading the article it says at the

470
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:03,979
incredibles edibles shop they mark each

471
00:16:02,448 --> 00:16:06,049
square of chocolate with the number 10

472
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:08,509
to indicate 10 milligrams of THC the

473
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:11,929
psychoactive ingredient of marijuana 10

474
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:13,490
is the standard serving in the past

475
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,439
chocolate didn't have to indicate the

476
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,750
amount of THC in each bar some of them

477
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,339
were in line with what industry feels

478
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:21,110
will improve I'm gonna start that sense

479
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,310
again I'm sorry some of them are in line

480
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:23,930
with what the industry feels will

481
00:16:22,309 --> 00:16:26,149
improve safety out there others seem

482
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:28,448
like overkill but we were happy to do it

483
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,980
set incredible spokesman Bob Hoshino

484
00:16:28,448 --> 00:16:32,539
some clerks working at retail pot shops

485
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:34,069
have been recommending much more which

486
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:36,259
could cause some issues with those who

487
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:37,789
had not had much experience with that

488
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:40,100
bowls now edible packaging contains

489
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:42,349
warnings the only a small amount and

490
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,389
then wait before eating more so it says

491
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,750
wait 45 minutes so when you eat this

492
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:50,360
wait 45 this is a weirdly worded article

493
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:52,399
so it says wait 45 minutes so when you

494
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,019
eat this wait 45 minutes to see how it

495
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,208
affects you and then you can continue

496
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:59,179
with another dose if you really wanted

497
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:01,099
to says sweet leaf spokeswoman Elizabeth

498
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:03,318
Dee that's a long last name Elizabeth

499
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,088
Dee I won't butcher that for you so

500
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:06,649
they're showing a picture of the package

501
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:09,259
and it totally shows like a little it

502
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,429
says to educate and to medicate there's

503
00:17:09,259 --> 00:17:11,539
like a little clock on there like the

504
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,669
one that you'd see at the store this is

505
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:16,149
be back in ten minutes instead it shows

506
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:18,620
it says take one square wait two hours

507
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,089
so they're trying to encourage you to

508
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:21,558
take one in wait two hours the problem

509
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:22,789
is a lot of people don't do they think

510
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:23,209
they're badasses and they can just eat

511
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:25,459
at all

512
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:27,410
but back into the article a variety of

513
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:29,330
the marijuana infused products included

514
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:31,429
including drinks cookies and candies

515
00:17:29,329 --> 00:17:33,289
come in single servings we just want to

516
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:34,940
educate people that 5 milligrams is a

517
00:17:33,289 --> 00:17:38,240
good serving not too much not

518
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,190
over-the-top make it safe said Elizabeth

519
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,870
I can't read her last name I'm sure it's

520
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:43,070
long this is the first step in

521
00:17:41,869 --> 00:17:45,769
regulation for the edible

522
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:48,919
industry this is a good idea you guys

523
00:17:45,769 --> 00:17:50,509
but something I wanted to bring up this

524
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:53,150
is going to crush a couple of companies

525
00:17:50,509 --> 00:17:55,400
I'm sure because this came up quickly

526
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,720
and it had to happen I think he went

527
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,970
into effect on the first of this month

528
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,370
and they didn't get a lot of time people

529
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,500
had to pull product that they have

530
00:18:01,369 --> 00:18:04,849
already made already have packaged they

531
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:07,250
had to pull it all off the shelf and

532
00:18:04,849 --> 00:18:08,089
then they had to repackage it or I don't

533
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,589
know if they were even allowed to

534
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,939
repackage it because if the pieces

535
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:13,339
weren't properly labeled they had to

536
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,380
destroy those candy bars so I'm certain

537
00:18:13,339 --> 00:18:17,059
that this put at least one or two small

538
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:18,710
businesses out of business because of

539
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:21,710
these new regulations they keep pushing

540
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:26,150
on us I kind of agree with the whole

541
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:28,490
situation because well I work at the

542
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,290
dispensary and I hang out people that

543
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:32,240
work there all day and we insist to

544
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:33,559
people just take this and they laugh

545
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,870
like they're gonna be able like they're

546
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,569
Superman and they don't realize what

547
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:39,979
they're buying is proper like they're

548
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:41,480
used to buying brownies that their

549
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:42,980
cousin made or that they're snowed or

550
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,630
uncle made and they weren't that potent

551
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,680
so they're buying these medical edibles

552
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,880
and they're just getting roar they're

553
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,070
wreck a tables but I mean they're made

554
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,330
by the same people to make medical and

555
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:52,609
buying these quality edibles they're

556
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:54,199
just getting [ __ ] up so I kind of like

557
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:57,349
the idea that we're marking them each

558
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,019
piece but it's hard for it I'm sure it's

559
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:01,279
hard for a business to keep itself going

560
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:02,809
when every month there's a new

561
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,250
regulation they're like oh you guys put

562
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:06,470
all those stripes on the package now you

563
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:08,500
have to put the stripes plus a hologram

564
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,670
you know so that's gonna crush somebody

565
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:12,980
let's get into another news article

566
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:15,890
because that one is boring as [ __ ] this

567
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:17,150
one is from the cannabis what's up to

568
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,410
the cannabis they're easily read a lot

569
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,780
of their stuff this article is by David

570
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:24,019
McCoy uh he's a writer for The Denver

571
00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:26,029
Post the headline says organs and bank

572
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:28,639
pulls out of Colorado a week after

573
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:29,869
taking on pot accounts a lot of you're

574
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,200
gonna say what but I'll catch you up to

575
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:32,750
speed

576
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,250
it says the Oregon Community Bank that a

577
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,410
week ago openly welcome to Colorado

578
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,299
marijuana industry customers has changed

579
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:39,590
its mind publicly saying it doesn't have

580
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:42,379
the infrastructure to handle the

581
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:44,029
overwhelming response for service but

582
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:45,740
people familiar with the move say the

583
00:19:44,029 --> 00:19:47,389
retreat was pressed by federal banking

584
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:49,069
regulators who stepped in late last week

585
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,340
to tell em bank executives they're

586
00:19:49,069 --> 00:19:53,288
crossing several states to work with

587
00:19:51,339 --> 00:19:55,648
with an industry that remains illegal

588
00:19:53,288 --> 00:19:57,999
under federal law was simply too risky

589
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:59,798
following national press the volume of

590
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:01,899
inquiries in Oregon Washington and

591
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:03,369
Colorado has been so overwhelming that

592
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:05,678
we don't currently have the inference

593
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,898
infrastructure to adequately support all

594
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,240
of these customers and Bank CEO Jeff

595
00:20:07,898 --> 00:20:11,949
Baker said Monday Colorado is the

596
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,509
farthest from our market area and the

597
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,048
most difficult to provide the quality

598
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:18,909
customer service to there are nearly

599
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:20,829
2,200 pot retail manufacturing and grow

600
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,778
businesses in Colorado according to the

601
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:24,158
state licensing data the bank will

602
00:20:22,778 --> 00:20:25,599
continue to serve legal marijuana

603
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,840
businesses in Oregon and Washington

604
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,908
Baker said industry insiders said the

605
00:20:28,839 --> 00:20:32,109
pull back was not unexpected we've

606
00:20:30,909 --> 00:20:33,730
become accustomed to our banking

607
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:35,979
solutions not actually for working out

608
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:37,929
said Michael Elliott executive director

609
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,240
of the marijuana industry group after

610
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:41,769
all after all after they got all that

611
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,569
press I was wondering if they'd get

612
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:45,700
increased scrutiny and pressure as a

613
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:48,519
result just like all the other banks

614
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,308
have part of the issue Baker said was M

615
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:52,868
banks lack of Colorado and banks lack of

616
00:20:51,308 --> 00:20:54,368
a Colorado branch which would require

617
00:20:52,868 --> 00:20:56,470
approval from the state banking

618
00:20:54,368 --> 00:20:58,618
authorities it did not need approval to

619
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,548
accept deposits from Colorado businesses

620
00:20:58,618 --> 00:21:02,288
so they're just searching for loopholes

621
00:21:00,548 --> 00:21:04,210
did not want to do business with us re

622
00:21:02,288 --> 00:21:06,099
it says without branch cash deposits

623
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,679
millions of dollars that often must be

624
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:11,319
treated with cleaners such as Febreze to

625
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,909
remove the pungent marijuana smell would

626
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,038
have to be made at a federal reserve

627
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:17,619
bank such as one located in downtown

628
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,240
vent Denver from there deposits would be

629
00:21:17,618 --> 00:21:21,548
electronically credited to M banks

630
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:25,839
accounts then to its marijuana business

631
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:27,579
depositors founded in 1995 the 165

632
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,558
million dollar bank has three organ

633
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:31,990
locations in and around Portland it

634
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:33,428
nearly closed in 2009 following a string

635
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,548
of problems that ranged from inadequate

636
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:38,499
board management to a balanced balance

637
00:21:36,548 --> 00:21:40,388
sheet wait oh god I can't even read an

638
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:42,579
I'm sorry you guys that ranged from

639
00:21:40,388 --> 00:21:44,709
inadequate board management to a balance

640
00:21:42,579 --> 00:21:46,480
sheet weighed down by toxic and poorly

641
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,100
performing loans that was hard to say

642
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,169
dude I'm gonna take a DAB here after

643
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,459
this article trust me

644
00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:53,499
Baker said the five Colorado based

645
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,048
marijuana business accounts that were

646
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:57,278
open will most likely be closed I'm not

647
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:59,440
a hundred percent on that but we're

648
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,690
reviewing it another six treat another

649
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,820
sixty enquiries from Colorado pot shop

650
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:04,880
owners will be shelved he said when an

651
00:22:03,819 --> 00:22:07,009
Bank went public with it

652
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,500
desire to bank the marijuana sector last

653
00:22:07,009 --> 00:22:11,720
week its brazenness raised industry

654
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,950
eyebrows baking regulators such as the

655
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,920
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

656
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:17,870
which oversees M bank have have frowned

657
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:19,750
on institutions that are overt about

658
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:22,219
working with legal cannabis businesses

659
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,960
Colorado's legal pot businesses have

660
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:28,130
long lamented that their accounts are

661
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,930
closed as soon as okay as soon as where

662
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,300
they are banking becomes public that was

663
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:34,220
odd this is exactly the reason why the

664
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,869
marijuana industry cannot say who they

665
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,579
have a bank account with and why the

666
00:22:35,869 --> 00:22:39,649
banks don't want it public Elliott said

667
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:42,319
Baker sidestepped the questioned about

668
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:44,540
whether the FDIC the agency he said

669
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,250
offered its tactic approval to the idea

670
00:22:44,539 --> 00:22:48,559
only a week ago that pushed and Bank out

671
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:50,269
of control out of Colorado we are

672
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,009
regulated by the government and the

673
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:54,259
expectation is that we run our bank in a

674
00:22:52,009 --> 00:22:56,240
safe and sound manner in the event we

675
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:58,220
don't we face severe repercussions from

676
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,200
our regulators Baker said certainly

677
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,269
regulators influence our decisions but

678
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,069
it ultimately is our call so they were

679
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:06,170
definitely coerced into it by the FDIC

680
00:23:04,069 --> 00:23:08,000
they don't want the feds don't want

681
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:11,810
cannabis money they don't want us to be

682
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,130
able to bank I think all right I'll

683
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:13,460
continue with the article sorry I needed

684
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:15,710
a drink

685
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:17,630
others familiar with the outcome of the

686
00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,670
FDIC frowned at the public nature of M

687
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:21,200
banks move making it unclear whether the

688
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:24,500
plan would have met approval had it not

689
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,600
been so well publicized the regulators

690
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,220
have the gun and all the bullets at one

691
00:23:26,599 --> 00:23:29,659
banking insider who's familiar with the

692
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:31,250
FDIC and its methods

693
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,230
any of us who have survived the

694
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,710
financial crisis knows exactly how this

695
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:35,329
works

696
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:37,910
if we're not team players our life

697
00:23:35,329 --> 00:23:40,159
becomes miserable Colorado has had

698
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:42,529
several efforts in banking and banking

699
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,540
the marijuana industry go a ride the

700
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:46,519
most recent a long delay in the opening

701
00:23:44,539 --> 00:23:48,019
of the fourth corner Credit Union the

702
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,579
world's first credit union created

703
00:23:48,019 --> 00:23:51,829
specifically for the pot industry had

704
00:23:49,579 --> 00:23:53,359
expected to open at the new year but it

705
00:23:51,829 --> 00:23:55,009
has not yet been granted a master

706
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:58,639
account by the Federal Reserve Bank in

707
00:23:55,009 --> 00:23:59,990
Kansas City so they're already two

708
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,640
months almost three months behind and

709
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:04,130
getting that open because the feds don't

710
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:05,480
want us to put our money in the banks so

711
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,800
that we can have it on us when they raid

712
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:09,110
us that's why they could take it all

713
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,079
from us alright I'll keep reading a move

714
00:24:09,109 --> 00:24:14,569
last year by the Colorado Legislature

715
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:16,339
set the stage for banking for a banking

716
00:24:14,569 --> 00:24:18,319
cooperative similar to a credit union

717
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:20,809
but has made no progress despite new

718
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,159
discussions that's because it too would

719
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:23,929
require the same master account

720
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,810
necessary to access the nation's money

721
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:28,940
system Colorado Springs State Bank the

722
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:30,589
last Colorado brain bank to openly work

723
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,320
with the marijuana industry closed about

724
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:34,970
300 accounts in late 2011 it made

725
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:37,490
concerns of working with companies that

726
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,620
violate federal law Baker said he'll

727
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,779
likely revisit the Colorado plan but it

728
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:43,849
might take some time the position of

729
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:45,259
state and federal regulators is that

730
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:47,149
they do not object to banking services

731
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:49,849
being provided to the cannabis industry

732
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:52,040
he said however they absolutely expect

733
00:24:49,849 --> 00:24:54,169
the development of strong programs time

734
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:57,170
and experience will allow programs to

735
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:58,430
become stronger it doesn't sound like

736
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,650
they want to work with us at all to tell

737
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,810
you the truth these dispensaries are

738
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:07,160
making a lot of money and without having

739
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:08,659
a bank I see how difficult it can be

740
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,680
because other businesses don't want to

741
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:13,910
be paid in cash like whatever businesses

742
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,380
are attached to your dispensary I don't

743
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,090
want to if you have a you have to have a

744
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,040
security guard all day long so you have

745
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:20,529
to pay for security service the security

746
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,180
service does not want to be paid in cash

747
00:25:20,529 --> 00:25:25,190
all of the dispensary customers paid in

748
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,529
cash so now the dispensary is sitting on

749
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:29,180
a [ __ ] ton of cash they have to turn

750
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:31,639
that into some sort of currency that

751
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,289
they can pay the electricity they got to

752
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:34,610
pay payroll they've got to pay the

753
00:25:33,289 --> 00:25:36,529
accountant they got to pay the lawyer

754
00:25:34,609 --> 00:25:37,939
they've got to pay the employees they've

755
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:40,910
got to pay the master grower they got to

756
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,440
buy nutrients you know so it's a pain in

757
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,790
the ass to deal with this cuz I'm gonna

758
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,170
press pause for a second I'm gonna take

759
00:25:43,789 --> 00:25:47,210

769
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:04,069

778
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:21,870
Ricardo Baca from the cannabis once

779
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:24,990
again it says 573 million dollars in pot

780
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:27,899
sales here are 12 stats that define the

781
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,940
year in marijuana so a couple a couple

782
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:31,410
episodes ago Spence and Maddie came on

783
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:33,480
and we talked about the Year in Review

784
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:35,220
and then in episode 50 we talked about

785
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:38,339
live resin kind of be in one of the big

786
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,110
dicks of the year the cannabis 20 there

787
00:26:38,339 --> 00:26:41,970
are 12 stats of the year

788
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:43,199
I'll read most of these I probably won't

789
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,089
read all 12 of them because I want to

790
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,309
get to the prizes you guys the first one

791
00:26:45,089 --> 00:26:49,259
says number one a hundred and thirty

792
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:51,450
point three metric tons that's

793
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:54,210
Colorado's annual demand for marijuana

794
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:57,990
equal to thirty six point eight million

795
00:26:54,210 --> 00:27:00,769
eighths of cannabis flower so every year

796
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:03,120
can Colorado sells and/or smokes

797
00:27:00,769 --> 00:27:06,660
thirty-six point eight million eighths

798
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,949
that's a lot of eights if you're buying

799
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,080
them at a shop that's averaging you

800
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,450
about sixty five to seventy dollars and

801
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,789
eight that's a lot of freaking money

802
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,620
we're bringing in says makes you wonder

803
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:19,529
how many Coloradoans how many

804
00:27:16,619 --> 00:27:21,929
Coloradoans use regularly the answer to

805
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,670
that is four hundred and eighty five

806
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:25,380
thousand that's the number of adults who

807
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,509
are 21 and older using marijuana

808
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,390
regularly which they can account for at

809
00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:33,029
least once a month and it's about 9% of

810
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:34,950
the state's population and then it says

811
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,500
and what about those using more often

812
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,930
than that 23% that's the Amana that's

813
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,480
the amount of Colorado's user population

814
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:44,100
that consumes cannabis nearly daily so

815
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,390
if you're at my club twenty three

816
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:47,809
percent of us we're in the twenty three

817
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,520
Club we smoke cannabis on a daily basis

818
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:52,559
but what about the out-of-state tourists

819
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:56,099
visiting Colorado that purchase legal

820
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,349
weed ninety percent that's the amount of

821
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:00,809
recreational pot sales out-of-state

822
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:03,509
tourists are responsible for at shops in

823
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:05,129
mountain town resort communities so

824
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:08,099
they're saying places like Bracken Vail

825
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:10,410
a 90 percent of pot sales are from

826
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:12,929
out-of-state tourists in my neighborhood

827
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:14,580
in our area what we have observed I'm

828
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,799
gonna say about seventy percent of the

829
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:19,289
people that stop in to the spot

830
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,029
dispensary are from out-of-state and I'm

831
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:22,649
going to say 50 percent of the people

832
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:25,950
are from Texas

833
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:29,669
questions what we have observed being in

834
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:31,409
the place a lot the next one says but

835
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:34,110
how much of Colorado's annual demand are

836
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:35,610
these tourists actually buying 7% that's

837
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:37,038
the amount of Colorado's annual pot

838
00:28:35,609 --> 00:28:41,939
demand purchased by out-of-state

839
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:44,519
tourists 9% is the price drop on a

840
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:47,100
recreational eighth of marijuana I had a

841
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:50,460
dozen prominent Colorado shops since the

842
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:52,319
1st of January so 1/8 has gone from

843
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:57,600
fifty five dollars or fifty three

844
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:59,579
dollars and 88 cents to $48.95 is how

845
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,629
much the prices have dropped I'm gonna

846
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:05,639
skip over a couple of these because

847
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:10,260
they're just ridiculous numbers so jeez

848
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:11,850
is that 212 million okay 246 million

849
00:29:10,259 --> 00:29:13,408

00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:16,349
hundred ninety nine dollars and three

851

marijuana sales as counted from January

853
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:24,690

data was not available at the time of

855
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:29,519
this article from the Colorado

856
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:32,190

872
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,750
marijuana sales also from January to

873
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:14,660
October somebody do some math on that

874
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:16,309
that's uh five five hundred and sixty

875
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:18,350
five hundred and seventy two million

876
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:20,720
dollars dude five hundred and seventy

877
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:25,129
two million dollars we made on cannabis

878
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,319
legal cannabis sales gosh that's a lot

879
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:29,270
of money imagine where that was going

880
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:30,349
before we had legalized cannabis of

881
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:31,609
course a lot of it is coming from

882
00:30:30,349 --> 00:30:33,049
out-of-state people and stuff but

883
00:30:31,609 --> 00:30:35,629
imagine where that money was going

884
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:37,309
before we had legalized cannabis where

885
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:40,070
was that going what was happening with

886
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,929
it so the next number is a hundred and

887
00:30:40,069 --> 00:30:43,539
three thousand nine hundred and eighteen

888
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:46,070
that's the number of medical marijuana

889
00:30:43,539 --> 00:30:48,529
patients reporting severe pain as their

890
00:30:46,069 --> 00:30:50,240
condition for a license or ninety four

891
00:30:48,529 --> 00:30:53,450
percent of the state's total patients

892
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,539
are using severe pain as their condition

893
00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:57,860
which yeah how can you deny severe pain

894
00:30:56,539 --> 00:30:59,899
if you go to the doctor and you say it

895
00:30:57,859 --> 00:31:01,669
hurts he's gonna go I believe you cuz

896
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,680
he's a doctor and he's compassionate so

897
00:31:01,670 --> 00:31:07,220
hell yeah use that one it hurts pick a

898
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,380
spot and say it hurts um six hundred or

899
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:11,569
sixty point 1 million dollars that's the

900
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,790
amount of call the amount Colorado has

901
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:17,000
brought in via taxes licenses and fees

902
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:19,159
on recreational and medical American I'm

903
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,460
not gonna say marijuana recreational and

904
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:24,830
medical cannabis from January to October

905
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,390
so sixty point 1 million dollars has

906
00:31:24,829 --> 00:31:29,509
been brought into the state of Colorado

907
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:31,550
just from taxes licenses and fees

908
00:31:29,509 --> 00:31:34,190
nothing was sold and no product passed

909
00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:37,279
hands that way simply of Licensing and

910
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:40,700
taxing people sixty point 1 million

911
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,379
dollars oh my goodness all right what

912
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:44,059
about the cannabis infused edibles the

913
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:45,800
cookies and gummies and brownies that

914
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:47,329
proved to be surprisingly popular in

915
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:50,000
this first year of recreational sales

916
00:31:47,329 --> 00:31:52,609
and then the answer is 10 milligrams of

917
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,440
THC that's the state's standard single

918
00:31:52,609 --> 00:31:56,929
serving size for marijuana edibles with

919
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,730
a hundred milligrams maximum allowed in

920
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:02,900
an individually packaged product being

921
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:06,170
sold recreationally a hundred milligram

922
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:07,790
incredible bar is fine there's nothing

923
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,630
you don't need more than that if you're

924
00:32:07,789 --> 00:32:09,589
from out of state

925
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:11,330
you're coming here you're gonna buy a

926
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:13,339
hundred milligram edible you're good

927
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:16,460
don't eat that whole thing I see that

928
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:17,959
that is a decent a decent amount 100

929
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,100
milligrams is a good limit and you can

930
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,900
buy multiple of those because you're

931
00:32:19,099 --> 00:32:22,129
allowed up to if you're out of state

932
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,509
you're allowed up to seven grams of

933
00:32:22,130 --> 00:32:25,490
cannabis you're allowed to divide that

934
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:26,839
into milligrams however millet many

935
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,740
milligrams are in that candy bar you can

936
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:32,569
get that many so here's a neat fact it

937
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,460
says and did any of these edibles end up

938
00:32:32,569 --> 00:32:36,079
making for a crazy Halloween as some

939
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,690
thought they would and then the response

940
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,309
is zero that's the number of reports of

941
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,120
THC laced candy given to

942
00:32:40,309 --> 00:32:43,339
trick-or-treaters on Halloween

943
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,079
regardless of widespread concern that

944
00:32:43,339 --> 00:32:47,769
legal marijuana would lead to pot laced

945
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:51,319
candies in children's Halloween halls

946
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:53,329
yeah nobody got ganja edibles because

947
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:55,009
they're expensive and because if you

948
00:32:53,329 --> 00:32:56,599
bought it you probably ate it yourself

949
00:32:55,009 --> 00:32:59,319
and didn't want to give it to some kid

950
00:32:56,599 --> 00:33:02,119
so those are 12 interesting facts

951
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,889
statistics I guess they are from the

952
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:06,849
state of Colorado for the first year of

953
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:09,950
legal cannabis I've got one more article

954
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:12,319
this comes from part of this happened in

955
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:17,269
my hometown in the lovely lovely town of

956
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:21,109
Pueblo Colorado this is why I have said

957
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:23,210
stop shipping cannabis because this dude

958
00:33:21,109 --> 00:33:25,219
got caught and he is gonna get [ __ ]

959
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:27,680
and then he'll probably get [ __ ] after

960
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:29,390
that but I'm not gonna go there the

961
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,960
articles from the cannabis and then it

962
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,940
says police found 63 thousand dollars in

963
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,490
marijuana and pot products in a UPS

964
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,890
package and then the headline is Pueblo

965
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,950
police Texas man arrested after trying

966
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:46,940
to ship 63k of marijuana there's a

967
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:48,529
picture of a table with it looks like

968
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:50,330
this dude has a bunch of eights and

969
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:51,649
they're rolled up another probably

970
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:53,179
ounces those are ounces it looks like

971
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,590
I'm trying to zoom in here he's got

972
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,150
houses and they're wrapped up and then

973
00:33:54,589 --> 00:33:57,799
those ounces are all shoved into bags

974
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,320
and it looks like he's got one two three

975
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:02,809
four of those ounces per bag and then

976
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:04,189
he's got one two three four five they're

977
00:34:02,809 --> 00:34:05,329
like eight of them on the table and

978
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,730
whatever I just pushed made the thing

979
00:34:05,329 --> 00:34:09,319
refresh but yeah he's got several pounds

980
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:12,349
there and then there's another picture

981
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,789
of a bunch of edibles there's a monkey

982
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:16,489
bar on there which is one of my favorite

983
00:34:13,789 --> 00:34:17,659
edibles there's a bunch of a bunch of

984
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:20,178
really popular edibles there's the

985
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:21,300
Mahatma concentrates so it looks like

986
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,610
this dude was trying to send

987
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,019
the goods back to Texas and let's read

988
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,090
about what happened to him

989
00:34:25,019 --> 00:34:28,679
those articles by Jesse Paul from the

990
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,690
Denver Post I found it on the cannabis

991
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,550
it says the Texas man was arrested

992
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,950
Wednesday on suspicion of trying to send

993
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:37,440
himself an estimated 63 thousand dollars

994
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:40,019
in marijuana and marijuana products some

995
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,110
of which was legally purchased from

996
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:45,179
pueblos back home and I'm curious

997
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:47,789
because they say sixty three thousand

998
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:49,050
dollars is that Texas price or was that

999
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:50,909
the price at the dispensary when he

1000
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:53,910
bought it or is that street price or is

1001
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:55,619
that DEA market price I'm curious

1002
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,849
should I say this guy's name I don't

1003
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,809
wanna say his name I read his name in

1004
00:34:56,849 --> 00:34:59,400
the article I don't want to because that

1005
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:01,230
makes him popular he's gonna get credit

1006
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:03,960
Johnny Woolf was arrested by the San

1007
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:05,880
Angelo Police Department in Texas at his

1008
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,340
residence and is being held at the Tom

1009

Green County Jail in lieu of a hundred

1010
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:12,960
thousand dollars cash only bond pueblo

1011
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,640
police said wolf has been charged with

1012
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,490
possession of marijuana with intent to

1013
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:20,069
distribute here's where the article gets

1014
00:35:17,489 --> 00:35:22,199
interesting to me the police in Pueblo

1015
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,090
began investigating investigating wolf

1016
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,009
early last month after United Parcel

1017
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:28,140
Service employees reported receiving a

1018
00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:29,970
package that was suspicious the package

1019
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:32,099
was sent by wolf out of Pueblo to

1020
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:34,679
himself at an address in San Angelo

1021
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:38,039
Texas I want to know what makes a

1022
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:39,539
package suspicious because they show a

1023
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:41,699
picture of this guy and this dude's got

1024
00:35:39,539 --> 00:35:44,309
long hair and he looks like he'd be a

1025
00:35:41,699 --> 00:35:45,359
rowdy Texas troublemaker sorry dude I

1026
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,440
just called you out but you do man you

1027
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,670
get that long hair I know

1028
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,650
dreadlocks tuber I know what it's like

1029
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:52,079
but you look like [ __ ] trouble I

1030
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:54,300
wonder if that was all it took to make

1031
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,349
him suspicious that and the fact that he

1032
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,730
sent the package to himself in Texas

1033
00:35:57,349 --> 00:36:01,289
he's like I'm just in wolf and I want to

1034
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,599
send this to Justin wolf that might have

1035
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:05,759
been in but I'll keep reading it says

1036
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,500
inside police found several double

1037
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,030
vacuum-sealed packages with a total of

1038
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,400
nine pounds of high-grade marijuana

1039
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,410
police said investigators say the

1040
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:15,630
package also had cannabis edibles cough

1041
00:36:13,409 --> 00:36:17,609
syrup skin patches and wax concentrate

1042
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,860
that had been legally purchased from two

1043
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:22,570
separate dispensaries in Pueblo Colorado

1044
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,309
police estimate the marijuana to be

1045
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:26,110
worth fifty eight thousand dollars in

1046
00:36:24,309 --> 00:36:27,130
the cannabis products worth to be five

1047
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,140
thousand dollars

1048
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:30,610
Pablo police say they drafted a warrant

1049
00:36:29,139 --> 00:36:33,099
on Tuesday for Wolf's arrest and

1050
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:34,780
contacted police in Texas who arrested

1051
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:39,009

1053

do there's broken glass on the table you

1298
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,969
can be mad for a minute you could be

1299
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,350
brokenhearted but then you you got to

1300
00:45:47,969 --> 00:45:51,419
grab the broom and the dustpan and sweep

1301
00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:53,699
up the [ __ ] broken glass you got to

1302
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:55,289
throw that glass in the trash you got to

1303
00:45:53,699 --> 00:45:56,189
move on right that's all I could do

1304
00:45:55,289 --> 00:45:58,619
because it's broken

1305
00:45:56,190 --> 00:46:01,460
I can't glue it back together duct tape

1306
00:45:58,619 --> 00:46:04,259
is not gonna work that shit's done so I

1307
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:07,139
had a moment of Zen as I was sweeping up

1308
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:08,070
this broken glass I thought there's so

1309
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:11,009
many things that happened in your life

1310
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:12,750
that suck and they hurt or maybe they're

1311
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,670
good well you can't cling to things

1312
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:16,469
because you could drop that glass at any

1313
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:17,550
minute and that she could break dude and

1314
00:46:16,469 --> 00:46:19,379
he can't put it back together

1315
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:21,150
and sometimes you just gotta sweep some

1316
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,170
[ __ ] up throw out the trash can and

1317
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:26,190
[ __ ] walk away and just move on so

1318
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:27,360
when you have some [ __ ] happen to you

1319
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,130
just trying to learn something to think

1320
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:32,180
about it like that because I've been

1321
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:34,829
stuck on something and breaking that rig

1322
00:46:32,179 --> 00:46:36,359
was definitely symbolic in some way to

1323
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:37,889
me and I learned something from it I

1324
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:40,140
just wanted to share that with you guys

1325
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:41,609
I broke a rig and I wanted a huge life

1326
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:44,219
lesson from it that had nothing to do

1327
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:45,640
with the rig itself I just this moment

1328
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:48,699
of Zen came over me and taught me

1329
00:46:45,639 --> 00:46:49,598
life lesson wanted to share that I hope

1330
00:46:48,699 --> 00:46:50,618
you enjoyed it hope you learned

1331
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,760
something from it also if there's

1332
00:46:50,619 --> 00:46:53,500
something that you're [ __ ] stuck on

1333
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:56,109
that you're clinging to just let it go

1334
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:58,420
dude no it's easier said than done but I

1335
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:59,739
dropped a $300 rig and I swept it up and

1336
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,409
threw it away there's nothing we can do

1337
00:46:59,739 --> 00:47:03,879
about it just sometimes you got to sweep

1338
00:47:02,409 --> 00:47:05,679
some [ __ ] up and move on I didn't get

1339
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:07,599
cut from the rig and I had fun hitting

1340
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,018
it when I hit it so that's all I could

1341
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:09,640
do

1342
00:47:08,018 --> 00:47:11,318

1445
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:28,549
from the mystic roots band they allow me

1446
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:30,260
to play their music at the start of the

1447
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:33,320
show that is cool as [ __ ] because

1448
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:34,820
playing music on a podcast is expensive

1449
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,080
oh that sounds great

1450
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,690
weird it's gotta pay to play people's

1451
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,150
music on your show do that music should

1452
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:44,269
be free free free free freedom royalties

1453
00:51:41,150 --> 00:51:50,450
royalties are royalty we're the kings of

1454
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:52,070

1537
00:54:57,949 --> 00:55:01,339
I've been using a lot more grow coffee a

1538
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,780
lot of worm castings and stuff and I've

1539
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,059
got a question about that coming up for

1540

1542

pie heads showed up to my house early I

1546
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:26,419
was impressed this will be a perfect

1547
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:28,489
question since you guys are from the

1548
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:29,510
organic side of the growing I've been

1549
00:55:28,489 --> 00:55:31,339
talked about grow Kashi

1550
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:33,710
I actually gave some grow Kashi away in

1551
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:35,329
a prize package recently and one of my

1552
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:37,929
listeners a lot of the listeners have

1553
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:40,369
been asking how to use the grow Kashi I

1554
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:41,929
read the instructions and it says to

1555
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:43,130
fill up your reservoir with however many

1556
00:55:41,929 --> 00:55:45,079
gallons of water and then you add a

1557
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,490
third of a cup of coffee and then you

1558
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:48,019
mix in I don't remember the specific

1559
00:55:46,489 --> 00:55:50,659
amount of molasses but she makes in a

1560
00:55:48,019 --> 00:55:53,420
specific amount of molasses per gallon

1561
00:55:50,659 --> 00:55:56,420
and then you let it sit for 24 to 48

1562
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:58,159
hours and then that I use that excuse

1563
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,070
mic off guys we took some gnarly dabs

1564
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:02,809
after that's mixed I use that and just

1565
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:04,910
water into the top of my plants and I

1566
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:06,590
notice that they love it do you guys

1567
00:56:04,909 --> 00:56:12,799
have other ways that you prefer or

1568
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:13,850
recommend because this is Allen on the

1569
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,910
mic just so that you know who you're

1570
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:20,130
listening to you can put it in your teas

1571
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:22,199
top dress you can get you mycelium going

1572
00:56:20,130 --> 00:56:26,160
on the top layer with that sometimes you

1573
00:56:22,199 --> 00:56:28,379
want to you know put a mulch down okay

1574
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:31,768
definitely have seen results layering it

1575
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:35,358
in your pot as you transplant okay so

1576
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:35,358
some dirt then some kocchi kocchi

1577
00:56:37,789 --> 00:56:41,730
in there throw in some worm castings

1578
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:43,798
right worm castings every every time

1579
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,119
everywhere I've seen you know I've seen

1580
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:47,210
a difference in my plants I've only been

1581
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,559
using them for a week in my plants

1582
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:51,059
they're more vigorous they're wanting to

1583
00:56:49,559 --> 00:56:52,619
more they're wanting more water more

1584
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:54,210
often because they're growing so much

1585
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,818
more it's because it learning how to eat

1586
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:59,220
by themselves okay they're starting to

1587
00:56:56,818 --> 00:57:00,088
cycle nutrients basically what you're

1588
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:02,338
doing is when you're growing

1589
00:57:00,088 --> 00:57:06,358
synthetically you just bypassing this

1590
00:57:02,338 --> 00:57:14,489
entire organic I mean you're just

1591
00:57:06,358 --> 00:57:16,889
cutting everything out that's actually

1592
00:57:14,489 --> 00:57:17,579
why hydros have to supplement with so

1593
00:57:16,889 --> 00:57:19,949
much co2

1594
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:22,650
there's no co2 produced in the

1595
00:57:19,949 --> 00:57:24,239
decomposition of the natural soil okay I

1596
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:43,170
don't have the number in front of me

1597
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:50,579
I've been doing some research and that

1598
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:58,170
goes back to the crimes between Kashi

1599
00:57:50,579 --> 00:58:00,210
and grow Kashi on the show it's kind of

1600
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:02,460
like it's like a bait you know like the

1601
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,869
band-aid brand the girl Chi she's kind

1602
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:07,130
of taken over the industry like that

1603
00:58:03,869 --> 00:58:07,130
okay so grow Kashi

1604
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:14,619
they are the same thing is just Brokaw

1605
00:58:11,349 --> 00:58:19,059
she makes their own mix of [ __ ] okay

1606
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:20,650
[ __ ] is nothing but a yeah basically

1607
00:58:19,059 --> 00:58:23,259
it's a brayer it can be any medium you

1608
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:25,780
can use sticks or stones or oak brand

1609
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:27,370
just any sort of carbon-based material

1610
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:30,700
and then you're gonna knock you late it

1611
00:58:27,369 --> 00:58:33,009
with typically yeast photosynthetic

1612
00:58:30,699 --> 00:58:38,339
bacteria and lactic acid bacteria so

1613
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:38,340
that's an e/m one follower feeds and

1614
00:58:40,199 --> 00:58:44,439
guru Kashi

1615
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:47,019
actually adds in glacial rock dust for

1616
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:50,829
trace minerals so that's kind of what

1617
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:52,269
makes up their mix okay Rocky Mount worm

1618
00:58:50,829 --> 00:59:02,319
company will actually start carrying

1619
00:58:52,269 --> 00:59:03,489
their own food with humic acid Wow yeah

1620
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:11,920
so basically you'll get a little piece

1621
00:59:03,489 --> 00:59:15,279
of our gardens keep it local trying to

1622
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:16,690
keep everything in Colorado really cool

1623
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:26,080
yeah because it's important especially

1624
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:28,179
in the cannabis community to integrated

1625
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,400
you know up in NorCal a lot of that's

1626
00:59:28,179 --> 00:59:32,529
how farming should work exactly exactly

1627
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,200
it's a specialized product but is

1628
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:37,000
definitely artisan products you know it

1629
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:40,719
goes with anything with wine cheese

1630
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:43,329
meats you know it's just you should have

1631
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:46,299
its instruments yeah you know anything

1632
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:49,029
cars should want the best in you know

1633
00:59:46,300 --> 00:59:51,710
with organic practices that's what you

1634
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:54,050
get an actual medicine that's

1635
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:56,769
pure you know you're not smoking

1636
00:59:54,050 --> 01:00:00,050
anything that should be in your body and

1637
00:59:56,769 --> 01:00:01,639
yeah you know just give me the yeah get

1638
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:03,890
away from the man and dad makes me want

1639
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:10,179
to get back to the how to use the Kashi

1640
01:00:03,889 --> 01:00:13,699
yeah I definitely try to do that yes

1641
01:00:10,179 --> 01:00:18,889
basically for me personally if you just

1642
01:00:13,699 --> 01:00:21,919
want me to tell you hi oh thank you so

1643
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:25,480
basically when I do my initial trains

1644
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,470
plane out of a Red Solo Cup I'll

1645
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:30,289
traditionally cuz I make my own soils

1646
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:33,469
will have Prakash unit already or my own

1647
01:00:30,289 --> 01:00:35,150
form of Kakashi or Akashi so will it'll

1648
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:37,969
happen in the soil mix but I always top

1649
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:41,119
dress every time I transplant always top

1650
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:43,009
dress and usually it's with cover crop a

1651
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,349
little bit of grow Kashi a little bit of

1652
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:47,329
worm castings and then I'll just water

1653
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:49,609
it in with the product we carry that's

1654
01:00:47,329 --> 01:00:53,420
called sea crop I heard a lot about that

1655
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:56,088
it's it's amazing it's basically it's

1656
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:59,838
kind of like fermented sea water is that

1657
01:00:56,088 --> 01:01:01,759
your fish no it's not a fish I would say

1658
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:03,650
I used this in place traditionally if

1659
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:05,569
you're familiar with full power okay I

1660
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:07,460
use it in the place that it's got a lot

1661
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:08,808
of fulvic acids a lot of trace minerals

1662
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,470
a lot of things that you're not gonna

1663
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:15,609
get from your basic what you see a lot

1664
01:01:12,469 --> 01:01:18,798
of coastal we don't we don't have a

1665
01:01:15,608 --> 01:01:21,078
micronutrient bottle to use so we use a

1666
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:22,759
secret but yeah so I usually water in

1667
01:01:21,079 --> 01:01:27,048
with the sea crop right after that and

1668
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:29,540
then we'll roll into basically after

1669
01:01:27,048 --> 01:01:32,900
that it'll be every two weeks I'll go

1670
01:01:29,539 --> 01:01:34,429
through and do a drawer Kashi drag which

1671
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:37,280
is basically what you're referring to

1672
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:40,818
okay I do mine a little bit differently

1673
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:43,500
so what I like to do is use a grinded

1674
01:01:40,818 --> 01:01:47,190
herbs traditionally like a

1675
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:50,880
DraganFlyer is medicine so I use a take

1676
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:54,240
basically if I'm doing a 10-gallon thing

1677
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:56,460
of tea or Kashi dreg so I'll take my

1678
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,500
dragon flowers medicine I'll mix it in

1679
01:01:56,460 --> 01:02:01,260
there depending on you know flowers edge

1680
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:02,969
radiant green or flat flower dump that

1681
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,790
in there if you don't have those you can

1682
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:07,318
use alfalfa kelp okay you know so I

1683
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:08,909
dumped that in there it usually whatever

1684
01:02:07,318 --> 01:02:13,139
recommended rate you're gonna run a tea

1685
01:02:08,909 --> 01:02:16,440
with then I add 1/4 cup uh you know

1686
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:18,659
Bokashi per gallon forth a cup of worm

1687
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:23,250
castings per gallon and then one

1688
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:26,129
teaspoon of depending on what stage I'll

1689
01:02:23,250 --> 01:02:28,139
either use molasses or you could do some

1690
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:30,568
sort of carbohydrate source yeah and

1691
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:31,440
then I seal it up and then forget about

1692
01:02:30,568 --> 01:02:35,369
it

1693
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:37,409
they see like 12 to 24 hours but in my

1694
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:46,318
personal experience nothing's wrong with

1695
01:02:37,409 --> 01:02:50,789
taking the 14 days is bad okay

1696
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:52,679
and your if you're familiar with things

1697
01:02:50,789 --> 01:02:54,960
like that you'll you'll start to learn

1698
01:02:52,679 --> 01:02:58,259
what good ferments are what bad ferments

1699
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:03,000
are almost sweet bitter and not funky

1700
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:10,530
exactly what's the what's the fish smell

1701
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:13,050
overpowers then it's funk right what I

1702
01:03:10,530 --> 01:03:14,760
usually do is everybody's probably got a

1703
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,890
bunch of pan to film laying around

1704
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:18,930
somewhere so what I usually do is cut a

1705
01:03:16,889 --> 01:03:20,460
big square or have a big square pan to

1706
01:03:18,929 --> 01:03:23,669
film that was leftover from like a floor

1707
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:25,559
door or something I made and I just lay

1708
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:27,750
it over the container and wrap it and

1709
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:38,460
string and tie it tight there you go

1710
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:40,108
that's it happened by nature running

1711
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:44,400
down a hill into a big shitty puddle

1712
01:03:40,108 --> 01:03:47,130
exactly and the idea is that you we're

1713
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,139
gonna try to balance out aerobic and

1714
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:51,329
anaerobic bacteria

1715
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:53,069
in nature both exist like you're the

1716
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:58,440
exact reason you were saying things fall

1717
01:03:53,070 --> 01:04:00,780
on the ground the hot spots in the

1718
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:03,240
ground so by introducing these things on

1719
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:04,890
a regular basis I have you know I feel

1720
01:04:03,239 --> 01:04:08,339
that that's where we're kind of getting

1721
01:04:04,889 --> 01:04:09,659
a biological edge I see a difference in

1722
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,250
my plants and I know it's only been a

1723
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:12,960
couple of weeks but just feeding them

1724
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:13,500
they're more vigorous they are ready to

1725
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,099
grow

1726
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,539
it's basically so you've got your

1727
01:04:16,099 --> 01:04:20,250
protozoa cycle nutrients your fungal

1728
01:04:18,539 --> 01:04:21,509
hypha the bacterial content there's

1729
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:25,559
nematodes in there

1730
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:26,880
so you're just getting this funny

1731
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:27,960
because you know you go to the Hydra

1732
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:29,670
store when you see that they sell

1733
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,139
nematodes and you see that they sell

1734
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:33,720
great white and you see that they sell

1735
01:04:31,139 --> 01:04:35,879
OTT and they sell all of these things

1736
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:37,649
and it's like you take some time to go

1737
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:39,450
to Rocky Mount warm company's website

1738
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:40,860
you can actually look it up and you'll

1739
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:43,799
see that all of these things are already

1740
01:04:40,860 --> 01:04:47,670
in your worm castings you can make your

1741
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:50,070
own small scoops of worm castings in a

1742
01:04:47,670 --> 01:04:51,480
five-gallon bucket of water good clean

1743
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:53,610
water reverse osmosis clean

1744
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:55,079
dechlorinated water and bubble that [ __ ]

1745
01:04:53,610 --> 01:04:56,789
for like 12 hours and you've just made

1746
01:04:55,079 --> 01:04:58,679
great white you've made all of those

1747
01:04:56,789 --> 01:05:02,099
products on the shelf exactly and I will

1748
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:04,019
say that if you're new to making teas or

1749
01:05:02,099 --> 01:05:06,329
even if you're familiar with making teas

1750
01:05:04,019 --> 01:05:08,190
with worm castings a lot of people you

1751
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:10,559
we use like Alaska houmous

1752
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:11,909
from general organics yeah so different

1753
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,969
things like that traditionally they're

1754
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:16,829
using one cup per gallon please don't

1755
01:05:14,969 --> 01:05:21,569
waste your like you're just gonna be

1756
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:29,909
wasting money and forth the cup per

1757
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:32,070
gallon oh you're honestly that's one I

1758
01:05:29,909 --> 01:05:34,139
would even go one cup per five-gallon

1759
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:36,059
bucket okay yeah just to keep it real

1760
01:05:34,139 --> 01:05:38,969
simple nice but yeah that's you're gonna

1761
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:40,799
get every foam you guys leave room for

1762
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:43,019
foam such it's gonna fall if you if you

1763
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:45,490
do have a problem with the phone you can

1764
01:05:43,019 --> 01:05:47,530
always add in some sort of like

1765
01:05:45,489 --> 01:05:49,719
fat lipid so you could use like a fish

1766
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:53,170
hide really it'll take it out neem oil

1767
01:05:49,719 --> 01:05:55,629
Carazo oil coconut oil if I put neem oil

1768
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:58,119
in there how much would I use honestly

1769
01:05:55,630 --> 01:06:00,160
to take away phone you would just kind

1770
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:02,470
of like drip it off your finger out of

1771
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:04,269
the bottom it'll just kind of go away I

1772
01:06:02,469 --> 01:06:06,489
would recommend more let's just throw in

1773
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:08,259
a plant love coconuts

1774
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:17,649
I mean seriously coconut water coconut

1775
01:06:08,260 --> 01:06:19,450
powder throw at you like if your stuff's

1776
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:21,070
foaming up too bad throw you a little

1777
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:22,689
bit of coconut oil in there your plants

1778
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:25,930
will like it fine we'll go away keep

1779
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:29,579
your fuller nice and clean if not buy a

1780
01:06:25,929 --> 01:06:29,579
drip tray twice the size of your brewer

1781
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:37,420
[Music]

1782
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:39,309
I used when I started I've been through

1783
01:06:37,420 --> 01:06:41,139
every nutrient line I miss back in the

1784
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:43,449
day mixing forty two bottles of advance

1785
01:06:41,139 --> 01:06:45,009
nutrients used to be fun I feel like the

1786
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:46,960
mad scientist looking for the perfect

1787
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:48,100
mix and now I can do it with my organics

1788
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:54,010
with the help of you yeah that's how I

1789
01:06:48,099 --> 01:06:56,199
first started was a minute I messed

1790
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:58,359
those plants up I feel so bad and I wish

1791
01:06:56,199 --> 01:07:01,000
I had went with organics but I was

1792
01:06:58,358 --> 01:07:03,369
nervous but now after actually you know

1793
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,800
practicing it and going hands-on and

1794
01:07:03,369 --> 01:07:07,390
just kind of diving in and after reading

1795
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:09,010
a lot of the books you know they help

1796
01:07:07,389 --> 01:07:12,389
but you get to the end of them and it's

1797
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:15,400
like this is just life and just what

1798
01:07:12,389 --> 01:07:17,529
you've learned in science class it's

1799
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:19,269
nothing new it's just you know going a

1800
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:22,320
little farther beyond and that's where

1801
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:25,750
like Korean farming comes into you know

1802
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:28,510
more hands-on but once you you know

1803
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:32,469
start somewhere small with worm castings

1804
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:34,150
you know if you're trying to get

1805
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:36,250
hardcore into it you want to be

1806
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:37,780
completely self-sufficient and we can

1807
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:39,608
help you do that I mean I'm serious we

1808
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,780
can help you too where you you'll never

1809
01:07:39,608 --> 01:07:43,480
have to go to the Hydra store you'll

1810
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:46,570
never have to come to G you'll never

1811
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:49,329
have to rely on anybody to grow your own

1812
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:50,920
plants but in order to do that you're

1813
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:52,569
gonna have to start somewhere right

1814
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:55,030
and that's someone's the hard part is

1815
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:56,710
worm castings okay I've jumped in

1816
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,830
exactly and once you start with that

1817
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:01,329
base and then you'll start to understand

1818
01:07:58,829 --> 01:08:13,569
okay this is why I'm mixing it in with

1819
01:08:01,329 --> 01:08:16,329
the soil this is what they're doing the

1820
01:08:13,570 --> 01:08:17,890
bottom usually those roots that fall out

1821
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:19,180
of the holes like that they die off but

1822
01:08:17,890 --> 01:08:20,829
they're still reaching they're crawling

1823
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:23,140
around the room on the floor like I can

1824
01:08:20,829 --> 01:08:24,699
find some more I'm sure they're stoked

1825
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,890
about life in there yeah a little shop a

1826
01:08:24,699 --> 01:08:34,119
harvest that's it yeah yep I got huge

1827
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:36,190
roots now just a little Kashi and a litt

1828
01:08:34,119 --> 01:08:37,899
two applications of worm castings is

1829
01:08:36,189 --> 01:08:40,210
really all it is don't be afraid to use

1830
01:08:37,899 --> 01:08:42,278
the worm castings in the soil mixes and

1831
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:44,560
you know when you transplant in percent

1832
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:48,370
is what I typically go with okay for my

1833
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:49,690
personal how long does it take for those

1834
01:08:48,369 --> 01:08:53,909
worm castings to become five

1835
01:08:49,689 --> 01:08:57,219
bioavailable to my plants I would say

1836
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:58,899
theoretically instantaneously okay yeah

1837
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:01,900
so you're just break down there's no NP

1838
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:05,619
cave art so there isn't it there is an m

1839
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:07,059
PK value but that's not why so when

1840
01:09:05,619 --> 01:09:09,068
you're adding them the reason that

1841
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:10,900
you're gonna get I I'm not gonna say

1842
01:09:09,069 --> 01:09:12,940
instant results but it results so quick

1843
01:09:10,899 --> 01:09:14,349
is because when you introduce those

1844
01:09:12,939 --> 01:09:15,939
you're not like it's not like a

1845
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:18,370
fertilizer that you're waiting to be

1846
01:09:15,939 --> 01:09:21,369
it's absorbed by the exactly its life

1847
01:09:18,369 --> 01:09:23,619
you just dropped a spaceship and some

1848
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:25,329
little worms in these worm castings you

1849
01:09:23,619 --> 01:09:29,738
guys they're little tiny baby worms in

1850
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:31,539
the package tells me that that [ __ ] is

1851
01:09:29,738 --> 01:09:32,979
alive if that worm was alive in there he

1852
01:09:31,539 --> 01:09:34,359
got shipped they were packaged in

1853
01:09:32,979 --> 01:09:35,858
Colorado Springs as far as I know I

1854
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:39,279
bought it in Pueblo at Highgrove

1855
01:09:35,859 --> 01:09:40,539
I had it in my in my car for a day

1856
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:42,040
before I even was able to bring it in

1857
01:09:40,539 --> 01:09:44,130
the house cuz you can't haul in all the

1858
01:09:42,039 --> 01:09:46,470
gross [ __ ] during the day you know

1859
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:48,810
I will say though when purchasing worm

1860
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:50,520
castings the first thing you want to do

1861
01:09:48,810 --> 01:10:18,270
is you want to put them in a sealed

1862
01:09:50,520 --> 01:10:21,660
container because they will dry out it

1863
01:10:18,270 --> 01:11:08,610
smells good but I love that because I

1864
01:10:21,659 --> 01:11:18,630
love the smell good you know that's a

1865
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:19,949
beautiful place to visit the poppy seed

1866
01:11:18,630 --> 01:11:23,430
there's a chiropractor up there the

1867
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:25,050
charge is a dollar a minute I think he's

1868
01:11:23,430 --> 01:11:30,470
awesome he pops one of my favorite

1869
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:30,470
people he pops her back I don't know

1870
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:37,050
cool he knows that we were he knows

1871
01:11:35,189 --> 01:11:39,589
that's where his patient works and the

1872
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:39,590
arcade

1873
01:11:53,659 --> 01:12:57,170
we're turning into mixing soil

1874
01:12:55,439 --> 01:13:02,659
traditionally it's 2 percent by volume

1875
01:12:57,170 --> 01:13:02,659
okay so 2 gallons for 200 gallons okay

1876
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:10,259
like a trough or something or by a res

1877
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:14,039
or something that makes up your ground

1878
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:15,469
works but it slow down and it pulls are

1879
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:25,769
awesome there you go that's a good idea

1880
01:13:15,469 --> 01:13:29,159
buckets and then freak out that's good

1881
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:30,540
but you're aiming for see that white

1882
01:13:29,159 --> 01:13:32,880
growth and throw their [ __ ] away and

1883
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:35,219
don't do this it makes you soil grab

1884
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:36,359
some guru Kashi it makes it so if you're

1885
01:13:35,219 --> 01:13:38,010
gonna read amend your soil make sure

1886
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:39,838
grow Kashi and put your amendments in

1887
01:13:38,010 --> 01:13:42,599
there like you're saying mix it up in a

1888
01:13:39,838 --> 01:13:45,118
you know kiddie pool or on a tarp but a

1889
01:13:42,599 --> 01:13:47,819
Rubbermaid container and then what I

1890
01:13:45,118 --> 01:13:52,348
would recommend doing is swinging by J's

1891
01:13:47,819 --> 01:13:54,389
and picking up either cocoons or if you

1892
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:57,569
really want to like it's a lot of fun

1893
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:59,519
but live worms and I throw them in there

1894
01:13:57,569 --> 01:14:02,280
okay and just let them go to town

1895
01:13:59,519 --> 01:14:04,889
because either they're gonna die or

1896
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:06,628
they're gonna survive they self populate

1897
01:14:04,889 --> 01:14:11,248
so they'll either get in there they'll

1898
01:14:06,628 --> 01:14:14,338
do well if your soil is optimal your

1899
01:14:11,248 --> 01:14:17,849
worms will reproduce and you will have

1900
01:14:14,338 --> 01:14:19,889
an active soil food web and they do help

1901
01:14:17,849 --> 01:14:22,349
but I know Shawn's had experience with

1902
01:14:19,889 --> 01:14:24,149
them kind of over hurting the plant with

1903
01:14:22,349 --> 01:14:26,159
breaking down yeah they find hot spots

1904
01:14:24,149 --> 01:14:27,599
so if you make sure so let's say let's

1905
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:29,128
say that she makes your soil and you're

1906
01:14:27,599 --> 01:14:32,338
like dang I don't know if I did that

1907
01:14:29,128 --> 01:14:34,618
good enough stir that worms in there and

1908
01:14:32,338 --> 01:14:36,779
they tend to like they find hot spots

1909
01:14:34,618 --> 01:14:38,608
and work their way through it and they

1910
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:42,029
tend to break it up but yeah actually I

1911
01:14:38,609 --> 01:14:43,679
was running I went into one of my rooms

1912
01:14:42,029 --> 01:14:45,599
and saw some my test plants with a

1913
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,279
little bit of nitrogen toxicity err so

1914
01:14:45,599 --> 01:14:48,809
the tips of the leaves were kind of

1915
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:55,318
pointing at the ground they're a little

1916
01:14:48,809 --> 01:14:59,099
dark green yeah this is weird so is

1917
01:14:55,319 --> 01:15:03,059
actually alfalfa hay that I mulch that

1918
01:14:59,099 --> 01:15:05,458
used to mulch with but the worms went

1919
01:15:03,059 --> 01:15:08,909
crazy in it started just eating the [ __ ]

1920
01:15:05,458 --> 01:15:09,688
out of and I guess they cycled it and

1921
01:15:08,908 --> 01:15:11,608
invert my plant

1922
01:15:09,689 --> 01:15:16,739
I didn't earn my plan but just because

1923
01:15:11,609 --> 01:15:18,449
it was pretty amazing you can kind of

1924
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:19,768
overdo it with organics as well yeah I

1925
01:15:18,448 --> 01:15:22,378
mean you don't yeah you really want to

1926
01:15:19,769 --> 01:15:24,449
be lessons more with organics you you're

1927
01:15:22,378 --> 01:15:26,219
gonna know what breaks down in what

1928
01:15:24,448 --> 01:15:29,428
fashion how long it takes to break down

1929
01:15:26,219 --> 01:15:32,128
and you know knowing your plant don't

1930
01:15:29,429 --> 01:15:34,679
don't run one plant one cycle in

1931
01:15:32,128 --> 01:15:36,179
organics and give up because you you

1932
01:15:34,679 --> 01:15:37,828
want to dial that in and it's it might

1933
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:41,819
take one or two runs but that's the

1934
01:15:37,828 --> 01:15:44,158
beginning and then whatever your best

1935
01:15:41,819 --> 01:15:46,469
friend told you to mix your soil at do

1936
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:48,688
it half that rate because it's way

1937
01:15:46,469 --> 01:15:49,189
easier to fix the deficiency when this

1938
01:15:48,689 --> 01:15:55,969
is default

1939
01:15:49,189 --> 01:15:58,629
some sort of all the time do you carry

1940
01:15:55,969 --> 01:16:01,310
any sort of dehydrated coconut water yes

1941
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:03,650
I don't want to say yes so we've been

1942
01:16:01,310 --> 01:16:07,160
working really hard um we kind of

1943
01:16:03,649 --> 01:16:12,159
revamping inventory we're carrying soon

1944
01:16:07,159 --> 01:16:12,159
movie cover crops will be available all

1945
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:18,440
not just will be able to offer things

1946
01:16:16,399 --> 01:16:20,359
like alfalfa meal crustacean me oyster

1947
01:16:18,439 --> 01:16:22,759
shell powder kelp meal it's all food

1948
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:42,559
great it's all organic but I'll also be

1949
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:47,500
carrying company in the next few months

1950
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,500
is definitely gonna be changing a face

1951
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:55,550
definitely gonna have a lot more things

1952
01:16:53,869 --> 01:17:01,039
available to them for their organic

1953
01:16:55,550 --> 01:17:04,520
needs so just keep an eye out of like a

1954
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:07,670
feed chart you're offering is that

1955
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:09,199
available yet not yet so basically we're

1956
01:17:07,670 --> 01:17:12,380
trying to work out inventory first

1957
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:19,519
before we tell you okay what do you use

1958
01:17:12,380 --> 01:17:21,890
and not have it for you to use we've

1959
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:23,900
worked it out a couple of times a couple

1960
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:25,130
of the products that we were had an

1961
01:17:23,899 --> 01:17:26,599
owner Rock we calling it the rocky

1962
01:17:25,130 --> 01:17:28,250
mountain actual farming schedule a

1963
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,440
couple of things that we had on there

1964
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:32,060
initially are a little harder to source

1965
01:17:30,439 --> 01:17:34,399
and I don't think that we'll be able to

1966
01:17:32,060 --> 01:17:35,989
keep the regiment up if people actually

1967
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,269
pick it on yeah so we're trying to make

1968
01:17:35,988 --> 01:17:39,948
sure that if that occasion does happen

1969
01:17:38,270 --> 01:17:42,650
like I was saying I mean I guess we can

1970
01:17:39,948 --> 01:17:44,689
say here a bought the damn grinder so

1971
01:17:42,649 --> 01:17:46,579
we're gonna start powder izing our own

1972
01:17:44,689 --> 01:17:47,689
herbs even if we don't start selling

1973
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:49,149
them we'll start be doing we're gonna

1974
01:17:47,689 --> 01:17:52,960
start doing experiment so

1975
01:17:49,149 --> 01:17:57,039
powder IDs in the room but we will have

1976
01:17:52,960 --> 01:18:01,630
I would say April is gonna be how is the

1977
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:03,250

01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:23,189
down to make it taste better it's such a

2099
01:24:20,039 --> 01:24:35,489
toss-up there's a slogan they have for

2100
01:24:23,189 --> 01:24:38,899
that you don't waste it watch that movie

2101
01:24:35,489 --> 01:24:38,899

2102
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:46,800
they kill that movie first few minutes I

2103
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:48,930
wanted to smack Franco he's gonna ruin

2104
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,159
this movie but the director must have

2105
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:51,780
pulled him aside I've been like tone it

2106

2107
01:24:51,779 --> 01:24:56,460
just go you just I think now you're just

2108
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:59,220
gonna let that man do what he he does

2109
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,609
cuz he if no one's watched Freaks and

2110
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:05,490
Geeks

2111
01:24:59,609 --> 01:25:07,079
it's an older show but it's a great show

2112
01:25:05,489 --> 01:25:13,500
check that out it's it's old-school

2113
01:25:07,079 --> 01:25:16,529
Franco that was the movie though you

2114
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:19,560
know just like they perfectly did the

2115
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:21,630
Lord of the Rings references on King

2116
01:25:19,560 --> 01:25:23,400
that was that was needed in that movie

2117
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:26,400
but uh that was just a beautiful movie

2118
01:25:23,399 --> 01:25:29,279
so I was glad that Netflix put that on

2119
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:31,199
there so so like a bow kashi bucket yeah

2120
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:34,920
yes it will get you Bokashi bucket will

2121
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:37,569
stir a bit composts so we can start

2122
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:41,670
recycling all your kitchen scrap

2123
01:25:37,569 --> 01:25:44,109
and then as far as your plant ways

2124
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:47,170
different materials like that we can

2125
01:25:44,109 --> 01:25:49,000
also show you how to recycle those

2126
01:25:47,170 --> 01:25:51,819
basically what you're gonna want what I

2127
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,310
would recommend doing would be so you

2128
01:25:51,819 --> 01:25:56,769
want to start a compost bin take a

2129
01:25:54,310 --> 01:25:59,170
leftover pop from last season start out

2130
01:25:56,770 --> 01:26:01,540
with a nice soil base just dump it in

2131
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:03,520
there and then just feel free to start

2132
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:06,100
adding stuff you know throw stuff in

2133
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,840
there I keep a bucket in like a

2134
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:10,660
five-gallon bucket in my back door and

2135
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,460
I'll just throw things into it and then

2136
01:26:10,659 --> 01:26:14,470
every couple of days I'll walk that out

2137
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:17,140
to the actual compost pile in my back

2138
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:20,949
yard okay and then dump that in there

2139
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:22,539
throw some worm cast I do four per like

2140
01:26:20,949 --> 01:26:25,019
five gallon bucket full I'll do like a

2141
01:26:22,539 --> 01:26:33,399
handful of worm castings

2142
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:36,070
the secret is brewers yeast if you

2143
01:26:33,399 --> 01:26:40,989
really want to Bokashi green yeah if you

2144
01:26:36,069 --> 01:26:42,819
look at uh what is it by unity the

2145
01:26:40,989 --> 01:26:45,369
company their fungal their compost

2146
01:26:42,819 --> 01:26:50,139
accelerator is like worm castings kelp

2147
01:26:45,369 --> 01:26:51,789
and brewers yeast yeah you'd be amazed

2148
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:59,170
which you can find out there like how do

2149

2150
01:26:59,170 --> 01:27:08,409
know and then if it says it and you're

2151
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:10,810
like wait help brewers yeast extract

2152
01:27:08,409 --> 01:27:13,960
molasses you can source it from

2153
01:27:10,810 --> 01:27:15,700
somewhere that is sourcing and naturally

2154
01:27:13,960 --> 01:27:17,409
whether they grow is sustainably or

2155
01:27:15,699 --> 01:27:19,119
they've been growing it for a while you

2156
01:27:17,409 --> 01:27:22,180
might not be able to get it from where

2157
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:23,949
you are um but you know someone is

2158
01:27:22,180 --> 01:27:27,520
making it somewhere and if you want it

2159
01:27:23,949 --> 01:27:29,819
it might be you know you're not looking

2160
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:29,820
hard

2161
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:37,890
that's true those people are your

2162
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,890
friends now

2163
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,618
[Music]

2164
01:28:04,930 --> 01:28:14,619
it got repurposed it didn't get thrown

2165
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:14,620
in a landfill I was really motivated

2166
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:26,079
really motivated you kind of murdered

2167
01:28:22,970 --> 01:28:31,449
yourself trying to be so motivated

2168
01:28:26,079 --> 01:28:31,449
basically all I had to pay for power

2169
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:38,840
organics keep to your past not gonna lie

2170
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:40,700
the past like half a year has been a

2171
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:43,039
little rough and I didn't have all the

2172
01:28:40,699 --> 01:28:45,859
money to really do what we wanted to so

2173
01:28:43,039 --> 01:28:47,659
it was let's buy fruit let's take the

2174
01:28:45,859 --> 01:28:51,469
cores and the skins and the pits and

2175
01:28:47,659 --> 01:28:54,380
let's per minute of it so I can grow

2176
01:28:51,470 --> 01:28:56,210
microgreens and peas and sprouts and I

2177
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:58,789
can eat them in my sandwiches but I can

2178
01:28:56,210 --> 01:29:01,069
also further them use them as a tea

2179
01:28:58,789 --> 01:29:02,659
additive or a foliar spray yeah the same

2180
01:29:01,069 --> 01:29:04,599
thing with my eggs I can buy an eggs

2181
01:29:02,659 --> 01:29:07,670
from the store I'm gonna save my

2182
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:09,560
eggshells because I can use that with

2183
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:11,930
apple cider vinegar which already buying

2184
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:14,390
because I you know I drink it for health

2185
01:29:11,930 --> 01:29:16,610
resist wash my dress with it yeah so you

2186
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:18,079
just mix that so you Brown eggshell

2187
01:29:16,609 --> 01:29:19,549
crushing Marc Brown some eggshells mix

2188
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:21,979
it with apple cider vinegar water

2189
01:29:19,550 --> 01:29:24,680
soluble calcium yeah so you can make

2190
01:29:21,979 --> 01:29:27,979
everything in your growth with nothing

2191
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:29,630
if you have done it it's easy to learn

2192
01:29:27,979 --> 01:29:31,069
where it comes from what it is where

2193
01:29:29,630 --> 01:29:32,750
nature would have provided it go by the

2194
01:29:31,069 --> 01:29:34,399
Orianna fit if you're hungry and you

2195
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:36,770
need say so if you and your plants are

2196
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:38,539
hungry in the same at the same time I

2197
01:29:36,770 --> 01:29:40,250
recommend doing is cruising on down your

2198
01:29:38,539 --> 01:29:42,329
local Asian market and grabbing you some

2199
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:45,300
black fish the darker the better

2200
01:29:42,329 --> 01:29:46,380
I don't know the exact reason but I just

2201
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:49,619
go with it

2202
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:52,289
so you better dr. Chow said and say I

2203
01:29:49,619 --> 01:29:54,420
mean you gotta just gotta go he's a kind

2204
01:29:52,289 --> 01:29:57,300
of the founder natural farming okay

2205
01:29:54,420 --> 01:30:00,930
but yes that you can take some literally

2206
01:29:57,300 --> 01:30:03,930
go and buy you some fish clean it eat

2207
01:30:00,930 --> 01:30:06,360
what you want whatever's leftover blend

2208
01:30:03,930 --> 01:30:09,060
it you know typically with like a brown

2209
01:30:06,359 --> 01:30:11,899
sugar blend it all up together that's

2210
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:14,600
important and then seal it in 30 days

2211
01:30:11,899 --> 01:30:17,929
strain it

2212
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:20,850
IMO which or which is an indigenous

2213
01:30:17,930 --> 01:30:22,800
microorganisms e-m1 or lactic acid

2214
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:24,450
bacteria any of those will really work

2215
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,400
in that situation and that's the one

2216
01:30:24,449 --> 01:30:29,010
thing about organic gardening and

2217
01:30:26,399 --> 01:30:31,619
sourcing things locally it's gonna help

2218
01:30:29,010 --> 01:30:33,780
you plant fight off a lot of different

2219
01:30:31,619 --> 01:30:37,470
diseases pests that are found in your

2220
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:50,309
region outside use a lot of different

2221
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:51,930
IMO's all right I don't want to say it's

2222
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:53,760
a class we can go ahead and mention it

2223
01:30:51,930 --> 01:30:56,400
on here so we want to start doing

2224
01:30:53,760 --> 01:31:00,030
classes but we need to know who wants to

2225
01:30:56,399 --> 01:31:01,289
come to them yeah we're gonna try to

2226
01:31:00,029 --> 01:31:03,929

2249
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,890
classes I think they did like cloning

2250
01:31:51,880 --> 01:31:55,930
last time and some really awesome

2251
01:31:53,890 --> 01:31:58,360
introduction classes yeah see I'm hoping

2252
01:31:55,930 --> 01:32:06,340
we can kind of team up and maybe do some

2253
01:31:58,359 --> 01:32:08,339
more advanced classes for if you come to

2254
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:09,940
us and you feel like maybe you need to

2255
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:11,920
something you know what I mean maybe

2256
01:32:09,939 --> 01:32:15,159
we're a little over your head contact

2257
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:16,510
high grow and Jesse and I'll tell you

2258
01:32:15,159 --> 01:32:18,130
the walk you through the process they'll

2259
01:32:16,510 --> 01:32:20,020
teach you how to clone they'll teach you

2260
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:22,300
how to pH or they'll do whatever you

2261
01:32:20,020 --> 01:32:23,680
need they'll get you going and then

2262
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:26,890
whenever you feel comfortable are you

2263
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:29,260
ready come to us you know and yeah I try

2264
01:32:26,890 --> 01:32:31,960
to keep stuff if follow me on this the

2265
01:32:29,260 --> 01:32:34,750
big toe under stork's underscore kind of

2266
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:36,550
try to keep things simple so everybody

2267
01:32:34,750 --> 01:32:38,710
can kind of grasp it and then you know

2268
01:32:36,550 --> 01:32:42,279
from there you can delve into a little

2269
01:32:38,710 --> 01:32:44,380
bit more because a lot of growers you

2270
01:32:42,279 --> 01:32:46,239
know when they use bottle nutrients they

2271
01:32:44,380 --> 01:32:48,400
they go to the hydro store and they ask

2272
01:32:46,239 --> 01:32:49,899
you know what I gonna what do I need to

2273
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:53,710
grow what you know what are you using

2274
01:32:49,899 --> 01:32:55,899
and it's like go do some research to

2275
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:58,210
yeah to be a grower and your plants will

2276
01:32:55,899 --> 01:33:01,619
appreciate that and you'll you'll notice

2277
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:05,109
it in your your results at the end but

2278
01:33:01,619 --> 01:33:07,090
you know I'll explain things but I'll

2279
01:33:05,109 --> 01:33:12,519
let you you know open your mind to it

2280
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:14,319
more so examples with products that

2281
01:33:12,520 --> 01:33:16,720
we're gonna be carrying and research and

2282
01:33:14,319 --> 01:33:18,579
development so that's with Sean's page

2283
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:21,039
too and the Rocky Mountain natural

2284
01:33:18,579 --> 01:33:23,979
farming so just keep an eye out and just

2285
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:26,079
be part of the community yeah if you

2286
01:33:23,979 --> 01:33:27,879
wanna you know link up and talk organics

2287
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:30,609
you know we're always around

2288
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:32,730
what is the shop open the shop is open

2289
01:33:30,609 --> 01:33:37,439
during during the day get there before

2290
01:33:32,729 --> 01:33:37,439
before like - yeah

2291
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:43,400
for Jai's usually they're so very

2292
01:33:41,220 --> 01:33:46,110
flexible the phone numbers on the door

2293
01:33:43,399 --> 01:34:09,210
every day the week from about ten to

2294
01:33:46,109 --> 01:34:11,460
four and outside just email if you know

2295
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:12,989
we want them to know that the products

2296
01:34:11,460 --> 01:34:14,159
out there but the helps out there at the

2297
01:34:12,989 --> 01:34:15,029
same time don't feel like you're doing

2298
01:34:14,159 --> 01:34:16,319
this alone

2299
01:34:15,029 --> 01:34:18,210
these guys have put me on the track to

2300
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:19,979
organics like without a couple of

2301
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:26,520
conversations between Spence and Sean

2302
01:34:19,979 --> 01:34:28,259
I'd still be using the bottles with

2303
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:30,990
Nestor but Nestor up in Denver he's won

2304
01:34:28,260 --> 01:34:32,220
a few cups the shop used to grow four

2305
01:34:30,989 --> 01:34:36,079
but that dude gave a talk one night

2306
01:34:32,220 --> 01:34:38,400
about soil recycling and reconditioning

2307
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:39,569
yeah so hopefully you know we can

2308
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:43,649
definitely get on there again and have

2309
01:34:39,569 --> 01:34:45,960
some more conversations this is my this

2310
01:34:43,649 --> 01:34:51,809
is my one argument with organics all

2311
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:53,819
right with your plants when you put it

2312
01:34:51,810 --> 01:34:55,470
in your plants I want you to freak and

2313
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:59,309
drink it before you put it in your plane

2314
01:34:55,470 --> 01:35:00,240
yeah doing that then don't use it on

2315
01:34:59,310 --> 01:35:03,450
your plant

2316
01:35:00,239 --> 01:35:09,510
I will eat anything in my garden right

2317
01:35:03,449 --> 01:35:11,939
now perfectly fine you will not have to

2318
01:35:09,510 --> 01:35:14,579
pay me to ingest something in the garden

2319
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:18,179
that we have everything is how it should

2320
01:35:14,579 --> 01:35:19,789
be you as a patient you medicate in many

2321
01:35:18,180 --> 01:35:23,010
different ways and one of those ways is

2322
01:35:19,789 --> 01:35:25,979
ingesting raw cannabis as a plant you

2323
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:27,869
know using the leaves the nugs is a lot

2324
01:35:25,979 --> 01:35:31,469
of beneficial for that with pain

2325
01:35:27,869 --> 01:35:33,109
fibromyalgia you know just with

2326
01:35:31,470 --> 01:35:35,810
antibiotics and

2327
01:35:33,109 --> 01:35:37,279
in the cannabis so releasing a lot of

2328
01:35:35,810 --> 01:35:39,230
more of those cannabinoids that aren't

2329
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:42,170
available what you can smoke orange

2330
01:35:39,229 --> 01:35:43,399
edibles some people can't take edibles

2331
01:35:42,170 --> 01:35:45,770
or ingest and that's not what they're

2332
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:49,460
looking for so you know having a plant

2333
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:51,500
that you can actually chew you know it's

2334
01:35:49,460 --> 01:35:52,730
it's what should be like with any

2335
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:58,760
vegetable or flower you should be able

2336
01:35:52,729 --> 01:36:00,500
to eat it you know look at it if it's

2337
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:02,180
gonna if you're gonna be treating it as

2338
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:04,579
medicine then it should be food great

2339
01:36:02,180 --> 01:36:07,070
recreational purposes you know it is

2340
01:36:04,579 --> 01:36:09,289
what it is if you're gonna be for

2341
01:36:07,069 --> 01:36:11,539
example a medical dispensary I'm calling

2342
01:36:09,289 --> 01:36:13,220
you out quit using the [ __ ] if you want

2343
01:36:11,539 --> 01:36:15,079
to know how to grow proper cannabis for

2344
01:36:13,220 --> 01:36:29,449
your dispensaries get sick people don't

2345
01:36:15,079 --> 01:36:32,569
need yes I mean just people need to

2346
01:36:29,449 --> 01:36:35,090
educate themselves don't go jump into

2347
01:36:32,569 --> 01:36:36,619
organics don't go and read every organic

2348
01:36:35,090 --> 01:36:38,949
book and buy everything in there cuz

2349
01:36:36,619 --> 01:36:41,840
that's just as bad if there's reasons

2350
01:36:38,949 --> 01:36:44,659
did you a mean I would almost say your

2351
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:47,000
synthetics instead of bone meal or blood

2352
01:36:44,659 --> 01:36:48,260
meal because those care those are more

2353
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:50,989
harmful than the argument

2354
01:36:48,260 --> 01:36:52,909
same thing with glacial rock dust soft

2355
01:36:50,989 --> 01:36:54,439
rock phosphates different things like

2356
01:36:52,909 --> 01:36:56,930
that ease and mites they carry heavy

2357
01:36:54,439 --> 01:36:59,449
metals and used in large quantities like

2358
01:36:56,930 --> 01:37:01,550
a lot of these super soils call for your

2359
01:36:59,449 --> 01:37:03,739
putting more the same if not more heavy

2360
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:06,470
metals into your plans using chelated

2361
01:37:03,739 --> 01:37:09,590
nutrients exactly so you really want to

2362
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:11,119
educate yourself and that's key I really

2363
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:13,789
want to emphasize that if it's for

2364
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:16,099
medical purposes and you've gone ingest

2365
01:37:13,789 --> 01:37:19,010
the it yourself if it's not food grade

2366
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:22,039
it's not medical page exactly so I can

2367
01:37:19,010 --> 01:37:25,369
eat worm castings you can I wouldn't

2368
01:37:22,039 --> 01:37:29,329
recommend it but you're not gonna get

2369
01:37:25,369 --> 01:37:31,939
sick it's not gonna hurt you that's

2370
01:37:29,329 --> 01:37:34,279
where I'm coming from is you know if it

2371
01:37:31,939 --> 01:37:36,049
says keep out of reach of children as a

2372
01:37:34,279 --> 01:37:38,199
warning label of like what to do when

2373
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:42,630
you know

2374
01:37:38,199 --> 01:38:30,309
that's not cool I can't touch my skin

2375
01:37:42,630 --> 01:38:52,359
right that's what happens when the email

2376
01:38:30,310 --> 01:39:03,190
cord touches the microphone basically if

2377
01:38:52,359 --> 01:39:04,389
you're really you know it's just my head

2378
01:39:03,189 --> 01:39:12,250
is still making that noise from the

2379
01:39:04,390 --> 01:39:15,730
headphone jack and you know don't read

2380
01:39:12,250 --> 01:39:19,300
too many books go like I said source

2381
01:39:15,729 --> 01:39:23,369
things that there's a really good

2382
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:23,369
website called the unconventional farmer

2383
01:39:26,010 --> 01:39:31,090
[Music]

2384
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:45,189
simple and fun it's very hands-on as

2385
01:39:31,090 --> 01:39:46,930
wiggles WordPress Edie use but even then

2386
01:39:45,189 --> 01:39:49,279
you know check where it was source from

2387
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:51,590
but just explore

2388
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:55,880
oh the library yeah don't just stick to

2389
01:39:51,590 --> 01:40:03,380
weed we're not growing just cannabis

2390
01:39:55,880 --> 01:40:27,260
you're growing a plant a touch on some

2391
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:29,779
books yes don't fact of that it taught

2392
01:40:27,260 --> 01:40:32,480
me what things were where they were from

2393
01:40:29,779 --> 01:40:35,269
it really opened my eyes to how you can

2394
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:38,448
create your own nutrients just take

2395
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:40,340
everything that's the book I grabbed for

2396
01:40:38,448 --> 01:40:41,839
instructions that was my first jump into

2397
01:40:40,340 --> 01:40:44,270
organic and that goes right back there

2398
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,909
to you know if you're depending on how

2399
01:40:44,270 --> 01:40:49,460
you personally want to garden and what

2400
01:40:46,908 --> 01:40:50,448
level of organics you want to be on yes

2401
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:51,948
where you want to take things with a

2402
01:40:50,448 --> 01:40:54,469
grain of salt so you might not want to

2403
01:40:51,948 --> 01:40:55,578
use all the right phosphate products so

2404
01:40:54,469 --> 01:41:02,179
you might not want to use all of the

2405
01:40:55,578 --> 01:41:04,578
animal based products you're doing it

2406
01:41:02,179 --> 01:41:06,078
your way it's like music John Bonham

2407
01:41:04,578 --> 01:41:08,328
might have played it boom to Jack and

2408
01:41:06,078 --> 01:41:10,099
you can play it and give it your own

2409
01:41:08,328 --> 01:41:11,630
flavor you know put open hi-hat

2410
01:41:10,099 --> 01:41:13,550
somewhere and do your thing with it

2411
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:15,710
because your plants are in a different

2412
01:41:13,550 --> 01:41:17,659
room you could we can we accept the same

2413
01:41:15,710 --> 01:41:19,069
exact newts and feet are all all of our

2414
01:41:17,658 --> 01:41:22,328
plants that and some of our plants are

2415
01:41:19,069 --> 01:41:24,828
gonna be pissed completely different

2416
01:41:22,328 --> 01:41:26,238
it's like having girlfriends man one of

2417
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:27,319
them is not gonna like the same thing as

2418
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:32,859
the other what's not even getting into

2419
01:41:27,319 --> 01:41:32,859
that you're probably smart

2420
01:41:33,429 --> 01:41:39,079
yes I'd say that we the TLO is a good

2421
01:41:38,119 --> 01:41:41,988
place to start

2422
01:41:39,079 --> 01:41:43,429
okay and then you while you're reading

2423
01:41:41,988 --> 01:41:45,229
through that or before you read through

2424
01:41:43,429 --> 01:41:47,449
that I would recommend everybody should

2425
01:41:45,229 --> 01:41:49,009
just it sounds stupid but just make

2426
01:41:47,448 --> 01:41:51,979
yourself read it everybody should read

2427
01:41:49,010 --> 01:41:58,340
some sort of Jorge Cervantes or Ed Rose

2428
01:41:51,979 --> 01:42:00,109
everybody should read it if you yeah

2429
01:41:58,340 --> 01:42:03,610
that's the one the extreme of course

2430
01:42:00,109 --> 01:42:03,609
guided me I want a horticulture

2431
01:42:10,300 --> 01:42:18,320
definitely yeah with the organics the

2432
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:21,940
one thing that you're you're trying to

2433
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:25,840
do is mimic nature to your fullest and

2434
01:42:21,939 --> 01:42:28,428
when growing in a pot and using a

2435
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:30,679
chelated nutrient in a bottle you

2436
01:42:28,429 --> 01:42:32,869
there's nothing living going on there

2437
01:42:30,679 --> 01:42:34,730
there's no nature so by bringing that

2438
01:42:32,869 --> 01:42:38,210
you know those microbes into your pot

2439
01:42:34,729 --> 01:42:41,269
you're doing so much to your plant you

2440
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:42,800
know it's it's actually you know going

2441
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:44,239
back to what it should and it might take

2442
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:46,010
it a little bit some strains you know

2443
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:47,779
might freak out depending on where you

2444
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:50,239
get it from but if you're gonna do

2445
01:42:47,779 --> 01:42:52,179
organics and you know you like to start

2446
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:54,709
from seed definitely start from seed

2447
01:42:52,179 --> 01:42:57,170
start from seed yeah get some good

2448
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:59,989
quality genetics don't skimp on that um

2449
01:42:57,170 --> 01:43:02,090
cuts are good but a definitely a good

2450
01:42:59,988 --> 01:43:04,759
way to grow is start some seeds you know

2451
01:43:02,090 --> 01:43:06,860
jump in and even if it's backseat you

2452
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:09,199
know it's yeah I don't oppose growing

2453
01:43:06,859 --> 01:43:11,299
bags no it's not it was a bag seat

2454
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:13,609
yeah uh you know if you got a bag seed

2455
01:43:11,300 --> 01:43:17,000
and it turns out to be you know a reg

2456
01:43:13,609 --> 01:43:18,529
seed happens and you know might be

2457
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,359
beneficial for you to let it happen the

2458
01:43:18,529 --> 01:43:27,229
first time who knows but that's a whole

2459
01:43:20,359 --> 01:43:29,750
other subject as well after I'd read elo

2460
01:43:27,229 --> 01:43:31,639
would be one of the first ones marijuana

2461
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:34,488
horticulture ed Rosenthal some sort of

2462
01:43:31,640 --> 01:43:35,600
basic book his books are amazing just

2463
01:43:34,488 --> 01:43:37,609
because they touch on

2464
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:40,550
so many different bases it's a great

2465
01:43:37,609 --> 01:43:42,199
gateway and when you read books like

2466
01:43:40,550 --> 01:43:44,720
that if you're not familiar with like

2467
01:43:42,199 --> 01:43:46,309
academia and like going to school and

2468
01:43:44,720 --> 01:43:48,829
things like that it really helps

2469
01:43:46,310 --> 01:43:51,740
recharge you and teach that's research

2470
01:43:48,829 --> 01:43:53,510
and teach how to learn and that's where

2471
01:43:51,739 --> 01:43:56,689
I really recommend reading books and

2472
01:43:53,510 --> 01:43:58,789
that's where the Rev like I think

2473
01:43:56,689 --> 01:44:01,099
pinpoints his book is getting hands on

2474
01:43:58,789 --> 01:44:05,269
to people that aren't necessarily like

2475
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:08,680
Sean said you know books the Rev will

2476
01:44:05,270 --> 01:44:08,680
tell a joke in the middle of the perry

2477
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,640
just try it and I promise and it's

2478
01:44:15,170 --> 01:44:18,859
different when you when you want to

2479
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,039
learn something yeah yeah I would go

2480
01:44:18,859 --> 01:44:23,359
with those books those are great bases

2481
01:44:21,039 --> 01:44:24,680
and then you when you want to start

2482
01:44:23,359 --> 01:44:27,349
getting a little bit more advanced

2483
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:29,659
obviously most people are familiar that

2484
01:44:27,350 --> 01:44:34,520
have heard of teeming with microbes yeah

2485
01:44:29,659 --> 01:44:38,479
that one's it's a little complex over

2486
01:44:34,520 --> 01:44:40,460
and over and it's kind of it's a quick

2487
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:42,319
reference book when you so you'll use

2488
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:43,909
the Rebbe's book a lot and you'll see

2489
01:44:42,319 --> 01:44:45,229
when you is a beginner and you're mixing

2490
01:44:43,909 --> 01:44:46,699
soils and you're making teas you're

2491
01:44:45,229 --> 01:44:48,799
gonna have that it's gonna be ready to

2492
01:44:46,699 --> 01:44:50,239
find six copies of it because you're

2493
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:52,400
gonna have it next to you brewer and

2494
01:44:50,239 --> 01:44:54,590
you're gonna leave you know if you don't

2495
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:56,119
know how to do something he he starts

2496
01:44:54,590 --> 01:44:57,860
you off and he lets you know that you

2497
01:44:56,119 --> 01:45:01,970
might mess up but you know like you said

2498
01:44:57,859 --> 01:45:03,859
smell your teas teaming with my groups

2499
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:06,050
book will eventually become like that

2500
01:45:03,859 --> 01:45:07,159
for you once in kinda you know once you

2501
01:45:06,050 --> 01:45:08,270
get to the next level

2502
01:45:07,159 --> 01:45:09,500
you're gonna start yeah what's he's

2503
01:45:08,270 --> 01:45:11,570
getting there but once you've covered

2504
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:15,020
your basis and you're a little bit more

2505
01:45:11,569 --> 01:45:17,119
familiar with the food web and how

2506
01:45:15,020 --> 01:45:18,260
things work as far as nutrient cycling

2507
01:45:17,119 --> 01:45:20,479
and you get a little bit more familiar

2508
01:45:18,260 --> 01:45:22,190
with compost tea input while you're

2509
01:45:20,479 --> 01:45:24,289
using them and you really like oh you

2510
01:45:22,189 --> 01:45:26,239
know what this is this is cool I'm using

2511
01:45:24,289 --> 01:45:28,250
my even if you're using your bottled

2512
01:45:26,239 --> 01:45:29,809
organic nutrient you got your earthworm

2513
01:45:28,250 --> 01:45:32,159
castings and your makes your doing your

2514
01:45:29,810 --> 01:45:33,510
weekly teas and your rolling and

2515
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,979
you're like man this is cool I want to

2516
01:45:33,510 --> 01:45:37,829
take it to the next level I've already

2517
01:45:34,979 --> 01:45:39,539
read these books especially if you live

2518
01:45:37,829 --> 01:45:41,670
in a state to where you don't really you

2519
01:45:39,539 --> 01:45:44,300
know not everybody is open about growing

2520
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:47,340
yeah

2521
01:45:44,300 --> 01:45:48,810
then where I would turn is a like where

2522
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:50,489
we were kind of talking about earlier

2523
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:54,539
you know there's a lot of PDF files

2524
01:45:50,489 --> 01:45:56,539
about Korean natural farming different

2525
01:45:54,539 --> 01:45:59,159
things like that natural farming inputs

2526
01:45:56,539 --> 01:46:00,810
that's where I would recommend going

2527
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:03,149
once you kind of get comfortable with

2528
01:46:00,810 --> 01:46:04,860
your basis and that'll tell you how you

2529
01:46:03,149 --> 01:46:08,089
can actually make your own inoculates

2530
01:46:04,859 --> 01:46:08,089
how you can make your own fertilizer

2531
01:46:12,619 --> 01:46:17,069
this is like a beginning into organics

2532
01:46:15,569 --> 01:46:20,189
he shows you different ways to do it

2533
01:46:17,069 --> 01:46:23,039
that might suit your style if you don't

2534
01:46:20,189 --> 01:46:24,269
want to necessarily duties but just want

2535
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:27,930
to use waters he talks about like

2536
01:46:24,270 --> 01:46:30,060
nutrient spikes that are beneficial and

2537
01:46:27,930 --> 01:46:32,400
that's how I first got into organics um

2538
01:46:30,060 --> 01:46:34,410
I just I couldn't have some plants

2539
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:36,000
inside so I needed to put them outdoors

2540
01:46:34,409 --> 01:46:37,859
and not have to check on them that much

2541
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:40,319
so I said why not try it and it worked

2542
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:42,329
out pretty pretty well don't uh don't

2543
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:55,949
overdo it that's for sure okay cuz you

2544
01:46:42,329 --> 01:46:57,269
can really I think really overdo it you

2545
01:46:55,949 --> 01:46:59,880
can really burn your plants they get

2546
01:46:57,270 --> 01:47:01,910
super hot they need to decompose over

2547
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:09,000
time you need to give them they're there

2548
01:47:01,909 --> 01:47:10,880
in your soils yeah I would do is if you

2549
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:13,739
really want to start mixing your in soil

2550
01:47:10,880 --> 01:47:16,050
like you really you're just [ __ ] just

2551
01:47:13,739 --> 01:47:17,519
determined on it and you're going to the

2552
01:47:16,050 --> 01:47:20,640
Hydra store and you're gonna pick up

2553
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:22,590
some amendments basically if you're

2554
01:47:20,640 --> 01:47:25,650
gonna go with the back soil it doesn't

2555
01:47:22,590 --> 01:47:28,520
matter and go sunshine for you Pro makes

2556
01:47:25,649 --> 01:47:31,109
you happy frog it doesn't matter just

2557
01:47:28,520 --> 01:47:32,610
pick what you want I personally would

2558
01:47:31,109 --> 01:47:34,380
recommend you going with the sterile

2559
01:47:32,609 --> 01:47:35,779
medium something with not no real

2560
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:37,029
nutrient factor

2561
01:47:35,779 --> 01:47:39,239
[Music]

2562
01:47:37,029 --> 01:47:42,039
and I would recommend like a pro mix

2563
01:47:39,239 --> 01:47:45,519
based sunshine mix or even a sunshine

2564
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:47,859
advanced think those options are really

2565
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:50,140
great if you don't even want to buy your

2566
01:47:47,859 --> 01:47:52,960
own back soil then just go and pick up a

2567
01:47:50,140 --> 01:47:56,050
brick of peat moss from Lowe's go and

2568
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:58,329
get you a bag of perlite from you know

2569
01:47:56,050 --> 01:48:02,350
the hydro store or the farming for the

2570
01:47:58,329 --> 01:48:05,019
farm sometimes when you source that so

2571
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:07,420
things can come in it so you might want

2572
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:09,190
to treat it naturally before you start

2573
01:48:07,420 --> 01:48:17,529
using it or you know keep an eye on it

2574
01:48:09,189 --> 01:48:19,449
because how much are my worm castings

2575
01:48:17,529 --> 01:48:21,579
gonna help me keep away those pests

2576
01:48:19,449 --> 01:48:25,840
that's gonna build up just everything in

2577
01:48:21,579 --> 01:48:28,600
the soil the plant needs you know it's

2578
01:48:25,840 --> 01:48:31,000
gonna start fighting the fight before

2579
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:35,470
your plants even growing you know so

2580
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:37,420
it's like it's I mean you're gonna help

2581
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:38,860
build your plants immune system like you

2582
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:40,750
said it'll start fighting it from the

2583
01:48:38,859 --> 01:48:43,149
inside out that kind of goes back down

2584
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:48,279
and building high-yield chitin eating

2585
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:50,289
bacteria love to come we're gonna get

2586
01:48:48,279 --> 01:48:52,300
some class toad you want classes cuz I

2587
01:48:50,289 --> 01:48:54,489
really want to get to talking about like

2588
01:48:52,300 --> 01:49:00,730
the different asset like what is in our

2589
01:48:54,489 --> 01:49:03,760
castings and why they work because I

2590
01:49:00,729 --> 01:49:05,199
want to do an episode about like we

2591
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:06,400
can't have everybody we're not telling

2592
01:49:05,199 --> 01:49:08,050
you throw away the bottled nutrients

2593
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:10,299
today that's not what anyone don't go to

2594
01:49:08,050 --> 01:49:11,890
find a balance for you so that'll be one

2595
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:13,449
of our next topic is the find the

2596
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:16,780
balance between the bottles and the

2597
01:49:13,449 --> 01:49:19,869
organics yeah yeah just don't yeah don't

2598
01:49:16,779 --> 01:49:22,630
toss your bottled nutrients don't throw

2599
01:49:19,869 --> 01:49:25,000
anything away slowly pick get some worm

2600
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:27,489
castings yeah start making teas and then

2601
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:29,739
slowly start working things out it's not

2602
01:49:27,489 --> 01:49:31,929
like a you're not just gonna magically

2603
01:49:29,739 --> 01:49:33,789
become an organic gardener right dip

2604
01:49:31,930 --> 01:49:35,890
your foot in the water yeah this could

2605
01:49:33,789 --> 01:49:37,090
be the way to way improve your drawing

2606
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:44,160
though this could make your buds taste

2607
01:49:37,090 --> 01:49:44,159
better girl it's just sweeter

2608
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:48,459
actually go to make the transition and

2609
01:49:46,779 --> 01:49:51,880
then find their nice little happy spot

2610
01:49:48,460 --> 01:49:53,949
in the middle and that's what you want

2611
01:49:51,880 --> 01:49:56,409
as a grower I know a lot of people who

2612
01:49:53,949 --> 01:49:58,449
are really happy and just kill it

2613
01:49:56,409 --> 01:50:00,189
growing synthetics and organics together

2614
01:49:58,449 --> 01:50:02,289
so yeah like you said it can really

2615
01:50:00,189 --> 01:50:04,269
improve your drawing style and whether

2616
01:50:02,289 --> 01:50:06,159
you want to commit to going fully

2617
01:50:04,270 --> 01:50:12,400
organic or you want to run synthetics I

2618
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:16,059
think that everybody could benefit by a

2619
01:50:12,399 --> 01:50:17,409
friend grow warehouse in Colorado

2620
01:50:16,060 --> 01:50:19,330
Springs who use the Rocky Mountain worm

2621
01:50:17,409 --> 01:50:21,250
castings but he integrates it with

2622
01:50:19,329 --> 01:50:23,710
nectar of the Gods but he uses a nectar

2623
01:50:21,250 --> 01:50:26,050
of the Gods in a very low dosage with

2624
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:28,079
aunties and he uses cover crops and

2625
01:50:26,050 --> 01:50:32,320
things like that so he does practice a

2626
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:39,939
you know an organic style of growing but

2627
01:50:32,319 --> 01:50:43,179
it's not full organic permaculture yeah

2628
01:50:39,939 --> 01:50:46,059
but he's you know he is actually a

2629
01:50:43,180 --> 01:50:47,500
arborist I've been looking into that so

2630
01:50:46,060 --> 01:50:50,500
one of the things that we want to try to

2631
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:52,180
be able to present through Jay is if it

2632
01:50:50,500 --> 01:50:53,560
holds any merit to anybody out there

2633
01:50:52,180 --> 01:50:56,710
we're gonna call it Rocky Mountain

2634
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:58,720
natural farming certified so what we'll

2635
01:50:56,710 --> 01:51:02,039
do is we're gonna try to start looking

2636
01:50:58,720 --> 01:51:02,039
into some of these products for you

2637
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:10,659
there is no arm realistic for us man

2638
01:51:07,029 --> 01:51:12,550
there is no there's I mean there is an

2639
01:51:10,659 --> 01:51:14,139
arm realistic on certain you know

2640
01:51:12,550 --> 01:51:16,840
bottled nutrients and stuff but we have

2641
01:51:14,140 --> 01:51:18,550
nothing to really go off of we need to

2642
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:20,289
create some sort of system and that's

2643
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:22,659
what we're really hoping to do know what

2644
01:51:20,289 --> 01:51:24,909
you source from is take the time for you

2645
01:51:22,659 --> 01:51:26,590
to look into where your products come

2646
01:51:24,909 --> 01:51:28,029
from how they made how they affect the

2647
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:29,829
final product so that if I'm in your

2648
01:51:28,029 --> 01:51:31,509
store I can buy that and know that I

2649
01:51:29,829 --> 01:51:34,139
didn't just buy I'll tell you who plane

2650
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:35,789
chopped up came from

2651
01:51:34,139 --> 01:51:39,659
how it was harvested when it was

2652
01:51:35,788 --> 01:51:42,059
harvested that's very important hire

2653
01:51:39,658 --> 01:51:43,259
more people open your doors more after a

2654
01:51:42,059 --> 01:51:45,090

want something out of out of the state

2667
01:52:18,389 --> 01:52:21,149
of Colorado I would recommend going

2668
01:52:20,519 --> 01:52:22,829
online

2669
01:52:21,149 --> 01:52:24,449
yeah and then just sourcing it straight

2670
01:52:22,828 --> 01:52:27,929
through Rocky Mountain warm company comm

2671
01:52:24,448 --> 01:52:30,478
okay as far as local growers I cannot

2672
01:52:27,929 --> 01:52:36,029
stress this enough we want to know who

2673
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:37,708
you are if you're in Colorado tell us

2674
01:52:36,029 --> 01:52:39,148
I talked to Jay a little earlier we're

2675
01:52:37,708 --> 01:52:40,679
trying to work something out but tell us

2676
01:52:39,149 --> 01:52:41,669
that you listen to the show and that you

2677
01:52:40,679 --> 01:52:44,158
heard about it and we'll give you a

2678
01:52:41,668 --> 01:52:50,969
quarter pound a cover crop for free just

2679
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:53,009
for mentioning because the listeners

2680
01:52:50,969 --> 01:52:54,809
were high if you mentioned if you shop

2681
01:52:53,010 --> 01:52:56,070
at the worm store and you say that you

2682
01:52:54,809 --> 01:52:57,958
listen to the podcast they'll give you a

2683
01:52:56,069 --> 01:52:59,759
quarter pound of cover crop should start

2684
01:52:57,958 --> 01:53:01,168
off your organic source to help out your

2685
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:02,458
organics it'll go on top it'll keep

2686
01:53:01,168 --> 01:53:03,988
everything moist so that your worms

2687
01:53:02,458 --> 01:53:06,090
don't or your worm castings don't dry

2688
01:53:03,988 --> 01:53:07,648
out so did you might go fungi going it

2689
01:53:06,090 --> 01:53:09,149
does not die on you while it's growing

2690
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:10,739
in there when things dry out I think I

2691
01:53:09,149 --> 01:53:12,780
let mine get a little too dry lately

2692
01:53:10,738 --> 01:53:15,029
yeah you want to use the natural enzymes

2693
01:53:12,779 --> 01:53:17,578
of plants that are around you and that's

2694
01:53:15,029 --> 01:53:19,018
one big thing with organics is with

2695
01:53:17,578 --> 01:53:22,029
sourcing things locally we have to do

2696
01:53:19,019 --> 01:53:24,289
like six episodes with you guys

2697
01:53:22,029 --> 01:53:27,319
another thing is what do you want to

2698
01:53:24,288 --> 01:53:28,969
hear guys what do you tell of March

2699
01:53:27,319 --> 01:53:30,738

to understand that's like you know okay

2780
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:31,360
this is not everything that's in a

2781
01:57:29,470 --> 01:57:33,220
bottle is bad some companies do care

2782
01:57:31,359 --> 01:57:35,109
what their patients are putting into

2783
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:43,060
their plants and into their medicine so

2784
01:57:35,109 --> 01:57:45,420
there are some when you go to the hydro

2785
01:57:43,060 --> 01:57:48,460
store and you're asking somebody a

2786
01:57:45,420 --> 01:57:50,649
question go to the bottle and read

2787
01:57:48,460 --> 01:57:52,420
things a lot of companies put a face on

2788
01:57:50,649 --> 01:57:54,609
their brand and that's marketing and

2789
01:57:52,420 --> 01:57:56,319
that's not what organics is okay this is

2790
01:57:54,609 --> 01:57:58,509
actually like having the product and it

2791
01:57:56,319 --> 01:58:00,789
does what it does a lot of bottles put

2792
01:57:58,510 --> 01:58:03,970
things on their labels to make you go

2793
01:58:00,789 --> 01:58:05,739
towards the bottle that exactly that

2794
01:58:03,970 --> 01:58:07,990
might be a little cheaper and it's just

2795
01:58:05,739 --> 01:58:09,699
you know it's the same values that's why

2796
01:58:07,989 --> 01:58:22,779
some companies change their label every

2797
01:58:09,699 --> 01:58:25,500
three months big inside drive it across

2798

2859
02:01:32,689 --> 02:01:43,919
just point that right now we're

2860
02:01:41,369 --> 02:01:45,750
community so let's uh let's come

2861
02:01:43,920 --> 02:01:47,520
together so one random question do you

2862
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:49,319
guys I'm adding OGT into my base with my

2863
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:55,440
worm castings I'm just wasting money now

2864
02:01:49,319 --> 02:01:57,509
how GT is soft rock phosphate fried

2865
02:01:55,439 --> 02:01:59,159
derma highs are iam which has actually

2866
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:00,510
been taken out of like great white a

2867
02:01:59,159 --> 02:02:02,189
couple other products they cycle

2868
02:02:00,510 --> 02:02:04,289
nutrients too quickly I don't know if

2869
02:02:02,189 --> 02:02:05,698
you're familiar with OG bio war but it's

2870
02:02:04,289 --> 02:02:08,609
the same reason they recommend not using

2871
02:02:05,698 --> 02:02:10,259
the new pack with a hydroponic system

2872
02:02:08,609 --> 02:02:10,769
it'll actually cycle nutrients out of

2873
02:02:10,260 --> 02:02:17,850
the plant

2874
02:02:10,770 --> 02:02:18,810
okay worm castings man I have a few

2875
02:02:17,850 --> 02:02:21,150
plants that are showing some

2876
02:02:18,810 --> 02:02:47,460
deficiencies and they're fed and it's

2877
02:02:21,149 --> 02:02:52,738
because I put so much in their plant

2878
02:02:47,460 --> 02:02:54,750
that sometimes the plants you know still

2879
02:02:52,738 --> 02:03:01,799
becoming itself but yes bottom line with

2880
02:02:54,750 --> 02:03:03,750
Jays using Rocky Mountain castings and

2881
02:03:01,800 --> 02:03:08,130
I'm not a hater of OGT but these worm

2882
02:03:03,750 --> 02:03:09,719
castings are ridiculously I mean if you

2883
02:03:08,130 --> 02:03:11,219
want to put soft rock phosphate or

2884

mystic roots crew I usually do an ad but

3003
02:08:18,729 --> 02:08:21,129
Shawn just said something that really

3004
02:08:19,869 --> 02:08:24,340
got my attention here

3005
02:08:21,130 --> 02:08:26,319
he said that NPK value no longer matters

3006
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:27,400
to him would you like to elaborate that

3007
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:32,500
now that I've got some microphones

3008
02:08:27,399 --> 02:08:35,469
turned on yes I think NPK with organic

3009
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:39,010
true organic gardening isn't a necessity

3010
02:08:35,470 --> 02:08:41,020
that's something that is in PK value is

3011
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:43,570
all synthetic it was invented for

3012
02:08:41,020 --> 02:08:45,460
synthetic fertilizers okay there's a way

3013
02:08:43,569 --> 02:08:48,069
to sell them exactly

3014
02:08:45,460 --> 02:08:51,189
um yeah you're just given the plant what

3015
02:08:48,069 --> 02:08:52,479
they need when they need it and the

3016
02:08:51,189 --> 02:08:54,879
reason I brought this up to you is

3017
02:08:52,479 --> 02:08:57,489
actually saw a post earlier today and it

3018
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:59,890
was out of a publication I'll just read

3019
02:08:57,489 --> 02:09:04,179
it for you real quick do it do it is

3020
02:08:59,890 --> 02:09:06,340
okay so this is plant and prosper you

3021
02:09:04,180 --> 02:09:07,810
he's a really cool guy if you don't

3022
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:10,180
follow on Instagram it's plant

3023
02:09:07,810 --> 02:09:12,810
underscore in underscore prosper so we

3024
02:09:10,180 --> 02:09:17,110
saw him throw this up earlier it's uh

3025
02:09:12,810 --> 02:09:21,370
Justin von Liebig he's actually credited

3026
02:09:17,109 --> 02:09:22,899
with creating synthetic fertilizers so

3027
02:09:21,369 --> 02:09:24,939
here's a little excerpt that plant

3028
02:09:22,899 --> 02:09:25,939
prosper posted from a book that he was

3029
02:09:24,939 --> 02:09:27,799
reading

3030
02:09:25,939 --> 02:09:29,809
in peak a gardeners are there practices

3031
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:32,300
to the great scientist justin von Liebig

3032
02:09:29,810 --> 02:09:34,490
the father of artificial fertilizers

3033
02:09:32,300 --> 02:09:37,400
what most don't know is that later in

3034
02:09:34,489 --> 02:09:39,529
life von Liebig acknowledged a grave

3035
02:09:37,399 --> 02:09:41,239
mistake and relying only on chemistry in

3036
02:09:39,529 --> 02:09:43,219
fact he saw negative impacts of our

3037
02:09:41,239 --> 02:09:45,109
artificial fertilizers on life in the

3038
02:09:43,220 --> 02:09:46,850
soil in his own vegetable garden and

3039
02:09:45,109 --> 02:09:48,649
thereafter preferred organic matter to

3040
02:09:46,850 --> 02:09:51,680
inorganic chemical fertilizer he

3041
02:09:48,649 --> 02:09:53,389
invented to quote von Liebig after I

3042
02:09:51,680 --> 02:09:55,010
learned the reason why my fertilizers

3043
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:56,750
weren't effective in the proper way I

3044
02:09:55,010 --> 02:09:57,260
was like a person that received a new

3045
02:09:56,750 --> 02:09:59,000
life

3046
02:09:57,260 --> 02:10:01,670
understanding how nutrients will make us

3047
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,949
work will make us all see the light and

3048
02:10:01,670 --> 02:10:06,020
then ultimately make us better gardeners

3049
02:10:03,949 --> 02:10:08,389
with know with more sustainable gardens

3050
02:10:06,020 --> 02:10:10,370
sorry kind of butcher that theme oh no

3051
02:10:08,390 --> 02:10:11,570
that's that's pretty much been your

3052
02:10:10,369 --> 02:10:14,539
message the whole time anyway

3053
02:10:11,569 --> 02:10:16,489
yeah the synthetics are disrupting the e

3054
02:10:14,539 --> 02:10:20,510
coli if the organic life in the plants

3055
02:10:16,489 --> 02:10:21,769
we need to get away from that you

3056
02:10:20,510 --> 02:10:24,949
brought me a bouquet she bucket have I

3057
02:10:21,770 --> 02:10:26,600
said that yet no I was gonna bring it to

3058
02:10:24,949 --> 02:10:27,920
you okay well I give you a big thanks

3059
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:29,270
for that one huh big thanks and shout

3060
02:10:27,920 --> 02:10:31,250
out to the rocky mountain worm company

3061
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:33,560
Sean brought me a bouquet she bucket so

3062
02:10:31,250 --> 02:10:59,060
I'm one step closer to becoming organic

3063
02:10:33,560 --> 02:11:00,470
as [ __ ] like the purple Kalonji purple -

3064
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:02,810
I took a lot of pictures today shoutouts

3065
02:11:00,470 --> 02:11:04,880
Kalonji cush that's a sweet stream so

3066
02:11:02,810 --> 02:11:08,090
what we're saying about the NPK so yeah

3067
02:11:04,880 --> 02:11:11,300
basically NPK was created with synthetic

3068
02:11:08,090 --> 02:11:14,000
fertilizers it's kind of you know the

3069
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:15,380
basis behind it you you give play

3070
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:16,789
nitrogen when it needs it you give to

3071
02:11:15,380 --> 02:11:19,069
play a phosphorus and potassium when

3072
02:11:16,789 --> 02:11:21,199
they need it or when you think they need

3073
02:11:19,069 --> 02:11:25,579
it and you by practice this natural

3074
02:11:21,199 --> 02:11:27,470
process and by doing that when you when

3075
02:11:25,579 --> 02:11:29,869
you bypass this process basically you're

3076
02:11:27,470 --> 02:11:31,490
just leaving the salts in the mineral

3077
02:11:29,869 --> 02:11:32,689
salts and everything that's left over

3078
02:11:31,489 --> 02:11:34,219
from the fertilizer that's not

3079
02:11:32,689 --> 02:11:35,678
immediately taken up by the plants roots

3080
02:11:34,220 --> 02:11:37,750
you're leaving that in the dirt

3081
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:39,880
because you've bypassed all natural

3082
02:11:37,750 --> 02:11:41,738
chemistry it's not being digested it's

3083
02:11:39,880 --> 02:11:44,679
not being broken down it stays there

3084
02:11:41,738 --> 02:11:48,849
it's like what you were saying about co2

3085
02:11:44,679 --> 02:11:50,440
and synthetic rooms exactly there's yeah

3086
02:11:48,850 --> 02:11:56,289
there's nothing that yeah well I'm gonna

3087
02:11:50,439 --> 02:11:58,419
have some numbers on that or something

3088
02:11:56,289 --> 02:11:59,829
salty all day I see Gatorade cuz they'll

3089
02:11:58,420 --> 02:12:01,690
sue the [ __ ] out of me but if I drink

3090
02:11:59,829 --> 02:12:03,189
some if I just put salt water all day

3091
02:12:01,689 --> 02:12:04,509
that's essentially what we're feeding

3092
02:12:03,189 --> 02:12:06,250
the plants by feeding them synthetic

3093
02:12:04,510 --> 02:12:07,960
nutrients exactly like you'll you'll pee

3094
02:12:06,250 --> 02:12:10,539
out the water but the salt stay in there

3095
02:12:07,960 --> 02:12:11,710
you know I mean it's not good for you

3096
02:12:10,539 --> 02:12:13,658
it's not good for the plant and

3097
02:12:11,710 --> 02:12:15,429
someone's gonna say but I flush heavily

3098
02:12:13,658 --> 02:12:17,529
but you don't flush often enough I don't

3099
02:12:15,429 --> 02:12:19,090
think even if you get runoff that salt

3100
02:12:17,529 --> 02:12:20,679
is still binding to you because your

3101
02:12:19,090 --> 02:12:22,750
plant has to metabolize it and what it

3102
02:12:20,679 --> 02:12:25,029
does metabolize is still coming out of

3103
02:12:22,750 --> 02:12:26,800
the roots as well so you've got the

3104
02:12:25,029 --> 02:12:28,359
extra buildup you put in there you got

3105
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:29,710
the part that was never used and then

3106
02:12:28,359 --> 02:12:30,849
you got the part that was metabolized

3107
02:12:29,710 --> 02:12:32,529
you got a lot of salt stuck in there

3108
02:12:30,850 --> 02:12:34,659
using the synthetics well then it also

3109
02:12:32,529 --> 02:12:40,658
forms the plant too so it's in the plant

3110
02:12:34,658 --> 02:12:41,948
materials as well what are you rolling

3111
02:12:40,658 --> 02:12:43,029
up dude because you're a couple feet

3112
02:12:41,948 --> 02:12:44,799
away from me on that [ __ ] smells

3113
02:12:43,029 --> 02:12:45,279
delicious over here I swear it's getting

3114
02:12:44,800 --> 02:12:50,230
stronger

3115
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:52,389
I think the Wi-Fi Tahoe smells delicious

3116
02:12:50,229 --> 02:12:54,488
did you grow that I no no I picked it up

3117
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:56,289
from a local shop up in the springs nice

3118
02:12:54,488 --> 02:13:02,019
to that local shop in the spring it's

3119
02:12:56,289 --> 02:13:05,500
good work with the NPK we don't rely on

3120
02:13:02,020 --> 02:13:08,140
the numbers we rely on more of what it's

3121
02:13:05,500 --> 02:13:11,050
called the nutrient cycle theory so it's

3122
02:13:08,140 --> 02:13:13,690
you know the plant it's kind of like a

3123
02:13:11,050 --> 02:13:18,039
person you know the plants a baby it's

3124
02:13:13,689 --> 02:13:20,049
growing it needs things to aid in you

3125
02:13:18,039 --> 02:13:21,729
know its vegetative growth so that's

3126
02:13:20,050 --> 02:13:26,619
where your nitrogen comes in that's

3127
02:13:21,729 --> 02:13:28,119
where your potassium comes and helps

3128
02:13:26,619 --> 02:13:29,710
strengthen their cell walls as your

3129
02:13:28,119 --> 02:13:32,229
plants get bigger to make sure you know

3130
02:13:29,710 --> 02:13:34,119
that everything's going properly instead

3131
02:13:32,229 --> 02:13:36,250
of giving the plant directly what it

3132
02:13:34,119 --> 02:13:38,050
needs what we'll do is we'll let the

3133
02:13:36,250 --> 02:13:39,760
plant decide for itself all of those

3134
02:13:38,050 --> 02:13:41,380
things will be available in the soil and

3135
02:13:39,760 --> 02:13:42,940
not in the sense that we're gonna load

3136
02:13:41,380 --> 02:13:44,319
it down without foul familial or

3137
02:13:42,939 --> 02:13:46,748
bonemeal their blood meal

3138
02:13:44,319 --> 02:13:50,019
but will we the soil will have an mpk

3139
02:13:46,748 --> 02:13:52,478
value usually you know I've calculated

3140
02:13:50,019 --> 02:13:54,639
last time and just with the real basic

3141
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:57,489
mix of like neem and Carazo

3142
02:13:54,639 --> 02:13:58,899
and kelp meal and things like that I

3143
02:13:57,488 --> 02:14:00,818
think we were running around like a

3144
02:13:58,899 --> 02:14:02,739
three to four it's kind of what the

3145
02:14:00,819 --> 02:14:05,139
fertilizer quote-unquote was coming out

3146
02:14:02,738 --> 02:14:06,428
it's fairly low exactly I'm sure that

3147
02:14:05,139 --> 02:14:08,260
plant got everything you needed

3148
02:14:06,429 --> 02:14:10,118
yeah and that's and that's where we come

3149
02:14:08,260 --> 02:14:11,859
from is you know that's the reason that

3150
02:14:10,118 --> 02:14:14,198
when you go to the gross tour you'll see

3151
02:14:11,859 --> 02:14:17,530
that organic fertilizers are like zero

3152
02:14:14,198 --> 02:14:20,078
you know one point two three or these

3153
02:14:17,529 --> 02:14:21,818
extremely low numbers and people see

3154
02:14:20,078 --> 02:14:24,219
that and they're like oh that's the

3155
02:14:21,819 --> 02:14:27,639
other one says your 0-60 like that's

3156
02:14:24,219 --> 02:14:32,168
gonna yield me weight and that's that's

3157
02:14:27,639 --> 02:14:34,449
an economist conception it's not I mean

3158
02:14:32,168 --> 02:14:35,858
you will get bigger buds using that

3159
02:14:34,448 --> 02:14:36,998
right they're not gonna be the tastiest

3160
02:14:35,859 --> 02:14:38,709
through the cleanest and if I need a

3161
02:14:36,998 --> 02:14:39,998
bunch of pennies I would feel full but I

3162
02:14:38,708 --> 02:14:42,158
just shoot out a bunch of pennies

3163
02:14:39,998 --> 02:14:43,898
exactly yeah wouldn't get anything from

3164
02:14:42,158 --> 02:14:45,578
it you know I'll argue that you're not

3165
02:14:43,899 --> 02:14:49,298
necessarily gonna get bigger bucks from

3166
02:14:45,578 --> 02:14:50,759
it right a lot of the like does you know

3167
02:14:49,298 --> 02:14:55,118
zero zero six - that sounds like a

3168
02:14:50,760 --> 02:14:57,219
powdered blue booster and those things

3169
02:14:55,118 --> 02:14:59,469
can really [ __ ] your plan up in a hurry

3170
02:14:57,219 --> 02:15:04,989
if you try to go too crazy with them

3171
02:14:59,469 --> 02:15:07,719
there yeah yeah like I said as far as

3172
02:15:04,988 --> 02:15:09,878
the whole NPK thing I wouldn't stress it

3173
02:15:07,719 --> 02:15:11,469
I'd make sure that when you you go into

3174
02:15:09,878 --> 02:15:14,738
your cycle make sure your soil is

3175
02:15:11,469 --> 02:15:16,298
amended properly and then it's you know

3176
02:15:14,738 --> 02:15:18,338
make sure that you're feeding it it

3177
02:15:16,298 --> 02:15:22,298
beneficial bacteria that it's getting

3178
02:15:18,338 --> 02:15:24,548
everything it needs if you know it'll

3179
02:15:22,298 --> 02:15:26,859
have alfalfa and it'll have kelp in and

3180
02:15:24,548 --> 02:15:28,838
if you need that booster you can always

3181
02:15:26,859 --> 02:15:31,869
top dress with like a fish bone meal or

3182
02:15:28,838 --> 02:15:34,889
make a nettle tea or a yarrow tea there

3183
02:15:31,868 --> 02:15:37,808
are many different options and those

3184
02:15:34,889 --> 02:15:39,760
while they may not be high in NPK that's

3185
02:15:37,809 --> 02:15:41,739
what their predominant with and that's

3186
02:15:39,760 --> 02:15:43,418
gonna you know that's gonna get the you

3187
02:15:41,738 --> 02:15:45,218
enter that into the soil that's going to

3188
02:15:43,418 --> 02:15:47,019
get the bacteria and the fungi cycling

3189
02:15:45,219 --> 02:15:48,908
whatever nutrient you just ingested it

3190
02:15:47,019 --> 02:15:50,498
you entered into the soil so they're

3191
02:15:48,908 --> 02:15:52,118
just gonna keep carrying on that process

3192
02:15:50,498 --> 02:15:53,288
and keep delivering it to your plant as

3193
02:15:52,118 --> 02:15:55,128
your plant needs it

3194
02:15:53,288 --> 02:15:57,679
does your plant know when to stop eating

3195
02:15:55,128 --> 02:15:59,868
at that point yes it'll be like good so

3196
02:15:57,679 --> 02:16:01,219
you can't you're not you don't run as

3197
02:15:59,868 --> 02:16:02,898
much risk of burning it with you

3198
02:16:01,219 --> 02:16:06,319
organics is something I've noticed yeah

3199
02:16:02,899 --> 02:16:07,729
when I was really kind of first got into

3200
02:16:06,319 --> 02:16:09,529
it I kept getting a lot of nitrogen

3201
02:16:07,729 --> 02:16:11,869
deficiencies at the beginning of flower

3202
02:16:09,529 --> 02:16:14,538
I mean every like every ran I did

3203
02:16:11,868 --> 02:16:16,668
organic or just for some reason I would

3204
02:16:14,538 --> 02:16:20,059
just get these yellow ass leaves yeah

3205
02:16:16,668 --> 02:16:24,109
week three and inches it sucks try to

3206
02:16:20,059 --> 02:16:25,909
follow your feed to keep up three if

3207
02:16:24,109 --> 02:16:27,438
you're already yellow and it's yeah and

3208
02:16:25,908 --> 02:16:29,359
it'll Ospreys and I thought that it was

3209
02:16:27,439 --> 02:16:32,329
because yeah I wasn't feeding the plant

3210
02:16:29,359 --> 02:16:35,388
enough nitrogen that wasn't necessarily

3211
02:16:32,329 --> 02:16:37,429
the case where I really saw the

3212
02:16:35,388 --> 02:16:39,679
improvement was when I dialed my

3213
02:16:37,429 --> 02:16:41,808
amendments back you know when I really

3214
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:43,340
slowed things down and was like okay I'm

3215
02:16:41,808 --> 02:16:46,759
not gonna pound it with stuff I'm gonna

3216
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:48,500
make sure that the soil food webs alive

3217
02:16:46,760 --> 02:16:51,619
that everything's cycling how it needs

3218
02:16:48,500 --> 02:16:54,738
to that everything is working and will

3219
02:16:51,619 --> 02:16:58,639
let the plant decide for itself and yeah

3220
02:16:54,738 --> 02:17:00,408
I mean you know anymore - I haven't

3221
02:16:58,638 --> 02:17:04,518
dealt with the deficiency in a while I

3222
02:17:00,408 --> 02:17:07,488
will say that I don't I haven't ran

3223
02:17:04,519 --> 02:17:09,500
comparisons I don't run when I I don't

3224
02:17:07,488 --> 02:17:11,029
run traditional bro so I can't say that

3225
02:17:09,500 --> 02:17:13,250
this is what I'm you know you're gonna

3226
02:17:11,029 --> 02:17:19,158
you'll compare to this I only do my own

3227
02:17:13,250 --> 02:17:21,679
thing yeah I just rant I just made the

3228
02:17:19,158 --> 02:17:24,888
switch back to full organics of my

3229
02:17:21,679 --> 02:17:30,049
indoor grows I had been using bottled

3230
02:17:24,888 --> 02:17:32,978
nutrients and my first I took the clones

3231
02:17:30,049 --> 02:17:35,268
my first set of plants that we

3232
02:17:32,978 --> 02:17:38,358
transplanted into a good soil and

3233
02:17:35,269 --> 02:17:39,859
everything we never fed him any bottled

3234
02:17:38,359 --> 02:17:43,219
nutrients or anything like that so there

3235
02:17:39,859 --> 02:17:46,189
wasn't any flushing involved but I used

3236
02:17:43,218 --> 02:17:49,549
the soil mix that was pretty much what

3237
02:17:46,189 --> 02:17:52,700
I've been using previously when I grew

3238
02:17:49,549 --> 02:17:55,369
indoors and I nitrogen burned some

3239
02:17:52,700 --> 02:17:59,719
I think of the the first half of the

3240
02:17:55,370 --> 02:18:02,479
plants I transplanted um we used one

3241
02:17:59,718 --> 02:18:05,178
amount of all the inputs and I got the

3242
02:18:02,478 --> 02:18:06,619
yellowing instantly and you know a lot

3243
02:18:05,179 --> 02:18:08,899
of people could have been like oh that's

3244
02:18:06,620 --> 02:18:10,490
lack of nitrogen but already knew

3245
02:18:08,899 --> 02:18:13,099
there's a [ __ ] ton a nitrogen in there

3246
02:18:10,489 --> 02:18:16,069
so the next night when we transplanted

3247
02:18:13,099 --> 02:18:18,439
the other half of the plants I just cut

3248
02:18:16,069 --> 02:18:20,808
the amount in half and use the half

3249
02:18:18,439 --> 02:18:23,809
amount of everything and those plants

3250
02:18:20,808 --> 02:18:25,759
just exploded instantly and they're

3251
02:18:23,808 --> 02:18:27,409
still outgrowing you know that's been

3252
02:18:25,760 --> 02:18:29,630
three weeks ago and they're still

3253
02:18:27,409 --> 02:18:31,728
outgrowing yeah the plants that we

3254
02:18:29,629 --> 02:18:33,379
transplanted the first night so go easy

3255
02:18:31,728 --> 02:18:35,449
with the organics because they're

3256
02:18:33,379 --> 02:18:36,679
bioavailable the plant sir that's right

3257
02:18:35,450 --> 02:18:38,540
there the plants can eat it you don't

3258
02:18:36,679 --> 02:18:41,090
have to yeah they don't have to do as

3259
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:42,410
much work to eat that so you can speed

3260
02:18:41,090 --> 02:18:43,819
them up too much by overfeeding them

3261
02:18:42,409 --> 02:18:45,138
with a lot of these organics and that's

3262
02:18:43,819 --> 02:18:47,119
something we're talking about with one

3263
02:18:45,138 --> 02:18:49,968
of our favorite products is OGT and

3264
02:18:47,120 --> 02:18:51,410
Shawn was teaching me how a GT can kind

3265
02:18:49,968 --> 02:18:52,819
of speed up the metabolism of your

3266
02:18:51,409 --> 02:18:54,409
plants a little bit too much so go easy

3267
02:18:52,819 --> 02:18:57,170
on the GT guys I've been recommending

3268
02:18:54,409 --> 02:18:58,760
that a lot replace that with Rocky

3269
02:18:57,170 --> 02:19:01,519
Mountain worm castings if you're able to

3270
02:18:58,760 --> 02:19:05,059
I was wondering when I heard I listened

3271
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:07,250
to the podcast last night but uh

3272
02:19:05,058 --> 02:19:15,170
I was wondering if that could be useful

3273
02:19:07,250 --> 02:19:17,599
in flushing I know you're super huge fan

3274
02:19:15,170 --> 02:19:21,138
of og bio war I started using them here

3275
02:19:17,599 --> 02:19:24,620
recently I am so impressed with our G by

3276
02:19:21,138 --> 02:19:27,968
war holy hell I mean I'm talking just

3277
02:19:24,620 --> 02:19:30,469
from the standpoint of the plants

3278
02:19:27,968 --> 02:19:32,869
overall health I mean I haven't seen a

3279
02:19:30,468 --> 02:19:35,569
damn yellow leaf I haven't everything's

3280
02:19:32,870 --> 02:19:38,599
green and waxy it's yeah it's pretty

3281
02:19:35,569 --> 02:19:39,199
cool I mean but that goes to the new

3282
02:19:38,599 --> 02:19:41,360
pack

3283
02:19:39,200 --> 02:19:43,429
I had read somewhere that somebody had

3284
02:19:41,360 --> 02:19:44,750
actually mentioned hitting it cuz you're

3285
02:19:43,429 --> 02:19:46,370
only supposed to use the nutrient pack I

3286
02:19:44,750 --> 02:19:48,260
believe three times throughout the whole

3287
02:19:46,370 --> 02:19:51,439
cycle but I heard him about introducing

3288
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:53,180
it a fourth time yeah about like what

3289
02:19:51,439 --> 02:19:55,578
repair not even into flush I think they

3290
02:19:53,180 --> 02:19:57,199
were saying like around like week

3291
02:19:55,578 --> 02:19:59,000
if you know a couple of weeks before

3292
02:19:57,199 --> 02:20:00,890
flush which usually like really start

3293
02:19:59,000 --> 02:20:03,799
cycling in but yeah I mean that's

3294
02:20:00,889 --> 02:20:04,788
definitely something I dia you guys

3295
02:20:03,799 --> 02:20:07,759
gonna have to start taking a lot of

3296
02:20:04,789 --> 02:20:10,550
notes on these next few episodes Sean

3297
02:20:07,760 --> 02:20:12,590
wants to do a full episode on recycling

3298
02:20:10,549 --> 02:20:14,299
soil andrea mending your soil we had a

3299
02:20:12,590 --> 02:20:26,359
listener asked specifically about that

3300
02:20:14,299 --> 02:20:28,068
we're gonna get to that one I do want to

3301
02:20:26,359 --> 02:20:30,369
let Jesse talk a little bit or a lot

3302
02:20:28,068 --> 02:20:32,898
actually about he wants to talk about

3303
02:20:30,369 --> 02:20:34,550
light deprivation my brain is blank

3304
02:20:32,898 --> 02:20:36,170
today he wants to talk about light

3305
02:20:34,549 --> 02:20:41,358
deprivation and getting a head start on

3306
02:20:36,170 --> 02:20:42,799
the outdoor season Sean's got a bomb he

3307
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:44,180
wants to drop I'm not sure do you want

3308
02:20:42,799 --> 02:20:46,849
to drop in now or do you want to put

3309
02:20:44,180 --> 02:20:54,109
people in suspense and give this new new

3310
02:20:46,850 --> 02:20:56,479
idea he's gonna talk about renting

3311
02:20:54,109 --> 02:20:58,340
recycled soils and then he's got a bomb

3312
02:20:56,478 --> 02:21:00,769
the drop on the entire drilling world

3313
02:20:58,340 --> 02:21:02,148
you're gonna you're gonna either you're

3314
02:21:00,770 --> 02:21:03,979
gonna hate me or you're gonna love me

3315
02:21:02,148 --> 02:21:06,828
but we're gonna change the way you think

3316
02:21:03,978 --> 02:21:08,179
about a certain item that most people

3317
02:21:06,828 --> 02:21:10,398
are using regularly every gonna

3318
02:21:08,180 --> 02:21:13,520
everybody that I know is everybody's

3319
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:15,559
using I use it regularly in my lineup so

3320
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:17,869
don't think that you know I mean I just

3321
02:21:15,559 --> 02:21:19,670
learned this too so yeah I'm guilty of

3322
02:21:17,869 --> 02:21:21,140
it as well I think you got probably will

3323
02:21:19,670 --> 02:21:23,210
probably give you two weeks to study up

3324
02:21:21,139 --> 02:21:24,349
on it probably skip Yulin at one episode

3325
02:21:23,209 --> 02:21:26,148
just because we don't want you too many

3326
02:21:24,350 --> 02:21:31,750
times you don't get stale and expected

3327
02:21:26,148 --> 02:21:31,750
and then we'll yeah perfect if so anyway

3328
02:21:32,379 --> 02:21:36,228
Drive you back and all that you drop

3329
02:21:34,309 --> 02:21:39,648
that bomb on the show and disrupt

3330
02:21:36,228 --> 02:21:40,608
everybody's growing methods good I've

3331

you can find that Graham was talking

3349
02:22:18,049 --> 02:22:23,688
about remedies on Instagram it's like

3350
02:22:21,529 --> 02:22:26,090
green remedies nature nature's greens or

3351
02:22:23,689 --> 02:22:27,170
something because Instagram is kind of a

3352
02:22:26,090 --> 02:22:30,109

3445

lot of notes over there do you want me

3446

to just let you go about it do you want

3447
02:25:30,998 --> 02:25:33,309

3450
02:25:35,408 --> 02:25:39,998
good starting for it well let's get

3451
02:25:36,969 --> 02:25:41,469
started bro here comes Jesse I really

3452
02:25:39,998 --> 02:25:43,559
don't have as many notes as it looks

3453
02:25:41,469 --> 02:25:43,559
like

3454
02:25:43,709 --> 02:25:49,629
it's really big print it's pretty big

3455
02:25:47,409 --> 02:25:54,389
this top paragraph first three is the

3456
02:25:49,629 --> 02:25:54,389
important part this was written by

3457
02:25:54,840 --> 02:26:00,040
either erica jonathan from forever

3458
02:25:58,209 --> 02:26:01,899
flowering greenhouses sweet I was gonna

3459
02:26:00,040 --> 02:26:05,530
shout that mouth yeah yeah they're great

3460
02:26:01,899 --> 02:26:08,079
guys great products and I found it on a

3461
02:26:05,530 --> 02:26:13,630
website called the ganji.com

3462
02:26:08,079 --> 02:26:17,319
which is also a great website joint

3463
02:26:13,629 --> 02:26:20,679
break so light deprivation this is just

3464
02:26:17,319 --> 02:26:22,869
a definition that we taste good I I

3465
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:26,739
couldn't taste the Tahoe and I'm sure

3466
02:26:22,870 --> 02:26:29,829
yeah I was having trouble and I've

3467
02:26:26,739 --> 02:26:33,100
always had trouble explaining light

3468
02:26:29,829 --> 02:26:36,129
depth to some people so I was used

3469
02:26:33,100 --> 02:26:38,500
someone else's definition of it light

3470
02:26:36,129 --> 02:26:40,750
deprivation aka light depth is the

3471
02:26:38,500 --> 02:26:43,629
process of forcing plants to flower with

3472
02:26:40,750 --> 02:26:45,700
sunlight in a time of year that is not

3473
02:26:43,629 --> 02:26:48,939
normally the flowering period of the

3474
02:26:45,700 --> 02:26:51,130
sun's natural light cycle similar to

3475
02:26:48,940 --> 02:26:53,079
controlling the light cycle with the

3476
02:26:51,129 --> 02:26:55,750
girl life by turning it on and off with

3477
02:26:53,079 --> 02:26:57,940
the timer farmers can control the

3478
02:26:55,750 --> 02:26:59,649
budding cycle by blocking the sunlight

3479
02:26:57,940 --> 02:27:05,079
making the plants think it's time to

3480
02:26:59,649 --> 02:27:07,799
flower typically this is done with the

3481
02:27:05,079 --> 02:27:13,190
hoop house or a greenhouse of some kind

3482
02:27:07,799 --> 02:27:18,659
however it's not actually necessary and

3483
02:27:13,190 --> 02:27:20,829
[Music]

3484
02:27:18,659 --> 02:27:22,360
basically what we're trying to do we

3485
02:27:20,829 --> 02:27:23,739
want to grow outside but we want to get

3486
02:27:22,360 --> 02:27:26,620
a little bit of a jump on the outdoor

3487
02:27:23,739 --> 02:27:28,780
season before the police and thieves go

3488
02:27:26,620 --> 02:27:30,880
looking for the outdoor crops so our

3489
02:27:28,780 --> 02:27:32,710
trick is to build a greenhouse outside

3490
02:27:30,879 --> 02:27:33,939
or a hoop house which I'll let Jessie

3491
02:27:32,709 --> 02:27:36,299
explain how to build a hoop house use

3492
02:27:33,940 --> 02:27:41,170
our construction guy he's got a beard

3493
02:27:36,299 --> 02:27:42,849
and a hammer and a truck we need to do

3494
02:27:41,170 --> 02:27:45,969
we want to put our plants outside and

3495
02:27:42,850 --> 02:27:47,979
outside we'll put them out early before

3496
02:27:45,969 --> 02:27:49,869
we get to our flowering cycle that

3497
02:27:47,978 --> 02:27:51,519
nature gives us with the Sun the Sun

3498
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:53,350
cycles the photo period is what makes

3499
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:55,069
these plants flower so we're gonna trick

3500
02:27:53,350 --> 02:27:57,530
them we're gonna cover up our outdoor

3501
02:27:55,069 --> 02:27:59,239
for a greenhouse or hoop house we're

3502
02:27:57,530 --> 02:28:01,370
gonna cover that up every day at the

3503
02:27:59,239 --> 02:28:03,229
same time and let them sleep for 12

3504
02:28:01,370 --> 02:28:05,150
hours and then uncover it every morning

3505
02:28:03,229 --> 02:28:06,890
at the same time so that these plants

3506
02:28:05,149 --> 02:28:08,659
are tricked into thinking that the

3507
02:28:06,890 --> 02:28:11,869
season has changed to fall and it's time

3508
02:28:08,659 --> 02:28:13,489
for them to flower so maybe we can do

3509
02:28:11,870 --> 02:28:15,051
this with the if you schedule it right

3510
02:28:13,489 --> 02:28:16,940
you can get these going for weeks maybe

3511
02:28:15,050 --> 02:28:19,189
three or four weeks before everybody

3512
02:28:16,940 --> 02:28:20,960
else is in flower you can pull off one

3513
02:28:19,190 --> 02:28:22,190
crop before everybody else and that

3514
02:28:20,959 --> 02:28:25,729
chute won't get stolen

3515
02:28:22,190 --> 02:28:28,280
here you can I have it all figured out

3516
02:28:25,729 --> 02:28:30,170
because I'm doing it myself if you put

3517
02:28:28,280 --> 02:28:34,551
your plants out April 25th here you

3518
02:28:30,170 --> 02:28:36,440
harvest July 30 I want to say wow that's

3519
02:28:34,550 --> 02:28:38,270
really yeah because nobody gets a

3520
02:28:36,440 --> 02:28:40,819
harvest too late September early October

3521
02:28:38,271 --> 02:28:43,280
and October yeah and that's what the 65

3522
02:28:40,819 --> 02:28:44,959
days drained um you know so you're not

3523
02:28:43,280 --> 02:28:46,250
gonna worry about any cold you're not

3524
02:28:44,959 --> 02:28:48,289
gonna get that freeze that everybody

3525
02:28:46,250 --> 02:28:49,940
worries about but you know in our region

3526
02:28:48,290 --> 02:28:52,190
possibly a little bit and you can really

3527
02:28:49,940 --> 02:28:53,870
season you can put plants back in there

3528
02:28:52,190 --> 02:28:55,700
and re flower them didn't you

3529
02:28:53,870 --> 02:28:58,880
you can actually two runs out of that

3530
02:28:55,700 --> 02:29:01,820
yeah two runs easily I've seen three

3531
02:28:58,879 --> 02:29:03,670
runs so actually I've seen four runs but

3532
02:29:01,819 --> 02:29:06,979
that was with the [ __ ] greenhouse

3533
02:29:03,670 --> 02:29:08,810
flowering hoop house or a small

3534
02:29:06,979 --> 02:29:10,189
greenhouse is the way to go if you guys

3535
02:29:08,810 --> 02:29:12,649
are trying to do this on a small level

3536
02:29:10,190 --> 02:29:14,239
the smallest level of light deprivation

3537
02:29:12,649 --> 02:29:17,659
I think you could do put a couple of

3538
02:29:14,239 --> 02:29:20,959
potted plants try to use the seven

3539
02:29:17,659 --> 02:29:22,159
gallon or bigger at least some people

3540
02:29:20,959 --> 02:29:23,750
you know this is for the guy that's just

3541
02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:25,459
trying to do one plant for himself or

3542
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:26,690
whatever yeah put your seven gallon a

3543
02:29:25,459 --> 02:29:27,979
lot of guys are gonna use a five-gallon

3544
02:29:26,690 --> 02:29:30,500
bucket from Home Depot you know that's

3545
02:29:27,979 --> 02:29:33,829
what they're gonna go get 44 what's up

3546
02:29:30,500 --> 02:29:35,090
44 so 44 you take your and 44 was kind

3547
02:29:33,829 --> 02:29:37,069
of doing this last year you take your

3548
02:29:35,090 --> 02:29:39,021
five gallon Home Depot bucket with your

3549
02:29:37,069 --> 02:29:40,579
big-ass plant in there and every day at

3550
02:29:39,021 --> 02:29:42,650
six o'clock or every day at 7 o'clock

3551
02:29:40,579 --> 02:29:43,810
whatever time you choose you gotta pay

3552
02:29:42,649 --> 02:29:46,550
attention what time the Sun Goes Down

3553
02:29:43,810 --> 02:29:48,199
get that plant and go put it in a closet

3554
02:29:46,550 --> 02:29:53,479
in the house just put it back in your

3555
02:29:48,200 --> 02:29:54,891
girl room yeah just put it in the room

3556
02:29:53,479 --> 02:29:56,270
for the night and let it sleep every

3557
02:29:54,890 --> 02:29:58,190
night at the same time and it has to go

3558
02:29:56,271 --> 02:30:00,170
back outside under the Sun every night

3559
02:29:58,190 --> 02:30:01,730
at or every day at the same time as long

3560
02:30:00,170 --> 02:30:03,290
as you give that plant 12 hours of

3561
02:30:01,729 --> 02:30:05,779
consistent 12 hours of darkness

3562
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:07,260
uninterrupted every night you can do a

3563
02:30:05,780 --> 02:30:09,989
light depth like that and use the

3564
02:30:07,260 --> 02:30:13,350
in a closet whose grill area here's the

3565
02:30:09,989 --> 02:30:15,449
trick to you don't actually have to put

3566
02:30:13,350 --> 02:30:19,620
it back out at the same time just not

3567
02:30:15,450 --> 02:30:22,229
gonna wait for you know 10 11 o'clock at

3568
02:30:19,620 --> 02:30:23,870
night you know safe time Sun completely

3569
02:30:22,228 --> 02:30:28,019
down no lumens

3570
02:30:23,870 --> 02:30:29,640
genius and then use a user Farmers

3571
02:30:28,020 --> 02:30:30,540
Almanac to find out what time Sun goes

3572
02:30:29,639 --> 02:30:33,358
up that long ago

3573
02:30:30,540 --> 02:30:36,380
yeah and typically you're probably

3574
02:30:33,359 --> 02:30:38,790
getting your first actual this is from

3575
02:30:36,379 --> 02:30:41,759
Jonathan a favor flowering actually how

3576
02:30:38,790 --> 02:30:43,859
about this mark but you get your first

3577
02:30:41,760 --> 02:30:46,800
movements probably before the Sun

3578
02:30:43,859 --> 02:30:49,790
actually comes up yes so you know take

3579
02:30:46,799 --> 02:30:53,278
20 minutes off that time but yeah that's

3580
02:30:49,790 --> 02:30:55,800
yeah I've done it before the

3581
02:30:53,279 --> 02:30:57,989
old-fashioned or the other way of you

3582
02:30:55,799 --> 02:31:04,739
know seven and seven and it's very

3583
02:30:57,989 --> 02:31:06,510
tedious bring that plant in at seven

3584
02:31:04,739 --> 02:31:08,010
o'clock let it chill out before you go

3585
02:31:06,510 --> 02:31:10,500
to bed at eleven or twelve go put it

3586
02:31:08,010 --> 02:31:11,969
back outside cuz it's nighttime the

3587
02:31:10,500 --> 02:31:13,469
sun's gonna come up yeah yeah it's gonna

3588
02:31:11,969 --> 02:31:17,068
be six thirty seven o'clock in the

3589
02:31:13,469 --> 02:31:18,778
summer probably exactly that's a good

3590
02:31:17,068 --> 02:31:22,559
idea right there that's basically free

3591
02:31:18,779 --> 02:31:24,000
yeah I'm gonna buy a big-ass pot you

3592
02:31:22,559 --> 02:31:25,469
gotta buy some soil you gotta buy some

3593
02:31:24,000 --> 02:31:27,000
Rocky Mountain worms you got to buy some

3594
02:31:25,469 --> 02:31:29,429
grow Kashi you need some dragonfly earth

3595
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,568
medicine a lot of cool other [ __ ] Sam

3596
02:31:29,430 --> 02:31:31,859
Houser my it a little bit mix that up

3597
02:31:30,568 --> 02:31:33,510
Sean's gonna teach you what to put in

3598
02:31:31,859 --> 02:31:36,329
your soil a couple episodes put all that

3599
02:31:33,510 --> 02:31:40,559
[ __ ] in a pot put a nice clone of some

3600
02:31:36,329 --> 02:31:43,139
grateful dog in there yep you can do it

3601
02:31:40,559 --> 02:31:47,389
that's free weed you can I mean you

3602
02:31:43,139 --> 02:31:47,389
could use the garage I shed you know

3603
02:31:47,870 --> 02:31:52,410
I've seen people take a big-ass trash

3604
02:31:51,000 --> 02:31:54,180
can if you got a little plant you take a

3605
02:31:52,409 --> 02:31:55,770
little big 30 something gallon trash can

3606
02:31:54,180 --> 02:31:57,479
drill some holes in the bottom of it so

3607
02:31:55,770 --> 02:31:59,520
that you got airflow and just set that

3608
02:31:57,478 --> 02:32:01,260
[ __ ] right on top of it yeah I've seen

3609
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:03,120
him do that for hailstorms but also seem

3610
02:32:01,260 --> 02:32:05,398
to do that for a shitty light debt it'll

3611
02:32:03,120 --> 02:32:06,990
work I mean it's absurd work it'll work

3612
02:32:05,398 --> 02:32:09,510
it's not gonna be you know the most

3613
02:32:06,989 --> 02:32:11,489
amazing but it's what you got so do you

3614
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:13,829
want to teach these guys how to do hoop

3615
02:32:11,489 --> 02:32:15,550
house just like a quick since you the

3616
02:32:13,829 --> 02:32:17,319
man with the hammer at all

3617
02:32:15,550 --> 02:32:20,411
real simple one it's just you need a

3618
02:32:17,319 --> 02:32:22,620
gravel pad or an elevated area I mean

3619
02:32:20,411 --> 02:32:25,081
you don't need it but you need drainage

3620
02:32:22,620 --> 02:32:30,880
it keeps it from being a muddy mess

3621
02:32:25,081 --> 02:32:32,501
Jesus I'm stoned again I made the

3622
02:32:30,880 --> 02:32:35,380
mistake and not smoking all day before

3623
02:32:32,501 --> 02:32:39,130
coming it just I have to do when you

3624
02:32:35,380 --> 02:32:43,450
show up at my spot it's dad time to warm

3625
02:32:39,130 --> 02:32:45,729
up but yeah I mean take two by fours lay

3626
02:32:43,450 --> 02:32:49,630
him down on the ground screw into each

3627
02:32:45,729 --> 02:32:53,591
other like a big rectangle eight-foot by

3628
02:32:49,630 --> 02:32:56,200
let's say 12-foot so you need to eight

3629
02:32:53,591 --> 02:32:59,291
foot two by fours to 12 foot two by

3630
02:32:56,200 --> 02:33:03,609
fours I'll make a rectangle pretty how

3631
02:32:59,290 --> 02:33:04,540
much had full screws build that stake it

3632
02:33:03,610 --> 02:33:06,881
to the ground

3633
02:33:04,540 --> 02:33:09,850
lots of different ways to do that a

3634
02:33:06,880 --> 02:33:15,520
piece of rebar or something and then now

3635
02:33:09,851 --> 02:33:17,860
the you know nail the rebar to the to

3636
02:33:15,521 --> 02:33:21,421
the 2x4 with a fence staple or something

3637
02:33:17,860 --> 02:33:25,569
like that and then take you you a

3638
02:33:21,421 --> 02:33:27,399
12-foot he's counting he's doing he's

3639
02:33:25,569 --> 02:33:35,520
doing construction math I'd say at least

3640
02:33:27,399 --> 02:33:40,359
six pieces of at least two inch PVC

3641
02:33:35,521 --> 02:33:42,011
would need to be at least twelve or

3642
02:33:40,360 --> 02:33:45,400
fourteen foot long I think to make the

3643
02:33:42,011 --> 02:33:48,310
entire hoop over okay but at the front

3644
02:33:45,399 --> 02:33:51,280
you'll screw basically you're just gonna

3645
02:33:48,310 --> 02:33:53,110
bend the PVC into the hoop you don't

3646
02:33:51,281 --> 02:33:54,761
have circle yeah you're making kind of a

3647
02:33:53,110 --> 02:33:56,711
it just looks like a really cheap

3648
02:33:54,761 --> 02:34:01,569
greenhouse yeah yeah and then you use

3649
02:33:56,710 --> 02:34:03,220
some clamps like some conduit clamps you

3650
02:34:01,569 --> 02:34:05,351
can even just screw straight through the

3651
02:34:03,220 --> 02:34:09,729
PVC into the but I mean you got to

3652
02:34:05,351 --> 02:34:12,159
secure to the 2x4 so now so for a 12

3653
02:34:09,729 --> 02:34:15,159
foot greenhouse I'd put up

3654
02:34:12,159 --> 02:34:15,670
four of those pieces of PVC or four

3655
02:34:15,159 --> 02:34:17,739
hoops

3656
02:34:15,670 --> 02:34:20,590
and then used one as a skeleton beam

3657
02:34:17,739 --> 02:34:23,079
down the middle that that would be at

3658
02:34:20,590 --> 02:34:25,809
the peak attach it with zip ties or

3659
02:34:23,079 --> 02:34:28,360
something like that if you're in a

3660
02:34:25,809 --> 02:34:30,510
really windy or yeah you'll probably

3661
02:34:28,360 --> 02:34:36,460
want to beef up your material a little

3662
02:34:30,510 --> 02:34:38,710
yeah like the Front Range Colorado and

3663
02:34:36,459 --> 02:34:42,398
then you know just throw some plastic

3664
02:34:38,709 --> 02:34:44,769
over it no we got a greenhouse it's

3665
02:34:42,398 --> 02:34:47,170
pretty simple some thin see-through

3666
02:34:44,770 --> 02:34:47,829
plastic right over it yeah they've got a

3667
02:34:47,170 --> 02:34:51,010
weatherproof

3668
02:34:47,829 --> 02:34:52,809
weather resistant greenhouse yeah so now

3669
02:34:51,010 --> 02:34:54,489
you basically built this big rectangle

3670
02:34:52,809 --> 02:34:57,250
you've secured the rectangle to the

3671
02:34:54,489 --> 02:34:59,799
ground and then we took PVC and made

3672
02:34:57,250 --> 02:35:02,379
arches and then he just made one two

3673
02:34:59,799 --> 02:35:03,609
three four so arches mm-hmm you got one

3674
02:35:02,379 --> 02:35:05,170
a teach-in and then a couple the middle

3675
02:35:03,610 --> 02:35:05,470
then you take that one right down the

3676
02:35:05,170 --> 02:35:07,719
center

3677
02:35:05,469 --> 02:35:09,609
yeah and then we just drape plastic and

3678
02:35:07,719 --> 02:35:12,069
secure the plastic and each and the

3679
02:35:09,610 --> 02:35:13,329
bottom on each side mm-hmm and then I do

3680
02:35:12,069 --> 02:35:14,079
you let it hang you get make some on the

3681
02:35:13,329 --> 02:35:15,549
front back too

3682
02:35:14,079 --> 02:35:17,439
or do you just let the front back open

3683
02:35:15,549 --> 02:35:19,148
if you're willing to do it cheap I just

3684
02:35:17,439 --> 02:35:21,790
really recommend leaving them open okay

3685
02:35:19,148 --> 02:35:23,379
if you get some airflow in there unless

3686
02:35:21,790 --> 02:35:27,880
it rains totally sideways you should be

3687
02:35:23,379 --> 02:35:29,289
yeah I mean you can have the plastic now

3688
02:35:27,879 --> 02:35:31,509
that greenhouse is good all year right

3689
02:35:29,290 --> 02:35:32,830
like you can use that for if you don't

3690
02:35:31,510 --> 02:35:35,020
want to do light depth that's a perfect

3691
02:35:32,829 --> 02:35:36,700
cheap little hoop house you can bunch of

3692
02:35:35,020 --> 02:35:39,579
cannabis in there by 12 you can put a

3693
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:41,350
lot of pots in there yeah okay okay so

3694
02:35:39,579 --> 02:35:42,579
guys get get some seeds going or get

3695
02:35:41,350 --> 02:35:44,079
some clones cut now because you're gonna

3696
02:35:42,579 --> 02:35:48,819
want to get these suckers outside pretty

3697
02:35:44,079 --> 02:35:50,879
soon veg on the inside

3698
02:35:48,819 --> 02:35:53,559
we haven't actually addressed this

3699
02:35:50,879 --> 02:35:56,409
Padgham inside to the size that you

3700
02:35:53,559 --> 02:36:01,949
would normally flip a plant or even

3701
02:35:56,409 --> 02:36:06,250
[ __ ] bigger our light dip Placer

3702
02:36:01,950 --> 02:36:08,590
[ __ ] guy gigantic I mean and they're

3703
02:36:06,250 --> 02:36:12,579
Turkey they taste good they're as big as

3704
02:36:08,590 --> 02:36:14,559
an outdoor plant when it's starts starts

3705
02:36:12,579 --> 02:36:18,690
flowering outdoors you know an inground

3706
02:36:14,559 --> 02:36:22,560
traditional or natural light cycle flat

3707
02:36:18,690 --> 02:36:25,801
I mean the yield is uh my custody

3708
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:27,060
numbers but it's it's very much worth it

3709
02:36:25,800 --> 02:36:28,680
if you do it right yeah this will

3710
02:36:27,060 --> 02:36:31,050
definitely pay for itself definitely

3711
02:36:28,681 --> 02:36:33,931
that outdoor cannabis is so good it's

3712
02:36:31,050 --> 02:36:37,310
definitely good it tastes good and then

3713
02:36:33,931 --> 02:36:39,931
does amazing things green house cannabis

3714
02:36:37,310 --> 02:36:42,931
you know it has been protected from the

3715
02:36:39,931 --> 02:36:47,329
wind and rain so it's a lot more frosty

3716
02:36:42,931 --> 02:36:47,329
er looks a little more like indoor weed

3717
02:36:47,421 --> 02:36:54,870
my favorite yeah I honestly prefer to

3718
02:36:52,440 --> 02:36:56,881
endure some turps exactly you can't

3719
02:36:54,870 --> 02:36:58,620
match that Sun yeah in that controlled

3720
02:36:56,880 --> 02:37:00,449
environment alright so we've got this

3721
02:36:58,620 --> 02:37:03,120
hoop house and it's pretty much weather

3722
02:37:00,450 --> 02:37:18,570
resistant it's 8 by 12 how tall I

3723
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:20,730
usually end up about 7 8 feet tall 7

3724
02:37:18,569 --> 02:37:22,770
feet tall in here you could get gigantic

3725
02:37:20,729 --> 02:37:28,350
with this I've seen some guys in NorCal

3726
02:37:22,771 --> 02:37:31,159
I mean they have scissor lifts to pull

3727
02:37:28,351 --> 02:37:33,391
the plastic over and [ __ ] like a matches

3728
02:37:31,159 --> 02:37:35,521
we're gonna have to talk about now we're

3729
02:37:33,390 --> 02:37:36,659
trying to make this light depth so we're

3730
02:37:35,521 --> 02:37:39,480
gonna put our plants out there when

3731
02:37:36,659 --> 02:37:42,149
they're waist high ish maybe a little

3732
02:37:39,479 --> 02:37:43,609
higher maybe I'm tall so I can't really

3733
02:37:42,149 --> 02:37:46,859
[Music]

3734
02:37:43,610 --> 02:37:49,351
about 36 to 42 inches tall you want to

3735
02:37:46,860 --> 02:37:50,551
start inducing flower and now we can't

3736
02:37:49,351 --> 02:37:52,980
just flip the light like we used to

3737
02:37:50,550 --> 02:37:54,600
indoors to 12 12 now we've got to do it

3738
02:37:52,979 --> 02:37:56,310
like jessie was saying we've got to use

3739
02:37:54,601 --> 02:37:58,290
some sort of cover we got to use some

3740
02:37:56,310 --> 02:38:00,630
kind of tarp so you need if you've got

3741
02:37:58,290 --> 02:38:02,160
if your greenhouse is 12 feet long and 8

3742
02:38:00,630 --> 02:38:03,569
feet wide you're gonna need like 12 by

3743
02:38:02,159 --> 02:38:05,011
12 at least to cover it because that

3744
02:38:03,569 --> 02:38:08,190
arch is gonna take a lot more space

3745
02:38:05,011 --> 02:38:10,620
probably 12 by 15 or so right yeah yeah

3746
02:38:08,190 --> 02:38:13,560
so just get a 15 by 15 tartness that you

3747
02:38:10,620 --> 02:38:15,311
have plenty of coverage yeah and make

3748
02:38:13,560 --> 02:38:17,229
sure it's actually

3749
02:38:15,310 --> 02:38:20,319
it actually blocks out the Sun yeah you

3750
02:38:17,229 --> 02:38:23,739
might have to use two layers I have used

3751
02:38:20,319 --> 02:38:28,001
I get green tarps because of the green

3752
02:38:23,739 --> 02:38:31,210
spectrum supposedly you know I don't

3753
02:38:28,001 --> 02:38:32,890
know if that's yeah I don't know about

3754
02:38:31,210 --> 02:38:37,449
the science behind that that's just I

3755
02:38:32,890 --> 02:38:39,761
was standing in there and I was like all

3756
02:38:37,450 --> 02:38:41,801
of the light you need it dark so

3757
02:38:39,761 --> 02:38:43,841
whatever time you pick every night off

3758
02:38:41,800 --> 02:38:44,859
you pick seven o'clock you gotta figure

3759
02:38:43,841 --> 02:38:46,569
out what time the sun's gonna come up

3760
02:38:44,860 --> 02:38:48,551
yeah if you pick seven o'clock you gotta

3761
02:38:46,569 --> 02:38:51,251
go out to this hoop house every night

3762
02:38:48,550 --> 02:38:53,020
and cover it up with the tarp so it's

3763
02:38:51,251 --> 02:38:55,659
completely dark the first few times you

3764
02:38:53,021 --> 02:38:58,329
do it go in there and hang out wait for

3765
02:38:55,659 --> 02:38:59,501
like 40 minutes just lay down and hang

3766
02:38:58,329 --> 02:39:01,960
out for a little bit close your eyes

3767
02:38:59,501 --> 02:39:03,880
adjust to the dark if you can see any

3768
02:39:01,960 --> 02:39:05,649
light if you can see any light in there

3769
02:39:03,880 --> 02:39:07,569
it's too much like you gotta make it

3770
02:39:05,649 --> 02:39:11,979
darker I continuously do that through

3771
02:39:07,569 --> 02:39:14,140
the season yeah yeah so it's with tarps

3772
02:39:11,979 --> 02:39:17,261
and cheaper material I mean you forever

3773
02:39:14,140 --> 02:39:18,609
flowering makes really nice stuff if

3774
02:39:17,261 --> 02:39:20,171
you've got some money to spend in some

3775
02:39:18,610 --> 02:39:21,881
land to put it on check out forever

3776
02:39:20,171 --> 02:39:23,591
flowering greenhouses well yeah but it's

3777
02:39:21,880 --> 02:39:25,029
not your backyard setup though you can

3778
02:39:23,591 --> 02:39:26,711
get just the greenhouse fabrics from

3779
02:39:25,030 --> 02:39:28,570
them and I was weak and they're actually

3780
02:39:26,710 --> 02:39:31,510
not too expensive I'm gonna do it this

3781
02:39:28,569 --> 02:39:34,989
year and they also have a blackout tarp

3782
02:39:31,511 --> 02:39:36,640
that's breathable so you know that's and

3783
02:39:34,989 --> 02:39:40,290
it's not too much to just order the tart

3784
02:39:36,640 --> 02:39:42,341
from them so if you can afford that that

3785
02:39:40,290 --> 02:39:47,590
other one I only sent you

3786
02:39:42,341 --> 02:39:52,501
yeah yeah please we want hats I'm trying

3787
02:39:47,591 --> 02:39:54,881
to close the deal for you man but uh

3788
02:39:52,501 --> 02:39:56,319
damn I lost my train of thought thinking

3789
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:59,290
about they're bitching half covering it

3790
02:39:56,319 --> 02:40:03,569
up oh yeah the cheap plastic it's gonna

3791
02:39:59,290 --> 02:40:06,369
tear throughout the season so you know

3792
02:40:03,569 --> 02:40:09,640
continuously check it have extra plastic

3793
02:40:06,370 --> 02:40:12,130
I put past and put the tarp and in

3794
02:40:09,640 --> 02:40:14,170
plastic over it so

3795
02:40:12,129 --> 02:40:16,809
to make sure you get a total blackout

3796
02:40:14,170 --> 02:40:18,790
okay yeah yes any light in there that's

3797
02:40:16,809 --> 02:40:20,889
her point guys so every night this is

3798
02:40:18,790 --> 02:40:23,260
the whole time you're doing this every

3799
02:40:20,889 --> 02:40:24,819
night somebody hopefully you hopefully

3800
02:40:23,260 --> 02:40:26,319
you've got the dedication somebody's got

3801
02:40:24,819 --> 02:40:27,939
to go out there every night and make

3802
02:40:26,319 --> 02:40:29,289
this [ __ ] dark yeah and then every

3803
02:40:27,939 --> 02:40:31,720
morning you have to go out there and

3804
02:40:29,290 --> 02:40:32,830
turn the lights on by uncovering it yeah

3805
02:40:31,719 --> 02:40:34,539
you're gonna get some hair you're gonna

3806
02:40:32,829 --> 02:40:36,430
have to get air flow in there while it's

3807
02:40:34,540 --> 02:40:37,689
covered up so think about a waited to

3808
02:40:36,430 --> 02:40:39,189
get air flow in there while you're

3809
02:40:37,689 --> 02:40:43,680
covered you might need a fan towards the

3810
02:40:39,189 --> 02:40:46,829
floor yeah a trick I used for that is

3811
02:40:43,680 --> 02:40:48,670
this also helps keep everything secure

3812
02:40:46,829 --> 02:40:51,549
dedicated you just pulled out forever

3813
02:40:48,670 --> 02:40:53,710
flowers stickers oh nice and a business

3814
02:40:51,549 --> 02:40:56,529
card there you go yeah help you get in

3815
02:40:53,709 --> 02:40:58,839
touch with them for sure yeah

3816
02:40:56,530 --> 02:41:07,030
[Music]

3817
02:40:58,840 --> 02:41:08,228
I met him once kind of it was when they

3818
02:41:07,030 --> 02:41:18,280
were through the crater site one time

3819
02:41:08,228 --> 02:41:20,319
yeah no smoking out there yeah that dude

3820
02:41:18,280 --> 02:41:22,960
was it like some sativa or something in

3821
02:41:20,319 --> 02:41:29,978
those tubes yes that was actually some

3822
02:41:22,959 --> 02:41:33,959
lemon Geoffrey Sour Diesel - you're

3823
02:41:29,978 --> 02:41:33,959
losing my [ __ ] around

3824
02:41:34,139 --> 02:41:37,458
[Music]

3825
02:41:43,079 --> 02:41:50,429
[Music]

3826
02:41:53,780 --> 02:41:58,168
[Music]

3827
02:41:55,889 --> 02:42:00,180
I'll remember light def is awesome

3828
02:41:58,168 --> 02:42:02,908
you're just talking about what fabric

3829
02:42:00,180 --> 02:42:06,029
and stuff you're ventilation yeah I'll

3830
02:42:02,908 --> 02:42:12,180
take loose turf and like a 10 inch or a

3831
02:42:06,029 --> 02:42:13,498
12 inch one and of the ducting to it tie

3832
02:42:12,180 --> 02:42:15,148
it to the side of the greenhouse so it's

3833
02:42:13,498 --> 02:42:18,119
up off the ground it doesn't suck any

3834
02:42:15,148 --> 02:42:20,368
dirt or anything into the fan set that

3835
02:42:18,119 --> 02:42:23,248
on the floor of the greenhouse plug it

3836
02:42:20,369 --> 02:42:25,649
in pull your tarps hook to that have

3837
02:42:23,248 --> 02:42:28,588
like a six-foot chunk of ducting and

3838
02:42:25,648 --> 02:42:30,958
pull that out wrap the plastic around it

3839
02:42:28,588 --> 02:42:32,850
there you go and make it do a couple of

3840
02:42:30,959 --> 02:42:36,299
asses on the ground and all that good

3841
02:42:32,850 --> 02:42:37,619
stuff you got a bigger ducting keep the

3842
02:42:36,299 --> 02:42:38,789
lights on I know everybody tells you to

3843
02:42:37,619 --> 02:42:40,078
keep your ducting straight but at this

3844
02:42:38,789 --> 02:42:42,869
time you got to bend it let's say you

3845
02:42:40,078 --> 02:42:44,818
keep light out and that puts a negative

3846
02:42:42,869 --> 02:42:47,248
pressure on the greenhouse too it helps

3847
02:42:44,818 --> 02:42:49,168
suck the tarp nice and tight yeah if

3848
02:42:47,248 --> 02:42:50,100
you've got a syllabub good okay yeah

3849
02:42:49,168 --> 02:42:53,968
that's a good idea

3850
02:42:50,100 --> 02:42:57,209
use some some Timbers rocks whatever

3851
02:42:53,968 --> 02:43:00,918
that is there or whatever to hold the

3852
02:42:57,209 --> 02:43:05,129
tarp down you know once you pull it over

3853
02:43:00,918 --> 02:43:06,628
you can have sandbags but that'll be on

3854
02:43:05,129 --> 02:43:07,829
the edges on the ground is something

3855
02:43:06,629 --> 02:43:10,459
heavy enough to keep waiting from

3856
02:43:07,828 --> 02:43:13,738
literature you're taking your tarp away

3857
02:43:10,459 --> 02:43:18,229
and then like squeeze clamps from Harbor

3858
02:43:13,738 --> 02:43:23,548
Freight like big ol alligator clips oh

3859
02:43:18,228 --> 02:43:27,568
yeah yeah yeah use those to help secure

3860
02:43:23,549 --> 02:43:30,060
it all to the PVC frame and also close

3861
02:43:27,568 --> 02:43:33,269
up the ends wrapped plastic real tight

3862
02:43:30,059 --> 02:43:34,889
and clamp the clamps on them all right

3863
02:43:33,270 --> 02:43:41,189
we got a sweet structure we got some

3864
02:43:34,889 --> 02:43:42,418
cover we've got some airflow plants to

3865
02:43:41,189 --> 02:43:43,949
go in there hopefully you got some good

3866
02:43:42,418 --> 02:43:44,789
ira genetics or some gauge green

3867
02:43:43,949 --> 02:43:47,149
genetics or some

3868
02:43:44,789 --> 02:43:49,349
to put in there they'd be pretty sweet

3869
02:43:47,148 --> 02:43:50,519
you can do the opposite with this also

3870
02:43:49,349 --> 02:43:53,009
you guys if you're trying to keep your

3871
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:55,949
growing season going longer you can put

3872
02:43:53,009 --> 02:43:57,328
lights in this greenhouse - which sounds

3873
02:43:55,949 --> 02:43:58,799
strange but sometimes your plants are

3874
02:43:57,328 --> 02:44:00,869
gonna flower earlier than you want them

3875
02:43:58,799 --> 02:44:02,699
to in some areas if you're in a warmer

3876
02:44:00,869 --> 02:44:03,869
place and then you can keep it going and

3877
02:44:02,699 --> 02:44:05,009
then you may have to add a heater later

3878
02:44:03,869 --> 02:44:06,389
in the season but if you're trying to

3879
02:44:05,009 --> 02:44:07,439
get to grows out of it like we were

3880
02:44:06,388 --> 02:44:09,509
talking about you can pull off that

3881
02:44:07,439 --> 02:44:11,398
light depth grow hang up a couple whites

3882
02:44:09,509 --> 02:44:12,689
veg some plants in there all you have to

3883
02:44:11,398 --> 02:44:14,548
do when the Sun Goes Down at night just

3884
02:44:12,689 --> 02:44:15,869
turn on one or two lights and those will

3885
02:44:14,549 --> 02:44:17,729
keep your plants awake so that they

3886
02:44:15,869 --> 02:44:19,289
don't go into flower when you're ready

3887
02:44:17,728 --> 02:44:21,658
just take the lights down then you can

3888
02:44:19,289 --> 02:44:25,289
get that whole other it can just be CFLs

3889
02:44:21,658 --> 02:44:27,148
- it doesn't stay on all the time you

3890
02:44:25,289 --> 02:44:28,649
can just walk through every couple of

3891
02:44:27,148 --> 02:44:30,358
hours of light and it'll wake them up

3892
02:44:28,648 --> 02:44:32,218
for sure they just disrupt that they

3893
02:44:30,359 --> 02:44:33,658
won't hurt out the Sun like that they'll

3894
02:44:32,218 --> 02:44:36,148
be cool so that's a good way to get to

3895
02:44:33,658 --> 02:44:37,679
full harvest out of this cheap ah you're

3896
02:44:36,148 --> 02:44:39,778
gonna have to put a heater in there yeah

3897
02:44:37,679 --> 02:44:41,459
if you do it that way but you get 2 full

3898
02:44:39,779 --> 02:44:44,309
crops out of this and if you're doing 18

3899
02:44:41,459 --> 02:44:48,109
buy or we doing 12 by 8 yeah it will a

3900
02:44:44,308 --> 02:44:50,488
you can fit quite a few plants in there

3901
02:44:48,109 --> 02:44:52,439
numbers well it depends on your

3902
02:44:50,488 --> 02:44:53,788
container so Zane your plants right but

3903
02:44:52,439 --> 02:44:56,549
you're eight feet wide you can do either

3904
02:44:53,789 --> 02:44:58,469
two or three pots yeah I mean come on

3905
02:44:56,549 --> 02:45:00,629
endeavor three there's no need to have a

3906
02:44:58,468 --> 02:45:02,128
walk space if you need to get in there

3907
02:45:00,629 --> 02:45:06,059
just pull the plants out I mean it's

3908
02:45:02,129 --> 02:45:12,869
freaking outdoor so you know that's army

3909
02:45:06,058 --> 02:45:15,328
crawl through your rooms that's no

3910
02:45:12,869 --> 02:45:18,838
square foot of biomass if you do it

3911
02:45:15,328 --> 02:45:19,888
right so lots of train to get the plants

3912
02:45:18,838 --> 02:45:22,648
going all right

3913
02:45:19,888 --> 02:45:24,958
96 square feet of tops feel like that's

3914
02:45:22,648 --> 02:45:27,538
a decent start on light death yeah sure

3915

02:46:14,430 --> 02:46:23,130
inbox it takes work though yeah for you

3936
02:46:20,729 --> 02:46:26,879
there's more work they'll already kind

3937
02:46:23,129 --> 02:46:29,670
of I'm already working like light dev

3938
02:46:26,879 --> 02:46:32,879
takes a lot of dedication and commitment

3939
02:46:29,670 --> 02:46:34,440
so yes like ninja status but for the

3940
02:46:32,879 --> 02:46:36,119
cost of the supplies the time you're

3941
02:46:34,440 --> 02:46:38,250
gonna do it you don't have to pay for

3942
02:46:36,120 --> 02:46:40,020
any electricity and the Sun is free as

3943
02:46:38,250 --> 02:46:42,239
long as you're reliable with getting out

3944
02:46:40,020 --> 02:46:45,300
and covering and uncovering everyday and

3945
02:46:42,239 --> 02:46:46,530
not letting keeping the air flow when

3946
02:46:45,299 --> 02:46:49,739
they're not letting it get stagnant in

3947
02:46:46,530 --> 02:46:52,440
there you should be cool I think I think

3948
02:46:49,739 --> 02:46:53,879
when Sean comes to talk about his soil

3949
02:46:52,440 --> 02:46:55,409
recycling we'll talk a little bit about

3950
02:46:53,879 --> 02:46:59,179
keeping bugs away unless you guys want

3951
02:46:55,409 --> 02:47:04,649
to talk about bugs an outdoor right now

3952
02:46:59,180 --> 02:47:06,329
prevention let's go talk about yeah how

3953
02:47:04,649 --> 02:47:09,180
are we gonna keep bug to actually okay I

3954
02:47:06,329 --> 02:47:13,440
had a friend asked me um about

3955
02:47:09,180 --> 02:47:16,290
caterpillars last night yeah and there's

3956
02:47:13,440 --> 02:47:19,170
not a lot you can do about them once

3957
02:47:16,290 --> 02:47:22,350
that happens just you know manual labor

3958
02:47:19,170 --> 02:47:23,270
pick them out cut away the wrong manual

3959
02:47:22,350 --> 02:47:24,381
and have them company

3960
02:47:23,270 --> 02:47:27,461
[Music]

3961
02:47:24,380 --> 02:47:30,831
that's a little thing is a local joke I

3962
02:47:27,460 --> 02:47:32,869
actually used to know a guy he told

3963
02:47:30,831 --> 02:47:35,540
everyone that was his name and his first

3964
02:47:32,870 --> 02:47:37,551
name actually was Manuel so how do we

3965
02:47:35,540 --> 02:47:41,899
keep the caterpillars from getting into

3966
02:47:37,550 --> 02:47:44,239
the grow I believe I was told those

3967
02:47:41,899 --> 02:47:47,470
little [ __ ] lay their eggs about

3968
02:47:44,239 --> 02:47:50,239
three weeks before you actually see him

3969
02:47:47,470 --> 02:47:53,270
so that's when it's still pretty early

3970
02:47:50,239 --> 02:47:55,069
but growth and you know it's especially

3971
02:47:53,271 --> 02:47:56,841
outdoors they're still stretching a lot

3972
02:47:55,069 --> 02:47:59,331
at that point there's just a little

3973
02:47:56,841 --> 02:48:03,771
popcorn notes on [ __ ]

3974
02:47:59,331 --> 02:48:07,610
so spinosad is my had great success with

3975
02:48:03,771 --> 02:48:10,101
last year I got a Monterey spray

3976
02:48:07,610 --> 02:48:13,041
yeah Monterey bug spray Mike's awesome

3977
02:48:10,101 --> 02:48:16,551
ice no actually we don't have that one I

3978
02:48:13,040 --> 02:48:19,609
think I bought it there whoa we have the

3979
02:48:16,550 --> 02:48:22,399
captain child not too harsh actually has

3980
02:48:19,610 --> 02:48:29,690
more spinosad in it then Monterey of

3981
02:48:22,399 --> 02:48:33,501
belief so neem oil although I mean neem

3982
02:48:29,690 --> 02:48:35,261
oil works great so it's actually a

3983
02:48:33,501 --> 02:48:38,300
bacteria found in the bottle of rum

3984
02:48:35,261 --> 02:48:40,819
barrels yeah I think it's it's good to

3985
02:48:38,300 --> 02:48:42,439
be used it needs to be it's something to

3986
02:48:40,819 --> 02:48:44,751
be used strategically like Jesse was

3987
02:48:42,440 --> 02:48:47,120
saying but it needs to be well playing

3988
02:48:44,751 --> 02:48:49,489
thought out talk to other people figure

3989
02:48:47,120 --> 02:48:51,261
out when they usually see this probably

3990
02:48:49,489 --> 02:48:53,931
absolutely I thought so I mean 102

3991
02:48:51,261 --> 02:48:55,881
strategically yeah you don't just spray

3992
02:48:53,931 --> 02:48:57,980
willy-nilly I mean you want to you want

3993
02:48:55,880 --> 02:48:59,810
to apply for reasons at certain times

3994
02:48:57,979 --> 02:49:02,630
you want to get a tune with your

3995
02:48:59,810 --> 02:49:04,341
environment that's where I feel about

3996
02:49:02,630 --> 02:49:05,930
that I mean you yeah you want to utilize

3997
02:49:04,341 --> 02:49:07,489
everything that you can there's you

3998
02:49:05,931 --> 02:49:11,149
don't have too many options especially

3999
02:49:07,489 --> 02:49:14,859
here in Pueblo with our extreme weather

4000
02:49:11,149 --> 02:49:17,978
and it's amazing yeah

4001
02:49:14,859 --> 02:49:19,359
well yes you're high and dry I said if I

4002
02:49:17,978 --> 02:49:26,559
was a spider mite I don't want to live

4003
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:28,959
here here I mean I've seen crops here

4004
02:49:26,559 --> 02:49:31,269
completely wrecked by ioud here goes

4005
02:49:28,959 --> 02:49:33,189
organics again I've seen crops here

4006
02:49:31,270 --> 02:49:35,379
completely wrecked by spider mites and

4007
02:49:33,189 --> 02:49:38,520
powdery mold and I've never had an issue

4008
02:49:35,379 --> 02:49:40,749
with them personally I have found that

4009
02:49:38,520 --> 02:49:42,069
you know occasionally you'll have some

4010
02:49:40,748 --> 02:49:45,309
when the plants come out in the spring

4011
02:49:42,068 --> 02:49:50,559
and they're very easy to deal with a

4012
02:49:45,309 --> 02:49:55,359
little neem oil maybe some like

4013
02:49:50,559 --> 02:49:57,458
lemongrass paste some water there's you

4014
02:49:55,359 --> 02:50:00,279
know very easy to deal with most of the

4015
02:49:57,459 --> 02:50:02,590
bugs just don't like water yeah Moisture

4016
02:50:00,279 --> 02:50:05,408
though Gardens I've seen react by Mr

4017
02:50:02,590 --> 02:50:07,568
Newt or bottle-fed they're pouring

4018
02:50:05,408 --> 02:50:10,449
[ __ ] chelated nutrients into the

4019
02:50:07,568 --> 02:50:12,908
earth you know I think the big problem

4020
02:50:10,449 --> 02:50:15,489
is it usually and it comes in two

4021
02:50:12,908 --> 02:50:17,828
situations either a they don't do

4022
02:50:15,488 --> 02:50:19,689
anything about it and then they just get

4023
02:50:17,828 --> 02:50:21,068
the infestation and then that's usually

4024
02:50:19,689 --> 02:50:23,050
where they want to come in and treat

4025
02:50:21,068 --> 02:50:27,038
with like an eagle 20 or tetras and or

4026
02:50:23,049 --> 02:50:29,099
something like that or the other

4027
02:50:27,039 --> 02:50:32,498
situation is is that they'll actually

4028
02:50:29,100 --> 02:50:36,879
use those things on a regular basis as a

4029
02:50:32,498 --> 02:50:38,680
preventative the plant builds no sort of

4030
02:50:36,879 --> 02:50:40,629
self immune system right you know you're

4031
02:50:38,680 --> 02:50:42,520
all you're doing it for it the second

4032
02:50:40,629 --> 02:50:44,680
that you forget the second that that

4033
02:50:42,520 --> 02:50:48,248
insect builds up a resistance you've

4034
02:50:44,680 --> 02:50:50,289
lost the war so the trick is prevention

4035
02:50:48,248 --> 02:50:52,208
you want to go at it really you want to

4036
02:50:50,289 --> 02:50:54,550
go out systemically you want to add in

4037
02:50:52,209 --> 02:50:56,260
mean cake and crustacean meal things

4038
02:50:54,549 --> 02:50:59,519
like that into your soil mix you want to

4039
02:50:56,260 --> 02:51:01,978
plan out spray regiments of neem oil

4040
02:50:59,520 --> 02:51:08,828
essential oils like he was saying a

4041
02:51:01,978 --> 02:51:12,429
lemongrass peppermint oil spider mites

4042
02:51:08,828 --> 02:51:14,228
on contacts if you see a little bit of

4043
02:51:12,430 --> 02:51:16,029
an infestation your first thing is to go

4044
02:51:14,228 --> 02:51:17,769
and remove any stippled you know

4045
02:51:16,029 --> 02:51:19,238
anything with stippling and then go back

4046
02:51:17,770 --> 02:51:21,529
through and hit him with some rosemary

4047
02:51:19,238 --> 02:51:26,148
oil what's your thoughts on this

4048
02:51:21,529 --> 02:51:27,829
I have rosemary growing in my yard how

4049
02:51:26,148 --> 02:51:31,219
would I go about just taking the raw

4050
02:51:27,829 --> 02:51:33,620
plant and utilizing that into her so you

4051
02:51:31,219 --> 02:51:35,619
can go a couple of ways there's either

4052
02:51:33,620 --> 02:51:41,630
you can make it like a traditional

4053
02:51:35,620 --> 02:51:42,979
essential oil which is that's just a

4054
02:51:41,629 --> 02:51:43,579
quick google search it's really not that

4055
02:51:42,978 --> 02:51:46,159
hard

4056
02:51:43,579 --> 02:51:48,049
it's just kind of like you you know you

4057
02:51:46,159 --> 02:51:49,818
mix its it and forget it you know you

4058
02:51:48,049 --> 02:51:51,049
might have to apply some heat to it or

4059
02:51:49,818 --> 02:51:53,449
things like that the other option would

4060
02:51:51,049 --> 02:51:55,519
be like a cold process kind of like a

4061
02:51:53,450 --> 02:51:57,620
ferment to kind of extract those

4062
02:51:55,520 --> 02:52:00,470
essential oils so that would be more

4063
02:51:57,620 --> 02:52:01,819
like a fermented plain juice so then you

4064
02:52:00,469 --> 02:52:03,619
would go that would go back to like the

4065
02:52:01,818 --> 02:52:06,469
Korean natural farming that I kind of do

4066
02:52:03,620 --> 02:52:08,660
where you would take the rosemary or

4067
02:52:06,469 --> 02:52:12,019
whatever plant you would want makes it a

4068
02:52:08,659 --> 02:52:14,779
little basil honestly you could do

4069
02:52:12,020 --> 02:52:19,909
mixtures of them all I do personally I

4070
02:52:14,779 --> 02:52:22,579
do ginger garlic cinnamon sticks and

4071
02:52:19,909 --> 02:52:24,738
then I'll grind all of that uh mix it in

4072
02:52:22,579 --> 02:52:28,670
with the indigenous microorganism and

4073
02:52:24,738 --> 02:52:31,039
em1 and yeah that's usually how like

4074
02:52:28,670 --> 02:52:33,228
trout create a little spray off of that

4075
02:52:31,040 --> 02:52:36,080
I'd also have a dam I put that smells

4076
02:52:33,228 --> 02:52:37,670
amazing he does like my girlfriend

4077
02:52:36,079 --> 02:52:42,439
actually likes that when I spray it in

4078
02:52:37,670 --> 02:52:55,818
the house but yes I am I'm like forget

4079
02:52:42,439 --> 02:52:57,950
what I'm saying to you just preventative

4080
02:52:55,818 --> 02:52:59,988
preventative czar key so you want to

4081
02:52:57,950 --> 02:53:03,050
plan out your neem sprays your essential

4082
02:52:59,988 --> 02:53:05,299
oil sprays your spine aside anything

4083
02:53:03,049 --> 02:53:07,009
that you're gonna use you want to make

4084
02:53:05,299 --> 02:53:08,840
sure that you have it planned out on a

4085
02:53:07,010 --> 02:53:10,969
calendar when you're gonna use it before

4086
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:13,068
you go if you're gonna make things like

4087
02:53:10,969 --> 02:53:14,719
I was saying you want to make sure that

4088
02:53:13,068 --> 02:53:17,778
you give yourself a month or two in

4089
02:53:14,719 --> 02:53:19,849
advance so you make sure they'll be

4090
02:53:17,779 --> 02:53:21,710
ready because these are 30-day ferments

4091
02:53:19,850 --> 02:53:23,300
right and making warm casting tees of

4092
02:53:21,709 --> 02:53:24,189
things has taught me to plan several

4093
02:53:23,299 --> 02:53:27,459
days ahead

4094
02:53:24,190 --> 02:53:29,171
you have to you have to start it 12 to

4095
02:53:27,459 --> 02:53:31,270
48 hours before you're actually going to

4096
02:53:29,171 --> 02:53:33,431
apply it before it's even useful yep

4097
02:53:31,271 --> 02:53:35,530
get that foamy layer which when you get

4098
02:53:33,431 --> 02:53:38,140
used to it it actually is it kind of

4099
02:53:35,530 --> 02:53:39,761
turns out to be a lot easier because on

4100
02:53:38,140 --> 02:53:41,529
your way out of the garden you start

4101
02:53:39,761 --> 02:53:44,261
this tea up and you hate it the next day

4102
02:53:41,530 --> 02:53:46,480
with it so yeah it works out like that

4103
02:53:44,261 --> 02:53:46,750
I'm getting away from the bottles thank

4104
02:53:46,479 --> 02:53:48,609
you

4105
02:53:46,750 --> 02:53:50,140
you guys are doing it for me so we got

4106
02:53:48,610 --> 02:53:52,450
some hoop house action kind of got some

4107
02:53:50,140 --> 02:53:53,681
ideas on how to keep away the bugs was

4108
02:53:52,450 --> 02:53:57,579
the one thing you talked about a lot

4109
02:53:53,681 --> 02:54:00,730
Quran Jamil yes there's neem and then

4110
02:53:57,579 --> 02:54:02,500
there's kasha they're the same thing you

4111
02:54:00,729 --> 02:54:05,560
hear a lot of people talk about like a

4112
02:54:02,500 --> 02:54:08,261
neem and courage of 50/50 mix it's

4113
02:54:05,560 --> 02:54:13,421
really unnecessary the big difference is

4114
02:54:08,261 --> 02:54:15,780
that like neem oil technically has like

4115
02:54:13,421 --> 02:54:19,591
what's the word I'm looking for

4116
02:54:15,780 --> 02:54:22,480
almost like birth control style

4117
02:54:19,591 --> 02:54:24,970
properties to it okay which for human

4118
02:54:22,479 --> 02:54:27,789
health reasons and courage oil doesn't

4119
02:54:24,970 --> 02:54:30,011
okay so that's kind of my basic

4120
02:54:27,790 --> 02:54:31,511
understanding is that they're the same

4121
02:54:30,011 --> 02:54:33,341
thing basically

4122
02:54:31,511 --> 02:54:35,829
coraggio is a hell of a lot cheaper to

4123
02:54:33,341 --> 02:54:39,131
source or at least garage a meal

4124
02:54:35,829 --> 02:54:43,569
I've never personally used karashi oil

4125
02:54:39,130 --> 02:54:44,829
specifically but the it's basically okay

4126
02:54:43,569 --> 02:54:50,529
you got me curious about these birth

4127
02:54:44,829 --> 02:54:51,970
control properties now if you really

4128
02:54:50,530 --> 02:54:53,570
want some birth control properties go

4129
02:54:51,970 --> 02:54:58,770
use eagle 21 thank you Spears

4130
02:54:53,569 --> 02:54:58,770
[Music]

4131
02:54:59,939 --> 02:55:05,020
birth control all right I've got over

4132
02:55:03,998 --> 02:55:06,548
all the stuff we wrote down because

4133
02:55:05,020 --> 02:55:08,140
we're coming up on 50 minutes try to

4134
02:55:06,549 --> 02:55:09,459
keep this about an hour I've notice we

4135
02:55:08,139 --> 02:55:17,198
get a lot more lessons when we go like

4136
02:55:09,459 --> 02:55:18,640
50 instead of part of my problem is I'm

4137
02:55:17,199 --> 02:55:24,789
over here making notes of leadership you

4138

promise you guys we'll get you a coupon

4140
02:55:26,259 --> 02:55:30,430
code at the end of the episode I'll

4141
02:55:27,369 --> 02:55:31,509
throw that in right at the end man one

4142
02:55:30,430 --> 02:55:34,629
of the cool words I learned today

4143
02:55:31,509 --> 02:55:36,009
nutritive cycle theory I like that it's

4144
02:55:34,629 --> 02:55:37,659
good I wrote that down I'm gonna have to

4145
02:55:36,009 --> 02:55:39,039
do that again and read more about that I

4146
02:55:37,658 --> 02:55:47,020
said do that again what a good little

4147
02:55:39,039 --> 02:55:49,719
NCT I've got a couple of post up about

4148
02:55:47,020 --> 02:55:51,819
it on my feet and then Rocky Mountain

4149
02:55:49,718 --> 02:55:53,738
natural farming stage I've got a little

4150
02:55:51,818 --> 02:55:55,208
post about it up because make sure you

4151
02:55:53,738 --> 02:55:57,009
check out the Rocky Mountain natural

4152
02:55:55,209 --> 02:55:58,569
farming and the Rocky Mountain worm
