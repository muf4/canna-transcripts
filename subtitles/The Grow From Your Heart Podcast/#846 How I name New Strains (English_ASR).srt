126
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,519

127
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:54,959
bubble goat okay so this is another

128
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:56,478
Redline I talked earlier about how

129
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,918
Redline got its name on a previous

130
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,839
episode I called Redline Redline because

131
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:03,000
when I smoke it my eyes get bloody red

132
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:05,319
and real heavy also I used to ride

133
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,240
bicycles when I was a teenager I rode GT

134
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,759
Bicycles but Redline bikes were real

135
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,400
popular red Lin's got red Lebanese

136
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,000
hashplant in there so a lot of it comes

137
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:17,159
from pop culture references a lot of it

138
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,800
uh the names just create themselves like

139
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,479
bubble goat bubble goat is Indiana

140
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,720
Bubblegum and Golden Goat bubble goat

141
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,560
that name made itself gorilla goat

142
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,280
Gorilla Glue and Golden Goat those kind

143
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,038
of names make themselves uh peggo was

144
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:33,879
another one named after a Grateful Dead

145
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:36,478
song uh sometimes it's just random stuff

146
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,560
but sometimes it's uh just things that

147
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,959
happen to uh that it just tells you what

148
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,918
they are bubble goat like I was saying

149
00:05:39,959 --> 00:05:44,399
it's just bubble goat so it depends on

150
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,240
cultural references it depends on uh

151
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,198
maybe just telling you the names of the

152
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840
two strains together we'll describe

153
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:51,720
we'll make a perfect name for it bubble

154
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:54,318
goat gorilla goat I'm sure there's more

155
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,919
of those uh sometimes it's just random

156
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,080
stuff sometimes a friend will say

157
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,439
something cool one day uh Mike was

158
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,399
talking and he said something about the

159
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:02,800
word Afterglow and I said bro quit

160
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,918
talking because that is a strain name

161
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,199
and I wrote down Afterglow now we got a

162
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,639
strain called Afterglow um Storm Shadow

163
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:11,680
the old strain Storm Shadow that was

164
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,319
named after a G.I Joe character Storm

165
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,240
Shadow the silent killer um what else do

166
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,240
we got I'm trying to think of strains

167
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,038
that are available now Congo Ripper how

168
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,319
did we come up with Congo Ripper that is

169
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:24,478
Congo to Jack the Ripper that should be

170
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,560
fairly obvious there how those came up

171
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:29,079
uh White Chapel White Chapel is Golden

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,918
Goat and Jack the Ripper uh Jack the

173
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:33,318
Ripper was famous murderer a famous

174
00:06:30,918 --> 00:06:35,918
serial killer uh the White Chapel killer

175
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,479
is also what he was known as so uh it

176
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,918
got known as White Chapel as the cross

177
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:41,560
I'm inspired by a lot of different

178
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:43,198
random things sometimes I'll smoke a

179
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,120
strain and get a certain flavor out of

180
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,360
it and that's how I name it sometimes I

181
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,959
try to honor the crosses sometimes it's

182
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,360
just a pop culture reference or some

183
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,879
sort of energy thing that I thought of

184
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,919
uh that I thought of when I smoked that

185
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,839
strain or that the two names made me

186
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,639
think of sometimes it's just totally

187
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,878
completely random uh Sometimes some

188
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:02,439
sometimes I don't have a name in mind

189
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,439
until I smoke it sometimes I've already

190
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,839
got a strain name in mind when I create

191
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,839
the line uh orange gasm I knew that

192
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:10,279
orange gasm was going to be super

193
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:11,878
delightful it's going to make your toes

194
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,318
curl uh it was going to have that

195
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,400
beautiful orange flavor orange gasm was

196
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,960
that just happened naturally so it all

197
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,519
just kind of depends I've got a list of

198
00:07:17,959 --> 00:07:22,560
strain names if something cool comes up

199
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:24,799

good but it's also like some chemicals

227
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,400

uh King of the Hill was an awesome

257
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,839
cartoon animated series I don't know

258
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,560

00:09:30,759 --> 00:09:34,399
if we want anyway let's get back to the

265
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:36,600
point Big Mountain fudge cake in the

266
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,440
show King of the Hill they started a

267
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,200
band um the name of the band was Big

268
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,519
Mountain fudge cake they referred to

269
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,120
themselves as the fudge um I thought

270
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:46,560
it'd be really fun to name a strain Big

271
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,039
Mountain fudge cake of course I took a

272
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,078
strain with some chocolate turps in

273
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:52,559
there big mountain fudge cake so the

274
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:53,879
names are random and sporadic uh

275
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,000
sometimes I have the names in mind

276
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,439
before I even make a strain sometimes I

277
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,919
don't even think of the name until after

278
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,920
I smoke the strain I do have a long list

279
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,879
of strain names and I go through it and

280
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,838
I'm super picky it's got the strain a

281
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:09,120
strain name can make or break your

282
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,160
creation people may buy 2500 packs of a

283
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,039
pack of seeds just because of the name

284
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:16,039
uh they may not buy any of it because of

285
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,559
the name I really think Scarlett Bonas

286
00:10:16,039 --> 00:10:20,639
if it would have been named something

287
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:22,278
differently it would have sold uh better

288
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,679
I think that one was slept on simply

289
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:25,799
because of the name there are some

290
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,439
things um I had a lady tell me that she

291
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:28,759
did not like my strain name Bounty

292
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,680
Killer so that's another one we can

293
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,958
touch on uh Bounty Killer uh was named

294
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,278
after a reggae artist named Bounty

295
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:37,199
Killer that's simply where that name

296
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:39,559
came from the kangi Kush was named after

297
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,440
a reggae artist called szla kangi

298
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:42,838
Capleton was named after a reggae artist

299
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,120
called Capleton I'm sure you could see

300
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,079
where this is going but I named a lot of

301
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,839
stuff after Grateful Dead songs Fish

302
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:52,039
songs ree artists uh things are named

303
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,680
after people some of the Stray names are

304
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,078

weaknesses your um anyway he asked him

328
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,720
what a weakness was like one of his his

329
00:11:47,078 --> 00:11:50,359
personal weaknesses I forget the [ __ ]

330
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,800
name of the the thing that he asked him

331
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,519
it's like a trait he's like what's one

332
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:57,519
of your weaknesses and he said chocolate

333
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,839
Soule and Larry King's a [ __ ] 124

334
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,240
years old he didn't understand he said

335
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,200
Saka sule with a big question mark and a

336
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,680
dumbfounded voice and so to that Tom

337
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,759
sigura just smiled back and said

338
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:10,399
chocolate sule and then Larry King got

339
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,519
it at that point but Saka sufle was a

340
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,120
madeup word that Larry King said one

341
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:18,440
time and that is how Saka sufle became

342
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:21,000
that's just how uh that happened he said

343
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,000
it I liked it uh the first hundred packs

344
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
of that strain that I sold came in a

345
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,720
package with an image of Larry King with

346
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,320
his suspenders and his microphone in

347
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,959
front of him those were two of his

348
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,720
iconic things

349
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:34,319
the first 100 packs of the machine I

350
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,800
sold also came in a custom package with

351
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,360
a silhouette of Bert ker holding a

352
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:39,679
microphone I had to do the silhouette I

353
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,560
didn't want to do any copyright

354
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,519
copyright violations but those were two

355
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,518
strains that sometimes I had to explain

356
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:48,198
the name another strain that people ask

357
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:50,919
me about a lot this strain name is

358
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:52,679
double Paula what is double Paula um

359
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:55,198
double Paula is a strain that I made

360
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:58,958
around 2000 I don't remember exactly I

361
00:12:55,198 --> 00:13:01,000
want to say Circa 2016 2018 somewhere in

362
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,638
that time frame uh that's when double

363
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,958
paa was made people ask me a lot of

364
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,159
questions about double paa um I made

365
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,719
that one around 2016 it grows kind of

366
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:11,600
tall kind of quickly um tastes real good

367
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,680
good strong TPS on it nice and potent

368
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,920
one of my favorite strains um yeah

369
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,120
that's double Paula I get a lot of

370
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:18,639
questions about that one and guess what

371
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,919
I'm going to continue to get questions

372
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,720
because I ain't going to tell you [ __ ]

373
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,319
about double Paula right now I love the

374
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,120
mystery I love the mystery around double

375

380
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:38,079

about strain names I feel like there

384
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,278
were a lot more that I wanted to cover I

385
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:46,120
could probably hit pause go to the

386
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:48,519
website we could talk about a billion

387
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,360
strain names but the strain names are

388
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,600
inspired by uh Just Like Music just like

389

tinfoil hat tinfoil hat two reasons uh

395
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,560

398
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:17,559
thinking shit's going on that's not

399
00:14:14,198 --> 00:14:20,599
going on also there's a famous podcast

uh Bobby Knight oh let me talk about

405
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,440
Bobby Knight then we will wrap up this

406
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,879
part because I feel like I really want

407
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,320
to give a shout out to Bobby Knight

408
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:39,198
Bobby Knight uh who is Bobby Knight

409
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Bobby Knight is a uh Bobby Knight is PED

410
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:45,120
Bobby Knight was a basketball coach for

411
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,920
Indiana uh my grandparents both came

412
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,078
from Indiana um they were what you call

413
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,198
hooers and they were into hooer

414
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,799
basketball so my grandparents both knew

415
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,758
Bobby Knight very well they followed him

416
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,278
I come from a big Basketball family my

417
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:01,199
grandparents my uncles loved basketball

418
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:03,278
I'm 6'5 and everyone's disappointed that

419
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,039
I don't give a [ __ ] about basketball I

420
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,639
can shoot but I don't care to play D at

421
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,159
all so I just stand there and watch

422
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,799
everybody score on you and then I go try

423
00:15:08,159 --> 00:15:11,958
to shoot my own shot we're getting

424
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:13,799
sidetracked anyway Bobby Knight my

425
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,479
grandparents were Indiana basketball

426
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,240
fans Bobby Knight was a coach for

427
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:20,278
Indiana basketball I got a hold of the

428
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,600
Indiana bubble gum the classic bubble

429
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:24,958
gum strain that comes from Indiana I

430
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,879
crossed the Indiana bubblegum to

431
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,559
Afterglow so right as those seeds were

432
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,879
coming to fruition and almost ready to

433
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,518
harvest Bobby Knight passed away and it

434
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:34,759
was like something just told me name the

435
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:36,639
strain Bobby Knight that gave me a way

436
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,519
to honor my grandparents it gave me a

437
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,639
cool strain name and we got to honor

438
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,360
Bobby Knight and then all of the uh

439
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,959
basketball fans knew what it was right

440
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:46,480
away and all the Indiana basketball fans

441
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,479
definitely knew what it was right away

442
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,680
so Bobby Knight was named after a

443
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,839
basketball coach from Indiana and my

444
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,559
grandparents were from Indiana and they

445
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,720
were a couple of my favorite people of

446
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,359
course so they inspired me in a lot of

447
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,319
ways I wanted to pay some sort of

448
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,600
tribute to my grandparents by naming a

449
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:06,039
ganja strain sort of after them but it's

450
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,159
Bobby KN so it doesn't have their name

451
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,278
in it or anything they're not

452
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,639
implemented in my business here but it's

453
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,480
a nod it's a shout out to my

454
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,159
grandparents and also of course Bobby

455
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,839
Knight and of course to that Indiana

456
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:21,639
background that is in my blood all right

457
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:23,279
that is my answer and I'm sticking to it

458
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:25,680

to use that coupon code by then if you

490
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,759
don't use it by then it tells me a

491
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,839
couple of things you didn't check your

492
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,640
spam also it tells me you didn't listen

493
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,678
to the podcast because if you listen to

494
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,320
the show you would know that you got

495
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,960
your message read which would then tell

496

you to go check your inbox so if you

497

00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:51,678

499
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,599

that coupon code for your free seats at

501
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:59,639
iir the question says rosta Jeff what

502
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,839
are your thoughts on clone clone

503
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,080
degeneration from the mother plant is

504
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:06,678
there a way to revive or rejuvenate old

505
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:10,199
clones I think you mean like rejuvenate

506
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:14,038
an old plant so um let me first touch on

507
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,400
something um he said degeneration clone

508
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:19,000
degeneration is a thing sometimes mother

509
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,400
plants get tired they get old uh if you

510
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,798
abuse a plant if you don't give it the

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,519
best care if it's uh threatened with

512
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,558
bugs or problems or inadequate

513
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:29,359
environment sometimes these plants can

514
00:18:27,558 --> 00:18:31,558
get old and tired and stuck performing

515
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,599
that the way the way that they used to

516
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:35,798
that is what this listener means by

517
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:39,079
degeneration there is another thing that

518
00:18:35,798 --> 00:18:41,480
happens people call it genetic drift

519
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:43,399
that is a different thing completely

520
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,679
I've done a full podcast on genetic

521
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,200
drift uh in the Cannabis world we are

522
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,480
using the phrase the term genetic drift

523
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,120
inaccurately incorrectly as we do many

524
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,360
terms in this industry in this business

525
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:56,439
in this community however today I want

526
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:58,079
to make sure we are not talking about

527
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,640
genetic drift that is not what this

528
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,720
listener is referring to this is

529
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,240
degeneration when a plant starts getting

530
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,079
old and tired uh it happens with every

531
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,679
living organism eventually if you don't

532
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:12,359
give it the ideal diet environment if it

533
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:14,000
faces any threats any problems pests or

534
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:16,279
pathogens or it could be a lot of other

535
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,839
things at this time um overwatering

536
00:19:16,279 --> 00:19:20,759
underwatering a lot of stress on this

537
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,439
plant can cause future generations to

538
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,640
not be as healthy as they were the

539
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,600
genetics will be exactly the same but

540
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,400
the overall health of the new cuting can

541
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,119
may not be as as optimal as previous

542
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,200
generations of this plant so this

543
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:38,399
listener is saying is there a way to

544
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:40,000
revive or rejuvenate these plants um yes

545
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,679
unfortunately I feel like we have

546
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,200
already surpassed this time of the year

547
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,600
unless you've got some supplemental

548
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,600
lighting that may help you out but what

549
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:51,000
many breeders and Growers are known to

550
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,480
do is when the right time of year comes

551
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,679
around you can put small copies of your

552
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,120
plants outdoors and put them out there

553
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:01,440
in the sunshine and that Sunshine will

554
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:02,959
rejuven revive and correct many of the

555
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,880
problems that your plants may be

556
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,558
experiencing I've probably said it on

557
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,320
the podcast a few times I'll say it

558
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:11,798
again the sun is Magic the sun works

559
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,119
wonders the sun is the fixer the Healer

560
00:20:11,798 --> 00:20:16,558
the sun will cure a lot of things if you

561
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,439
can put a small plant outside uh if you

562
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:20,240
can veg a plant or get a small plant

563
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,240
even if you got a large Plant put it

564
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,359
outside veg it let it be outside for a

565
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,880
week maybe two weeks you will see great

566
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,639
Improvement if if you put that plant out

567
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,840
at the proper time of year that depends

568
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,840
on where you live your location

569
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,798
geographically geographically that word

570
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:38,079
was easy to say it depends on your

571
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:39,639
location on the globe uh if you're in

572
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:41,720
certain regions you could do this all

573
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:43,280
year long if you're in Colorado you've

574
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,200
got about a three or four week window

575
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,798
where this is an opportunity so it

576
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,159
depends on where you are it depends on

577
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,639
your light if you've got a greenhouse

578
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:52,480
where you can provide supplemental

579
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,038
lighting this would work beautifully put

580
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,240
it out there just about anytime that

581
00:20:54,038 --> 00:20:58,038
it's not too cold get that sunshine on

582
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,798
it for a few hours a day that will help

583
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:01,279
you correct the plant add some

584
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:03,279
artificial light to go with that

585
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,519
sunshine and you will see improvements

586
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,200
in the health of that plant overall in

587
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,480
just a couple of weeks of course you do

588
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,600
need to feed the plant properly you also

589
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,038
make sure not to get any you need to

590
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:15,759
make sure not to acquire any bugs any

591
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:17,720
pests we don't want to take more pest

592
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,720
indoors uh that could just lead to a

593
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,558
whole another slew of problems in the

594
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,640
near future we are going to talk about

595
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:25,000
integrated Pest Management that's

596
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,240
something that came up today on the

597
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,599
Discord so that is on my mind to talk

598
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,798
about in the near future but a way to

599
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,359
rejuvenate clones uh that have gotten

600
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:34,960
old that have gotten Dusty that just

601
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:37,240
don't seem to be as healthy as they once

602
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,480
were put them outside give them plenty

603
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,798
of light uh get them going Outdoors get

604
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,640
that sunshine on them feed them well uh

605
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:45,679
let them feel that outdoor environment

606
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,278
and they will come back around they will

607
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,159
get healthy again this will work for

608
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:50,919
most plants uh that are just a little

609
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:52,480
bit beat up looking old if they're beat

610
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:54,919
to [ __ ] and they're if they're supposed

611
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,400
to die sometimes you just got to let it

612
00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:58,200
go you should have been taken better

613
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,320
care of that plant overall if it was

614
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,360
that important to you all right my

615
