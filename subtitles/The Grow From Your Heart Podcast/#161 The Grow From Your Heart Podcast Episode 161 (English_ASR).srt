time they had a costume contest and

47
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:47,879
a costume contest that's right I've got

48
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,219
a Chewbacca costume

49
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:52,109
it is super dope I bought it at a

50
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:53,670
costume shop it took him a long time to

51
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:55,950
get it in stock it took like three weeks

52
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,478
to order that thing it was kind of

53
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:59,549
pricey you know it wasn't the cheapest

54
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:01,109
costume anybody's ever bought but it was

55
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,460
well worth it because I've had it for I

56
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:04,978
think I've had it for four or five years

57
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:06,780
and I wore every other year and every

58
00:02:04,978 --> 00:02:09,360
year I went at least one costume contest

59
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:13,378
in it so it is paid for itself I at the

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,960
elevat-- party I won a dope new rig it's

61
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:17,909
a it's a Halloween themed rig

62
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,409
it's orange it's a brighter orange than

63
00:02:17,909 --> 00:02:22,109
normal orange but it's like orange a

64
00:02:19,409 --> 00:02:23,520
little brighter than orange crayon it's

65
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,160
got a pumpkin on the back of it it's a

66
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,010
just a straight tube it's about that's

67
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,719
probably it's almost the same it's the

68
00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:33,090
same height as my Dr Pepper bottle

69
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,949
almost the height of a water bottle so

70
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,670
it's a straight tube it's got a round

71
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:37,229
ball

72
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,939
pumpkin looking base and then it's got a

73
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:41,039
straight tube and then another orange

74
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:42,689
kind of a pumpkin looking spot and then

75
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:44,699
a straight piece and then another

76
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:46,319
pumpkin looking an orange bulb with a

77
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:49,379
green top on it so it looks pumpkin II

78
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,180
it takes a 14 millimeter banger so I got

79
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,219
a 14 millimeter banger on it they came

80
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,840

84
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,439
costume contest but guess what the

85
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:03,449
people from elevate did not decide that

86
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:04,979
I won the crowd had decided that I won

87
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:07,530
the costume contest so it could not be a

88
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:09,389
fix it was based on crowd applause and

89
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,069

171
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:45,180
topic of the show there's one more thing

172
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:47,968
I have to talk about before I get into

173
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,259
the main topic excuse me for all the

174
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:50,668
throat clearing I just notice something

175
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,060
I put a new mic cover on this microphone

176
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:55,859
you guys I try to replace the microphone

177
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,209
covers on these mic so that not

178
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:58,560
everybody spitting into the same thing

179
00:05:57,209 --> 00:06:00,628
and rubbing their face on the same [ __ ]

180
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,120
for a long time and I just gave myself a

181
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:05,580
fresh new one and it stinks it smells

182
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,348
like like shoe polish or something funky

183
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:08,968
whoo that's pretty terrible but for some

184
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:10,218
reason I keep sniffing it I'm not

185
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:13,408

240
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:04,329
get into the main topic of this podcast

241
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:05,918
the main thing I want to talk about I

242
00:08:04,329 --> 00:08:07,810
was on a forum the other day yes I do

243
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,069
read the forum's I roll around I do not

244
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:11,348
use a name that anybody would recognize

245
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:12,968
me by so you won't find me on there I'm

246
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:15,968
also at a bunch of Facebook groups but

247
00:08:12,968 --> 00:08:17,800
I've uh I've had to check out of a bunch

248
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:19,930
of the Facebook groups because honestly

249
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,310
I see so hmm

250
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,629
I apologize for all the throat clearing

251
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,949
you guys I was taking some fat dabs of

252
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,389
some live resident has just got me all

253
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:26,710
clogged up but we'll deal with it we'll

254
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,689
get through a podcast it'll quit right

255
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,399
about the time the show ends I see a

256
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:31,899
bunch of [ __ ] and Facebook groups

257
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,088
you guys I see people recommending the

258
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:35,708
shittiest advice and then I go look at

259
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:37,180
the person that gave that advice I look

260
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:38,559
at their pictures of their grow and I

261
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:39,699
can see why their growth looks the way

262
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,679
it does and why they're giving the

263
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,750
advice that they are giving they're not

264
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,819
qualified and it kind of frustrates me

265
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:48,610
so I had to leave a bunch of Facebook

266
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:50,350
groups I'm not in a lot of them I but I

267
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,970
do go trolling or browse around the

268
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:54,519
forums so I see what's going on and

269
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,600
lately a topic I've seen more than once

270
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,189
or twice is pee

271
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,950
we're talking about ways to determine

272
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:01,420
flowering times of new seeds and new

273
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,370
clones that they've gotten that they

274
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:04,959
don't have any information on maybe

275
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:06,519
somebody got some bagged seed and they

276
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,530
don't know how long to let that bag seed

277
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:10,179
flower or maybe somebody was gifted a

278
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:11,589
clone and they don't know anything about

279
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,009
the clone from the friend they gave it

280
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,780
to him

281
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:16,870
so they were like hey Ross - Jeff how do

282
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:18,789
I determine how long to let these plants

283
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,320
flower so that I don't [ __ ] up my crop

284
00:09:18,789 --> 00:09:21,519
so you guys I'm gonna get some water

285
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,020
here to fix up my throat you know I'm

286
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,189
gonna take a couple more dabs and then

287
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:25,960
after that we're gonna talk about how to

288
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:30,910
determine flowering time of new

289
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:32,470
cultivars all right you guys I am back I

290
00:09:30,909 --> 00:09:34,029
promised we would talk about ways to

291
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,490
determine flowering time of new

292
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:38,379
cultivars so maybe you got some seeds

293
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,389
and you don't know how long those seeds

294
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:41,649
are supposed to take maybe you maybe you

295
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:43,480
had a bunch of pack 2 seeds and these

296
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:44,889
got mixed up or mislabeled or weren't

297
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,450
labeled at all or maybe they came out of

298
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:47,799
a bag maybe you've got seeds that you're

299
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:49,540
running you have no idea what they are

300
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:51,789
you're gonna need to know how long to

301
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:53,349
let those plants flower maybe your buddy

302
00:09:51,789 --> 00:09:54,129
gave you clothes maybe you bought clones

303
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,930
at the dispensary

304
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:57,610
maybe you cut clones and you don't know

305
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,409
which clone that is you need to

306
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,769
determine how long to let that plant

307
00:09:59,409 --> 00:10:04,209
flower so obviously the way to the

308
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,429
easiest way to do that would to be

309
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:08,680
flower that plant out and then around

310
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:10,870
week seven or eight maybe eight or nine

311
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:12,489
I have to say about week seven get in

312
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,850
there and start looking at that plant

313
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,100
with a loop or a magnifier of some sort

314
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:21,070
of a magnifying glass some sort of an

315
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,259
eye you need at least a 60 to 100 times

316
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:26,140
magnifying glass to look at these plants

317
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,909
you want to see the trichomes that are

318
00:10:26,139 --> 00:10:29,409
on your buds and look in a few different

319
00:10:27,909 --> 00:10:32,199
places on the plant don't just look in

320
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:34,990
one spot so what I use hooks up to my

321
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,400
computer I've got a let me see I can go

322
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:37,090
right here on my computer it'll remind

323
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,829
me the brand

324
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:41,320
it's from Dino scope I've got a Dino

325
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,850
scope a little it's a scope that hooks

326
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,320
up it's a magnifying scope that hooks up

327
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:46,360
it's a USB port goes right into my

328
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,129
computer I works with a Mac it works

329
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,629
with a Windows machine I use it on a Mac

330
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:51,159
so I promise it works it was a [ __ ] to

331
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:52,659
get it started but once I downloaded the

332
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:54,639
driver and got it working it works

333
00:10:52,659 --> 00:10:57,519
beautifully every time now I can take

334
00:10:54,639 --> 00:11:00,039
screenshots of what I'm seeing but this

335
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,210
little scope I basically I can take I

336
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:03,159
take my chair

337
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,509
cuz it rolls and has wheels and I put

338
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:06,100
the MacBook on the chair because I'm

339
00:11:04,509 --> 00:11:07,569
clumsy and I like to drop [ __ ] so I

340
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,820
leave the MacBook on the chair and I

341
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,740
roll it around and then I use the scope

342
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:13,930
it's got a nice long cord and then I use

343
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:15,190
that scope to go find the spots that I

344
00:11:13,929 --> 00:11:17,439
want on the plant and then I look at the

345
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,570
screen and I can see if the trichomes

346
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,050
are amber or if the trichomes are clear

347
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:24,640
or if they're milky or if they're busted

348
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:26,979
ruptured open and got [ __ ] dripping out

349
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,960
of them I can see that clearly with the

350
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,300
scope I've got I can see bugs [ __ ] if

351
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,850
there is bug [ __ ] in my plants I can see

352
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:35,500
any insect in the world with this scope

353
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,850
that I've got so I like to pull leaf off

354
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,350
randomly and look at the underside of

355
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,450
the leaf and see what's going on look

356
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,089
for eggs looks for bugs look for bug

357
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,700
[ __ ] look for signs of bugs so what you

358
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:48,670
need if you can't get that type of a

359
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:50,710
thing for your computer they sell the

360
00:11:48,669 --> 00:11:52,509
420 scope is okay I think they call it

361
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:55,050
the dope scope or the 420 scope that's

362
00:11:52,509 --> 00:11:57,789
okay there's one sold at the gross store

363
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:59,500
that is made by Hydra farm which is the

364
00:11:57,789 --> 00:12:01,480
one that I like I have the 100x little

365
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,250
scope it takes a double a battery at

366
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:05,529
full they may take two batteries but it

367
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:07,149
folds it folds together real nicely when

368
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:09,220
you unfold it it lights up and then you

369
00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,809
can see through it real well that one I

370
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,730
really like but get yourself a scope so

371
00:12:10,809 --> 00:12:15,699
that you can look at the trichomes at

372
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:17,769
least 60 X 100x magnification is better

373
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:20,710
it's most obvious way to tell when

374
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:22,179
plants are done when within your view

375
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,740
you're probably gonna see a certain

376
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,559
amount of trichomes it's gonna be hard

377
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,700
to count them but you want about

378
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,139
twenty-five to thirty percent of those

379
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,910
twenty to thirty percent of those you

380
00:12:29,139 --> 00:12:32,710
want them turning amber you want it to

381
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:34,299
kind of look like the color like maybe

382
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,280
you dipped him in dr. pepper or maybe

383
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:38,559
they got a little they're just you could

384
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:41,588
see it it turns amber orangish color

385
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:44,049
they'll start off clear then they'll get

386
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:45,880
milky and then they get like a silvery

387
00:12:44,049 --> 00:12:47,769
color and then from silver that's when

388
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:49,299
they start turning amber but when thirty

389
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:50,799
percent your items are amber that's

390
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:54,009
usually when you want to harvest most

391
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,269
strains so it's kind of up to you you

392
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:57,220
can go a little early you can go a

393
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:59,559
little late it's not that huge of a deal

394
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:01,649
a lot of people way over stress the

395
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:04,838
harvest window in a production facility

396
00:13:01,649 --> 00:13:05,949
we say this string gets this many days

397
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,480
and then we're cutting it the [ __ ] down

398
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:09,790
because we have another crop coming up

399
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,800
right behind it so and that the weed

400
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,838
comes out pretty fabulous in most of the

401
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:17,289
production facilities and we just pick

402
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,420
something like 60 days or 70 days I like

403
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:20,980
to say 63 days because that's 9 full

404
00:13:19,419 --> 00:13:21,189
weeks of flower and most of the strains

405
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,350
were

406
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:25,150
running nowadays nine weeks is perfect

407
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:29,050
but let's talk a little more because

408
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:30,340
this scope you're looking at the

409
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:31,959
trichomes is really gonna help you out

410
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:34,750
but you're going to need to know a

411
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:36,879
little earlier in the game when to

412
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,980
harvest because you're gonna need to

413
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,809
flush your plants about ten to fourteen

414
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:43,330
days before you start cutting down i

415
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:45,399
heavily stress flushing your plants it's

416
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:47,889
free and you've got to water the plants

417
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,220
anyway so why not just pour a bunch of

418
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:53,860
water in there and clean the plants out

419
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,389
so let's talk about some ways to

420
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:57,580
determine how long those plants are

421
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:59,679
gonna take you need to figure out how

422
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,110
indica or sativa dominant those plants

423
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:06,609
are and a huge indicator of that is leaf

424
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:08,860
shape and size if your leaf has really

425
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,480
long slender fingers it's probably

426
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,360
sativa dominant and you're gonna lead

427
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,879
more toward the nine to ten week range

428
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:18,700
maybe even longer if your plants have

429
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:21,490
big fat broad leaves if they're real

430
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,930
wide if the the wider the leaf probably

431
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,610
the shorter the flowering period is

432
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:26,979
something that I've learned it's not

433
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,360
always true but it's usually a good

434
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,100
thing to follow so if you've got good

435
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:34,240
wide leaves you're looking at eight to

436
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,279
nine weeks now if you've got a eight or

437
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,350
nine week plant the first time you run

438
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:40,389
it I recommend going nine weeks why not

439
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:42,040
try that extra week to see what happens

440
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:43,929
you may get more bulk right at the end

441
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,779
you may get more resin right at the end

442
00:14:43,929 --> 00:14:48,370
it may harden up it may do a lot of good

443
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:50,019
[ __ ] in that last one week so let that

444
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,210
happen it's not gonna over ripen too

445
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:53,769
much but it don't worry about a little

446
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,150
over ripening it's not that huge of a

447
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,319
game especially if it's your first time

448
00:14:55,149 --> 00:14:58,269
that's something I wrote down that I

449
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,240
wanted to wait a little while to mention

450
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:03,460
but this is hopefully not your last time

451
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,990
running this strain this is your first

452
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:07,060
time running this strain which means you

453
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:08,980
can [ __ ] it up because you have another

454
00:15:07,059 --> 00:15:10,599
time and another time and another time

455
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:13,029
after that to run it hopefully if this

456
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,110
is a good genetic good cultivar and you

457
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:16,088
can keep it around you're gonna be

458
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,350
running it a bunch of times so this is

459
00:15:16,089 --> 00:15:21,580
just your test run this is your first

460
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:24,310
date you'll be ok so leaf size and leaf

461
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,780
shape will give you a big hint on how

462
00:15:24,309 --> 00:15:27,429
long those plants are gonna take if

463
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:28,629
you've got an eight or nine week plant

464
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:30,069
like I just said like the eight or nine

465
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:31,659
weekend to go let it go nine weeks

466
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,190
because you want it to go to full

467
00:15:31,659 --> 00:15:34,659
maturity if you've got a plant with long

468
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:36,160
skinny leaves that's a 90

469
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:37,778
ten week plan I would recommend lighting

470
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,189
that plan go ten weeks the first time

471
00:15:37,778 --> 00:15:41,470
why not you want to see what the

472
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,329
potential of that plan is a lot of those

473
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,040
sativa plants really do magical [ __ ]

474
00:15:43,328 --> 00:15:46,809
toward the end of their growth phase or

475
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,088
at the end of their flowering phase they

476
00:15:46,809 --> 00:15:50,799
bulk up they resin up they really put on

477
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:52,839
some flavor they get better at the end

478
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,250
they're probably swelling up because

479
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,660
they want to be bred too and you're not

480
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,399
giving them any pollen so they're just

481
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:59,110
getting bigger and bigger and stickier

482
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:00,909
and fatter so sometimes it's better to

483
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,220
let those sativa strains go longer I

484
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:06,129
like an 11-week sativa it doesn't scare

485
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,500
me to run a 77 day sativa dominant plant

486
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:09,850
flower it when it's real short be ready

487
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,528
to have some sticks and supports

488
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:13,240
available and get that sucker going

489
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:15,188
don't be afraid to grow something that

490
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,600
take seventy seven days or even maybe a

491
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:18,068
little bit longer it's well worth it

492
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,050
you're gonna get more potency you

493
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:22,028
usually get more weight and everybody

494
00:16:20,049 --> 00:16:23,409
loves that good sativa buzz and it's

495
00:16:22,028 --> 00:16:25,568
harder to find everyone's grown those

496
00:16:23,409 --> 00:16:27,009
shorter indicas so if you're growing a

497
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:27,370
heavy sativa you're gonna stand out from

498
00:16:27,009 --> 00:16:29,409
the crowd

499
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,879
medical users are gonna appreciate it

500
00:16:29,409 --> 00:16:32,198
they're gonna want more recreational

501
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,879
users are gonna love it they're gonna

502
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,359
want more so that's gonna help everybody

503
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,879
out

504
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,919
so the basic leaf size is a good

505
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,420
indicator of how long your strain may

506
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:41,649
take from the very beginning if it's

507
00:16:40,419 --> 00:16:43,179
real broad you're looking at eight to

508
00:16:41,649 --> 00:16:45,759
nine weeks if you get some skinny leaves

509
00:16:43,179 --> 00:16:47,649
go nine or ten weeks maybe even a little

510
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,839
bit longer the thing is if you start

511
00:16:47,649 --> 00:16:51,879
flushing a little bit too early that's

512
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,199
okay if you start flushing too late

513
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:55,179
that's when you start overdoing things

514
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,379
you'll be okay so if you've got these

515
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:58,328
plants that are gonna end up taking

516
00:16:56,379 --> 00:17:00,338
thirteen or fourteen weeks and you've

517
00:16:58,328 --> 00:17:02,198
already started flushing to be prepared

518
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,189
for week 11 you'll be okay

519
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:04,240
they're just gonna start looking a

520
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,970
little ragged they're gonna turn a

521
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,709
little bit yellow but they'll keep going

522
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,150
if you're growing a really long sativa

523
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,409
something that I should mention if

524
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,350
you're a new grower and you're growing

525
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:16,209
along sativa longer than eleven weeks

526
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:18,578
you will be lucky if by the end of that

527
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,288
grow that plant has any big leaves left

528
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:21,970
those plants like tip they're they're

529
00:17:20,288 --> 00:17:23,828
finicky and they will lose a lot of

530
00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:25,509
leaves they'll look like [ __ ] but you'll

531
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:27,308
have amazing medicine still because

532
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:29,679
they're Hardy and a plant that goes that

533
00:17:27,308 --> 00:17:31,480
long is meant to survive a lot of

534
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,190
experienced growers have a long a hard

535
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,659
time with a longer flowering plant

536
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,000
because the feeding regimen is kind of

537
00:17:34,659 --> 00:17:38,590
confusing you're not sure when to phase

538
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,089
certain nutrients out and when to face

539
00:17:38,589 --> 00:17:41,589
Sutent certain nutrients in because

540
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:43,808
everything happens at a different time

541
00:17:41,589 --> 00:17:45,579
than what we're all taught about these

542
00:17:43,808 --> 00:17:46,898
nine week plants everybody all the

543
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:48,279
nutrient companies that sell you stuff

544
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:50,049
most of the stuff you see

545
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,759
online when they're recommending feeding

546
00:17:50,049 --> 00:17:53,950
they're basing that on about an eight to

547
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,269
nine week flowering phase and most of

548
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,769
them don't even give you enough time to

549
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:57,940
flush most tell you to flush for one

550
00:17:56,769 --> 00:17:59,710
week because they want you to keep

551
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:02,140
pumping [ __ ] product into your plants

552
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,390
so my points all this is that you can't

553
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,920
really over flush so be prepared to

554
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,750
flush flush like normal and if the

555
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,300
plants look like they want longer let

556
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:11,740
them go longer you can tell if they want

557
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,119
to go longer by using the scope that's

558
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,789
pretty much the only way you can get in

559
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:17,409
there and tell also something that will

560
00:18:15,789 --> 00:18:19,740
give you a hint of how long the plants

561
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:21,970
are going to take is the basic structure

562
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:24,279
structure my words are hard to say today

563
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:27,190
I apologize the basic structure of your

564
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,410
plants how how tall they get how quickly

565
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,019
how much they branch out how bushy the

566
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:33,580
plant is is it growing straight up if

567
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:35,650
that plants going straight up and not

568
00:18:33,579 --> 00:18:36,939
making a lot of side branches you've

569
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:39,340
probably got yourself a sativa dominant

570
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,720
plant that's gonna take a little longer

571
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:42,699
to flower it's just gonna keep going

572
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,250
straight up if you've got a plant that

573
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,900
is growing really long lanky branches

574
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,789
and it's just going really really fast

575
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,040
that plant may take a little longer to

576
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:53,139
flower if your plant is staying short

577
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,849
and stocky and real squatty and just

578
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,590
getting wider and wider as it grows

579
00:18:54,849 --> 00:18:58,959
you've probably gotten indica dominant

580
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:01,000
plant which is also you're gonna have to

581
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,710
put that trait together with your leaf

582
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,779
size and kind of put those two together

583
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,340
and let those two things kind of give

584
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,960
you hints of how much indica and how

585
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:09,939
much sativa and those plants and how

586
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,710
long you should let them go if you've

587
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:13,090
got seeds in the breeder pack says that

588
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,590
they're done in eight to nine weeks I

589
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:16,599
recommend you let them go nine weeks

590
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:18,669
maybe even let them go a little bit

591
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:20,079
longer if you can I like to let stuff go

592
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:21,940
I'm kind of weird I'll it I like things

593
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,339
to go nine ten or eleven weeks just cuz

594
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,080
I it's easier to remember I know a lot

595
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:28,449
of strains that I run sixty-three days

596
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:31,599
is perfect for most of them alright you

597
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:33,819
guys so that is basically ways to figure

598
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,559
out flowering times of new seeds and new

599
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:37,720
clones that you've got check the

600
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:39,369
trichomes if you've got a scope if you

601
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,190
can hook your scope up to your computer

602
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:44,049
I recommend you check in three places

603
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:46,240
check at the top of the plant that big

604
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,769
top bud check that one check in the

605
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,240
middle of the plant so you know how you

606
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:51,250
got the top and if you didn't do any

607
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,870
topping you got a top and then there's

608
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,089
buds that come up right underneath that

609
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:57,039
the next part of the crown the next part

610
00:19:55,089 --> 00:19:58,659
of the bouquet check some of those check

611
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,279
like right around that ring there and

612
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,410
then go down a little bit further in the

613
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:03,420
plant and check down

614
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:05,009
and see how the difference is going you

615
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:06,960
may be really amber down at the bottom

616
00:20:05,009 --> 00:20:09,599
you may be really clear at the top I

617
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,789
like to harvest one about 30% of the

618
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,500
total trichomes have started to show

619
00:20:11,789 --> 00:20:15,420
amber so it kind of looks like you got a

620
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,740
little bit of dr. pepper on them or a

621
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,670
little bit of root beer or something and

622
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,250
they're just starting to turn a little

623
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:21,840
bit brownish if you wait too long they

624
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:23,009
all start turning that color I feel like

625
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,869
they kind of the plants lose their

626
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:25,829
flavor you can cut them a little bit

627
00:20:24,869 --> 00:20:27,419
earlier they're gonna taste better

628
00:20:25,829 --> 00:20:29,369
here's part of the deal you cut them

629
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,930
sooner they taste better you cut him a

630
00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:33,239
little bit later they probably get

631
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,650
heavier and more potent so that's that's

632
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,250
something you want to balance on

633
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,080
yourself

634
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:38,940
most people are focused on getting as

635
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:41,279
much as they can from each light or each

636
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,809
square foot or each square meter or each

637
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:44,099
table however you're growing nowadays

638
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,869
and however you're doing the measurement

639
00:20:44,099 --> 00:20:47,819
for your own business plan so most

640
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:50,099
people want to let it go that extra few

641
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:51,539
days and add on that extra bulk and I

642
00:20:50,099 --> 00:20:53,399
mean you can they just get more potent

643
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,159
in my opinion as you let them go so guys

644
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,900
that's mostly ways to kind of

645
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,670
predetermine how long to let your plants

646
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:01,019
flower all right you guys I wrote down a

647
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,600
couple of more notes that I want to talk

648
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:05,250
about that I was inspired to rant on

649
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:07,199
because of this topic but before I get

650
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,579
that far I need a dad I don't need a dad

651
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,049
but makes me sound weird when I say that

652
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:12,210
I need a dad I felt weird I would love

653
00:21:10,049 --> 00:21:14,149
to take a dab with you guys so if you

654
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:17,009
were in a safe place where you can smoke

655
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:20,100
start getting a DAB ready I'm taking the

656
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:23,129
lid off of some golden goat shatter from

657
00:21:20,099 --> 00:21:24,899
tiara concentrate this golden goat

658
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:26,910
shatter is amazing there's very little

659
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,759
left because I really like it

660
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,050
I keep aah I keep coming up to the to

661
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,250
the table where the email is and I'm

662
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,259
like I'm gonna take a little dab of that

663
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,970
golden go and I just get a little dab it

664
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,500
and I take it bad and I get the flavor

665
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,730
on my mouth but it saved us such a

666
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,930
little dab that he doesn't really get me

667
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,759
high because I take a lot of dads you

668
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:42,930
guys I take a lot of big dads so be like

669
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,609
[ __ ] I gotta take another little dad

670
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,660
I'll take the little dad I feel like two

671
00:21:44,609 --> 00:21:46,919
or three those little like you know what

672
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,420
[ __ ] it I'm just gonna take a big dad

673
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,680
and I'll take a big dad that I should

674
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,200
have just started with and then I end up

675
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:54,240
really high it's funny I like it so this

676
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,370
gram of golden go shatter has not lasted

677
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,319
very long at all good job do whoever

678
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:00,559
drew the material and then a really good

679
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:04,019
job to our friends at tiara concentrates

680
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:05,399
this came out wonderfully it is just

681
00:22:04,019 --> 00:22:07,980
straight shatter I talk about different

682
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,769
consistencies of hash this is like a

683
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:12,240
little pane of glass wrapped in

684
00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:13,950
parchment it's not that sharp because

685
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,149
it's more like Jolly Ranchers it's like

686
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:17,460
if you had a sheet of joe

687
00:22:15,148 --> 00:22:18,658
rancher it would just be snappy like

688
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,548
this I'm trying to fold it back up so

689
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:22,469
that I could put this away all right

690
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:25,108
I've got the hash on to the dabber I've

691
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:27,479
got the hash put away putting it back in

692
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:29,158
my child proof child safe container I

693
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,629
just like keep it in that container

694
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:33,839
because it's labeled got a couple of the

695
00:22:30,628 --> 00:22:35,939
flavors over here all right so you got

696
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:39,108
me a DAB I'm gonna heat up the nail

697
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:41,219
right now I'm smoking on a quartz banger

698
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,838
so let's talk about some different nails

699
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:43,950
a lot of times you see me using the

700
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:45,538
email if you've ever watched me on

701
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:47,249
Instagram it's a nail it's made out of

702
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:48,989
titanium and it's got a cord attached to

703
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:50,940
it and actually attaches to a box and

704
00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:52,348
that box keeps the nail at the

705
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,119
appropriate temperature for taking dads

706
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:55,499
all the time I'm not using that right

707
00:22:54,118 --> 00:22:58,168
now it is right here next to me it's

708
00:22:55,499 --> 00:23:00,868
turned on but I want to use this rig

709
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:03,089
that I was uh that I want so I've got a

710
00:23:00,868 --> 00:23:05,819
quartz banger it kind of looks like a

711
00:23:03,088 --> 00:23:07,888
normal bowl like a pipe bowl or it's

712
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:09,538
it's basically just a little dish it's a

713
00:23:07,888 --> 00:23:11,848
quartz dish

714
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:14,158
it's pinky deep it looks like a thimble

715
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:17,278
it's almost like a thimble you guys but

716
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,419
it's quartz and uh so it's course it's

717
00:23:17,278 --> 00:23:19,950
gotta of course it's got a little piece

718
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:21,119
that goes into the ring and it goes into

719
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,399
the rig just kind of like where a bong

720
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:25,019
bowl would go and then of course I'm

721
00:23:23,398 --> 00:23:27,418
using the rig I won from elevate it's a

722
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:28,798
pumpkin looking rig so with a little

723
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:30,929
pumpkin on the back which is the coolest

724
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,158
part so I'm gonna heat the Banger it's

725
00:23:30,929 --> 00:23:34,080
gonna be hard to hear me probably while

726
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,129
I do that I got a lot of compression

727
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,968
going on here but I don't think it'll

728
00:23:35,128 --> 00:23:40,738
cut this out but while I heat it make

729
00:23:38,969 --> 00:23:42,899
sure you check out the dank team.com

730
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:44,338
they've got a fresh crop of ira genetics

731
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:46,528
and stock so make sure you check them

732
00:23:44,338 --> 00:23:48,868
out for feminized and regular cannabis

733
00:23:46,528 --> 00:23:49,919
seeds means all right you guys are just

734
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,658
a couple of seconds something to take a

735
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,849
dab of this golden go and then we'll get

736
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:54,929
on with this podcast I do appreciate you

737
00:23:53,848 --> 00:23:56,848
dabbing with me I hope you're heating

738
00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,259
the nail right now my nail has got the

739
00:23:56,848 --> 00:24:00,148
cool excited it's way over heated it's

740
00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:02,548
kind of cleaning off some funk so I'll

741
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:06,808
hold the nail cool all right guys let's

742
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:10,158
dab together here we go

743
00:24:06,808 --> 00:24:10,158
feels cool let's do this

744
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,519
that's a pretty big dad maybe bigger

745
00:24:28,789 --> 00:24:32,779
than I needed for a podcast but what

746
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:38,119
could go wrong right I just gotta say

747
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:39,440
her talking to a microphone oh yeah yes

748
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:41,500
excellent work to my friends or to our

749
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,860
concentrates this golden go shatter is

750
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:47,000
amaze balls I approve all right my head

751
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,319
will quit spinning here in just a couple

752
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,970
of seconds then we're gonna move on with

753
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,109
the parts that I wrote it down I'm glad

754
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,299
I wrote them down cuz I would have

755
00:24:51,109 --> 00:24:54,409
forgotten by now let's take one last

756
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:56,269
drink here then we'll get on with this

757
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:58,250
guys I hope you took a fat dab with me

758
00:24:56,269 --> 00:24:59,059
if you're dabbing with me while we're on

759
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:00,349
the ball you're listening to the show

760
00:24:59,059 --> 00:25:03,529
send me a tweet let me know what you're

761
00:25:00,349 --> 00:25:06,349
smoking on tweet me at G fyh podcast on

762
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:08,059
twitter at g f YH podcast I'd love to

763
00:25:06,349 --> 00:25:09,579
know that you're smoking with me and I'd

764
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:11,869
love to know what you're smoking on

765
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:14,059
alright so let's get to the notes that I

766
00:25:11,869 --> 00:25:16,879
wrote down who I wrote down that

767
00:25:14,059 --> 00:25:19,549
phenotype variations will take different

768
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:22,190
times to flower which means if you buy a

769
00:25:19,549 --> 00:25:24,319
package of seeds not every seed in that

770
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:27,200
package is going to take the same amount

771
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,539
of time to flower you may get one strain

772
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,700
that takes or one phenotype that takes

773
00:25:29,539 --> 00:25:33,649
nine weeks and you may get one phenotype

774
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:36,289
that takes ten weeks to flower out of

775
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,930
the same package now the reason for that

776
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,700
I'll explain a little bit why that comes

777
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:43,250
to do when I talk about f1 and f2

778
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,850
breeding and f3 and f4

779
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:49,009
when you make an f1 it's got a very wide

780
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:51,949
variety of traits it'll bring out traits

781
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:53,539
from the mother plant and the father

782
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,400
plant they were used of the female and

783
00:25:53,539 --> 00:25:56,839
the male so the girl plant they received

784
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:59,269
the pollen and the male plant that threw

785
00:25:56,839 --> 00:26:02,929
pollen those traits are gonna show but

786
00:25:59,269 --> 00:26:05,180
also the grandparents so whatever female

787
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:07,250
you used the male and female used for

788
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:09,500
that are going to show up in your F

789
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,079
wands and whatever you used for the male

790
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:14,869
the male and female used to make that is

791
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,819
gonna show up in your f1 seeds so you're

792
00:26:14,869 --> 00:26:19,009
gonna see grandma you're gonna see

793
00:26:16,819 --> 00:26:20,809
grandpa and then you're also gonna see

794
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,910
Grandma and Grandpa on the other side

795
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:24,769
and then you're also gonna see mommy and

796
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:26,330
you're also gonna see daddy so you're

797
00:26:24,769 --> 00:26:27,558
gonna have a lot of different phenotypes

798
00:26:26,329 --> 00:26:29,928
popping up from

799
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:33,109
laughs once this is a possibility so you

800
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:34,730
may get one that takes eight weeks you

801
00:26:33,109 --> 00:26:36,648
may get one that takes ten weeks and

802
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:39,679
this is very possible so when you make

803
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:42,378
those F ones there's a lot of variation

804
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,379
so what we do is breeders we find the

805
00:26:42,378 --> 00:26:47,748
most desirable female that you can find

806
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:49,490
out of all of your seeds out of the f

807
00:26:47,749 --> 00:26:51,288
wands you want the one that is whatever

808
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,970
you're looking for the best stink or the

809
00:26:51,288 --> 00:26:55,128
best growth or the best resin you want

810
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:56,899
the best all-around girl and then you

811
00:26:55,128 --> 00:26:58,579
want to take pollen from the male from

812
00:26:56,898 --> 00:27:01,219
the same generation and throw that

813
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:04,189
pollen onto that girl and the seeds that

814
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,659
come from there will be called f2 f2 s

815
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:07,490
will be a little bit more stabilized

816
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:09,379
meaning you're not gonna see as much

817
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,118
representation of the grandparents pop

818
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:13,009
up in the seeds but you're gonna see a

819
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:14,449
little bit closer to the mommy and daddy

820
00:27:13,009 --> 00:27:17,089
and you're gonna start narrowing it down

821
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,720
a little bit more closely to what you're

822
00:27:17,089 --> 00:27:21,740
trying to make with that seed line

823
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:24,169
something interesting that happens with

824
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:28,788
an f2 cross is called transgressive

825
00:27:24,169 --> 00:27:31,549
segregation you actually see the the

826
00:27:28,788 --> 00:27:34,038
kids outperform the parents is generally

827
00:27:31,548 --> 00:27:35,418
what happens you'll see it'll also go

828
00:27:34,038 --> 00:27:37,009
the other way also you'll see weaker

829
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:41,299
traits also but we call those as

830
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:43,819
breeders hopefully so you'll see if you

831
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:46,368
put a gigantic male and a gigantic

832
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:49,069
female and the male makes super stank

833
00:27:46,368 --> 00:27:50,749
and the female make super resin you put

834
00:27:49,069 --> 00:27:53,028
them together you just may make the

835
00:27:50,749 --> 00:27:54,079
super Hulk by on your f2s

836
00:27:53,028 --> 00:27:55,730
because you're gonna see that

837
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,528
transgressive segregation come through

838
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,860
mostly in the f2 generation is where I

839
00:27:57,528 --> 00:28:02,990
find a bat so then I would find my

840
00:28:00,859 --> 00:28:04,609
favorite f2 right the best looking girl

841
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:06,740
of that f2 that's got the traits I'm

842
00:28:04,609 --> 00:28:08,240
going after hopefully it was very

843
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,528
similar to the F ones you know what I

844
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,788
mean you found the one that looked like

845
00:28:09,528 --> 00:28:12,048
you were going after and then you go

846
00:28:10,788 --> 00:28:14,419
find another one that looks like that

847
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:16,099
that's an f2 or that's improved and then

848
00:28:14,419 --> 00:28:17,659
you hit it with the pollen from the f2

849
00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:20,089
male now you have to find a male and a

850
00:28:17,659 --> 00:28:21,830
female and then you hit the the female

851
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:24,168
with the male pollen and when those

852
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:26,089
seeds come out you have now made f3 now

853
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,820
what I'm getting at is every time you do

854
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:30,319
that if you do it correctly sometimes

855
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:31,788
you have to go back you have got to keep

856
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:33,230
a bag of seeds from the old ones that go

857
00:28:31,788 --> 00:28:35,450
back and re hunt but if you do it

858
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:37,548
correctly when you go through each time

859
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:39,409
you're going to make that strain more

860
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:41,118
stable and more stable so you'll start

861
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:41,610
off with like five different phenotypes

862
00:28:41,118 --> 00:28:43,558
and you

863
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:46,619
again and now hopefully you just worked

864
00:28:43,558 --> 00:28:48,420
it down to like three solid phenotypes

865
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:51,149
and then you breed it again and then you

866
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:52,620
got two solid phenotypes to wear when

867
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,390
you grow these plants your fifty-fifty

868
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,469
gonna get this one or this one you know

869
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:57,990
what I mean that's what it's gonna be

870
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,700
kind of like and then hopefully you can

871
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,279
breed it down to where by the time you

872
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,170
get to f5 which takes a long time you

873
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:05,460
guys that is years of breeding and years

874
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:07,620
of developing because you got to find

875
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,179
the males and the females and then

876
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:11,039
sometimes you don't find what you're

877
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,870
looking for so you finish a crop and you

878
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,168
just start over and I actually searched

879
00:29:12,869 --> 00:29:18,539
through I'd say 250 seats to find inner

880
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:20,429
eyes male and I threw away a good

881
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:21,720
portion of the females that popped up

882
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:24,390
because it wasn't what I needed at the

883
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,250
time so by the time you get to an f5

884
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,049
you'll be growing out these seeds and

885
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,569
they will look like clones if you do it

886
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:32,069
correctly five or six I think

887
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:33,869
yeah if five is about where they'll come

888
00:29:32,069 --> 00:29:36,178
out really close f6 will look like

889
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:37,529
clones but I wouldn't want to take it

890
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,210
that far because then nobody else could

891
00:29:37,529 --> 00:29:40,500
breed to it it would just be whatever

892
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,950
you bred to it would come out looking

893
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,960
like that

894
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:45,870
all the time but just be real dominant

895
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,130
genes so every time you breed to it if

896
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:49,889
you do it correctly it makes it more

897
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:51,360
stable so what I'm getting at is a lot

898
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,299
of the breeders on the market right now

899
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,009
are selling UF ones which is not a bad

900
00:29:54,298 --> 00:29:59,039
thing I appreciate it

901
00:29:56,009 --> 00:30:01,048
gage green sells F ones and one of my

902
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,029
favorite brands to buy is gage green

903
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:05,220
genetics because I love the variation

904
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:06,660
that comes in the f1 I get to see a lot

905
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,819
of neat stuff I actually had the honor

906
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,679
of being a tester for gage green so I

907
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:12,689
get to see a lot of great [ __ ] come out

908
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:15,150
of their garden I got to test a lot of

909
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,880
great seeds I loved F ones because of

910
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:19,620
that so you may get an f1 that takes 8

911
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:21,840
weeks you may get an f1 that takes 9

912
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:23,279
weeks from the same exact pack of seeds

913
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,779
now you've got a decision to make do you

914
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:26,730
want to cut that one down early and

915
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:28,289
change your feeding regimen and have two

916
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,298
different plants that you've got to feed

917
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:33,569
or do you just want to let them all go

918
00:30:30,298 --> 00:30:36,029
that 60 days sixty-four days

919
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:37,439
56 days it's up to you you get to decide

920
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:40,079
that stuff but that's a decision you've

921
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,730
got to make if you can tell early on and

922
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,369
flower that one is kind of taking off

923
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:45,960
and getting a little bit taller than the

924
00:30:44,369 --> 00:30:47,579
others I mean you may have some thinking

925
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,250
to do right at the beginning there that

926
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,808
may give you a hint so different seeds

927
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:53,519
are the same seed packet different

928
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,950
phenotypes you may have different

929
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,240
flowering times

930
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,919
I really love searching through seed

931
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,419
packs and finding the phenotypes because

932
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,399
depending on what you're working with

933
00:30:59,419 --> 00:31:03,350
you may find some really great [ __ ] you

934
00:31:01,398 --> 00:31:05,298
may also find some ridiculous stuff but

935
00:31:03,349 --> 00:31:07,579
in the same pack I found completely

936
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:09,440
purple buds that were short and compact

937
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:11,329
and plants make purple bright purple

938
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:15,740
buds and I've also had plants that make

939
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:17,269
tall velvety bright green buds and I

940
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,888
couldn't decide which phenotype to keep

941
00:31:17,269 --> 00:31:21,380
so I kept them both and I called them

942
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:23,000
just different phenotypes so female

943
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:25,610
hunting is fun I really love it that's

944
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,619
one of my favorite things to do so

945
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:30,048
expect some variation also something I

946
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:33,138
wrote down is different flowering times

947
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:35,720
in different rooms and environments so

948
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:36,888
if I gave you clones if I gave you

949
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:38,509
clones and I gave one of your other

950
00:31:36,888 --> 00:31:40,129
friends clones and I gave a couple other

951
00:31:38,509 --> 00:31:44,869
guys clones and you guys all took it to

952
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:48,019
your grow room you may see that your

953
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:49,788
room wants these plants to flower in 58

954
00:31:48,019 --> 00:31:52,788
days they may be perfectly finished in

955
00:31:49,788 --> 00:31:55,638
58 days if I give somebody else plants

956
00:31:52,788 --> 00:31:57,859
they may need 63 days if we're getting

957
00:31:55,638 --> 00:31:59,509
right down to it so environmental can

958
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:02,839
have a lot to do with it you guys

959
00:31:59,509 --> 00:32:04,730
also indoors and outdoors you're gonna

960
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:06,379
see huge differences in different areas

961
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,639
our buds are gonna look completely

962
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:09,019
different if we're growing them in

963
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:11,058
California if we're growing them in

964
00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:13,009
Colorado altitudes make a huge

965
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:14,750
difference environmental factors like

966
00:32:13,009 --> 00:32:18,319
that will play a huge difference in your

967
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:19,730
flowering times yep alright I think I've

968
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,408
gone I'm filling enough you guys we're

969
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,819
at 32 minutes now so I think I'm gonna

970
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:24,200
