i'm not going to say their name i got a

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,040
question about i was straight up

50
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:01,280
relationship love and relationship and

51
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,280
family and marriage advice and i'm going

52
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,359
to say right now at the top of this show

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,759
that's not what this is about i am in no

54
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,520
way qualified to give you relationship

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,598
advice that sort of stuff this is a

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,760
cannabis growing show somebody paid

57
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,839
money on my patreon to ask me a

58
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,120
relationship advice question i asked if

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
they wanted their money back they did

60
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,680
not want their contribution back i felt

61
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,159
it very weird um i'm not the guy to come

62
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
to for that so uh that was awkward

63
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,878
that's all i've really got to say about

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,560
that i wanted to address that on the

65
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,399
show because first of all it was kind of

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,759
i thought they might be trolling me but

67
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,159
then i realized no this person paid

68
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,598
money for this uh they might be serious

69
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:36,878
so i contacted them i was like bro is

70
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,000
this for real i'm like yeah i need your

71
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:39,518
guidance and i was like i'm not the

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,360
person dude i'm not a relationship

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,759
counselor all i'm gonna do is say i'm a

74
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,560
42 year old single guy not the guy to

75
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,919
ask for relationship advice from uh i

76
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,360
just want to make it clear don't don't

77
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:51,280
send me relationship questions on

78
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,640
patreon you'll get your money back and

79
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,878
also that's kind of funny i thought it

80
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,399
was funny once i was like this is real i

81
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,840
don't know if i thought it was funnier

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,080
when i thought it was trolling or when i

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,519
realized it was real either way that was

84
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,800
my laugh of the week i thought i'd share

85
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,959
it with you guys

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,159
relationship advice on patreon that's

87
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,000
kind of funny maybe i should have taken

88
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,079
the money and given my best advice it

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,759
did not feel right i don't have that

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,440
kind of qualification you guys all right

91
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,959
let's jump into some real content here

92
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,560
on this podcast

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,239
i do have a patreon question here in

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,318
front of me that does come from a long

95
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,039
time patreon supporter who would rather

96
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:25,119
remain a not a mouse it goes a lot like

97
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,840
this it says hey ross to jeff i've never

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,319
heard you discuss the washing qualities

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,239
of your strains i plan on dabbling in

100
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,958
some bubble hash production and i've

101
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,200
wondered if you have any reports on irie

102
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,080
washing attributes if no such reports

103
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:42,238
exist which i restrain is the stickiest

104
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
of them all that's a very good question

105
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,360
uh what our friend here is asking is

106
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,598
about making bubble hash they're going

107
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,040
to there's a lot of good ways to do this

108
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,238
but let's just stick to the point

109
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,959
they're going to make some bubble hash

110
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,480
they're going to extract the trichomes

111
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,438
from the plants using

112
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,039
ice water ice probably some bubble bags

113
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,400
and some agitation that's the main way

114
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,479
to do it they're gonna freeze the

115
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,000
trichomes off the buds collect them

116
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,759
through some sort of a sieve bag that's

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,598
the way it's gonna happen here so our

118
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,759
friend is basically asking which irie

119
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:12,079
genetic strains wash the best because

120
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:14,399
they do plan to make some bubble hash uh

121
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,959
they're going to use uh bubble bags and

122
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,120
ice and water and agitation and remove

123
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,280
the trichomes from the plant material to

124
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,439
make smokeable concentrates some people

125
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,279
from there will press that make it even

126
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,800
cleaner and better uh some people will

127
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,399
just smoke the bubble depending on the

128
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,319
quality that they make there are a lot

129
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,839
of methods to doing that in the winter

130
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,599
time it's a great time to make bubble

131
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,599
hash because the colder uh your

132
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,040
environment the colder the process the

133
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,639
better the concentrate that is an

134
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,960
advantage of being here in colorado in

135
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,560
the winter time let me get myself back

136
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,478
on track our friend wants to make bubble

137
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,639
hash and to make the best hash they want

138
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:48,879
to know which irie genetic strains have

139
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,918
been known for making the best bubble

140
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,680
and the best wash concentrates i do have

141
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:55,599
some good feedback for you i can tell

142
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,918
you right away that the cream is

143
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,560
definitely going to be one of the best

144
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,719
washers the cream is amazing for washing

145
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,879
it rinses really easily it puts off a

146
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,039
lot of product it tastes and smells

147
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,439
amazing and most of the time the color

148
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,599
that comes from it is a real light white

149
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,918
color so it makes your washed product

150
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,479
product look really desirable really

151
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:18,000
tasty and the the buzz from it will sit

152
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,439
you on your ass it's the kind of buzz

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
that makes you just sometimes when you

154
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,800
smoke concentrates your brain will

155
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
wander when you smoke the cream you just

156
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,319
sit right back in your ass you find a

157
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,839
recliner and you lean back and you chill

158
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,839
out for a little bit that's what it'll

159
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:32,560
do to you so the cream is going to be

160
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:35,560
my very first recommendation however the

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,240
cream is getting close to being sold out

162
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,399
forever once the cream sells out i'm not

163
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,560
going to make any more um

164
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,719
nothing against the cream plant excuse

165
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,319
me nothing against that cream plant it

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,639
is just uh it's not something that i'm

167
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,038
going to work with anymore it's time to

168
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,120
move on i make some things i produce

169
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,038
them for a certain amount of time and

170
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,399
then sometimes i just simply move on i'm

171
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:58,159
only allowed to have so many plants in

172
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,000
the garden you guys know that and so uh

173
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
the cream the mom plant that makes the

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,279
cream has been eliminated i don't have

175
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,519
that plant anymore couldn't make more if

176
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:07,679
i wanted to i could have to it i could

177
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,918
s1 it however it is time to move on the

178
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,680
cream has done its thing uh it's worked

179
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,839
its course so i will not be making any

180
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,439
more cream seeds if you can find them uh

181
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,918
if you can get them i would get those

182
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:19,439
make some bubble hash with those

183
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:21,758
another line that would make amazing

184
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:23,360
concentrates is the dark hollow that one

185
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,280
makes more of that real

186
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
musky earthy garlicky scented

187
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,119
concentrate it's also real light in

188
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,359
color it washes really well i really

189
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,519
like the dark hollow concentrates now

190
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,160
let's talk about something else i was at

191
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,560
the dude grows cup and my friend kelvin

192
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,880
grew strawberry starburst and they

193
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,839
pressed the strawberry starburst into

194
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,000
rosin the rosin that pedro made out of

195
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,560
the strawberry starburst was some of my

196
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,079
favorite rosin i have ever smoked so if

197
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,839
you're going to press it maybe

198
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,800
strawberry starburst might be right up

199
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,799
your alley for the pressing concentrates

200
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,439
i also wrote down that the blue

201
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,240
raspberry truffle has made some amazing

202
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:04,560
pressed concentrates then we're going to

203
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,519
talk about the machine recently i was

204
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,680
gifted a batch of the machine so the

205
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,279
machine started off as machine fresh

206
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,959
frozen buds they grew the plant they

207
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,478
chopped it down they took off all the

208
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,478
big leaves and froze it almost

209
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,318
immediately then they took that and they

210
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,199
made bubble hash out of those frozen

211
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,120
buds from those frozen buds then they

212
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,639
pressed that in a press and made hash

213
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,360
rosin that concentrate put me on my ass

214
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,680
it made me totally goofy the entire time

215
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,360
i had that jar of concentrates around

216
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,840
my day was just half done it was like i

217
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,680
was multitasking but i was malta i was

218
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:39,679
actually multi [ __ ] things up i

219
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,360
wasn't getting anything done properly i

220
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,439
was doing 10 things at a time all of

221
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,280
them were failing it was a good thing

222
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,000
that concentrate was awesome but it made

223
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,478
me

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,038
stupid it made me dumb i did a podcast

225
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,878
and i don't really i don't recall that

226
00:07:51,038 --> 00:07:54,639
podcast i know i did it i know i had a

227
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,240
good time and it was a good show

228
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,319
but i was in a bubble for the whole time

229
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,639
that machine concentrate wrecked me so

230
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,240
the machine makes great concentrates

231
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,319
something else i've noticed is that all

232
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
of the lemon strains that i breed make

233
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,840
really tall trichomes and those tall

234
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,478
trichomes seem to make good concentrates

235
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,159
so the lemon sunrise the lemon jeffrey

236
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,439
those seem to make really good

237
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,720
concentrates i don't know if it's the

238
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,879
tall trichomes i don't know if it's the

239
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,800
size of the trichome head i'm really not

240
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,039
certain i'm not a concentrate maker or a

241
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
trichome head expert so that is not my

242
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,959
area of expertise but i do know that

243
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,479
those lemon strains make amazing

244
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,680
concentrates

245
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,758
now i did say that i'm not the

246
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,560
concentrate maker let me tease an

247
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,879
upcoming episode for episode 710 i do

248
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:39,038
plan to have a concentrate maker on the

249
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,200
show i will ask them about the size and

250
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:42,799
shape of trichome stocks and heads and

251
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
see how much of a difference that does

252
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,079
make in our concentrate production

253
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
because i'm interested to learn that

254
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,360
type of thing too so i've been rambling

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
for quite a bit about

256
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,200
bubble hash recommendations let me kind

257
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,000
of recap a little bit and then also let

258
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,680
me you should keep this in mind um i do

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
smoke a lot of flour people are like do

260
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,759
you only smoke concentrates no i smoke a

261
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,080
lot of flour i just tend to take more

262
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:06,480
dabs when i'm on the go because uh to

263
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
get myself the buzz i want with flowers

264
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,720
i basically have to smoke an entire uh

265
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,920
big fat joint about about a two gram

266
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,600
three and a half gram joint i gotta

267
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:15,599
smoke that bad [ __ ] by myself to get

268
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,959
the desired effect uh and then i'm just

269
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,120
carrying a joint around or hitting a

270
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:21,518
bowl all day i could take a dab or two

271
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,919
dabs in just a couple of minutes and be

272
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
lit for a few hours a couple maybe two

273
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:27,278
and a half hours if i take a couple of

274
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,959
fat dabs i could be nice and heavily

275
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:30,320
medicated i would prefer a dab every

276
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:31,199
hour but when you're working when you're

277
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,480
busy

278
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,399
trying to be productive you can't be

279
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,759
sitting around dabbing all day so i try

280
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,320
to stay on the move that's why i smoke a

281
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,879
lot of dabs but i do love smoking a lot

282
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,480
of flowers i breed seeds i make a lot of

283
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,399
new creations

284
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,360
i like to test grow and test smoke and

285
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,519
enjoy my new creations i really love to

286
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,278
smoke when i create a new seed line and

287
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,200
give it to somebody local and they grow

288
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,200
it and they bring me flowers or bring me

289
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,480
concentrates i love smoking those

290
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,240
flowers i love smoking those

291
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,560
concentrates so i do smoke a lot of

292
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,320
flowers but i primarily have been

293
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,479
smoking concentrates lately since the

294
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,000
whole dab revolution fired up and uh

295
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,839
they're easily available readily

296
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,278
available kind of what i'm leaning

297
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,000
towards here kind of what i'm heading

298
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:15,439
for is i think i've accidentally been

299
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,120
breeding flowers that are geared toward

300
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,959
concentrate production i don't know if i

301
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,200
was doing it subconsciously or

302
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,439
consciously but i prefer to smoke

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
concentrate so when my harvest is ready

304
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,200
when all my flowers are done most of the

305
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,040
time if it's not a seeded product if

306
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,800
it's something i grew for myself at

307
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,399
least two thirds three quarters of it

308
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,479
gets allocated for concentrate

309
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,399
production we don't even trim it

310
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,320
not the way that we would trim it for uh

311
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:40,159
for smoking which we'll talk about our

312
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,079
concentrate gurus in a future episode to

313
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,278
see the difference between harvesting

314
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,039
and growing our buds if there's a

315
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,039
difference between growing for

316
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,199
concentrate and growing for flowers but

317
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,519
i allocate probably three quarters of my

318
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,759
my grow for concentrate making uh

319
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,759
concentrate production because i prefer

320
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,439
to smoke concentrate so i maybe

321
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,278
subconsciously secretly in the back of

322
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,200
my head have been breeding so that i can

323
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,958
have the best quality concentrates if

324
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,560
you think about it i've got strawberry

325
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:05,919
starburst that makes [ __ ] strawberry

326
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,479
concentrates who doesn't love a

327
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:10,399
strawberry concentrate lemon jeffrey

328
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
lemon concentrates who doesn't love a

329
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,159
lemon concentrated i kind of caught

330
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
myself accidentally breathing toward

331
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,159
that avenue most of my stuff is going

332
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,240
toward the most flavorable most potent

333
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:22,159
concentrates so i said i was going to

334
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,079
recap i don't know if i got to that part

335
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,078
uh bubble hash some of the best strains

336
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,919
i would recommend would be the cream

337
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,479
i've got great experience with the cream

338
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,479
making amazing bubble hash

339
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,399
then i would say strawberry starburst

340
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,240
then i would say blue raspberry truffle

341
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,559
then i would throw the machine in there

342
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,959
definitely dark hollow

343
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,719
then all of the lemon strains that i

344
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:44,639
make fall in that category for making

345
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,240
good concentrates i don't have good

346
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,319
experience i don't have the education

347
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
but i think something with the size of

348
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
the trichome heads they come from the

349
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,279
lemon skunk plant that i work with i

350
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,519
think that results in very good

351
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,278
concentrates it just catches in the bags

352
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,720
very well and i guess if there's a big

353
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:00,559
trichome had there's got to be a lot of

354
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,759
product inside of that trichome head as

355
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,719
well right that's where all the magic

356
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,319
happens

357
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,320
i'm not sure what i'm talking about all

358
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,839
right my friend who would rather remain

359

please do reach out uh he wrapped this

366
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,560
up with take care bro oh also uh which

367
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,200
is the stickiest eye restraint of all i

368
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:29,039
think sticky is going to be uh kind of

369
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,959
more about your growing and breeding

370
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,639
environment it's all about uh if your

371
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,239
room is dry your weed won't get real

372
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,480
sticky if your room is kind of humid if

373
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
you've got the proper vpd your weed will

374
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,639
get sticky it's got the potential the

375
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,879
opportunity to get sticky then in the

376
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,360
dry and cure process you've got to baby

377
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,919
that weed and keep it just right spongy

378
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,079
gooey but not not juicy you want to kind

379
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,039
of ah that's that's the fine line right

380
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,958
there that's where you get the

381
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,958
stickiness i think that comes from the

382
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,359
dry and cure i think anything out of my

383
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,319
line properly grown properly dried and

384
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,240
cured has the potential to be the sticky

385
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,079
icky all right dude once again thank you

386
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,120
for the great question let's keep it

387
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:06,719
moving

388
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,440
all right this next message comes from

our friends at cedar city canada and it

390
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,920

welcome thank you for listening and

394
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:22,559
watching it goes on it says i'm

395
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,360
cultivating indoor hemp because i live

396
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,000
in a prohibition state ah be careful you

397
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,399
still may need uh hemp cultivation

398
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,679
licenses don't think that just because

399
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,759
it's hemp and not cannabis that you

400
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,120
can't get in any trouble uh side rant

401
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,720
random stories sometimes these are

402
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,720
people's favorites favorite parts of the

403
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,440
podcast we had some friends who were

404
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,440
growing cannabis outdoors they possibly

405
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,959
allegedly may have been over their legal

406
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,800
limit of how many cannabis plants we

407
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,879
were allowed to have in the region in

408
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:51,919
which they were growing the police came

409
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,198
actually uh zoning came it was zoning it

410
00:13:51,919 --> 00:13:54,639
wasn't even the police because in

411
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,159
colorado if you've got a certain amount

412
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,278
of plants over your limit

413
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,559
and you don't seem like you're into a

414
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,720
criminal activity or a criminal

415
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,799
enterprise they just send zoning so far

416
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,399
it's a zoning violation so they sent

417
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,319
code enforcement and code enforcement

418
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,480
comes up and they're like sir it seems

419
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,839
that you have too many cannabis plants

420
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,680
and my friend said what if i tell you

421
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,880
their hemp plants and he said well then

422
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:14,239
we're going to go get the department of

423
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,679
agriculture and find you for your

424
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,440
illegal hemp plants but if you've got

425
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:18,799
illegal cannabis plants we're just going

426
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,120
to make you cut those down until you've

427
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,958
got your limit so the options were if

428
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,278
they were cannabis plants we were going

429
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,638
to cut them down until we got to our

430
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,838
legal limit we were allowed to have

431
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,519
explants we had x plus question mark had

432
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,000
to cut down all the question mark get to

433
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,360
x while the while the uh department of

434
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,799
the code enforcement guy watched he

435
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,480
basically was like pick them out cut

436
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,479
them down that's all i care about and so

437
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,278
the plants got chopped down if they were

438
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,639
hemp

439
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:45,120
we would not have had they would not

440
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,720
have had the option to cut down the

441
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,480
parts the plants in the question mark

442
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,240
those would have been illegal hemp

443
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,720
plants and we would have been fined for

444
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,120
growing hemp without any licensing

445
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,519
that was a weird dynamic to experience

446
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,879
that day that luckily that zoning guy

447
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,240
was pretty cool he was just an older guy

448
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,000
he didn't want any [ __ ] didn't want any

449
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,680
trouble wanted to come out and say hey

450
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,360
the neighbors say it smells like [ __ ]

451
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,039
dank weed out here you got too many

452
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
plants i can't really say much other

453
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,919
than cut down the plants and if those

454
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,519
are still here in a few days the law

455
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,719
will come and we're like well [ __ ] we'll

456
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,560
just cut down the plants and the plants

457
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,720
went choppy chop chop into the compost

458
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,399
bin that was that uh we were allowed to

459
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,079
finish the crop with the legal amount of

460
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,919
plants in that area

461
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,519
i told you i was gonna get rambling so

462
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,240
be careful with your hemp plants that is

463
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,440
the main point of that story um let's

464
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
get back into this i live in a

465
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
prohibition state and i am on the be

466
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,199
careful growing anything in a

467
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:35,439
prohibition state my friend uh please do

468
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,639
it says i'm on the fence with breeding a

469
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,519
cbd cultivar i like that uh with your

470
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,600
breeding expertise um that might be an

471
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,560
exaggeration but i appreciate that would

472
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:49,600
it matter for thc sake which was the

473
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,198
male versus which was the female say an

474
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,040
orange gasm let's not say orange

475
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:54,799
gasoline because orange gasms uh fem

476
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,480
seed and it's got to be uh this will

477
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,000
that it may work in here but i just want

478
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,519
to keep in mind orange gas ms femme and

479
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
that bell went off and the breeder

480
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,159
salesman side of my brain say orange

481
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,600
gasm pollinated by cbd cultivar that is

482
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,240
possible so you've got a female orange

483
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,000
gasm pollinated it by a high cbd

484
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,198
cultivar or

485
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:16,320
pollen from a reversal reversal or a

486
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:18,879
male thc to the cbd cultivar i see what

487
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,040
you're saying thc male to a cbd female

488
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,879
or the opposite either way

489
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,719
i know you do not grow hemp but if you

490
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:26,720
add any advice or knowledge on the

491
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,519
pollen donor versus the receiver that

492
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,800
would be helpful thanks again um then

493
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,679
something cut out here looks like my

494
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,198
printer by the way something is oh i

495
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,799
think it says orange jasmine is fire the

496
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,719
emojis did not print here that's what

497
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,799
happened uh by the way the orange gasm

498
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,240
is fire thank you bro i appreciate that

499
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,799
uh let's talk a little bit about

500
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,240
breeding for cannabinoids you're trying

501
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:51,679
to create a high cbd cultivar by or yeah

502
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,879
high cbd cultivar by starting with a thc

503
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,479
and a cbd high strain so when you do the

504
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,559
first cross

505
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,639
when you make that first cross so a lot

506
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,958
of you're asking mainly if it matters if

507
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,880
we do the male or the female it all

508
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:06,399
matters um

509
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,000
i don't think it's going to matter which

510
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,919
is the male and which is the female it's

511
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,558
going to work it's going to come down to

512
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,919
your selection the first cross is going

513
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:17,599
to open up pandora's box um it kind of

514
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,520
depends on which plant also it depends

515
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,159
on which plant carries the dominant tree

516
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,759
which one uh dominates the mix i've

517
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,759
talked about this in previous episodes

518
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,599
when we're breeding a lot of the times

519
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,480
the goal is to mix the plants together

520
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,918
to get two traits of a plant one

521
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,079
traits of one plant traits of another

522
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,559
plant mix those into one plant you hope

523
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,798
to see those traits uh those alleles

524
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,399
express themselves and the progeny uh

525
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:41,759
sometimes you see weird [ __ ] sometimes

526
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,038
you see stuff from the grandparents

527
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:44,160
sometimes you don't see what you're

528
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,640
expecting

529
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:49,840
but it all depends on the dominance

530
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,080
codominance uh and not dominance of the

531
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,918
genes of the traits of that plant

532
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,879
sometimes i've talked about uh using a

533
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,038
male plant that is too dominant excuse

534
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,320
me a male plant that is too dominant in

535
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,519
a mix imagine if you've got like just a

536
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:05,359
dude that's just

537
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,879
beastly all the time yeah he can't think

538
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:08,558
real well but he could [ __ ] move a

539
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,640
refrigerator with his left hand and

540
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,079
you're just an ogre just a real ogrely

541
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,679
male maybe you wouldn't want to breed

542
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,960
with that ogrely male because all the

543
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,360
offspring are just going to be [ __ ]

544
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,200
flat forehead narrow eyed ogres we don't

545
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,879
need a bunch of ogres in the offspring

546
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,880
you want to see some of the female in

547
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,360
the cross so i would skip those real

548
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,960
meathead ogrely male plants

549
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,719
because those are going to be due to

550
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,558
dominant if you've got a male or a

551
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,400
female plant that could happen on either

552
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,480
side you could have a super powerful

553
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,480
[ __ ] femme queen on one side or an

554
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919
ogrely dominant male on one side and

555
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,360
that will dominate your mix and then

556
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,600
your cross is just going to be more

557
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:43,839
representations of the male or female

558
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,159
the cannabinoids are going to transfer

559
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,639
the same way if the male plant carries

560
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,080
the thc and it's a super dominant plant

561
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,480
you're going to see a lot of thc in the

562
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,319
offspring if the female plant is super

563
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,000
dominant in the mix and carries the cbd

564
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,319
you're going to see that or vice versa

565
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,558
however it works just depends on kind of

566
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,558
which plant is dominant and it's gene

567
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,119
passing a lot of times we'd hope to see

568
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,359
a perfect 50 50 mix which is how it

569
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,119
works but expression you're gonna see

570
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,359
weird [ __ ] so now let's talk about the

571
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,918
weird [ __ ] we're gonna see

572
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,599
um in my experience from my what you

573
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,840
called expertise which i'm not sure i

574
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,319
qualify for but thank you

575
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,480
when we first make this f1 cross with

576
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:24,399
these varied cannabinoids in my

577
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,200
experience in my prediction and with my

578
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,360
expertise uh what i've seen what i think

579
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,200
will happen is the f1 the first cross

580
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:33,279
you take your either way i don't it

581
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,840
doesn't matter if you've got a thc male

582
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:38,319
or a female cbd male or female you got

583
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,959
cbd and thc male or female we're going

584
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:44,079
to cross them bad [ __ ] the first time

585
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,400
you're going to get very high cbd

586
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:48,319
cultivars you're going to find very high

587
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,320
thc cultivars then you're going to find

588
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:52,000
things in the middle and everything in

589
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:54,079
between you're just gonna open up

590
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,519
pandora's box and get a little bit of

591
00:19:54,079 --> 00:20:00,319
everything at this point i would find a

592
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:01,839
female that is obviously high in cbd i

593
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,000
would try to do lab testing that's the

594
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,918
best way to find cbd if that's really

595
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,759
what you're looking for find the one

596
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,759
that is the highest in the cbd and

597
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,440
lowest in thc

598
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,519
you also need to find the good grower

599
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,440
the one that grows well so do the phenol

600
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,400
hunt find the one that works best for

601
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,159
you

602
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,320
find the plant that looks like how you

603
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,880
want your finished project to look like

604
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:24,558
what do you want the plant structure to

605
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,400
be like how do you want it shaped you

606
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,480
want long spaces do you want short

607
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,000
internal structure do you want long

608
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,240
branching do you want short branching

609
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
what kind of plants are you into growing

610
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,319
find the plant that grows the way you

611
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
need it to grow for your purpose or the

612
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,319
plant that is going to reach your goal

613
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,038
so now you've selected a female

614
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,279
from the f1 progeny find a male from the

615
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,679
f1 progeny that looks just like that

616
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,839
girl if you can similar leaf shape

617
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,000
similar node structure similar

618
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,879
everything find its twin except it's a

619
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,839
boy then cross those two pollinate that

620
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,400
bad [ __ ] now you've made the f2s

621
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:03,439
in those f2s we're going to find a lot

622
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,200
of crazy [ __ ] we're going to find uh

623
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,960
grandparents and great grandparents

624
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,240
expressing themselves but we are also

625
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,480
going to find

626
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,960
beautiful representations of exactly

627
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,360
what we're looking for for the f2 we

628
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,120
found exactly what we want in this batch

629
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:19,439
you're going to find that exactly the

630
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,279
one with the cbd the growth structure

631
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,798
exactly what you want in this batch then

632
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:24,399
you're going to find a male and you're

633
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,759
going to do it again now we're making

634
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,840
the f3

635
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:31,359
now at this point we're actually

636
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:34,079
beginning to lock in that cbd dominant

637
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,599
trade we have found the plants so the f1

638
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:36,960
uh when you make that f1 it's going to

639
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,599
be wild you're going to have a lot of

640
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,120
stuff f2 even more wild but there's

641
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,879
going to be a solid plant in there to

642
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,479
work with then you're going to use that

643
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,640
f2 to make f3

644
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,798
the f3s are going if we selected

645
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,038
correctly the f3s are going to start

646
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:53,200
showing us exactly what we're looking

647
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,919
for if we did this correctly

648
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,640
at least 50 of the plants we grow should

649
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:01,360
look like the plant we are looking for

650
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,600
maybe closer to 60 maybe 70 it depends

651
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:05,918
all about your selection so at this

652
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,678
point here we go again find the plant

653
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,400
that works very well for you the one

654
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:13,280
that makes the cbd the low thc the

655
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:15,120
flavor you want that grows the structure

656
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,918
shape time all of the attributes that

657
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,558
you need find those alleles for you find

658
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,720
that plant find the female find the male

659
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,519
here we go again let's pollinate let's

660
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,240
cross them now we're making f4 now at

661
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:29,679
this point your percentage of your uh

662
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,000
stability this is where the word

663
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,679
stability really does come in here uh

664
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,798
this is where your stability will come

665
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,600
into play you're going to start

666
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:40,798
increasing the stability every time you

667
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,558
do this if you select correctly if you

668
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,558
don't make the right selection you got

669
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,240
to go back to that f2 the f3 wherever

670
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,558
you were wherever you did see what you

671
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,480
liked go there maybe the step before and

672
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,079
rework that select different plants from

673
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,000
the mix

674
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:57,279
so just keep working this by the time

675
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,359
you get to f4 you should be really close

676
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,399
to what you're looking for by the time

677
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:04,719
you get to uh f5 you'll have what i

678
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,038
called what i wrote down as reliable

679
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,640
stabilized phenotypes most of the

680
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,240
phenotypes are going to come out looking

681
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,880
like the plant you're looking for by the

682
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,319
time you get to f6 you've got basically

683
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,000
clones you're growing

684
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:21,200
probably 95 98 of the seeds you toss out

685
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,599
are going to look exactly the same so it

686
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,640
doesn't really matter uh which plant has

687
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,319
the thc which one has the cbd that first

688
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,559
time you cross it you're gonna you're

689
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,240
gonna get the the whole mix of [ __ ] the

690
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:34,558
second time you're gonna get an even

691
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,038
wider mix of [ __ ] find the plants you

692
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:39,759
like keep moving forward and fill your

693
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,679
generation with your goal in mind take a

694
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:43,519
lot of notes

695
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,278
never be afraid to go back if you messed

696
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,240
up and you're not seeing what you want

697
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,599
in the f3 f4 go back work the f2 again

698
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,440
start there

699
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,399
then take a lot of notes see what did

700
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,080
and what did not work also here may be a

701
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,759
useful tip when you were working with

702
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:59,439
these plants you've got a couple of

703
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,558
options you can take

704
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,480
the um you can take one male and you can

705
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:06,558
pollinate multiple females what is

706
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,079
stopping you from taking one the select

707
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,918
male uh from your f2 population and

708
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,839
pollinating three females you got the

709
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,080
tall one the short one and the squatty

710
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,599
one pollinate all three of them mark the

711
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,038
seeds and grow those and see which one

712
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,959
of those you like the best what is

713
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,960
stopping you nothing's stopping you from

714
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,798
pollinating multiple females so

715
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,840
pollinating multiple females each round

716
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,000
will give you

717
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,319
multiple avenues to work with then you

718
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,679
can always cross those lines together if

719
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,759
you get one that has the structure you

720
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,400
want and one that's got the cbd that you

721
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,158
want later on cross those together

722
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,640
that's always a fun work parallel line

723
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,080
should i talk briefly on parallel lines

724
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,480
so in your first project you were

725
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,639
working strictly for cbd right so let's

726
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,519
just breed for cbd on this side all

727
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,840
we're looking for is cbd maybe growth

728
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,119
also because you have to have stable uh

729
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:54,639
plants that can support themselves

730
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:56,079
strong healthy vigorous plants is the

731
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:58,240
word i'm looking for so we're looking

732
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:59,678
for plant growth and cbd on one side we

733
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,480
just breed for that

734
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,278
you just just just like i said before f2

735
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,120
look for cbd and plant growth f3 for cbd

736
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:09,919
and plant growth all the way up to f5

737
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:12,399
maybe f6 on another project we're using

738
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,080
the exact same seeds except we're

739
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,759
looking for different attributes let's

740
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,639
say we're looking for

741
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:20,798
maybe it puts out a super strong grape

742
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,880
aroma so we're going to breed other

743
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:25,278
plants over here and we're looking for

744
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,640
nothing but grape aroma so we're going

745
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:28,159
to grow them and all the plants don't

746
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,720
smell like grapes they get tossed we're

747
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,400
gonna f2 the grape smelling plant gonna

748
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,600
find an f2 that smells like grapes we're

749
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,360
gonna have three that f4 f5 f6 where

750
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,480
every time we grow it it just smells

751
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:43,038
like grapes every time then we cross our

752
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,880
cbd dominant cultivar to our grape

753
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:47,038
cultivar and we breed those together and

754
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,679
you get [ __ ] grape cbd out of your

755
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,640
line a true f1 that you've created all

756
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:54,400
the way from f f yeah that that feels

757
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,159
really fun to do right that's a lifelong

758
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,600
project uh maybe something to think

759
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,919
about that's just what i was saying when

760
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,519
i say parallel lines i said it had to

761
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,720
ramble about it thanks for listening to

762
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,720
that i hope you learned something on

763
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,600
that let me get myself back on track

764
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,319
here because i did freestyle most of the

765
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,199
info coming out of this question here a

766
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,439
lot of this is going to rely on your

767
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,679
selection luckily now we've got science

768
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,360
we've got labs um

769
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,720
you can do predicative testing if you're

770
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,959
looking for cbd you can take snippets or

771
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,720
tissue samples of all of your plants and

772
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,880
send them to the lab and they can say

773
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,200
this plant has got the precursor for a

774
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,600
lot of thc or the precursor for a lot of

775
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,919
cbd and you can toss those high thc

776
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,918
plants and keep those high cbd plants

777
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,600
now you're just breeding out of uh

778
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,360
you've already got half your population

779
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,119
eliminated half your work is done for

780
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,038
you you know those cannabinoids are

781
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,119
going to be there now you can grow for a

782
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:48,640
structure uh the other traits which you

783
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,479
are looking for you can focus more on

784
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,720
that predicative testing will really

785
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,640
help you out if that is available

786
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,720
affordable cost effective that will

787
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
really speed you up in this program you

788
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,000
can identify the presence of cbd

789
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,159
precursors

790
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,240
early and vegetative growth yes i know

791
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,400
that sounds crazy but then you can get

792
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,960
rid of all those thc plants early and

793
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,320
just breed for cbd that will definitely

794
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,960
help you move forward in your

795
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,639
generations all right my friend i folded

796
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,319

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,600
traits would come from but i think i

804
