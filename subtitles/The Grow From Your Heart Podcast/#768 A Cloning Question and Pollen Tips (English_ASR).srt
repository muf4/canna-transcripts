00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:20,699
the episodes aren't completely current

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,800
that info is still completely useful

93
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,419
also a lot of people do laugh and enjoy

94
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,879
watching the older shows going back and

95
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:29,098
seeing how the show has evolved how my

96
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:31,199
approach to podcasting how the gear how

97
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:32,518
everything has evolved my point is go

98
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,719
watch a lot of the old episodes I've

99
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,640
been noticing that some of them have

100
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,620
been getting more views and more clicks

101

YouTube alright I feel like that is

104
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,399
enough rambling here at the top of the

105
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,319
show I did say that I was going to

106
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,939
answer grow questions I've got a couple

107
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,339
of great emails right here in front of

108
00:03:47,939 --> 00:03:52,199
me this one comes from my friend Kip big

109
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,060
shout out to my buddy Kip it goes a lot

110
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,738
like this it says what's up Rasta Jeff

111
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,120
what's up Kip good to see you thank you

112
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,340
for the patreon support thank you for

113
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,019
the great question it says I've got a

114
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,000
quick question for you I was wondering

115
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,519
in your experience what is the best

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,378
practice for flipping into flower after

117
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,599
taking clones that is a very good

118
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:11,158
question Kip goes on to say I typically

119
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,738
wait a couple of weeks so I can make

120
00:04:11,158 --> 00:04:15,780
sure my roots are my Cuts root but I've

121
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:18,060
been getting nearly 100 percent rooting

122
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,699
success lately uh the funny part about

123
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,439
that is as soon as you get too confident

124
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:24,300
and you do flip your plants early that's

125
00:04:22,439 --> 00:04:25,740
when you're going to have rooting

126
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:27,840
problems I'm not trying to curse you I'm

127
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,759
not trying to jinx you that is the way

128
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:31,918
that the grow gods do treat us so be

129
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,020
very careful with that it goes on it

130
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:36,000
does say is there a timeline you should

131
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,099
wait to flip after taking Cuts or can

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,978
you take a cut from a healthy plant and

133
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,080
then go straight into flour I'm doing a

134
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:44,699
fairly large Fino hunt right now of 36

135
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:47,758
plants congratulations bro that sounds

136
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,040
like a lot of fun uh in my 2x4 with Solo

137
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,479
cups and I want to keep them small also

138
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,879
thanks for all of the great content

139
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:56,819
every week and for the bomb genetics

140
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,379
enjoy your week brother from Kip I had

141
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:59,699
some notes on here but as I was reading

142
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:01,978
this I realized you're doing this in

143
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:04,080
Solo cups and I'm going to give one more

144
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:06,240
detail before I read the notes that I

145
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,180
actually have written to avoid taking

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,860
clones from 36 Solo cups have you

147
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,660
thought about re-veging I know that is

148
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,220
totally derailing your plan and you're

149
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,500
asking me about cloning which I will get

150
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,820
to but in my mind if you're running solo

151
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,439
cups those plants are going to get

152
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,939
they're only going to get so big you

153
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:22,978
don't want them too large in a Solo Cup

154
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:24,899
especially in your limited space large

155
00:05:22,978 --> 00:05:27,779
Plant count there I always just grow

156
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:30,120
them very small then I would flour them

157
00:05:27,779 --> 00:05:32,279
then I would Mark uh I would keep my

158
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,600
favorites then when I come to harvest I

159
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,339
would not Harvest all of it I'd leave

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,500
the bottom buds from every one of them

161
00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,939
then smoke it and then re-veg your

162
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,279
favorites that's what I would do I would

163
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:43,139
re-vege them instead of doing clones for

164
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:44,579
plants this small but I don't want to

165
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,620
ruin your whole strategy I don't want to

166
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:48,240
rethink your whole program that's just a

167
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,399
suggestion that is what would Rasta Jeff

168
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,199
do I would just re-vadge now let's focus

169
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,060
on the question because that's what you

170
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,500
want to know let me be useful here there

171
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,079
are a couple of different ways to do

172
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,240
this in most situations we would not be

173
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,620
running such small plants in most

174
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,900
situations we're going to have larger

175
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,240
plants most people are not growing in

176
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:07,859
Solo cups a very small percentage of us

177
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,139
out there are growing in cups I do it

178
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,939
that's how I run a lot of testers some

179
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,259
of the things that I just bred I don't

180
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:15,000
know what they're going to do I want to

181
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:16,740
see if it's intersexy if it smells good

182
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,478
looks good so I'll run a bunch of those

183
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,639
in cups just to get a feel for what I've

184
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,839
got but not everybody does that in most

185
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,360
scenarios we're going to be growing

186
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,739
larger plants in larger containers so

187
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,259
the first scenario I want to talk about

188
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,000
is if we were to take clones from the

189
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:31,860
bottom of the plan A lot of times the

190
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,180
plants will grow up we leave the tops

191
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,620
alone we clean up the bottom right

192
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,959
before we go into flour that's called

193
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,220
lollipopping or shaving the legs you

194
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:39,839
clean up the bottom branches and they

195
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,759
take the suckers off the lower branches

196
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,038
that you do leave when you're doing that

197
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,960
I find that to be a great opportunity to

198
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,360
take a couple of clones the bottoms will

199
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,799
have two four maybe six clones available

200
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,960
right there on the bottom you can cut

201
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:54,180
off if you are taking clones from the

202
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,339
bottom you can cut those off and you

203
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:58,139
could in theory put your plant into

204
00:06:56,339 --> 00:06:59,698
flour right away because you don't need

205
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:01,439
any hormones to move around you don't

206
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,939
need any recovery time because you're

207
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,500
taking stuff from the bottom you're just

208
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,819
completely removing it the hormones are

209
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,379
already at the top where you want them

210
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:09,240
so if you're going to take stuff from

211
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,279
the bottom when you're lollipopping you

212
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:13,319
can do that basically anytime they don't

213
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,359
need recovery time time for that again

214
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,639
that one detail you should focus on is

215
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,500
do you have roots on your clothes or are

216
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,120
you confident that your clones will root

217
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,800
before you put your other plants into

218
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,079
flour I still kind of use that same

219
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,579
practice I don't flour the room until I

220
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,620
see roots on the other clones that I've

221
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,060
taken so I know I've got backups that's

222
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,759
kind of a practice that I do employ

223
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,500
let's talk about another option now if

224
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,479
you do choose to take clones from the

225
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,000
top of the plants then yes I would wait

226
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,038
for some recovery time when I'm growing

227
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,680
larger plants I do generally top the

228
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,259
plant once or twice that main apical top

229
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,939
makes a beautiful clone a lot of times I

230
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,860
will take the two bottoms and the main

231
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:52,019
top right out of the plant and use those

232
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,939
as my three clones in my cloner or in my

233
00:07:52,019 --> 00:07:56,159
clone machine so that's where my first

234
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:58,800
three clones will come from if I take

235
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,020
that top clone I do allow the plants at

236
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,879
least 10 to 14 days to recover you want

237
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:05,279
the hormones in that plant to move

238
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,139
around so that plant can establish who's

239
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:09,359
got the new apical dominant top that's

240
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,978
part of why we top it is to confuse that

241
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,900
plant's hormones and it goes wait we had

242
00:08:10,978 --> 00:08:14,339
one dominant top that's the plant's goal

243
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,138
is to have one dominant top to get up

244
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,579
there and get pollinated and the rest of

245
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,079
the branches are just kind of extra

246
00:08:17,579 --> 00:08:20,818
branches to get pollen to keep life

247
00:08:19,079 --> 00:08:22,500
going but when you take out that main

248
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,120
top all the others go hey I've got the

249
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,038
chance to be the top so we got to let

250
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,780
that action happen and they'll all even

251
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:29,279
out and all try to grow up and be tops

252
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:31,258
and you get a bunch more main Tops on

253
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,000
the plant we do need to allow some time

254
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,158
for those hormones to move around and

255
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,839
for things to recover after we do take

256
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,819
the main top out you could

257
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,800
hypothetically go directly into flower

258
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:42,539
but you will get a much smaller yield

259
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,879
your top buds won't be as large as they

260
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:46,319
could be and that's always where most of

261
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,939
the weight and the yield and the bulk

262
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,800
comes from is that top part of the plant

263
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,839
there so you would be handicapping

264
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,399
yourself kneecapping crippling yourself

265
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,260
if you were to do that too quickly

266
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:57,240
another thing to think about there is if

267
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:58,620
you were trellising if you're topping or

268
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,419
if you're scrogging excuse me if you're

269
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,860
working them into a net you may want to

270
00:09:00,419 --> 00:09:03,539
allow some time to work them in the net

271
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,399
let them recover a little bit before you

272
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:07,919
do put them into flour that will help

273
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,778
them grow like I said bigger fatter Buds

274
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:11,879
and that is the main goal is those big

275
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:13,740
fat juicy nuggets so if you are take

276
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:15,600
taking the quick answer if you're taking

277
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,639
clones from the bottom go ahead and flip

278
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,399
it if you're cutting the tops do allow

279
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:21,899
some time for Recovery my friend Kip

280
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,240
thank you for the great great question

281
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:26,278
bro I do appreciate it I look forward to

282
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,560
hearing back from you and I do look

283
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,080
forward to seeing how your 36 plant

284
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,338
funeral hunt goes in your small space if

285
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,440
you need any help have any questions

286
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:36,180
need some guidance please do reach out

287
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,040
for that because I've done basically

288
00:09:36,179 --> 00:09:41,278
this exact thing that you were going to

289
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:43,019
do and I do wish you the best of luck

290
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,820
all right I'm Gonna Keep the show moving

291
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:47,039
I do have one more great question right

292
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,080
here in front of me this one comes from

293
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,579
our friend Sean it doesn't have a lot of

294
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,680
info about the name they want me use so

295
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:54,120
we're going to call you Sean today this

296
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,699
one was quick and to the point it said

297
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,560
do a video collecting pollen another

298
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,778
pollinating a female then it says you've

299
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,338
done the STS and clone cutting just the

300
00:10:00,778 --> 00:10:04,320
thought but I know you're busy man I

301
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,120
love these quick to the point emails

302
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,640
these are awesome

303
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,560
um let's talk about this so Sean said do

304
00:10:08,639 --> 00:10:12,778
a video collecting pollen that is a

305
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,059
great idea however

306
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:18,360
um YouTube does not like it when I post

307
00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:20,399
videos that do contain live plants

308
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,440
YouTube has removed a couple of my

309
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,899
videos because they've got live plants

310
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,839
in them uh YouTube has also been taking

311
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:29,639
down uh videos and channels uh that are

312
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,019
part of our community so I'm trying to

313
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,399
be extra careful you may have noticed

314
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,560
sometimes I'm more careful with some of

315
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,299
the words that I do use I'm definitely

316
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:37,559
going to be more careful with some of

317
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,778
the content I would like to keep the

318
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,338
channel alive we do a lot of Education

319
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,139
we've got a great Community here the

320
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:44,880
comment section is always beautiful you

321
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:46,980
guys keep going in the comments I love

322
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,480
that but I have to be very careful with

323
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,600
what I'm putting out on YouTube so I

324
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,759
cannot do a pollen collection video but

325
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,740
I can describe it with words that should

326
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,539
be safe so let me talk a little bit

327
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,919
about collecting pollen I've got too

328
00:10:57,539 --> 00:11:01,019
many notes on the table here let me

329
00:10:58,919 --> 00:11:04,500
cover up this other page so I'm not so

330
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,639
distracted yes I do have the add big

331
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,500
shout out to the friend who made the

332
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,659
lemon Jeffrey concentrate it is working

333
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,820
bro anyway let's get back on track let's

334
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,559
talk about collecting pollen I can't

335
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,620
can't show you the plants because of

336
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:17,399
YouTube rules that's my first note here

337
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,220
the first thing I want to talk about

338
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:21,778
when it comes to collecting pollen is uh

339
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,920
know your male what are you working with

340
00:11:21,778 --> 00:11:24,480
do you know that that's a good male

341
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,639
where'd you get that make a good

342
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,100
decision there then the next thing I'm

343
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,319
going to talk about is ah no wind and no

344
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,519
disruptions and no sprays we don't want

345
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,440
a lot of wind in the room so you're

346
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:37,200
going to put your plant into flour and

347
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,339
around day 14 or day 17 maybe 21-ish

348
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,320
you're going to start getting a lot of

349
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:41,640
pollen we don't need any wind in the

350
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,200
room that's going to blow that pollen

351
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,578
right off of your plant you're not going

352
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
to be able to collect it we don't want

353
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,000
to spray anything in the room because

354
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,100
that of course is going to destroy the

355
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,778
pollen we don't want that basically no

356
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:53,339
disruptions to this plant try not to

357
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:55,320
nudge it bump it don't move it around

358
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,180
keep that male plant in the same place

359
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,700
so that it can basically build up a

360
00:11:57,179 --> 00:12:01,559
whole bunch of pollen for you to collect

361
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,300
all right so there are several ways to

362
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,518
collect the pollen let's jump into that

363
00:12:03,299 --> 00:12:07,259
part the first method that I'm going to

364
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,240
talk about is while the plant is still

365
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:11,220
alive and standing and then eventually

366
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,019
we will cut this plant down and talk

367
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,000
about other ways to gather the pollen

368
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:16,500
there the first way this plant is

369
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,120
standing you've got your growing plant

370
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,799
it is growing just like a normal plant

371
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,959
except this one's a boy it's got balls

372
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,519
all over it uh one thing you can do to

373
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:26,039
collect the pollen is to put a

374
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,440
collection vessel underneath the plant

375
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,599
I've seen people use a big mirror I've

376
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,100
seen people use dinner plates I've seen

377
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,139
people use just a sheet of glass

378
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,579
something like that underneath the plant

379
00:12:34,139 --> 00:12:37,199
that will collect the pollen that you

380
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:39,719
can scrape it up and scoop it up very

381
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,200
easily is a really good idea make sure

382
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:45,300
that whatever you use is non-static I've

383
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,820
seen people use like a little plate that

384
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:49,319
was plastic or a styrofoam plate and the

385
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,720
pollen actually fell out of the plant

386
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,519
and static electricity pushed that

387
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,139
pollen right away and we did not collect

388
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,539
any pollen at all because there was

389
00:12:55,139 --> 00:13:00,600
static on the plastic or styrofoam plate

390
00:12:57,539 --> 00:13:03,120
don't do that I recommend glass maybe a

391
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,620
Pyrex dish maybe a glass dinner plate if

392
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,019
you've got a big mirror that is perfect

393
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:09,240
so imagine that you just put the mirror

394
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,620
down and this is just an idea you put

395
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,419
the mirror Down Under the plant and then

396
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:13,799
you set the plant the whole pot right on

397
00:13:12,419 --> 00:13:15,599
top of that mirror then all of the

398
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,519
pollen that falls down will land right

399
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,500
on that mirror or that sheet of glass or

400
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,578
whatever you have chosen now that does

401
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,320
sound kind of sketchy because you're

402
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:23,879
putting a plant right onto the mirror if

403
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
you've got a small plant it's not a big

404
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,778
deal if you've got a thick mirror it's

405
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,458
not a big deal you got to run some risks

406
00:13:27,778 --> 00:13:31,980
if you want to win the game sometimes

407
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:33,659
now another thing we could talk about is

408
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,920
uh you just let that pollen fall right

409
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:36,600
onto that mirror so it'll start

410
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:38,219
pollinating it'll fall right down on

411
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,720
there another thing we can do is

412
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,339
sometimes I'll take a plan instead of

413
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,600
letting it grow straight up I'll just

414
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,220
grab it right in the middle and I'll put

415
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,040
a tie on it and I'll bend that plant

416
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,480
down maybe like uh 45 maybe a 90 degree

417
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:49,740
angle I'm not sure where my arm is right

418
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,379
now I'm not good with angles I guess

419
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,940
that's a 45. I'll put it at a 45 degree

420
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,860
angle and then we'll put the collection

421
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,180
vessel underneath that now the plant's

422
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,278
kind of tipped it's going to fall more

423
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:01,679
directly onto the vessel you don't have

424
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,539
the 360 following a pollen you got one

425
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:06,479
more long distance of pollen falling

426
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:07,799
maybe like a glass baking sheet a Pyrex

427
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,720
sheet or something like that would be

428
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,399
perfect to collect the pollen underneath

429
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,320
there so you can just let it grow and

430
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,320
that pile will start falling out that's

431
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,959
a really easy way to do it another way

432
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,760
that you could do it is to start tapping

433
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,259
the plant if you've got it growing

434
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,179
straight up or if you've got it tipped

435
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,559
over I go in there I honestly I'm a

436
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:27,359
drummer I've got drumsticks laying

437
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,278
around I go in with the drumstick and a

438
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,320
collection vessel usually a Pyrex dish

439
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,360
sometimes a jar and I'll just hold that

440
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,860
dish or that Pyrex dish or the jar right

441
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,600
up to the plant and I'll just start

442
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,860
tapping the plant the pollen Falls right

443
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,259
out into my dish I just use the

444
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,800
drumstick tap tap tap when you do this

445
00:14:40,259 --> 00:14:45,838
pollen is going to go everywhere I

446
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,000
recommend maybe wearing a mask maybe

447
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,440
covering up if you've got other plants

448
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,019
around that you don't want to pollinate

449
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,579
definitely take precautions for that you

450
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,259
may want to wet those plants while

451
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:57,000
you're messing with the pollen then

452
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,740
clean yourself up make sure that so

453
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,120
water deactivates pollen you guys if

454
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,440
you've got pollen on you in your

455
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,659
dreadlocks and your clothes and your

456
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,920
beard on your clothes wherever else I

457
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:07,019
haven't said on your shoes is where I

458
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,519
think I'm headed water will deactivate

459
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:09,839
that so you can get a pump spray or a

460
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:11,639
water bottle spray yourself down real

461
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,620
good or hop in the shower that will get

462
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,778
rid of all that active pollen also if

463
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,459
you spray down the plants the pistols

464
00:15:15,778 --> 00:15:18,958
are wet they are less likely to receive

465
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,479
the pollen at that time that should help

466
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,179
you out a little bit but be be very

467
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,339
careful because that pollen is very tiny

468
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,019
and one plate of pollen equals one seed

469
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:29,459
and you can get a bunch of pollen just

470
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,560
stuck in your dreadlocks and your arm

471
00:15:29,458 --> 00:15:33,479
hair and your clothes on your shoes it

472
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:35,638
does not take much so be very careful

473
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,620
with the pollen so as soon as you start

474
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:39,360
tapping that plant pollen is going to

475
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,698
start coming out and going flying a lot

476
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,800
of it will fall straight down tap gently

477
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:45,539
just enough maybe tap lower on the

478
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,698
branch tap down here and the pollen up

479
00:15:45,539 --> 00:15:50,458
here will start falling out don't be too

480
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:52,859
aggressive also don't have any fans on

481
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:55,679
don't breathe too heavily and definitely

482
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:57,720
do not sneeze because you will blow your

483
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:59,519
pollen all over the place all of your

484
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,040
work will be a waste of time that pollen

485
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,959
will go everywhere as long as this plant

486
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:06,958
is alive it will continue to produce

487
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:08,879
pollen up till probably week 10 week 11

488
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,500
whenever it starts burning out it'll

489
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,120
start good it'll go into senescence and

490
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,740
give up but you'll get plenty of fallen

491
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,659
out of it you can keep that plant

492
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:17,278
pollinating and just keep tapping it

493
00:16:15,659 --> 00:16:18,659
every few days and more pollen will come

494
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,698
out or leave your collection vessel

495
00:16:18,659 --> 00:16:22,679
underneath it and more pollen will land

496
00:16:20,698 --> 00:16:24,778
onto that glass plate or that Pyrex dish

497
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,120
if you've got it bent over more pollen

498
00:16:24,778 --> 00:16:29,220
will fall out I've seen guys just run a

499
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,320
ganja plant a male ganja plant in the

500
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:32,759
extra bathroom or in the window just in

501
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,920
the sunlight in the flowering season

502
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,919
right now outdoor season the plant would

503
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:39,479
go into flower within 21 days excuse me

504
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,159
within 21-ish days it would start

505
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,720
banging out pollen we could collect

506
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:44,639
pollen really easily just by putting a

507
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,199
plant in this window right here and give

508
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,698
it some time if we gave it a dark period

509
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:49,078
if we turned off all the all the lights

510
00:16:47,698 --> 00:16:50,698
in the house and just use the the

511
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,198
sunlight the natural sunlight so if you

512
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:53,939
put a plant in the bathroom close the

513
00:16:52,198 --> 00:16:55,740
door open the window let the sun

514
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:57,240
function on that it would make pollen

515
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,560
for you if it were a male it would begin

516
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,720
to make pollen for you you could collect

517
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,638
pollen that easily now we can continue

518
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,500
to collect pollen until we've got as

519
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,539
much as we need we do not need a lot

520
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,818
once you feel like this plant is done

521
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:11,338
now it is time to cut the plant down I

522
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:13,318
would gently carefully if you can try to

523
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:14,818
remove move the largest leaves from the

524
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:16,740
plant not a big deal if you can't do it

525
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,539
without disturbing the plant I'm kind of

526
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,859
a defoliation ninja I could just grab

527
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,240
with the thumb and the forefinger and

528
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,099
just take off the Leaf real easily it

529
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,660
just pops right off for me if you don't

530
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:26,698
have those ninja skills maybe you don't

531
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:28,620
do it but now is a good time to take off

532
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:31,019
some of the bigger leaves then I usually

533
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:32,699
get a Pyrex dish I've got a Pyrex dish

534
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,019
that my I don't even know where it came

535
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,819
from it probably used to be made to make

536
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:37,859
used to make brownies or some sort of

537
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:41,099
casserole I have commandeered it that is

538
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:43,558
now my pollen collection vessel it's

539
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:45,659
about probably 16 inches long and eight

540
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:47,700
or nine inches wide a beautiful pan to

541
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,679
go in the oven no longer that now it is

542
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,179
my pollen dish I usually take the top

543
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:53,220
off the plant or if it's a small plant

544
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,679
maybe I'll take the whole plant chop it

545
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,660
and gently lay that male plant into that

546
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,419
Pyrex dish and I will let it dry right

547
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:02,160
there as it dries more pollen will fall

548
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,900
out of it so it'll just fall all the

549
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,820
pollen comes out into that Pyrex dish

550
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,440
once I feel like it's super dry I'll

551
00:18:05,819 --> 00:18:09,058
kind of crunch the tops of my fingers

552
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,220
all the last bits of pollen will fall

553
00:18:09,058 --> 00:18:12,538
out I'll lift that male plant and I just

554
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,038
give it one one of these I kind of grab

555
00:18:12,538 --> 00:18:16,200
it at the base and use my fingers just

556
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,640
to kind of pull all the the pollen right

557
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,620
off of there into the dish to make sure

558
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,419
to get the last of it then I'll discard

559
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:23,699
that male plant he's done his job I've

560
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:26,400
got a dish with pollen in it now I let

561
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,440
that dry I want the pollen dry I'm gonna

562
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,960
say it again bone bone dry I said

563
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,000
earlier water will destroy your pollen

564
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,400
so at this point we want to get that

565
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,500
bone dry I would get tweezers I'd get

566
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,179
some sort of sifting device and pull out

567
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,038
all of the debris all of the male

568
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,538
flowers anything that is not pollen

569
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:45,839
needs to come out of here let it dry

570
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:47,879
really dry then put it in a container an

571
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,220
airtight dry container I prefer a glass

572
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,320
container maybe a glass vial with a

573
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,319
silicate pack I'm going to say it again

574
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,480
a silicate pack not a Boveda pack we

575
00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:59,279
want the package that sucks up the

576
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,500
moisture not maintains the humidity

577
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:04,619
level we want zero humidity in this

578
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:06,480
package so put a put a silicate pack in

579
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:08,339
there some people use rice to absorb the

580
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,160
moisture that may work for you I don't

581
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:13,500
know how much rice per pollen honestly I

582
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,538
don't do that at I use the silly kit

583
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,700
pack so put that in there to absorb the

584
00:19:15,538 --> 00:19:19,558
moisture and get your package super dry

585
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,600
before you seal it up then when you seal

586
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:24,240
it up I do recommend you put that in a

587
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,740
cool dry dark place I keep my pollen and

588
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,558
the crisper drawer in the refrigerator

589
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,660
and it seems to work for about two maybe

590
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,639
three or four sometimes up to six months

591
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:34,259
it depends on the pollen uh kind of

592
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,580
depends on I don't know I've had a lot

593
00:19:34,259 --> 00:19:37,558
of variables so I don't know what it

594
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:39,779
really depends on some of it stores real

595
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,339
well some of it just doesn't now the way

596
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,200
that I usually do this is I don't

597
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:45,058
generally collect a lot of pollen the

598
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,380
way that I usually do it is I will run

599
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,660
the male plant I'll run the female

600
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,460
plants I'll time them perfectly when it

601
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,840
is time for pollination I drag that boy

602
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,000
plant right to the middle of the room

603
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,259
and I give them a good shake and all

604
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,119
that pollen will come out and I'll watch

605
00:19:55,259 --> 00:20:00,298
that pollen go everywhere there are no

606
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,979
fans on I usually do it in the dark I

607
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:04,740
try not to breathe I try not to sneeze

608
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,960
let the pollination happen then I'll

609
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:08,880
wait four or five days let that pollen

610
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,919
build up again I'll go back in there

611
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,780
give them another Shake then when I'm

612
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,700
done Shake taking him I'll cut him down

613
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,918
and actually go and smack that male

614
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,360
plant either against the fan or against

615
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,740
the light I've got lights with the

616
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,659
shield right out of the glass up the

617
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,038
glass reflector right above it I'll hit

618
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,600
that light and the pollen just comes

619
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,160
raining down yeah it makes a little

620
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:28,319
extra cleanup there's pollen everywhere

621
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:30,298
I got to clean up anyway so I smack that

622
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,740
dead plant that I just cut it down I

623
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:33,599
smacked that plant right up against the

624
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,460
light all the pollen comes raining down

625
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,139
then I will discard that male plant

626
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,519
because I don't need it anymore but I

627
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,320
don't even keep the mail around I don't

628
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:41,940
collect the pollen I just cut them down

629
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,500
smack them around get the pollen

630
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:45,720
everywhere he's done his job and now

631
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,700
he's free to go now you've got pollen in

632
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,259
your collection vessel uh you've

633
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,460
probably stored it you've had in the

634
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:52,798
fridge for a little while now your

635
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,360
female plants are ready for pollination

636
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,160
let's talk about how to do that there

637
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:57,418
are several ways you could do it if

638
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,460
you've got a lot of pollen you could

639
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,038
just go in there and maybe turn off all

640
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:03,960
the fans and just go right above the uh

641
00:21:02,038 --> 00:21:05,220
right above the canopy and just open up

642
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,538
your pollen whatever it's in and just

643
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:08,339
give it a few Taps and just let some

644
00:21:06,538 --> 00:21:10,798
pollen just gently fall out you'll see

645
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:12,538
it just gently sprinkle the plants or if

646
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,819
you want to care fully pollinate one or

647
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:16,500
two branches you can get a Q-tip or a

648
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:18,599
paintbrush and you can pull the branch

649
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:20,339
down that you want maybe even pull that

650
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:22,379
plant out of the room and do this in a

651
00:21:20,339 --> 00:21:24,418
more isolated space take that female

652
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,860
plant take that pollen and just paint

653
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,140
the branches that you want with the

654
00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:29,879
pollen put a Q-tip or the paint brush

655
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,700
right into the pollen and then carefully

656
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,740
apply that pollen to the pistols of the

657
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,298
plant you want to pollinate then Mark

658
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,159
that Branch if you only do a couple of

659
00:21:36,298 --> 00:21:39,480
branches mark it keep an eye on that

660
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,980
Branch then when those seeds are ready

661
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,599
you know that they're right there in

662
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,759
that one those two branches that you

663
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:46,500
pollinated be very careful because I've

664
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:48,480
talked about how easy it is to

665
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,220
accidentally pollinate things if you

666
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,019
sneeze if you breathe too heavily if you

667
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,000
bump that jar if you bump the baggie

668
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:56,099
pollen will go flying around you may

669
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,259
accidentally pollinate things but if you

670
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,359
are careful you should be able to use a

671
00:21:58,259 --> 00:22:01,679
Q-tip a paintbrush something of that

672
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,879
nature and get in there and scoop a

673
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,159
little bit of pollen out of that

674
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,900
container and just apply it perfectly to

675
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,100
the plants or you could take it and you

676
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,538
could just sprinkle it right above the

677
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:12,000
plants I've seen guys pour it onto a

678
00:22:09,538 --> 00:22:13,859
piece of paper and just blow on it

679
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,240
but when you blow on it that [ __ ] goes

680
00:22:13,859 --> 00:22:17,399
everywhere it's gonna move more than you

681
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,900
expect it takes one or two test runs

682
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,880
maybe to figure out how hard to blow to

683
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:22,140
get the pollen to move but dump it onto

684
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,980
a little piece of paper and just give it

685
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,299
a

686
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,380
and just let it blow the reason you

687
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:27,418
don't go straight onto your hand you

688
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,880
guys is because your sweat will destroy

689
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,500
the pawl and that moisture will has the

690
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,059
opportunity the potential to destroy

691
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:35,038
your pollen so let me make sure that

692
00:22:33,058 --> 00:22:37,440
I've answered most of the question here

693
00:22:35,038 --> 00:22:38,879
uh collect the pollen tap it just bend

694
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,038
the plant over and tap it and collect

695
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,299
that [ __ ] or let the plant get finished

696
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,339
up cut it down when you've got enough

697
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:46,558
pollen and then start [ __ ] smacking

698
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:48,058
that plant on flowers or put in a

699
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,759
container collect the pollen that way

700
00:22:48,058 --> 00:22:52,678
get the pollen super dry that is one of

701
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,538
the most important parts here

702
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,840
um use a silicate pack do not use a

703
00:22:54,538 --> 00:23:00,179
Boveda pack dry the pollen then use a

704
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,939
paintbrush or a Q-tip to apply the

705
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:04,620
pollen to the branches that you want to

706
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:06,960
pollinate when you have successful

707
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:08,399
pollination you will see the pistols

708
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,019
kind of curl in the pistols look like

709
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,940
the dandelions the hairs you guys call

710
00:23:10,019 --> 00:23:13,740
them that part is sticking out when you

711
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,600
put pollen on there that part will curl

712
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:18,000
up and turn brown and get withered that

713
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,439
is a sign of successful pollination pay

714
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
attention to the parts you've pollinated

715
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,700
over the next few weeks watch the

716
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,200
development around 4 5 6 six weeks in

717
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,700
some plants go faster than others you

718
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,220
guys I can't tell you exactly how long

719
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,480
it will take four five six weeks in

720
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,819
you'll start seeing the seeds getting

721
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,740
harder around five or six weeks start

722
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:36,178
pulling one or two out randomly and just

723
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,159
squeezing them and see how hard they are

724
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:40,140
around week seven or week eight they'll

725
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,299
definitely be ready by then you'll have

726
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:43,620
a nice batch of seeds the way I harvest

727
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:45,058
seeds we'll just quickly do this since

728
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:47,279
we're here I've done a full show on it

729
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:49,619
but we'll go quickly when I harvest for

730
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:51,418
seed right before Harvest time I do a

731
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:53,038
heavy defoliation we don't need all

732
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,919
those leaves in there

733
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:58,200
also I turn my lights back to 18-6

734
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,720
shortly after pollination to speed up

735
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,640
the time to get the seeds ripe but I'm

736
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,319
getting ahead of myself I chop I heavily

737
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,179
defoliate I chop down the plants I hang

738
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,918
them upside down I let them get

739
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,900
completely dry before I even mess with

740
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,460
these plants they are bone dry if you're

741
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:13,679
trying to grow weed and smoke this weed

742
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,019
it's going to be dust this is useless so

743
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,400
I let it get bone bone dry then I take

744
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,798
that plant and I put it into a big

745
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,080
sterilite container and I use a glove

746
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:23,579
and I just pull all of the buds off the

747
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,259
sticks I just yank the sticks right out

748
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:27,178
of it so the buds land in this container

749
00:24:25,259 --> 00:24:28,859
it sounds like seeds and rocks hitting

750
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:30,538
the container then I put on rubber

751
00:24:28,859 --> 00:24:32,519
gloves again and I grind all that butt

752
00:24:30,538 --> 00:24:33,839
up with my hands until I've got just a

753
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:34,980
pile it looks like we're going to roll a

754
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,538
bunch of joints and there's a bunch of

755
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,058
seeds in it and a bunch of joint

756
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:40,740
material then I will run that through a

757
00:24:39,058 --> 00:24:42,178
seed sorting machine and I do have a

758
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,159
seed sorting machine that makes it very

759
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:45,538
easy if you've got a lot of seeds I

760
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,580
would recommend investing in that it

761
00:24:45,538 --> 00:24:49,319
will save you a lot of time if not there

762
00:24:47,579 --> 00:24:50,879
are a lot of ways to go about sorting

763
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,099
the seeds but that is how I harvest I

764
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,500
defoliate cut them down let them hang

765
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:57,359
get them dry as [ __ ] and then once

766
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,859
they're dry as [ __ ] I just do this and

767
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:00,899
crumble them up until I've got joint

768
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:02,819
rolling material pull out all the sticks

769
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,440
pull out all the junk then pull out all

770
00:25:02,819 --> 00:25:05,939
the seeds honestly the rest of that

771
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,220
material has been so beat up that it

772
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,259
goes into the compost bin or the bokashi

773
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,880
bucket I do not even use it that may

774
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:13,140
offend a lot of people but it is garbage

775
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,539
at this point there's so much

776
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,340
chlorophyll and just junk and dust in it

777
00:25:15,538 --> 00:25:20,759
that you don't even want it all right I

778
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:22,980
think I've covered the best part of my

779
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:25,798
pollination and collecting pollen uh

780
