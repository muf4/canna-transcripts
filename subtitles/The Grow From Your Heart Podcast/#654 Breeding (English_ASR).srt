73
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,039
episode

74
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:15,039

time none of the information really got

82
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,878
lost there was one jump cut

83
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,239

84
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,280

89
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:36,958
multi-cam journey with me we're learning

90
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,799
together somebody told me a long time

91
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,560
ago they were worried about all of the

92
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,000
uh technical additions to the show they

93
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,039
didn't want it to take away from the

94
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,120
podcast

95
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,639
i'm not going to let it take away from

96
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
the main focus of the show which is

97
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:49,439
teaching you

98
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,040
uh sharing my knowledge with you on how

99
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:52,000
to grow quality cannabis how to improve

100
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,840
your garden

101
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,519
uh today we're gonna focus on breeding i

102
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,680
got a great question about breeding

103
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,120
a lot of people ask me about breeding uh

104
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,360
and it's time to talk more about it so

105
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,039
we're gonna do that in just a moment

106
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,120
obviously i'm stoned and rambly today

107
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,878
but i won't let all the new gear

108
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,239
uh distract me from the focus of the

109
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:09,598
show i write the show

110
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,200
i do all the stuff on the computer on

111
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,238
the paper i do all that then we play

112
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,479
with all the gear

113
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,319
i've just added a step i don't let it

114
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,439
take from the previous steps i just

115
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:18,958
added more to it

116
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:20,318
i think it's going to go well it's

117
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,080
always got to keep evolving getting

118
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,439
better or it will get stale

119
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,280
got to keep moving forward you guys

120
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:26,400
can't stay where we were right move

121
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,318
forward do what you can do

122
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,680
all right i should move forward and quit

123
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,759
talking about the same thing

124
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,959
this episode will come out right after 7

125
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,120
10 7 10

126
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,280
snuck up on me this year there aren't

127
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,959
any major cannabis events going on in my

128
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,199
area that i'm aware of

129
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,799
uh no vending opportunities no major

130
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,318
consumption opportunities we just came

131
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,879
out of a really weird time here in the

132
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:46,639
world

133
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:48,399
so nobody really prepared anything for

134
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,399
the 710 event there is a

135
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,080
another non-cannabis related event i

136
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,239
will be attending on 7 10

137
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,599
i'm probably the only dab cadet in there

138
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,239
everybody else will be there for another

139
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:58,318
thing

140
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,360
uh but yeah 7 10 snuck up on me when you

141
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,199
hear this it will be

142
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
post 710. i hope everybody had a

143
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,719
wonderful beautiful 710 i hope you

144
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,479
stocked up on concentrates

145
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:08,080
uh they will sell out quickly this time

146
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,560
of year the places where you go to get

147
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
your dabs may not have dabs because 710

148
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,959
is coming

149
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:14,639
really quickly if you don't know about

150
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,399
710 we'll just ramble on to that one for

151
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,959
a moment i have done a full podcast

152
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,279
episode

153
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
one year ago did a full episode about

154
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:22,239
710

155
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,439
i bust out a bunch of equipment i should

156
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,040
probably do that again now that i'm

157
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:26,478
doing two cameras maybe get another

158
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,280
camera and do that one

159
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:31,199
but 7 if you flip the number 710 upside

160
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,758
down it actually says the word oil

161
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,680
so 710 is a good time to smoke oil we

162
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,319
take dabs now at 7 10. a lot of people

163
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,319
smoke

164
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,599
flowers or a joint or a blunt or a bong

165
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,719
rip at 4 20.

166
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,199
now 7 10 is when you smoke some dabs 710

167
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,919

710 that light right there is making my

176

182
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,038
going to delve too far into this topic

183
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,240
this is

184
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:13,599
everybody's heard about it every

185
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,639
cannabis consumer has heard about what

186
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
happened to

187
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,840
the lovely shikari richardson a uh an

188
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,560
olympic

189
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,839
runner has been uh basically stopped

190
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,120
from running not allowed to run in

191
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,839
certain events because

192
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,639
she failed a cannabis drug test that's

193
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,799
right she had weed in her system

194
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,720
the place where she consumed cannabis

195
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,400
cannabis was legal at the time or she

196
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,080
consumed it it was legal there

197
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,079
she was in a place where she could smoke

198
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:39,279
cannabis she also had a family member

199
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,439
just passed away i believe it may have

200
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,959
been her mom just passed away

201
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,160
i know god i don't even want to think

202
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,758
about that moment but i'm going to smoke

203
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,800
some cannabis when my mom passes i

204
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,759
promise you

205
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,120
ah but uh the person was just doing life

206
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
and where they were life was

207
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,959
happening and that was legal and because

208
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,919
they're an olympic athlete because they

209
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:57,599
did something that was a

210
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:59,279
was legal where they were now they can't

211
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,919
compete in an event

212
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:03,439
um that's [ __ ] it's kind of shitty

213
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,719
that somebody can't compete because of

214
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,560
cannabis use

215
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,759
also i have friends who are athletes i

216
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,360
hang out with a couple yeah

217
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,280
i'm not an athlete myself at all but i

218
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,639

219
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,918

an athlete he's competed in uh major

225
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,840
events i think he may have been in an

226
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,800
olympic he was a he's a wrestler the

227
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:27,839
dude's a wrestler

228
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,240
uh his brother was a ufc fighter uh they

229
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,758
said

230
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,759
that when you are in these types of

231
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,360
events that it's not just a paper

232
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,038
contract you don't just read paper and

233
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,879
you sign [ __ ] and say that's the rules

234
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,000
there's a meeting there's a discussion

235
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:39,600
people talk to you

236
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,199
and they put it into your head lots of

237
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
times there is no

238
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,400
cannabis use while you were under this

239
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,479
contract

240
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,239
yeah cannabis may be legal in colorado

241
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:48,800
oregon california wherever you want to

242
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,478
go

243
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,160
that it's legal it may be legal there

244
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,478
but if you choose to be

245
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,840
an olympic runner you are forfeiting

246
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:57,519
that this is your new

247
00:06:55,839 --> 00:06:59,279
thing your new contract this rule

248
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:00,639
supersedes all of those rules

249
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,799
you can't do it just like if you want

250
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,319
some jobs you have to pass a drug test

251
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,759
you can't do certain jobs if you want to

252
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,840
be a cannabis consumer

253
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,038
the olympics are the same way so there

254
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,359
is kind of a

255
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:13,120
being a person who wants freedom and

256
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,560
free cannabis and legalized cannabis and

257
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,399
let's all smoke and have a good time and

258
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,000
i feel that athletes need cannabis

259
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:19,439
just as much if not more than anybody

260
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,399
they're struggling their bodies hurt

261
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,478
they're under

262
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,918
strain mentally and physically all day

263
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:25,199
long they need something to calm down

264
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,478
make themselves feel better i think it

265
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,800
feels good

266
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,318
when i move heavy stuff after i take a

267
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,520
dab after that i don't feel like i moved

268
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,960
a bunch of heavy stuff

269
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,799
i think athletes should be allowed to

270
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,638
consume i think everybody should be

271
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
allowed to consume responsibly

272
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,879
but she did sign a paper she did shake

273
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,000
hands and say i won't do that my job

274
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,319
depends on it so

275
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,439
that's kind of a 50 50 i'm torn between

276
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,720
that how i feel on it was her

277
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,639
responsibility to

278
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,919
not get caught consuming cannabis is

279
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,160
what that was uh

280
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:54,079
she was gonna do it don't get caught so

281
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,240
um that was her responsibility but

282
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,279
where i'm leading to that i do want to

283
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,960
give a shout out

284
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,399
to one of her sponsors if you know my

285
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,918
personal life if you know me if you pay

286
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:03,758
attention my social media you know i'm a

287
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:06,560
big old sneakerhead

288
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,919
quarantine covid the lockdown got me

289
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,439
bored i wasn't allowed to go anywhere

290
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,359
usually i go to a comedy show or a

291
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,000
concert every single weekend if not two

292
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
or three of those

293
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
a week during covet i wasn't going

294
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,878
anywhere we were sitting here

295
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
zooming and being on a zoom video was

296
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,879
not enough for me

297
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,720
i developed a ridiculous sneaker

298
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,319
addiction that's right i've got

299
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,840
we won't go too far into that because it

300
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,120
could be a problem i may need an

301
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,799
intervention

302
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,800
find me up on intervention taking away

303
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,120
my sneakers uh but i wanted to give a

304
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,680
shout out to nike because nike is

305
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
shikari richardson's official sponsor

306
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,958
and

307
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,038
nike did not revoke their sponsorship

308
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,958
which i think is kind of cool

309
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,600
in this uh day and age i feel like such

310
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,679
an old guy when i say that

311
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,278
your sponsors bail out if you say

312
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:51,278
something wrong very quickly your

313
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,200
sponsors cancel you and forget about you

314
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,600
very quickly if you make the wrong move

315
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
and for nike to support uh they're in

316
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,399

for nike to support this in dorsey like

320
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,679
that and not drop them not fire them not

321
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,279
pull any ads not take any funding not

322
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,879

323
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:09,838

353
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,040
show know that but i'm sure there's a

354
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
few people out there that have no idea

355
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:02,559
that i even make seeds that's just

356
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,240
something that may have not gotten to

357

359
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:09,919
i'm fairly well known for my breeding

360
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,360
technique my breeding methods my methods

361
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,039
are tried and trued i've got

362
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,320
a couple of male plants a few male

363
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:15,679
plants have passed through my stable

364
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,120
that have been proven to be studs i've

365
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,159
got a very uh

366
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,159
reliable selection of female plants um

367
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,159
and my breeding skills have been proven

368
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,000
uh and i think i'm breeding

369
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,078
with purpose and from a good place so i

370
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
feel like i can give you a good little

371
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,958
rundown on breeding and a lot of people

372
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,079
have been asking for it is where i think

373
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,599
i was headed with that

374
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,199
a lot of people have been asking me for

375
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,519
breeding tips and i don't talk about it

376
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,519
a lot on the show honestly because

377
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,679
i wanted to make sure to give all of the

378
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,839
basic grow tips first i mean i need you

379
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,719
you need to be able to grow it's not you

380
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,240
don't need i guess you

381
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,000
it's better if i shouldn't say need

382
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
because you can pull off seeds no matter

383
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,639
what if you try

384
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,078
uh it's better if you know how to grow

385
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,759
if you understand the plant before you

386
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:55,199
start breeding you shouldn't

387
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,639
in my opinion just start breeding right

388
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,079
away have a good relationship with the

389
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,838
plant understand how it grows

390
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,519
understand the functions of the plant

391
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,640
then understand what you're looking for

392
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,078
in breeding build

393
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,679
just have a good foundation so i wanted

394
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,838
you to get that before i started doing

395
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:10,000
too much about breeding also

396
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,839
my business is breeding that's part of

397
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
what that's how i survive so why do i

398
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,079
want to teach everybody else how to

399
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,839
breed but at this point

400
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,359
i'm very insecure with my role in the

401
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,720
breeding community with my role in the

402
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
cannabis community i can teach you how

403
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,879
to breed

404
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,240
i'm going to do my thing forever it's

405
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,519
not going to push me out of a job out of

406
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,360
the market or anything like that so i'm

407
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,120
willing to share my knowledge

408
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,039
grow from your heart breed with love

409
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,639
let's uh cut me off of this [ __ ]

410
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:31,599
ramble fest and let's actually jump into

411
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:34,159
this email

412
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,839
and we'll set up this part of the show

413
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,559

414
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,640

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,000

companies now that's gonna get my

433
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,240
attention because this is a breeding

434
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
question

435
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,278
before i even get to the breeding part

436
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,760
let me ramble about this

437
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,360
if you work for a big company that has

438
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,519
plants that are in flower

439
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,440
and you are breeding at home it is your

440
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,159
responsibility as the grower slash

441
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
breeder

442
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,399
slash person with all the plans do not

443
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,559
pollinate that commercial grow if you

444
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,039
grow at work that's a commercial grow

445
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:35,278
do not contaminate that grow with pollen

446
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,360
they are relying on that crop to pay

447
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,278
your bills your rent comes from that

448
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,120
crop the patients the customers the

449
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,399
consumers don't want that crop seeded

450
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,440
because you decided

451
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,799
to be a a new breeder a pollen chucker

452
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,720
at home if you

453
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,639
successfully breed some seeds without

454
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
contaminating that crop at work

455
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,879
we'll call you a breeder if you [ __ ] up

456
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
and pollinate that entire crop at work

457
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:57,919
you're a shitty pollen chucker and you

458
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,519
didn't do your job right so

459
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,439
the first thing you need to do is make

460
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,159
sure in my opinion the first thing you

461
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,880
should do

462
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,719
maybe need to do i try not to use words

463
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,320
like should and need but

464
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,160
this i feel like it's appropriate you

465
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,320
you need to make sure

466
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,838
you should make sure not to pollinate

467
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
that big commercial grow people are

468
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,240
relying on that to be seedless

469
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:19,039
top shelf quality bud don't seed that

470
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,560
[ __ ] up

471
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,559
so now once you're sure you're not gonna

472
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,518
seed up that grow then we can talk more

473
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,039
about breeding

474
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,720
uh there are several ways to make sure

475
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,319
you don't seed that grow up change your

476
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
clothes a lot wash your hair

477
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,600
water deactivates pollen anytime you're

478
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
around that male plant when he's

479
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,159
pollinating

480
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,839
just squirt yourself down with pollen

481
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,278
change your clothes have

482
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,199
clothes that you go in the grow room

483
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,439
with and your personal grow

484
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:43,039
then grow clothes that you don't wear in

485
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,920
the grow so you come out of the grill

486
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,599
you change clothes

487
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:46,879
possibly take a shower between those

488
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
clothes if you have time if it's

489
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,120
possible

490
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,679
come out of the grow change clothes put

491
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,679
on fresh clothes then go to work and put

492
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,638
on different clothes at that growth so

493
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,399
you're using

494
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,159
different clothes in that grow different

495
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,278
clothes at home and different clothes in

496
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,439
your home grow

497
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,519
it sounds tedious it sounds ridiculous

498
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,480
but with the experiments you're trying

499
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,000
to play

500
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,839
with and the money you're putting at

501
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,120
risk at that commercial grow it is what

502
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,519
is necessary

503
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,360
everything from the hat to the shoes

504
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,240
need to be different don't take those

505
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,480
same shoes in your grow that you do to

506
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,759
the commercial grow that should be the

507
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,600
rule of thumb anyway you don't want to

508
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,838
move those bugs around and if you're

509
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,440
getting in the car you're leaving work

510
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,639
getting in the car those bugs are riding

511
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
home with you you're bringing them into

512
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,039
the house

513
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,959
you should change clothes take a shower

514
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,000
at that point then go into your grow in

515
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,759
different clothes

516
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,399
it's really hard to keep it all separate

517
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,319
but do the best that you can

518
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,440
keep that pollen away from the other

519
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,360
grow

520
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,040
really don't [ __ ] up that grow so i want

521
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,320
to finish this message but

522
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,159
that really stands out when you say i

523
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,720
want to breed at home and i'm working at

524
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:48,559
a company

525
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,399
that's going to set off a lot of alarms

526
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,439
for a lot of people don't tell anybody

527
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,120
at the commercial grow that you're

528
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,920
breeding at home

529
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,198
because if one seed pops up they're all

530
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,639
going to blame you they're gonna be like

531
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:00,319
it's that pollen chucker that's breeding

532
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,240
at home he just seeded everything it's

533
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,519
all gonna be your fault

534
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,440
all right there is more of this message

535
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,240
it says now i'm deciding i want to try

536
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,920
out breeding at a personal level at home

537
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,519
is there a previous episode number you

538
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:12,078
can point me to for the best breeding

539
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,600
guide

540
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,599
i've actually listened to two episodes

541
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,000
about breeding terms but i'm curious

542
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
if you have a more of a guide formatted

543
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
episode

544
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,160
already thanks again for everything much

545
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,560
love

546
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,919
uh do they say their name they don't say

547
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,958
that they want their name said so they

548
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,000
know who they are they don't need their

549
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,679
name said on this episode

550
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,120
but they've got a great question let's

551
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:33,919
talk a little bit about breeding i do

552
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,519
not have

553
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,278
a previous episode where i talk

554
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,159
specifically about breeding i do talk

555
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:39,759
about

556
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,519
pollination times i've talked a couple

557
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,639
of times about male selection which i'll

558
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,240
touch on here

559
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,680
uh but i don't think i've done the

560
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,159
episode that i owe you

561
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,278
for good breeding so i'm gonna take a

562
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:50,399
sip of my drink here because i'm sure

563
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:51,759
you could hear it in my throat

564
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,759
after i get a little moisture on the

565
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,680
face here we will talk about breeding

566
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,680
hang out here we go let's talk about

567
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,958
breeding cannabis uh the main thing one

568
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,519
of the main things to think about

569
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,439
is if you're gonna breed do you want to

570
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,799
pollinate all of the plants or just a

571
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,720
couple of plants because

572
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,479
uh pollen is hard to control if you

573
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,160
don't have some experience and a plan

574
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,879
there are ways to control the pollen but

575
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,799
if you're new

576
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,639
if you don't have some some strategy in

577
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,479
place you could really mess up

578
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,680
like i mentioned earlier do not

579
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,079
pollinate your work

580
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:21,599
grow do not pollinate your friends grow

581
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,519
do not pollinate the grow down the

582
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,519
street think about that sort of stuff be

583
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,360
kind to the people around you

584
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,959
a lot of people are growing cannabis now

585
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,240
and a lot of people are relying on that

586
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:31,838
for medicine

587
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,120
a lot of people are also growing hemp

588
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,519
all over the place so you've got to

589
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,679
worry about getting pollinated as well

590
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,919
from other sources so i would recommend

591
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:40,879
only breeding indoors or in a greenhouse

592
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:42,719
of some sort

593
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,720
i don't really trust outdoor breeding

594
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,600
because if some guy down the street gets

595
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,360
a male he may breed with me on accident

596
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,759
breed with my plants on accident sounds

597
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,039
better that way okay

598
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,680
one of the main things to think about

599
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:57,519
when breeding is what is your goal do

600
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:58,958
you have a goal or are you just pollen

601
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,799
chucking if you're just pollen chucking

602
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,159
that is fun too but it's much better

603
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,879
much more fulfilling

604
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,599
much more rewarding and uh much more

605
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
successful

606
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,639
if you have a goal how do you even know

607
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,000
if you were successful if you didn't

608
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,679
have a goal if you're just

609
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,880
putting plant a and plant b in a room

610
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,679
together and putting pollen on the

611
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,039
plants and

612
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,038
letting it happen and then growing the

613
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:18,959
seeds that's fun but

614
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,640
it was their success in it what was your

615
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,519
goal did you have something in mind did

616
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,079
you want to do something

617
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:27,119
are you making seeds for do you intend

618
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,960
to eventually be

619
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,399
a commercial seed producer will these

620
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,840
seeds be put to market

621
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,440
are you going to make seeds to give to

622
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,720
your friends are you going to sell them

623
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,320
you're going to pass them out at trade

624
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,000
shows are they going to be gifts are

625
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:39,200
these are they something you intend on

626
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,279
making to give to

627
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,279
disabled veterans who can't afford seeds

628
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,960
or um

629
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,319
i don't know there's some random group i

630
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,200
was trying to think of some random group

631
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,558
with like

632
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,558
a bunch of random names but then it

633
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:52,879
almost got offensive in my head like

634
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,480
um just random people from a random

635
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,160
place that do random things that enjoy a

636
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,880
certain thing all those together in one

637
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,558
group are you

638
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,240
specifically finding seeds for those

639
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:01,359
people who can't afford them

640
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,720
whatever you're doing with the seeds

641
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:04,159
what is your goal or are you just going

642
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,759
to grow them at your house on your own

643
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,519
or in your commercial grow on your own

644
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,079
what's your goal for the seeds

645
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:11,759
think about what your goal is it's all

646
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,480
about a goal a lot of things

647
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,079
in productivity of any sort it's all

648
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,519
about your goal you can't get to the

649
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,199
destination to the end

650
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,639
without a good goal from the very

651
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,840
beginning so when we're breeding when

652
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,919
we're making seeds

653
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,038
let's have a goal one of the first goals

654
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,640
to think of is

655
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,038
what am i breeding for who are these

656
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,400
seeds going to how big is this going to

657
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:31,839
get so think about that from the

658
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,440
beginning and kind of be prepared for

659
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,119
that from the start

660
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:39,919
then your next goal is to improve upon

661
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,359
the cannabis species not just to make

662
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,120
this strain and this strain because you

663
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:44,639
want to name it the two strains together

664
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,918
would make a really clever name and you

665
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
want to make a million dollars off a

666
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,440
cool strain name

667
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,038
the cool strain name will get you so far

668
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,320
but once people grow those seeds and

669
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,640
realize that they suck because you

670
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:56,159
didn't do any proper selection

671
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,000
then that strain sucks and now you got a

672
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,840
really popular strain name that is known

673
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,079
for putting out shitty plants so that

674
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:05,599
that's not the way to do it have a goal

675
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,759
improve upon the species

676
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,918
maybe you've got something that tastes

677
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,119
really good but it lacks potency maybe

678
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,880
you've got something that is super

679
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,558
potent that doesn't taste good

680
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,720
maybe you want to improve upon that

681
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,160
thing somehow then you need to find

682
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,519
a prob i guess you're gonna have a

683
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,558
female if you're smoking it then you

684
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:22,480
need to find a male

685
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,160
that is going to improve upon that

686
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,038
female when they breed if you breed them

687
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,400
together

688
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,558
and you just make something that is

689
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,000
worse or not better than both of the

690
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:31,678
plants you started with

691
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,038
you didn't really breed successfully in

692
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,600
my opinion unless

693
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:36,960
your goal was to isolate one trait if

694
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,558
you don't care about

695
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,919
the potency and the way that it grows

696
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:40,319
you're just looking for straight up that

697
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,240
one

698
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,319
sour mango terp and that's all you're

699
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,120
breeding for you can do that but

700
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:48,319
i want potency vigor things that people

701
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:51,359
often forget about

702
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:53,200
is stuff like pest resistance pathogen

703
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,159
resistance cold resistance drought

704
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,160
resistance

705
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,400
how does it handle temperature swings

706
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:01,279
diurnal swings humidity swings

707
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,519
does it take stress well because i put a

708
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,839
lot of my plants in a commercial grow

709
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:07,200
and no disrespect to the ladies and

710
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:08,798
gentlemen of the commercial grow but

711
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,400
sometimes they're overworked and they're

712
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,158
stressed and they party too hard on the

713
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
weekend or whatever is going on and the

714
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,360
plants have a little uh

715
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,119
they don't get taken care of as much as

716
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,798
they could of maybe saturday and sunday

717
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,319
the weekend crew might be hungover or

718
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:20,798
whatever and the plants deal with some

719
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,639
stress

720
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:24,400
i need them to survive that stress in

721
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,720
the commercial grow also

722
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
i sell seeds commercially people that

723
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,400
have never grown before are getting my

724
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,080
seeds i want them to have great success

725
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,480
and they're going to beat these plants

726
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,158
up

727
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,159
so it's all about selection we need

728
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,760
plants that are going to survive

729
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,760
drought stress problems uh being popped

730
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,119
and twisted and manipulated

731
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,798
a lot of these things are going to be

732
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,479
delivered by the male plan a lot of

733
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,558
these traits come from the male

734
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,400
side of this equation and a lot of

735
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,279
people are only breeding for

736
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,840
flavor aroma we call we call it in the

737
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,839
industry

738
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,519
instagram ability can you post this

739
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,480
plant like is it going to look good is

740
00:20:57,519 --> 00:21:00,240
it going to sell through

741
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,919
instagram but then when you get it in

742
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,558
your garden like i said a minute ago you

743
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,000
grow it

744
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,918
and it just grows like [ __ ] it grows

745
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,440
real skinny and it falls over

746
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,038
and one of the buds at the top is

747
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,798
beautiful it's [ __ ] purple it's got

748
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,839
red leaves coming off of it instagram

749
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:13,359
goes ape [ __ ]

750
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:15,678
but it doesn't grow worth the [ __ ] and

751
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:16,079
when you smoke it the buzz is miserable

752
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,759
and

753
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,839
there's no good flavor to it it just

754
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:21,359
looks really good it hit a good lab test

755
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:23,038
because it's got a lot of trichomes on

756
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:26,079
it but there's nothing good about it

757
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,839
other than paper and instagram so breed

758
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,079
for the right stuff have a goal

759
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,359
improve upon the plant and don't just be

760
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:32,720
pollen chucking and they're just a

761
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,119
pollen chuck so

762
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
uh selection is key i talked about a lot

763
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,558
of the resistance path

764
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,320
uh pest and pathogen we're just gonna

765
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,798
call that peth that's my new word right

766
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,079
now

767
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:46,000
uh pest and pathogen resistance comes

768
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,279
from the male a lot of that comes from

769
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,599
the male so

770
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:51,519
a good male is key to a good breeding

771
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,119
project male selection is very important

772
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:54,240
i've done full episodes on mail

773
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:57,519
selection

774
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,599
but selecting the mail let's talk about

775
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,319
choosing a male it's all about your goal

776
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,918
do you want to make uh indica or sativa

777
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:05,439
dominant plants do you want to make

778
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,038
tall skinny plants do you want to make

779
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,400
short squatty plants do you want to make

780
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,079
plants that flower

781
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,759
in 50 days do you want to make plants

782
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,000
that flower in 70 days do you want to

783
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,038
make

784
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,279
plants that flower in 142 days shout out

785
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:18,480
to my buddy lemur priest for his 140 day

786
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,359
finishers

787
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,558
um what do you want to make you've got

788
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,678
to choose a male

789
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:26,079
that will contribute those traits to the

790
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,519
mix

791
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,439
of course he's only going to give 50

792
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,119
percent maybe that's something else

793
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,200
we're going to talk about in a moment

794
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:34,639
he's only going to give about 50 of his

795
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
traits to this cross

796
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,799
what is he shaped like what does he

797
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,640
smell like find a male that has

798
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:42,240
traits that you want to work with this

799
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,080
is kind of like chefing

800
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,919
this male is one of your ingredients but

801
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:46,480
we've only got two ingredients to work

802
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,159
with

803
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,679
so what does this male bring to the

804
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,360
table are we mixing

805
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,798
uh what are two flavors that are good

806
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:54,479
together um

807
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:56,558
chocolate and anything right chocolate

808
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,798
and strawberries would be good together

809
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,399
um what else is good together i'm just

810
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,240
trying to think of random [ __ ] now but

811
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,600
like savory stuff together is always

812
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,960
good but then if you go and mix

813
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,319
two of the wrong things together

814
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,480
sometimes it just doesn't [ __ ] taste

815
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:09,519
good that's how breeding is also

816
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,038
you got to have the right two

817
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:12,798
ingredients if you mix the two bad

818
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:13,359
ingredients together it's just not gonna

819
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:14,798
work

820
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,719
you can't put ketchup and milk in the

821
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,000
same bottle and expect that to be good

822
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,720
sometimes breeding goes that way

823
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,599
so find a male with the features that

824
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,120
you're looking for

825
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:28,879
shape structure leaf size leaf shape

826
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:30,558
colors does that male plant put out

827
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,200
colors are you looking for a plant that

828
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,599
turns

829
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,200
dark colors red colors purple colors

830
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,439
look for a male plant that exhibits

831
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,000
those traits in the leaves

832
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,840
flowering time we don't want i

833
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,079
personally don't want a male

834
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,918
that takes way too long to flower but i

835
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,079
also don't want a male that shows me

836
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,440
flower too early

837
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:51,519
something i mentioned this is a good

838
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,960
segue into that uh

839
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:56,079
if a male plant flowers too early in my

840
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,120
opinion

841
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,720
he contributes too much of himself to

842
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:03,359
the breeding mix

843
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,278
my goal in breeding most of the time is

844
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,639
to find a male and a female that when

845
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:08,720
they breed together

846
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
you can find a perfect balance of the

847
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,079
male and female

848
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:14,399
in the offspring you'll see offspring

849
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,599
that look just like mommy just like

850
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,320
daddy and then you'll see some that

851
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,399
you'll say

852
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,240
man i see mommy's growth structure in

853
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,919
there it smells just like daddy it does

854
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,079
that stretching thing that mommy does it

855
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,320
does the leaf shape of the daddy plant

856
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,480
that is my goal is to find a male that

857
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:30,639
doesn't overpower the female

858
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,720
but still puts enough of itself into

859
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,799
that cross to make the females different

860
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,079
and off to make the offspring different

861
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,918
and something new so i don't want a male

862
00:24:38,079 --> 00:24:42,639
plant that flowers right away

863
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,400
if i have if i get a 10 pack most people

864
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,960
buy a 10 pack of seeds if you've got 10

865
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
seeds

866
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,000
you're most likely going to find

867
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,159
somewhere between four and six

868
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,679
males in there for the sake of my story

869
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,120
we're gonna say you've got five male

870
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,960
plants the girls are doing their thing

871
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:57,519
we're gonna talk about the boys

872
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,400
that first male plant to flower is way

873
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,319
too eager

874
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,919
he's like i want a flower here we go i

875
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,639
don't want to breed with him

876
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,120
i think the offspring he makes is going

877
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,278
to be

878
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,639
mostly like him it's going to be shaped

879
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:09,759
like him it's going to have the leaf

880
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,520
structure

881
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:13,278
the build and it's going to flower too

882
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,960
quickly if that plant gets root bound if

883
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,400
that plant doesn't get enough light

884
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,480
it's got an uh what's the word

885
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,320
propensity um wow

886
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,360
big words for me today i'm not even sure

887
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,319
if that's the right [ __ ] word but

888
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,719
we're going with it

889
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:26,240
uh it could flower early because that

890
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,278
male plant that i used was an

891
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,480
early flowering plant if i've got five i

892
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:32,880
generally choose

893
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,839
the third or fourth male to go into

894
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,919
flower and start

895
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:37,359
showing me hey i'm a strong male

896
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,038
flowering plant i want to see big

897
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,798
stamens coming off of it i want to see

898
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,558
rapid growth into flower

899
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,319
that fourth or fifth one will be the

900
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,918
winner sometimes that's not

901
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,000
the third or fourth will probably be the

902
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,919
keeper uh that is not

903
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
hard and fast but that is kind of a rule

904
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,240
of thumb and i i kind of have an eye

905
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,359
when i'm popping seeds i can see early

906
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,278
early on

907
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:59,359
early in veg like when they go from

908
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:01,359
their small like the cup or their small

909
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:01,839
veg into their large veg pots i have

910
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,918
usually

911
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,879
already decided that right there is my

912
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,240
breeding male

913
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,200
these two over here are the keeper

914
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,839
females i try not to let my

915
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,000
my intuition like that ruin anything i

916
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,079
try to still be open-minded but most of

917
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,558
the time i'm i'm correct already at that

918
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,558
point

919
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,319
and by the time it's dried and cured and

920
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:21,759
smoked everybody else already agrees

921
00:26:20,319 --> 00:26:22,720
like you were right bro we saw it from

922
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:24,000
the beginning because

923
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,839
they've been around so much we just

924
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,038
train them and i share my ideas

925
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:30,558
but um i kind of got myself lost there

926
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,558
on a ramble but i enjoy that

927
00:26:30,558 --> 00:26:34,798
find a good male plant uh that third or

928
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,200
fourth one is going to be your good male

929
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:36,720
plant

930
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,400
uh the early ones are going to put too

931
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,000
much of themselves into the mix that

932
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,840
third or fourth one is going to be a

933
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,599
good breeder it's going to have

934
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:45,519
it's going to pass enough of itself onto

935
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,399
the female to show you what it's got to

936
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,839
offer and then

937
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,679
the female is going to be able to

938
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:51,199
express itself in the breeding project

939
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,480
and like i said a moment ago that's when

940
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,558
you get the offspring

941
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
that shows phenotypes that look like

942
00:26:54,558 --> 00:26:57,599
mommy phenotypes that look like daddy

943
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,480
and then phenotypes that you could see

944
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:00,319
that perfect

945
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,759
chocolate strawberry mix half of it is

946
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:03,119
chocolate half of it is strawberry it's

947
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,480
perfectly beautiful

948
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,399
you can see that happen if your

949
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,798
selections are proper if that is your

950
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,960
goal

951
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,639
also maybe that's not your goal maybe

952
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,679
you want to just recreate this female

953
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,759
plant you got to find something that

954
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,840
doesn't adulterate it too much but

955
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,679
most of the time the goal is to make a

956
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,359
cross of those two

957
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,640
that is improving the species in my

958
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,079
opinion you don't want to just make a

959
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,278
photocopy or you don't want to move

960
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:26,079
backwards unless

961
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:26,398
you've got a specific goal so good male

962
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:29,119
is

963
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:31,359
key maybe a male that displays trichomes

964
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,278
if your male plant is showing trichomes

965
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,278
that is a good thing we want plants that

966
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,119
make trichomes if the males and females

967
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,679
both make trichomes that should add up

968
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:39,439
to

969
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,440
shabang double trichomes right if you

970
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,720
got a mendel chart and you see trichomes

971
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,000
trichomes that's going to be [ __ ]

972
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,120
trichomes with a capital t

973
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,398
right there on your chart baby uh aromas

974
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,558
i like a male plant you're going to

975
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,319
think i'm crazy i say this a lot i say

976
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,038
this often and i mean it

977
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:56,798
i do a stem rub on the plants uh early

978
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,480
flower i can already tell

979
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,599
about week two week three of flower what

980
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,399
these plants are gonna start smelling

981
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:01,918
like for me

982
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:04,000
i just grab the stem and just rub it

983
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:07,200
with my fingers and smell it

984
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,159
and if it smells like vomit and trash

985
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,720
can

986
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,200
and acrid disgustingness maybe some

987
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,880
funky feet maybe some rotten socks

988
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,240
that is a plant that i want to breed

989
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,520
with i don't choose to breed with the

990
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,839
sweet candies

991
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,200
smelling male males because i've got

992
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:23,839
those females i like an

993
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,278
acrid funky male plant that's just gross

994
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,879
i also like a plant with a good

995
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,159
structure that's really important to me

996
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,880
it's got to grow with the good

997
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,000
structure it's got to take some abuse i

998
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,919
will put

999
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,119
just like most people do a phenohunt i

1000
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,640
don't know how long it's been since i've

1001
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,319
talked about a proper final hunt we'll

1002
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,080
talk about that that's when you grow

1003
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:42,158
a number of seeds and you find the

1004
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,918
winners out of that pack of seeds you

1005
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,640
are hunting for the phenotype that you

1006
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:47,120
select

1007
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,159
i will do a phenohunt for boy plants

1008
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:50,639
i'll grow

1009
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,080
uh it's colorado so i'll grow 12 seeds

1010
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,399
at a time and i'll find

1011
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,759
uh the females out of there and just

1012
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,398
toss them immediately

1013
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,839
and now i've got six or five male plants

1014
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,839
to work with and i'll watch them grow

1015
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,678
and i'll find the best boy out of there

1016
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,918
and i'll pull him aside and then now

1017
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,080
i've got one plants and i've got 11 more

1018
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,679
seeds that i can crack and i'll run 11

1019
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,199
and i'll find another boy in there and

1020
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,798
compare it to that first one and i've

1021
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,080
done that a couple times until i found

1022
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,158
stellar males

1023
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:17,839
so run a final hunt until you find the

1024
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,360
male plant that you want if you've only

1025
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,720
got 10 seeds there's a male in there

1026
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,879
that will work for you

1027
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,519
if you've got 100 seeds your opportunity

1028
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,799
to find a stellar male are much better

1029
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,519
how do you know when you found a good

1030
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,240
male the only way to

1031
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,440
audition your stud plant is to pollinate

1032
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,599
in my opinion

1033
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,038
multiple female plants with that plant

1034
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,240
you could pollinate one plant with it

1035
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:38,798
and see what it makes maybe you just

1036
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,640
made one

1037
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,079
really awesome cross that's fun if

1038
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,320
that's what you want to do but

1039
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:45,759
if you really want to tell if that male

1040
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:48,158
is a good breeder

1041
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,919
hit him to several female plants with

1042
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:50,880
different traits all of those plants

1043
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:53,360
need to have

1044
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,200
different different traits i've got a

1045
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,719
strawberry starburst that smells like

1046
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,319
strawberry bubble gum or it's a

1047
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,919
strawberry fields from crockett

1048
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,918
smells like strawberry bubble gum i've

1049
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,480
got a platinum tangy from garden of

1050
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,120
wheaton

1051
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,599
it smells straight up like oranges so if

1052
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:08,079
i hit

1053
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,839
my male plant to the strawberry and my

1054
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,918
male plant to the tangie

1055
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:13,839
i could tell i get this strawberry and

1056
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,278
something and oranges and something and

1057
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:17,038
i can tell what this male plant is

1058
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,038
bringing to the mix i can see that

1059
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,119
when i cross it to this one and to this

1060
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:23,679
one that all of the offspring got tall

1061
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,519
and made big purple leaves or i can see

1062
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
commonalities or

1063
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,960
outliers through the breeding by doing

1064
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,639
multiple female plants i can

1065
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,000
if i hit four or five different females

1066
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
i could tell what that male is going to

1067
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,359
offer

1068
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,720
if i just hit one i don't know sometimes

1069
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,678
if the things that come from that

1070
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,640
offspring

1071
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:41,440
were traits from the grandparents they

1072
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,080
could have been

1073
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,558
so if i use um i'm just going to say

1074
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:46,000
plant a

1075
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:47,918
and plant b it's going to be easier that

1076
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,599
way if i use plant a in plant b

1077
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,360
and i make offspring and i name that

1078
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,119
number one and number one

1079
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,558
shows me things that aren't displayed in

1080
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:56,239
plant a and plant b

1081
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,079
it could come from the grandpa the

1082
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,000
parents of plant a or plant b

1083
00:30:58,079 --> 00:31:01,599
plant a's parents or plant b's parents

1084
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,038
and i wouldn't know that if i don't know

1085
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:06,000
that plant's parents

1086
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,798
so if i use multiple females i know if

1087
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,398
i'm seeing

1088
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:09,839
recessive traits or traits from

1089
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:11,678
grandparents or traits from great

1090
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,839
grandparents or if i'm seeing stuff that

1091
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,519
is displayed from the male

1092
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,240
people wonder why seeds are so expensive

1093
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,640
you guys to do it properly to do it

1094
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,399
correctly to do it sustainably

1095
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,840
uh to do it to where you're around for a

1096
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:25,359
while it does take some work some

1097
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:28,398
research some effort

1098
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:29,599
some care some effort that's a lot of it

1099
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:30,959
is effort a lot of people just think

1100
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:32,240
they're gonna put two plants in a room

1101
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,519
and let them hump and make some seeds

1102
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,599
and make some money

1103
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,038
that will work a couple of times but

1104
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:38,000
then people are gonna buy those seeds

1105
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:39,200
and they're gonna grow them out and

1106
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,960
they're gonna go yeah these are

1107
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,240
not what i was hoping for we're gonna go

1108
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,000
find a breeder that's been doing some

1109
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,798
testing and read some books and figured

1110
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,919
it out

1111
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:50,879
so um find a good selection pollinate

1112
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,480
several females with different traits um

1113
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,600
know your goal when you're doing this

1114
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,798
the first time you're doing it you're

1115
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,759
kind of looking to see what the male

1116
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:57,200
plant does

1117
00:31:55,759 --> 00:31:59,038
but you've probably got some plants

1118
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,000
you've been working with for a while

1119
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:04,000
uh find a male plant that is different

1120
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,240
than the girls if you've got a bunch of

1121
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,919
crazy sativa females maybe find an

1122
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,759
indica heavy male or something unless

1123
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,840
you're looking to make even more

1124
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:13,599
sativa heavy females find something that

1125
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,759
is going to reach your goal

1126
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:17,439
but it's more fun when the male is

1127
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:19,599
different than the female so that you

1128
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,519
can see what the male is doing

1129
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:22,719
to that mix i keep saying stuff like

1130
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:24,079
that but

1131
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,919
once you get there and you have the

1132
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:27,119
seeds and you start growing and you see

1133
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,559
what you've created

1134
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,319
if it all looks the same you're going to

1135
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,240
go my mail plant is

1136
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:33,519
really dominating the mix here because

1137
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
all of these crosses

1138
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,960
all smell like foot and i don't get any

1139
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,159
strawberries i don't get any oranges i

1140
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,600
don't get any blueberries like i

1141
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:40,480
expected from the females i'm just

1142
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,240
getting that

1143
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,159
bar trash can and puke from the male

1144
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,319
plant you know he's too powerful

1145
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,000
got to choose a different male for that

1146
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,599
that's never a bad thing

1147
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,038
this isn't on the notes yet but we're

1148
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,119
going to go into this part

1149
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,558
as a responsible breeder something

1150
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:57,678
you've got to do

1151
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,119
is know when you've made some trash

1152
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,480
if you've just made a bunch of seeds and

1153
00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:01,759
you grew out a bunch of them and they're

1154
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,839
not impressing you

1155
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:05,519
they aren't better than the parent plant

1156
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,599
that you started with

1157
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,839
don't sell them don't pass them out

1158
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,918
don't try to recoup your losses this was

1159
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:14,000
a breeding project where you learned

1160
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,440
these plants don't breed well together

1161
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,398
you've got to get rid of that

1162
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,278
or just grow it yourself or maybe f2 it

1163
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:21,199
or b

1164
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,200
c or b exit whichever one you want to

1165
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,840
use shout out to my buddy f1p

1166
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,360
um work with it yourself those are yours

1167
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:28,959
but maybe if they're not stellar if

1168
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,558
they're not impressive don't put them

1169
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,319
out don't sell them

1170
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:33,839
that's when you go making a bad name for

1171
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,278
yourself if you want to be around to be

1172
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,599
in the industry for a while

1173
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,038
do things correctly be honest impress us

1174

somebody is ready to blast your [ __ ] so

1186
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:03,199
do things correctly if you want to stick

1187
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,119
around in this industry in this scene

1188
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,038
right now if you're a seed breeder

1189
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,799
if you're a creator of some sort in this

1190
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:10,800
industry you are a pioneer

1191
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,720
you can either be remembered for years

1192
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,079
to come as a pioneer in this industry or

1193
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,959
you can be one of those people that

1194
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,879
popped up

1195
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,159
made a couple of bucks we realized

1196
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,000
you're just trying to [ __ ] us for a

1197
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,440
couple of bucks and now you are gone are

1198
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,800
you here forever are you part of the

1199
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
industry or are you here for the cash

1200
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,879
grab

1201
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,918
now's the time to make a decision if

1202
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:27,679
you're trying to get into the seed

1203
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:29,118
breeding game for the market

1204
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,079
all right that was my weird rant for

1205
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,280
this episode um

1206
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,320
yeah if you didn't make something good

1207
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,159
don't share it that is your

1208
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,760
responsibility to make that decision so

1209
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,519
pollinate a bunch of females grow that

1210
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,879
[ __ ] out uh multiple females are going

1211
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:41,358
to show you what the male does to the

1212
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:43,598
mix

1213
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:45,918
see what he does is this male plant

1214
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:48,240
adding value is he adding value to the

1215
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:50,158
crosses or is he just making a bunch of

1216
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,838
reproductions of the females or a bunch

1217
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,960
of reproductions of himself or is he

1218
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:54,719
making hemp

1219
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,398
if hemp is your goal you're reaching

1220
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:57,598
your goal but if that's not your goal

1221
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,519
we've got to figure out

1222
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,440
what ma which male plant we can use in

1223
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,800
the future to reach your goal crack more

1224
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,960
seeds find a better male

1225
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,800
repeat the process this is why seeds get

1226
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,199
expensive i have thrown away male plants

1227
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,440
i've thrown away batches of seeds

1228
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:13,039
for every cross i for every 10 crosses

1229
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,119
that i released there are probably five

1230
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:17,199
to ten more that didn't even make it

1231
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,280
uh it's not that they were terrible but

1232
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,118
i only want to put out

1233
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,480
nines and tens and elevens there's a lot

1234
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,039
of people out there that are okay with

1235
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,000
putting out

1236
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:28,000
fours and sixes and that's cool but

1237
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,960
that's just not how i operate i'd rather

1238
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,800
put out

1239
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,039
nines and tens and elevens because i've

1240
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,119
got the opportunity i know i can do it

1241
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,239
why waste your time and my time with a

1242
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,039
six

1243
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,799
if you're a six i still love you um

1244
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:41,599
where are we in this podcast i'm having

1245
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,000
fun today

1246
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,119
shout out to dabs by the way happy 710

1247
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,159
everybody i hope you guys have a

1248
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,680
had a wonderful 7 10. is that mail plan

1249
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,118
adding value right here oh it's the

1250
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,000
phone giving me interference i hope you

1251
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:53,358
guys didn't hear that come through the

1252
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,960
microphone something just rattled like

1253
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:56,559
chewbacca in my headphones

1254
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,480
i was the phone doing interference with

1255
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,480
the gear here enough rambles is that

1256
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,480
male plant adding value to your cross is

1257
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,800
he doing good or is he just making

1258
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,800
more hemp seed for you more bird seed

1259
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,760
don't be afraid to throw away a breeding

1260
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,440
project go back

1261
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,359
start over do it all over again that's

1262
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,200
how you learn the most it's going to

1263
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:15,838
take a long time

1264
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,879
uh this isn't your last breeding project

1265
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:18,159
hopefully i say

1266
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,358
a lot of times when people are freaking

1267
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,199
out stressing out over their grow

1268
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,960
they're not sure what to do i just say

1269
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:24,559
it's not your last grow it's your first

1270
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,838
grow it's the first time you're doing

1271
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:27,519
this we're going gonna have so many more

1272
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,679
grows to figure all this stuff out go

1273
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,358
ahead and ruin the first one mess it up

1274
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,960
that way your fifth and sixth one can be

1275
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,480
perfect if you [ __ ] up the fifth one i'm

1276
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,519
gonna be mad at you if you get the first

1277
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,199
one wrong

1278
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,480
that's perfect screw up the first time

1279
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:39,598
screw up the third time script the

1280
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,119
fourth time

1281
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,200
fifth and sixth let's start getting [ __ ]

1282
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,599
correctly so all you gotta do is start

1283
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:45,519
over

1284
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,519
breed again i know wasted some time

1285
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,880
wasted some energy it was worth it it's

1286
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,400
a good learning experience it doesn't

1287
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,440
really take that much time that long

1288
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,960
that much space

1289
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,559
uh this isn't on my notes but let's

1290
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,800
ramble a lot of people think that

1291
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:57,920
breeding requires a lot of space it

1292
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,680
doesn't it requires

1293
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,680
very little space you can breed with

1294
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,279
very small plants honestly

1295
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,639
when i'm making a new cross if it's

1296
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,839
something that has never been made

1297
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,358
before and i think

1298
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:08,559
that plant and that plant right there i

1299
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:09,920
should put them on a date i should put

1300
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,639
them in a room and i should let them do

1301
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,480
their thing

1302
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,078
and then we'll have some seeds those

1303
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,920
plants grow in a six

1304
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:18,320
inch net pot and they're about eight

1305
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,079
inches tall maybe ten inches tall when i

1306
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,480
flower them i do not top them

1307
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,240
i grow them they get eight to ten inches

1308
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,559
tall they go into flour

1309
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,639
i pollinate them and then we get about

1310
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,599
somewhere between 30 and 100 seeds

1311
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:32,000
depending on

1312
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,760
the plant some plants take pollen really

1313
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,320
well and give you a lot of seeds

1314
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,760
some are kind of stingy but some of them

1315
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,640
will just throw out seeds either way

1316
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,560
i've got enough

1317
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,000
to play with i can grow a few of them i

1318
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,519
can send a few of them to my tester

1319
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,119
friends they can grow them out

1320
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:46,400
then we can see if that new cross is

1321
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,000
worth the [ __ ] instead of making

1322
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,000
thousands and thousands of seeds at a

1323
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,320
big old plant and wasting space

1324
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
i can put we're in colorado the legal

1325
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,480
number to grow here is 12 plants i've

1326
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,800
got six

1327
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:58,559
recreationally six on my medical

1328
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,039
allowance so that gives me 12 plants

1329
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,440
i'll put

1330
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,358
six uh 12. let me do math in my head

1331
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,159
again i'll put 11. that's the goal

1332
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:06,559
number here

1333
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:07,440
11 female plants in a room and one male

1334
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,119
plant in a room

1335
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,880
and they'll just pollinate all 11 of

1336
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,960
those little tiny six-inch net pots

1337
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,599
under one led light

1338
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,280
real small plants real small pots grow

1339
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:19,440
them up just a couple of weeks

1340
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:20,720
flour them out pollinate them and then

1341
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,920
uh i do the 18

1342
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:23,919
6 trick once i get them good and

1343
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,119
pollinated i put the lights back on 18 6

1344
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,200
and i actually move

1345
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,039
those little tiny plants back to my veg

1346
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,159
space they don't even waste any space

1347
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,920
now they're just in the corner of the

1348
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:33,759
veg space they're getting what they need

1349
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,639
they're on 18-6 they're gonna finish

1350
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,880
flowering

1351
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,319
in about six to eight maybe nine weeks

1352
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,880
hopefully not that long depending on the

1353
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,960
strain

1354
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,039
i will have somewhere between thirty and

1355
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,599
a thousand seeds from each plant to play

1356
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:45,199
with

1357
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
uh did i say a thousand thirty and a

1358
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,519
hundred seeds from each plant to play

1359
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,838
with

1360
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:52,000
and that's enough for myself and lemur

1361
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,239
and mobius and rosin man and

1362
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,838
zozo to run them and see what we've got

1363
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:57,358
and then if i find out they're all good

1364
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:59,039
or if i find out they're all terrible we

1365
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,159
move forward from there if they're good

1366
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,239
i've still got the clones of the

1367
00:39:00,159 --> 00:39:03,759
original plants make a bunch more

1368
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,358
this time we'll run it in a seven gallon

1369
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,240
pot grow it up a little bit bigger

1370
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:07,759
pollinate it

1371
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:10,000
make enough seeds to last for a minute

1372
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,640
so we could stock up all the vendors

1373
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,719
but you don't need a lot of space you

1374
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,960
need the same things that you need

1375
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,719
uh for your regular grow you need a dark

1376
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:20,159
space that you can control the dark on i

1377
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,639
like to throw them into either

1378
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:23,519
11 13 or 12 12 for a few weeks get them

1379
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:25,679
into flower

1380
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:26,960
get that pollen on there um so let's

1381
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:28,078
talk about this a little bit more

1382
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,838
specific detail

1383
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,440
get them into flour around day 23 to 32

1384
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:34,799
depending on the plant is when they want

1385
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,000
pollen if you pollinate

1386
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,160
early your seeds will be um

1387
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,440
they're more likely to be more uniform

1388
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,879
and healthier if you pull in a ripe

1389
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,720
pollinate right in the middle

1390
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,920
you will get more seeds and they'll

1391
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:48,239
still be healthy they'll still be

1392
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:50,880
uniform if you pollinate too late

1393
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:51,439
your seeds will start to get not as

1394
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,200
round

1395
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,358
you'll get more twins you'll get more

1396
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,279
weirdos if you pollinate too late

1397
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,880
so it's all about timing that plant some

1398
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,599
of my plants want pollen i've talked

1399
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,280
about this

1400
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,280
uh the platinum tangie is ready for

1401
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,040
pollen at like day 23 of flowers she's

1402
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:06,640
like pollinate me i'm ready to go

1403
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,199
strawberry fields i gotta wait till like

1404
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:10,719
day 27 or day 30 to give her pollen

1405
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,480
if i hit her too early she doesn't make

1406
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,358
enough seeds if i hit her too late she

1407
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,440
doesn't make

1408
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:16,719
good seeds so it's all about timing when

1409
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,440
it comes to breeding

1410
00:40:16,719 --> 00:40:21,279
you may need to learn to put strawberry

1411
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,760
starburst or strawberry fields into the

1412
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,240
room

1413
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,920
a week ahead maybe two weeks ahead then

1414
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:26,959
drag the platinum tangy in there two

1415
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,519
weeks later

1416
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,880
let those flower then drag the male the

1417
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:32,318
male should already be in there so we'll

1418
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,838
talk about male timing

1419
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,838
but you want to pollinate the plants

1420
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:38,880
around day 23

1421
00:40:35,838 --> 00:40:40,480
to 27 maybe 32 depending on the plan

1422
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,480
you want those pistols to be big and

1423
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,000
bushy and strong looking

1424
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,519
now let's talk about timing the male

1425
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,440
plane your male plants probably going to

1426
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:49,519
start dropping pollen around day 14

1427
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,400
really get going around 17

1428
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,159
really dumping by 23 kicking it out by

1429
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,079
day 26.

1430
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,159
your plants are ready for pollen by now

1431
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,079
but uh you may want to get

1432
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,519
the females a little bit ahead you may

1433
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:03,119
want to get the male a little bit ahead

1434
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,800
it depends on your strategy what you

1435
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:06,800
want to do i've got a separate place for

1436
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,280
my male so i can get him ahead

1437
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,000
and he's really dumping pollen so he's

1438
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,599
probably

1439
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,039
a week ahead of the other so he's

1440
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,960
putting out good pollen some of that

1441
00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:16,239
later pollen is better in my opinion the

1442
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,760
early pollen is good

1443
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,159
the later pollen seems to be more

1444
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,240
productive not super late but like four

1445
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,078
five week six pollen is really good

1446
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:26,078
put that on the week three week four

1447
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,039
females and it really goes shebang so

1448
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,680
get your boy

1449
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,400
get him pollinating if you've got one

1450
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:31,679
space

1451
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
put them all in there at the same time

1452
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,279
and do what you've got to do i

1453
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,640
understand how it goes it will work

1454
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:38,319
a lot of the things i talk about are

1455
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,000
specifics that will dial things in and

1456
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:41,920
give you the best results

1457
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,358
this is growing cannabis on a homegrown

1458
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,639
level i understand sometimes you just

1459
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:46,000
got to throw some plants in a room and

1460
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:48,159
do what you can do so

1461
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,519
if that's what you've got to do do that

1462
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:51,118
so you've got your females in there

1463
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,719
they're going to want pollen around day

1464
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,318
23 27 30 32 at the latest

1465
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:58,879
uh your boy's going to start dropping

1466
00:41:56,318 --> 00:42:01,519
pollen around day 12 14

1467
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,480
17 they'll start dropping it like 25 by

1468
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,920
day 30.

1469
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,280
you can't [ __ ] walk around him

1470
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,599
because when you touch the floor you

1471
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:09,359
could see pollen fall off of him

1472
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,200
that's the point where i would drag him

1473
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,199
over to the females put him right in the

1474
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:14,960
middle of the females and just shake him

1475
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:16,239
just grab him right by the base and give

1476
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,599
him a good shake just like if you're

1477
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,279
going to whip somebody with him

1478
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:21,599
just whip all those female plants with

1479
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,200
them the pollen is going to go flying

1480
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,720
it's going to go everywhere at this

1481
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,759
point you're achieving full

1482
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,879
pollination those plants are getting it

1483
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,560
you're going to taste pollen you're

1484
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,000
going to have pollen in your teeth in

1485
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,279
your nose you're going to breathe pollen

1486
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
and you're going to sneeze it's going to

1487
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,040
suck

1488
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,719
you're going to have bright yellow

1489
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,079
boogers for a whole day you can't get

1490
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,679
rid of it no matter what you do your

1491
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,839
eyes are going to feel red and itchy

1492
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,519
i think that part of my redness and

1493
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:44,799
weirdness from my eyes today is from

1494
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:46,639
pollen big shout out to

1495
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,560
king solomon for making my eyes itchy

1496
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:49,679
it's worth it uh it could be that light

1497
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,920
could be solly

1498
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:53,759
uh but pollinate go in there and just

1499
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,039
spread that pollen i put the plant right

1500
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,880
in front of a fan sometimes

1501
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,440
just let the fan [ __ ] blow the pollen

1502
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,680
everywhere then i wait a few days

1503
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,679
maybe one maybe two maybe three days

1504
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,440
then i will pollinate again

1505
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:06,960
now that male plant in my opinion has

1506
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,960
done his job he's done

1507
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,880
i will cut him down and smack him

1508
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,358
against something either the fan or the

1509
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,960
lights

1510
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:14,880
just getting all that pollen out into

1511
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,240
that room just go sprinkle them all over

1512
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,240
the female plants make them actually

1513
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:20,318
make contact i'm trying to make

1514
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,318
maximum pollination where every pistol

1515
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:23,440
has been pollinated i want maximum seeds

1516
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:25,358
because you guys buy

1517
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,200
every seed that i make and i cannot keep

1518
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:28,799
up with you thank you i love you for

1519
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:29,598
that but i need to make as many seeds as

1520
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,839
i can

1521
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,039
so you drag them in there pollinate

1522
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:34,480
pollination should happen

1523
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,880
females are ready i keep saying it

1524
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,480
around day 23 about day 27

1525
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,160
30 32 ish your boy's dropping around 17

1526
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,400
a little bit later is the best pollen

1527
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:47,199
day 25 is really killer pollen

1528
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,639
uh get him in there juice up those girls

1529
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,039
let the pollination set

1530
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:52,719
pollinate one more time cut down the boy

1531
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:53,119
clean up the pollen get that boy out of

1532
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:54,559
there

1533
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,960
now you're just dealing with seated

1534
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,960
females at this point

1535
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,480
that's when i put the lights back on 18

1536
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,480
6. i've talked about this a lot there

1537
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,280
are full episodes about this

1538
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,039
in my opinion this works really well to

1539
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,760
speed up the finishing process to make

1540
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,400
the seeds

1541
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,160
finish faster they finish harder they're

1542
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,519
fatter they're stronger

1543
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,838
excuse me for that they're fatter

1544
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,519
they're stronger some of the best seeds

1545
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:18,480
i have ever made have been finished

1546
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:21,599
under the 18

1547
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,240
6 finishing cycle the best seeds i have

1548
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,400
ever made

1549
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:26,479
were finished under an 18-6 flowering

1550
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,519
cycle and they were grown under cannon

1551
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,639
leds

1552
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,880
i'm going to take a quick drink and

1553
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,480
we'll continue the rant about breeding

1554
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,160
all right so we've achieved pollination

1555
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,318
we've put our lights back on 18

1556
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,920
6. now we're gonna feed the plants the

1557
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,519
plants in my opinion don't need the

1558
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,838
bloom boosters like we normally feed

1559
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:43,358
them because we're not going for flour

1560
00:44:41,838 --> 00:44:44,719
uh when you put your plants on eighteen

1561
00:44:43,358 --> 00:44:46,960
six let me tell you that this is gonna

1562
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,559
happen they're gonna look like [ __ ]

1563
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,000
we've gotta give them several weeks for

1564
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,318
these seeds to finish up

1565
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
the plants are going to reveg don't

1566
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,039
worry don't stress on that we're not

1567
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,039
growing buds

1568
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,480
your intention is not to make big pretty

1569
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:00,960
flowers at this point

1570
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,800
at this point we are fully focusing on

1571
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,400
seeds we are growing a seeded crop you

1572
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,920
are now growing seeds before we were

1573
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,400
focused on trichomes

1574
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,280
and bag of peel flowers now it is just

1575
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,440
healthy fat

1576
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,119
seeds the plants are going to go back

1577
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,240
into a vegetative state because we've

1578
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,079
got them on an 18

1579
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:19,358
6 lighting cycle in about 14 17 21 days

1580
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,039
you're gonna see little new shoots

1581
00:45:19,358 --> 00:45:23,039
coming out of these plants do not freak

1582
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:24,800
out do not panic don't cut them off

1583
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:26,400
don't do any weird [ __ ] let them keep

1584
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,280
growing your plants are gonna look weird

1585
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,519
and crazy

1586
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,280
don't worry you're growing four seeds

1587
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:32,000
take a lot of pictures post it to social

1588
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,200
media see what

1589
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,318
people think they're gonna freak out

1590
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,118
they're gonna tell you cut it down it's

1591
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:36,318
a mutant

1592
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,760
they're not gonna know what the [ __ ] is

1593
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,519
going on just sit back and laugh like a

1594
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,720
mad scientist because it's really fun to

1595
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,759
see people freak out

1596
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:46,239
on a seated crop that is fully revenging

1597
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,760
if you need clones in a few weeks before

1598
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:49,199
you harvest you will have clones they'll

1599
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,599
be popping out right out of the tops of

1600
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:50,879
these

1601
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,200
seeded plants you'll have brand new

1602
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,960
clones cut those off use them just like

1603
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:56,639
normal clones that is a new mother plant

1604
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,079
don't flower that one out let that one

1605
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:58,639
grow out until the leaves get normal

1606
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:00,000
again

1607
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:01,519
then take clones off of that you can

1608
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,318
flower those those are your new plants

1609
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:04,159
you can get

1610
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,079
seeds and clones off of the same plant

1611
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:08,078
that is a crazy trick that i have done

1612
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,760
a couple of times so you've got your

1613
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:10,880
plants they're on 18-6 they're going to

1614
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,640
continue to flower

1615
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,000
they don't need the bloom boosters like

1616
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:17,199
they normally do because we're

1617
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:20,239
not growing buds they do in my opinion

1618
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:22,318
need enjoy and appreciate a little bit

1619
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,919
of amino acids amino acids are great

1620
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:25,519
building blocks to life if you've got a

1621
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,559
product with amino some sort of liquid

1622
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,318
amino in there

1623
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,000
add that to it also they do like a

1624
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,599
little extra cal mag

1625
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,199
they're also going to appreciate a

1626
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:35,119
little bit of nitrogen

1627
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:36,559
if you're a bottle grower i just

1628
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,960
basically don't switch

1629
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:41,358
the veg bottle to the bloom bottle when

1630
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,838
my feed schedule says put in the

1631
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,119
excuse me let me fix my brain when the

1632
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:47,599
feed schedule says

1633
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:49,519
put in the bloom bottle i just don't

1634
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,720
switch from veg to bloom i continue that

1635
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:52,480
veg bottle all the way through the

1636
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:54,239
flowering cycle

1637
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,800
i don't do a flush phase like you

1638
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:58,239
normally do

1639
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:00,720
that's because we're not going to smoke

1640
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:02,479
and i want to feed my seeds

1641
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,078
so yeah the main nutrient difference is

1642
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,079
they want a little bit more calmag they

1643
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:07,839
want some amino acids and i don't switch

1644
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:09,200
to the flowering nutrients i just use

1645
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,078
that veg bottle

1646
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:14,639
most other things are basically the same

1647
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,240
i don't defoliate as heavily

1648
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,519
honestly they don't grow as bushy

1649
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:20,399
because they're spending most of their

1650
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:21,599
energy on making those seeds

1651
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,200
so then you got to let them finish

1652
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,480
that's where i'm headed we're feeding

1653
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,078
them they're gonna grow they're just

1654
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,880
gonna keep on growing

1655
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,359
um try to don't get it too humid don't

1656
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:31,119
spray

1657
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:32,639
try not to spray because you've got

1658
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,358
seeds in there if you get them too wet

1659
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:35,199
too humid

1660
00:47:33,358 --> 00:47:36,799
those seeds will germinate inside of

1661
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,639
your buds i've seen it before

1662
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,800
i've seen little sprouts growing out of

1663
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,558
live plants it's really beautiful but

1664
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,760
you just ruined your plants and your

1665
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,800
seeds and you kind of [ __ ] up

1666
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,319
everything unless you're trying to make

1667
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,400
some living soil

1668
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:49,920
there's nothing to be used there so let

1669
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,280
them grow let them continue to grow

1670
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,880
don't let it get too humid you want at

1671
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,559
the same conditions as you do a normal

1672
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,280
grow environment so you're already doing

1673
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,680
that

1674
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,359
feed them water them then you will

1675
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:00,639
notice that the seeds are starting to

1676
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,039
get hard a lot of people say

1677
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:04,960
how do i know when the seeds are ready

1678
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:05,358
hopefully these plants are really seeded

1679
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,679
up

1680
00:48:05,358 --> 00:48:09,039
all you have to do is find a branch that

1681
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,318
you're okay with just kind of kind of

1682
00:48:09,039 --> 00:48:12,159
mangling a little bit

1683
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,079
grab a bud and just pinch it and pull

1684
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,719
out a seed and then roll it between your

1685
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:16,400
fingers

1686
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:18,558
the butt will fall off the casing will

1687
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,920
come off all the calyx and all that part

1688
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:21,280
will fall onto the floor and you'll just

1689
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,720
have a seat in your hand pop it right in

1690
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,960
your hand and check it out

1691
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:26,639
is it white is it pale is it gray is it

1692
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:28,960
getting tiger striped is it dark

1693
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:29,759
is it black then is it hard give it a

1694
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,920
squeeze

1695
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,000
if it crushes that's when you can tell a

1696
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,440
lot when it crushes does it just go

1697
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,519
squish if nothing comes out you're

1698
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,960
nowhere near ready if a little

1699
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,039
white gooey thing comes out you're

1700
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,800
getting close if it's hard and kind of

1701
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:44,239
goes crunch and white gooey [ __ ] comes

1702
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,720
out you're getting really close if it's

1703
00:48:44,239 --> 00:48:46,078
hard

1704
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,000
and when you pinch it it makes a little

1705
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,680
indention in your finger then you're

1706
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,239
probably ready but go a little bit

1707
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:52,159
longer

1708
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:54,000
it's going to take six to eight maybe

1709
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:55,759
nine weeks for these seeds to harden up

1710
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,199
honestly from the time you pollinate

1711
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,119
until the time you cut them down is

1712
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,358
going to be six to eight maybe nine

1713
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:03,280
weeks it is going to be very

1714
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,960
plant specific it's going to be very

1715
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,160
environmental specific

1716
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,000
there are a lot of things that will come

1717
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:09,920
into play to decide how long

1718
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,760
these seeds need to go before you

1719
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,200
harvest them i want to read my notes and

1720
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,800
make sure i didn't miss anything because

1721
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,480
i got stone and i went kind of fast and

1722
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,960
i did lose track of where i was at one

1723
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,079
point

1724
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,800
i want to make sure i don't miss

1725
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,800
anything for you select plants

1726
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,559
select a female select a male get them

1727
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,480
at the right point in flowering

1728
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,480
put them in the room let them do their

1729
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,280
magic on each other

1730
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,480
then switch the light cycle to 18 6 feed

1731
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,839
them properly

1732
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,679
uh basically give them veg nutrients

1733
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:40,239
all the way through give them aminos

1734
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,919
give them calmac give them nitrogen

1735
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:43,598
that should keep them happy don't let

1736
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,639
them get root bound don't get them too

1737
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:48,000
humid

1738
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:49,039
um they're on 18-6 let them go long

1739
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,119
enough

1740
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:52,239
then i think we can talk about

1741
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,119
harvesting

1742
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:56,399
um let's harvest one of the best parts

1743
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,240
about growing for seed is you don't

1744
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,680
really have to trim

1745
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:01,838
it's all just gonna none of it's gonna

1746
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,239
get smoked well unless you're gonna try

1747
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:05,838
i don't do that i don't feel it's useful

1748
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,759
i feel like it's a waste of time

1749
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:10,000
um so before harvest while the plants

1750
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,680
are still alive still growing still well

1751
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,679
still turgid is the word i'm looking for

1752
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:14,879
i will pull off as many leaves as i can

1753
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:16,719
get

1754
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,720
just defoliate with my hands maybe

1755
00:50:16,719 --> 00:50:20,239
scissors but put on a pair of gloves or

1756
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,679
just go pull off all of the leaves

1757
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,679
because when i cut the plants down i

1758
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:25,679
don't need that much leaf on there

1759
00:50:23,679 --> 00:50:27,358
so i go in i cut off all of the leaves

1760
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:28,318
or pull off all of the leaves as many as

1761
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:31,199
i can get

1762
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,960
then the next day i cut the plants down

1763
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,639
and i hang them upside down and put a

1764
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,318
label on them that way i know that this

1765
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:37,838
plant is for sure this plant

1766
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:39,199
it was the female this i already know

1767
00:50:37,838 --> 00:50:40,558
what it was pollinated by because it was

1768
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,719
my breeding project

1769
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,559
then i just simply let it dry i don't

1770
00:50:42,719 --> 00:50:46,399
even put them in a dry and cure room

1771
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:47,839
i just hang them in a basement where the

1772
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,680
air is and they just

1773
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:50,960
dry in that natural environment i'm not

1774
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:53,118
curing them i'm not drying them

1775
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,039
especially we're not going to smoke them

1776
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:56,720
this is all seeded product a lot of

1777
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:58,239
people think that it's insane or

1778
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:59,919
there's a problem with just seeding this

1779
00:50:58,239 --> 00:51:00,879
up and not even attempting to save the

1780
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,480
material

1781
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,160
by the time i'm done sorting it and

1782
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,639
getting the seeds out of it it is so

1783
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:08,719
beat up that it is not worth it any

1784
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,000
edibles that you make tastes like crap

1785
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,759
it tastes like chlorophyll

1786
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,280
any concentrates you may come out green

1787
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:15,280
and terrible because it's so beat up it

1788
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,200
is not worth the time energy and effort

1789
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:18,960
uh the material goes into the compost

1790
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,318
bin or the bokashi bucket

1791
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,000
is honestly what happens to that

1792
00:51:20,318 --> 00:51:23,358
material so we

1793
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,358
cut down the plants they've been

1794
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,078
defoliated heavily we cut them down they

1795
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:28,159
hang

1796
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,760
upside down or you can lay them on racks

1797
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:31,118
if you want but the seeds may start

1798
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,240
falling out as it dries up

1799
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,079
as long as you got something to catch

1800
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:35,039
the seeds and keep them separated keep

1801
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,920
them separated

1802
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,920
so that you don't get any

1803
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,720
cross-contamination or cross-labeling of

1804
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,800
seeds

1805
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:42,639
chop the plants down hang them up let

1806
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,960
them get this is how i do it i let them

1807
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,960
get crispity crispy crunchy dry they're

1808
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,800
super butter finger dry

1809
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,159
then i will get a container i wish i

1810
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,880
would have brought one to the table

1811
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:53,598
it is a sterlite container i believe is

1812
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,358
the brand

1813
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:56,800
sterlite makes them rubbermaid makes

1814
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,159
them there's a bunch of generic brands

1815
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,000
that make them at the big box stores

1816
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:02,318
where they sell you all the plastic [ __ ]

1817
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
you can get these containers it's

1818
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,838
probably 18 inches 16

1819
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,760
inches tall deep you might want to call

1820
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:08,880
it it's about three feet wide and it's

1821
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,160
about a foot and a half

1822
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,000
thick um it's like a big box basically

1823
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,399
it's all a big plastic box

1824
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,239
i will grab a pair of gloves and i will

1825
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,079
put my plant in that box

1826
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,000
and i basically grab the plant by the

1827
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,680
base of the stalk and i put my hand

1828
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,960
around all the buds and run my hand

1829
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,719
right up the main stem

1830
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,318
and just shuck all the buds right off

1831
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:30,239
the stem it is so dry

1832
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,000
that as i run my hand up the stem and

1833
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:34,239
push all these buds off they just fall

1834
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:35,838
right off the stick into the container

1835
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:37,199
so now all the buds are

1836
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,199
off the sticks they're all into this

1837
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,159
container i've got a couple of methods

1838
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:42,719
for removing

1839
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:44,159
uh the seeds at this point but some of

1840
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:45,679
the easiest ways are just

1841
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:47,679
put on gloves and just grind it all up

1842
00:52:45,679 --> 00:52:48,960
with your hands don't smash too hard

1843
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,039
you'll know when you're going hard

1844
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,358
enough to destroy seeds but if you've

1845
00:52:51,039 --> 00:52:53,279
got

1846
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:54,558
all the plant matter in that container

1847
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:55,280
and you just start grinding it up with

1848
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:56,880
your hands

1849
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,800
you will hear those seeds hitting that

1850
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,960
bin just ding ding ding ding ding ding

1851
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,119
ding if you did it right it sounds like

1852
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,400
it is raining seeds into that container

1853
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,318
it is a very

1854
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,079
uh when you grew seeds on purpose and

1855
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:10,800
you hear that it is a very

1856
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,480
satisfying feeling another really

1857
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,359
effective way of getting these seeds out

1858
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,880
of these buds

1859
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:16,480
is to remove all the buds from the

1860
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,838
sticks you got to get most of the sticks

1861
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,480
out because we're going to put all these

1862
00:53:17,838 --> 00:53:21,920
buds

1863
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,519
into a one gallon ziploc bag as many as

1864
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,639
you can get it into that one gallon

1865
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,480
ziploc bag

1866
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,920
and then i just kind of roll my hands

1867
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,719
around that bag and squeeze it and

1868
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,400
crumble it these buds are dusty bone dry

1869
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,480
so as i'm doing this i'm just making

1870
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:37,200
dust out of all of that bud

1871
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,318
then i personally use a seed sorter i've

1872
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:40,399
got a machine

1873
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:42,558
that i pour the seeds and all the the

1874
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,720
other material is called chaff so i pour

1875
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:46,559
the chaff and the seed mixture into this

1876
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,239
one part and seeds come out of one end

1877
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,519
and the chaff comes out of the other

1878
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:50,959
i've got to run it through a couple of

1879
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,400
times to make sure i don't miss any

1880
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,039
seeds but once i get the rhythm of the

1881
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,639
machine

1882
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:56,800
i can pull out a lot of seeds quite

1883
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:58,159
quickly if you don't have a seed sorter

1884
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,359
there are a lot of ways to figure out

1885
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:01,440
how to get the seeds

1886
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,199
uh remember that the seeds roll and the

1887
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:04,480
chaff is fluffy and stays at the top you

1888
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:05,838
can do it just like we used to back in

1889
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,519
the day get an album

1890
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:08,880
run the seat run the material up the

1891
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:10,239
album and the seeds fall down the

1892
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,200
material stays at the top

1893
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:13,598
there are a lot of ways to do it this is

1894
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,719
uh

1895
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:17,920
a seed breeder's version of trimming you

1896
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:18,959
guys out there trimming

1897
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,318
you always talk about how you want to

1898
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,519
put the scissors in your eye and that

1899
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:23,920
you hate trimming

1900
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,440
pulling the seeds out is that's the

1901
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,280
headache for a breeder if you don't have

1902
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,880
the machine if you've got the machines

1903
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:30,319
they will do you very well there is the

1904
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,240
easy grow

1905
00:54:30,318 --> 00:54:33,599
seed sorter is what i think it's called

1906
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:36,318
the easy seed

1907
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:38,720
seed sorter that is a great machine my

1908
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,239
buddy cascadian groan is putting out the

1909
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:42,000
larger models if you need something to

1910
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:44,078
do a few more seeds uh

1911
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,400
cascading groans is actually more

1912
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,839
affordable so find him on social media

1913
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,039
shout out to cascadian grown there you

1914
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:50,558
go brother free plug just because i want

1915
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,358
to support the community

1916
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:55,280
also there's another guy i saw damn i

1917
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:58,639
really wish i remember who saw the

1918
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,240
uh who made the plastic 3d printed

1919
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:02,879
version it was smaller

1920
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,000
uh but still all three great products no

1921
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,358
bias no

1922
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,119
yeah just three products you could use

1923
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:08,798
they're all three seed sorters another

1924
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,798
thing i've seen done

1925
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:12,480
i think i learned this from mr soul i

1926
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:13,519
like to share uh resources so you don't

1927
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,880
think i'm a wizard

1928
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,559
i do learn [ __ ] from a lot of other

1929
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:18,640
people mr soul

1930
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,240
puts his buds he takes the sticks out

1931
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:20,960
he's got just buds in a five gallon

1932
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:23,679
bucket

1933
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,838
and he taught us to get a drill and then

1934
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:27,838
at the hardware store they sell a paddle

1935
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,599
that is a drill bit so it hooks into

1936
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:31,279
your drill just like a normal drill bit

1937
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,200
but it is to stir paint is what i

1938
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,359
believe it was originally made for

1939
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:37,039
and you put your drill on like a low

1940
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:38,798
setting so you don't destroy the seeds

1941
00:55:37,039 --> 00:55:40,558
and just go into the five gallon bucket

1942
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:42,159
and just give it a few zoo

1943
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,119
zip zip you don't want to go in there

1944
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:47,039
and murder it but give it a few zaps

1945
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,880
and if the material is dry enough just

1946
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:50,639
give it a zip it'll just

1947
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,160
shatter that material and rupture the

1948
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,199
material and the seeds just go flying to

1949
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,039
the edge of the bucket

1950
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:57,039
it will not break the seeds if you put

1951
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:58,880
it on a low setting and you do it gently

1952
00:55:57,039 --> 00:56:00,318
and pay attention if you go in there and

1953
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,599
start [ __ ] mashing them on the bottom

1954
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:03,039
and making mashed potatoes out of it

1955
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:04,318
you'll destroy the seeds but

1956
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:05,599
if you're smooth about it and you pay

1957
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:07,358
attention watch what you're doing you

1958
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,640
will not destroy the seeds it is a quick

1959
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,039
way to get them out

1960
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,159
then all of the chaff is at the top all

1961
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:13,599
the seeds are at the bottom

1962
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:15,519
pull out a few handfuls of the chaff

1963
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:18,240
that will help you out start sorting

1964
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:20,960
those seeds much more quickly

1965
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:22,558
seriously pulling the seeds out is uh

1966
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,400
the really the challenging part

1967
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:26,319
unless you're making packages i package

1968
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,160
seeds by hand every seed that you buy

1969
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:29,838
was packaged by me i touched that seed i

1970
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:31,679
rolled it on the table made it was hard

1971
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:33,519
made sure it was hard that was weird

1972
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:35,440
uh touched that seed made sure it was

1973
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:36,639
hard all right rolled it on the table

1974
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,639
made sure it was hard i put all those

1975
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:40,159
seeds into the packaging myself

1976
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:41,598
i like to touch them but counting to 10

1977
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:42,798
and counting to 12 and counting to 6

1978
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,318
does get quite tedious

1979
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:46,400
i make sure to put extra seeds in there

1980
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:47,599
for you but that is my version of

1981
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,680
trimming that's what i'm just like all

1982
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,079
right my eyes are crossed i need a break

1983
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:53,358
so we've gotten all the way to selecting

1984
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,798
plants we've gotten all the way up to

1985
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:56,000
harvesting we've gotten to pulling the

1986
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:57,519
seeds out

1987
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,960
now you've got to count them it's always

1988
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:00,639
good to count your seeds i know that

1989
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,920
sounds tedious and monotonous i've got a

1990
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:03,440
machine that does that i simply drop my

1991
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,039
seeds in a machine and i hit go

1992
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:07,280
and it vibrates and it counts the seeds

1993
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:08,639
for me beautiful beautiful machine

1994
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,920
hopefully you've got a friend maybe a

1995
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:11,679
lovely girlfriend or somebody that will

1996
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:13,119
sit around and count seeds with you

1997
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,639
i just count them out sometimes you can

1998
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,480
do it by weight you'll get close enough

1999
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,759
if you just want a good idea

2000
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,358
sometimes you could tell that this mini

2001
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,520
in a baggie is about a thousand seeds

2002
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:23,279
you'll get good at it eventually

2003
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:24,960
count them because you want to know how

2004
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,000
many seeds you made because you want to

2005
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:27,280
know how many you make next

2006
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,440
time so that you can make if you make

2007
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,880
five more next time that's improvement

2008
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,240
but you want to just document stuff i

2009
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:32,880
like to make a lot of notes i like to

2010
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:34,399
make

2011
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,000
excessive notes that way i know where

2012
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,519
progress is i know where i'm slacking i

2013
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,880
know where i'm improving

2014
00:57:37,519 --> 00:57:40,880
all right now let's talk about the most

2015
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,318
rewarding part of this entire project

2016
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,400
now it is time to grow

2017
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,400
the seeds we have produced did we make

2018
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:48,000
trash did we make the next gems did we

2019
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,119
make the newest chem dog did we make the

2020
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,719
new gorilla glue

2021
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:52,079
did we make the new popular [ __ ] that's

2022
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,239
going to have everybody lined up at the

2023
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:55,839
dispensary or

2024
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,598
did we just make a bunch of intersex

2025
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:59,440
mutant plants and nobody wants to grow

2026
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:01,280
the only way to find that out is to

2027
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,559
sprout them and grow them the first

2028
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:04,319
thing you want to document is

2029
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,400
germination rate

2030
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,719
however many seeds you grow write it

2031
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,880
down uh how many germinated

2032
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:12,239
write that down that is your germination

2033
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,079
rate if you popped

2034
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,479
10 seeds and only seven of them sprouted

2035
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,240
you've got a 70 germination rate

2036
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,318
not really acceptable for commercial

2037
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:21,358
seeds those are good for you you need at

2038
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:23,679
least 80

2039
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:24,719
germination to put them out to market 90

2040
00:58:23,679 --> 00:58:26,719
is better

2041
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:28,639
if they don't have 90 germination rate

2042
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:29,679
at least put 13 seeds in that package

2043
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:30,960
when you sell them

2044
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:32,399
do something like that to help the

2045
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,079
people out but you need a good

2046
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,280
germination rate so test these seeds

2047
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,839
germ them out

2048
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,519
then see how they grow veg them take

2049
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:39,838
notes as they veg if you've got 10 of

2050
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,280
them

2051
00:58:39,838 --> 00:58:42,719
you should label them however you want

2052
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,839
you can name them you can number them

2053
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:45,519
you can letter them

2054
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:47,279
but just make notes right that plant

2055
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:49,280
number one grows like [ __ ] plant number

2056
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:50,880
two grows amazing plant number three

2057
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:52,480
it's kind of weird plant number four is

2058
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,200
the one i want to keep already

2059
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,798
make notes because you're not gonna

2060
00:58:55,199 --> 00:58:58,000
remember this is gonna be a long process

2061
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:59,519
and you're so excited

2062
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,519
all your mental notes are gonna get

2063
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:02,400
foggy so make a lot of notes grow these

2064
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:03,838
out

2065
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,440
you can grow them as big as you want you

2066
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:06,639
can grow them as small as you want but

2067
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,798
flower them out

2068
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:10,239
do your testing process however you want

2069
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:11,679
to test them do you want to grow them

2070
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:12,719
big and top them and spread them out and

2071
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,798
see what they do

2072
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,399
i like to run kind of a scientific test

2073
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:19,039
i run them once again in a six

2074
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,880
inch net pot untopped uh veg them for

2075
00:59:19,039 --> 00:59:22,239
about two or three weeks

2076
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,680
get them big enough just to see the

2077
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,399
shape of the plant then put it into

2078
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:26,159
flour

2079
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,838
then i'll find out very quickly if those

2080
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:29,519
plants show intersex traits if they're

2081
00:59:27,838 --> 00:59:31,519
mutants if they're weirdos

2082
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,599
i can find what they smell taste look

2083
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,358
like i can find production

2084
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,599
very quickly i can achieve production

2085
00:59:35,358 --> 00:59:40,078
very quickly and find winners and losers

2086
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,280
very quickly in less than 100 days if i

2087
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:43,200
do it by just

2088
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,559
flowering them out really quickly then

2089
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:45,919
you can dry them cure them smoke them

2090
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,280
with the crew take a bunch of pictures

2091
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,000
and see what you've got it's about 100

2092
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,440
day process

2093
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,358
maybe 120 if you veg them for too long

2094
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,880
so grow them out see what you've got if

2095
00:59:53,358 --> 00:59:56,239
you want to go bigger you can i like a

2096
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,400
small test grow

2097
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,078
it just makes more sense to me why grow

2098
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,519
big ass plants i don't even take a clone

2099
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:02,559
a lot of times on my test grows i've got

2100
01:00:01,519 --> 01:00:04,000
a thousand seeds

2101
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,280
grown out 10 of them if i find something

2102
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,920
cool and there i'll grow more seeds of

2103
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:07,440
that

2104
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,880
but just grow them out find what we've

2105
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:10,559
got why do i want to spend a bunch of

2106
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,880
time growing something that could be

2107
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,798
trash it could be amazing but it also

2108
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,318
could be trash and if i waste

2109
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:20,000
soil time electricity nutrients water

2110
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:22,079
real estate in the grow on plants that

2111
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,079
were [ __ ] then that's frustrating so

2112
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:26,640
veg them flower them out see what we've

2113
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:27,519
got smoke them yourself smoke them with

2114
01:00:26,639 --> 01:00:29,199
your friends

2115
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:30,639
smoke them with if you're a medical

2116
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,318
grower smoke them with whoever is

2117
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:34,879
consuming them medically if you are

2118
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,480
a uh profit grower smoke them with your

2119
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,079
favorite customers give them to them as

2120
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:39,440
a sample be like here's numbers one two

2121
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:39,920
and three let me know what you liked

2122
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:41,039
better

2123
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:42,480
and they're going to love you for that

2124
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:44,159
they're like you let me get you let me

2125
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,440
pick which one you're going to grow and

2126
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,239
they'll think it's custom for them and

2127
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:49,838
[ __ ] so uh select the best ones

2128
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,078
the best one i don't like the word ones

2129
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:53,599
so it's one plural it's weird select the

2130
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:54,480
best one or the plants that work the

2131
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,119
best for you

2132
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,960
then continue to grow those those all

2133
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,240
right my face is wearing out so at this

2134
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:00,960
point you've grown out a bunch of the

2135
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:03,039
plants

2136
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,639
uh you've found males females you know

2137
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,480
how many males and females come out of a

2138
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:07,519
pack you know your germination rate

2139
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:09,519
you know what kind of terps you're

2140
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:11,838
getting from each cross you can see now

2141
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,599
what that male did to each cross did it

2142
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:14,159
over dominate everything did it add a

2143
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,079
nice

2144
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:17,920
something to everything did it work the

2145
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,280
way that you expected it we said start

2146
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,039
this with a goal

2147
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,640
did you meet a goal did you exceed your

2148
01:01:21,039 --> 01:01:24,159
goal did you forget about the goal did

2149
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:26,400
you do something totally different that

2150
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:27,920
wasn't your goal but still amazing

2151
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,838
just document that and then when you do

2152
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:31,119
it again you got some sort of document

2153
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,400
some sort of record

2154
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:37,039
so um are the seeds you made

2155
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,880
better than the parents did you improve

2156
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:39,920
upon cannabis did you improve upon the

2157
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:41,680
species

2158
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,200
if you paid money for these seeds would

2159
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:45,039
you be happy with that

2160
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,639
uh is there a reason to grow these seeds

2161
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:47,920
again was this just something you would

2162
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:49,279
have done one time or do you want to

2163
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,880
keep growing these because you probably

2164
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,119
have a lot of them

2165
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:55,519
are you letting yourself and your ego

2166
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,200
get in the way of quality control

2167
01:01:55,519 --> 01:01:59,199
did you fall in love with this breeding

2168
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:00,719
project uh you know how your friend

2169
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,639
your friend the soundcloud rapper thinks

2170
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:04,239
that every beat he makes is the best

2171
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,038
beat ever but it's the same beat he's

2172
01:02:04,239 --> 01:02:07,279
been making since

2173
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,559
8th grade are you doing that with your

2174
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,319
breeding are you saying this is the best

2175
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,079
[ __ ] ever bro but it's really just

2176
01:02:10,318 --> 01:02:13,440
the same beat you made in 8th grade just

2177
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:15,039
trying to relive it because

2178
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,639
your ego is in the way and you really

2179
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,000
should just [ __ ] delete that and move

2180
01:02:16,639 --> 01:02:20,239
on and try something new

2181
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,358
don't let your ego get in the way of

2182
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:23,679
your breeding

2183
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:25,440
um i've done it i've been super proud of

2184
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,679
[ __ ] and then been like but but

2185
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,119
but and then if i catch myself saying

2186
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,038
but but then i already know that

2187
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,318
i just need to i but but just move on

2188
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,720
that [ __ ] ain't worth but

2189
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:36,318
but but move on you there are so many

2190
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:37,919
plants to work with so many male

2191
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:39,279
plants so many female plants you can

2192
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,039
make feminized plants which will be a

2193
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,160
whole other podcast we do not have time

2194
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,599
for that rabbit hole

2195
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:44,879
there are so many plants to play with

2196
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:45,760
why would you want to waste time with

2197
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:47,920
something

2198
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,760
that isn't moving the cannabis species

2199
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,400
the plant the industry the community

2200
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,520
forward

2201
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,760
why do you want to stall it out and

2202
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:55,838
stand still so if your breeding isn't

2203
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,359
perfect isn't amazing just abandon the

2204
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,960
project let's start over let's do

2205
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:00,400
something different unless you find a

2206
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,318
trait in there that you really want to

2207
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,079
isolate work with breed again

2208
01:03:02,318 --> 01:03:05,599
you'll know it if you see it you'll know

2209
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,000
what i'm talking about

2210
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:09,280
all right uh we got all the way through

2211
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,639
this i think

2212
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:13,039
yeah i think so there will be a couple

2213
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:16,719
of quick edits but i think we did a good

2214
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:18,400
breeding podcast this should spark a lot

2215
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,000
of questions i really hope i get a lot

2216
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,680
of feedback a lot of response from this

2217
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,798
