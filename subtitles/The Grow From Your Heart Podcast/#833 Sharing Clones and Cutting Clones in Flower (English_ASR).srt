mountain fudge cake fem seeds but they

53
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,920
are moving very quickly so make sure you

54
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:20,919
hit I direct.com for orange GM lemon

55
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,119
Jeffrey and Golden Goat feminized seeds

56
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:23,598
all right we've gotten all the business

57
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,360
covered here at the start of the show

58
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,878
now let's work our way into the pet

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
peeve section of today's podcast that's

60
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:30,878
right sometimes when I go to a

61
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,519
commercial grow maybe sometimes I'll go

62
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,799
to a friend's grow or perhaps I'll just

63
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,319
be scrolling online sometimes I see

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,840
something in a grow room or in a grow

65
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,119
environment that simply drives me crazy

66
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,319
sometimes it even almost hurts my

67
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,959
feelings and makes me sad for the plants

68
00:02:42,318 --> 00:02:45,679
I can see just by looking just by taking

69
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,080
a quick visual look that there are

70
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,599
simple things that we could do to

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,599
improve this grow in many ways small

72
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,000
details could give you better potency

73
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:54,639
better Harvest weight and just make the

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,878
grow overall more enjoyable for the

75
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:59,318
grower sometimes that stuff drives me

76
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,479
crazy I do encourage you the listeners

77
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:03,439
and the viewers to send me your growroom

78
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:05,359
pet peeves you can reach out and send

79
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:07,919
them to me at grow fromy yourheart

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,599
hotmail.com if I read your growroom pet

81
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,679
peeve here on the podcast I will send

82
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,399
you a coupon code for a free pack of

83
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,280
seeds on idirect tocom today's first pet

84
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,799
peeve came from somebody who calls

85
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,640
themselves local C and it says my pet

86
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:24,080
peeve is when a grower thinks plant

87
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:26,439
problems like deficiencies will be fixed

88
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,840
the day that they are addressed and

89
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:32,000
watered uh it can take a few days or

90
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,840
more to see a repair and calmag is not

91
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,120
always the answer that is absolutely

92
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,640
correct sometimes I'll see people post

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,519
hey I've got a problem this is what is

94
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:42,318
wrong with my plants help me now let's

95
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,158
say hypothetically that somebody posts a

96
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:46,119
photo of a plant with an obvious

97
00:03:44,158 --> 00:03:48,280
nitrogen deficiency I would identify

98
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,878
that nitrogen deficiency I would explain

99
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:51,438
to them why I think it's nitrogen I

100
00:03:49,878 --> 00:03:52,759
would say that plant is way yellow it's

101
00:03:51,438 --> 00:03:55,239
not as green as it could be that's

102
00:03:52,759 --> 00:03:56,959
usually a sign of nitrogen deficiency

103
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:59,920
then I would recommend a couple of ways

104
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,640
to correct that nitrogen problem most of

105
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,798
the time my first recommendation to

106
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:05,399
correct a nitrogen deficiency would be a

107
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:07,159
fol your feed I would say grab your

108
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,920
bottle of Base nutrients that's a

109
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:10,479
nitrogen based nutrient bottle right

110
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,238
there Shake It Up mix up a full of your

111
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,759
feed apply that to the plants nitrogen

112
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,040
is a mobile element so the plants are

113
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:17,918
going to receive that and they will move

114
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,040
it around as it needs to be that

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,120
nitrogen nitrogen will get distributed

116
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,600
throughout that plant as needed that

117
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,199
will solve your nitrogen deficiency the

118
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,280
other thing I would recommend is to mix

119
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,639
up a feed solution with that base

120
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:32,359
nutrient which is heavily nitrogen based

121
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,360
then water that into the plants as

122
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,840
normal now most people are probably

123
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,080
going to do one maybe two of those

124
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:38,799
things though a lot of people are going

125
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:40,519
to overdo both of those things but

126
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,879
that's not the point here the thing is

127
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,879
they're going to do that and then

128
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,120
they're going to look at the plants and

129
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,120
they're going to say they're still

130
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,079
yellow yes those plants are still yellow

131
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,720
they're not going to Green up right away

132
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,159
it's going to take a little bit of time

133
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,000
for the plants to metabolize the

134
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,080
nutrients you just gave them for them to

135
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,519
move that around to make that nutrient

136
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,918
mobile I can't remember the word of

137
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,680
moving mobile nutrients there's a

138
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,038
specific word for that they've got to

139
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,160
move those nutrients around where they

140
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,000
need to be and then over a course of

141
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,240
time you will see Improvement on those

142
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,478
plants but yes this viewer this listener

143
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,120
is absolutely correct that many times

144
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:13,599
when I make recommendations to people I

145
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,280
go say go spray that plant go fure feed

146
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
that plant with a nitrogen product

147
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,559
they'll go spray it and they'll say

148
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,319
still green dude and I go well yeah the

149
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,240
nutrients take a little bit of time to

150
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,960
work you're going to need a day cycle

151
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,079
for that metabolism to happen a night

152
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,918
cycle for corrections to be made maybe

153
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,959
another day or two for things to balance

154
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:32,439
themselves out it may take a day two

155
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,279
three maybe four or 5 days to see any

156
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,639
results when you were doing any sort of

157
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:38,359
correction that goes to any kind of feed

158
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,639
uh when you feed a plant uh unless

159
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,038
you're in cocoa or Hydro cocoa and hydro

160
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,639
do show you quite quickly but if you're

161
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:45,399
in a soilless mix or a soilless

162
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:47,560
situation you mix up a bottle of

163
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,159
nutrient you feed that plant most of the

164
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,759
time it's going to take two three maybe

165
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,240
four or five days to actually see

166
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,840
results of that feed a lot of processes

167
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,519
have to happen unless you went extreme

168
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,119
if you weigh overfed if you put

169
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,599
something in there that's way too hot

170
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,800
you might notice notice it the next day

171
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,919
if your nutrient if your pH is way off

172
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,520
you might notice that quite quickly but

173
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,560
most of the time it's going to take you

174
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:11,359
2 3 4 maybe even 5 days to identify

175
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,240
what's going on with that plant so be

176
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,240
patient when you're making Corrections

177
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,199
on if it's a deficiency or an over feed

178
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,759
be very patient waiting for changes to

179
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,800
happen you could just cause more

180
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,520
problems by being impatient trying to do

181
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,400
too much so identify that problem uh

182
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,598
find a solution create the solution uh

183
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:32,120
execute that solution then sit back and

184
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,079
let it work uh go smoke a joint go walk

185
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,519
the dog leave those plants alone for a

186
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,719
day or two pay attention but don't do

187
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:40,719
more [ __ ] to them just let them heal I

188
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,000
see a lot of people cause more harm than

189
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,160
good by doing too much so yes that is a

190
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,399
good uh a good pet peeve thinking that

191
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,319
those problems are going to uh be solved

192
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,120
just by one quick foler application it

193
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:52,720
will work but it may take a little bit

194
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,680
of time for those nutrients to move

195
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,440
around or whatever the case may be be

196
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:58,319
patient there was more to this it says

197
00:06:56,439 --> 00:07:00,598
it can take a few days or more oh and

238
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,360
nothing to complain about big fist bump

239
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:31,959
the question says been watching and

240
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,120
listening to the podcast for a little

241

over 3 years now you have a good Soul

242

bro thank you for noticing that I do

243
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,440
appreciate it it says you drop knowledge

244
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:44,079
for free and you put TLC into it uh both

245
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,480
of those are true so thank you it said

246
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,680
thank you I appreciate what you do boss

247
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,639
now for the question I was fortunate

248
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:53,159
enough to purchase some of the '90s

249
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,519
skunk testers congratulations bro those

250
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,039
were quite limited then it says I was

251
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,679
wondering if it was cool to sell or give

252
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:02,719
a clone away being that those are

253
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:04,958
testers now most of the time when it

254
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,320
comes to my plants my seeds my Creations

255
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:09,039
genetics in general I have no problem

256
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,399
with people cutting clones and sharing

257
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:14,078
those clones however what you have got

258
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,600
are tester seeds it would be and this

259
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:17,399
goes for almost any seed that you're

260
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,680
going to grow let me kind of back up if

261
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:22,120
you're going to give a clone away the

262
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,039
person receiving that clone expects you

263
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:27,200
to have ran that plant and tested it and

264
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:29,039
verified that is worth their time and

265
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,000
energy growing in that Garden that's why

266
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,360
people want clones because they want

267
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,360
something that they know is tried and

268
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:35,919
true uh they know it's female they know

269
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,480
it's not interx they know it doesn't

270
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,879
have any issues then they know it's

271
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,759
going to grow well in the garden it's

272
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,720
going to flower in a reasonable time

273
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:44,159
it's going to have a desirable Aroma and

274
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,680
flavor and then it's going to be

275
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,879
desirable in the end it's going to be

276
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:49,278
desirable to smoke and consume or make

277
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:52,039
concentrates or edibles however you're

278
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:54,600
going to use this um the person giving

279
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:56,838
out the Clone is kind of responsible the

280
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,600
person receiving the Clone is trusting

281
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:01,399
that Giver to be responsible for vetting

282
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,759
clone you've got if you've got the fem

283
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,720
you've got six seeds don't give them a

284
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:07,360
clone until you've ran all of six of

285
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,560
those seeds and you've identified the

286
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,639
winner out of that pack that is your as

287
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:15,119
a grower as a grow Community member as a

288
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,078
a Ganja Farmer that is your

289
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,000
responsibility that's your due diligence

290
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:22,239
to run those seeds uh if and I this

291
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,759
stands for testers uh any seeds that

292
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,799
you're working with it is your

293
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,319
responsibility to run those before you

294
00:10:25,799 --> 00:10:29,319
give out a clone because the person

295
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,879
getting that clone like I said is

296
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,440
trusting you and relying on you that

297
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:34,000
that clone is like I said going to

298
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,720
flower in a reasonable time it's going

299
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,320
to have a good aroma and flavor and it's

300
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,440
going to be potent and it's not going to

301
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,160
have any problems but keep an eye on

302
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,519
these plants and don't pass along any

303
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,759
problematic plants to your friends and

304
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,560
that goes for any seed the any seed

305
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:49,679
could be problematic any seed could also

306
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,399
be a gem but any seed that you are

307
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,000
running make sure you run that before

308
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:54,559
you pass out a clone to your friends and

309
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,879
I don't just say this with tester seeds

310
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,599
I don't just say this because this is my

311
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,639
new creation I don't I'm not trying to

312
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,920
hoard this or do any gatekeeping I don't

313
00:10:59,639 --> 00:11:02,879
want you to give your friend a

314
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:04,958
problematic plant before you've even ran

315
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,759
it run it grow it grow it a couple of

316
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,159
times uh maybe you don't want to give it

317
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:10,039
to him because it's not worth giving to

318
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,639
them maybe it'll give them problems or

319
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:14,078
just maybe just maybe it's so freaking

320
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,360
amazing that you want it all for

321
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:17,159
yourself and you don't even want to

322
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,800
share it and if you give it to them now

323
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,879
and you haven't even finished it maybe

324
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,519
you're giving out something that's going

325
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:23,360
to set you apart from the market that

326
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,078
may have helped you out in the future I

327
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,079
try not to uh what is it called

328
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:28,599
encourage gatekeeping here but that is a

329
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:30,319
thing that may happen sometimes I don't

330
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,320
give away my favorite plants cuz they're

331
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,120
my favorite plants that's what separates

332
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,839
me as a grower as a breeder I've got

333
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,720
this plant that's what makes us stand

334
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,160
out so run all those seeds find what you

335
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,720
enjoy find what you like and then once

336
00:11:41,159 --> 00:11:44,919
you know that those plants are good

337
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,120
there's no problems then consider giving

338
00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:48,439
a clone and yes I know uh when people

339
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,078
see that word skunk they're going to

340
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,040
want a clone already but uh do them the

341
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:56,159
favor and run it first do the feno hunt

342
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,599
for them um maybe just maybe involve

343
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,879
them in your selection when it comes

344
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,839
time so you're going to grow the six

345
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,838
seeds right uh probably one of them will

346
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:04,680
get cold early on you'll run five of

347
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:06,079
them uh one of them is not going to be

348
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:08,239
the top one that you want you got four

349
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,919
to choose from bring your friend over

350
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,079
when you do the pheno uh selection when

351
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:13,000
you're smoking these when you're doing

352
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:14,719
the smoke test and the sampling bring

353
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,159
your buddy over maybe you like clone

354
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,079
number one and your buddy likes clone

355
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,838
number two the best you can easily give

356
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,159
him that clone or that mother plant and

357
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,120
then you both have the skunk that you

358
00:12:21,159 --> 00:12:24,439
desire and you can both grow that uh you

359
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,639
can have your differences and your

360
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,279
similarities but I'm rambling and the

361
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,278
point here is um not just with test

362
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:33,320
seeds but with any seeds don't give out

363
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,639
clones until you fully ran that plant

364
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,480
and vetted it like I said a moment ago

365
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:39,278
as the Clone Giver people are trusting

366
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,199
you that is a lot of trust they're

367
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:42,679
trusting that you have ran this plant

368
00:12:41,198 --> 00:12:45,399
you verified that it's a female there

369
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:47,239
are no interx traits uh it flowers in a

370
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:49,519
reasonable time it's going to give you a

371
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:52,079
desirable Aroma and flavor and a nice

372
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,159
buzz and anything that is required for

373
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,078
your needs I don't know if you're

374
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:56,838
growing for concentrates Edibles

375
00:12:55,078 --> 00:12:59,958
topicals whatever but does it fit the

376
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,279
bill they're trusting you and also so

377
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,759
they're trusting you to give them a

378
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,720
clone that does not have problems no

379
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:08,720
bugs uh no pathogens definitely no hop

380
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,480
late and vroid definitely no russet

381
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,600
mites they're relying on you to give

382
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:16,039
them that clean clone so make sure you

383
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,639
provide all of those Services hit all of

384
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:19,879
those markers as somebody giving out a

385
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,519
clone and the person receiving the Clone

386
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:25,120
also it is also your responsibility to

387
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:27,240
treat that clone as if it has got every

388
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,198
problem on the planet when you get that

389
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,120
clone treat it treat it multiple times

390
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:33,399
times try to give it some isolation some

391
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,000
quarantine away from population that way

392
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,360
if it does have spider mites russet

393
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,278
mites thrips fungus snats whatever put

394
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,959
it put that clone in another area and

395
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:42,838
then keep an eye on it daily and treat

396
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:44,159
it and see if you see any bugs on it

397
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,639
once you know that it's clean then you

398
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:47,399
can put it in the general population

399
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:49,519
with the rest of your plants but that is

400
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,078
your responsibility as the Clone

401
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,959
receiver um I trust all my Bros I want

402
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,958
to believe in all my friends but if

403
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,679
anybody gives me a clone if my Mama gave

404
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,838
me a clone I would still treat that

405
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:02,198
clone like it's got thrips pites fungus

406
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,480
snats hlate and vroid and powdery mildew

407
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:05,838
all over it I would leave it in honestly

408
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,120
it would sit right here on this table

409
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,440
for a couple of days is where the new

410
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,679
clones come uh I mix up a spray solution

411
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
I spray the [ __ ] out of them and they

412
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:14,078
sit right here they don't go into the

413
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,159
grow space for several days and I look

414
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,599
at them I pay a lot of attention to them

415
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,198
uh just quarantine isolate uh that way

416
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,199
if there is a problem I can identify it

417
00:14:20,198 --> 00:14:24,120
and get rid of that clone or I can treat

418
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,559
it until that problem's gone then put it

419
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,600
in with the rest but any clone that

420
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,439
comes in like I said if it's my mom if

421
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,920
it's Mike if it's my best friend if it's

422
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,279
from uh any dispensary every clone that

423
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,039
comes in I am very suspect of that clone

424
00:14:34,278 --> 00:14:37,919
I don't care who you are it's my

425
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:41,319
responsibility and my fault if something

426
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,360
goes wrong so uh my buddy Ty that was a

427
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,160
long ramble my dude uh make sure you

428
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,079
check your inbox I've got your email

429
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,159
address here so that means that you've

430
00:14:47,078 --> 00:14:52,198
got a coupon code for a free pack of iy

431
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:54,039
genetics premium seeds at iy direct.com

432
00:14:52,198 --> 00:14:56,278
let me wrap this up and make sure that

433
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:59,120
we got everything here um I'm wondering

434
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,039
if it's cool to give away a clone um no

435
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,879
it's not cool to give away a clone yet

436
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,240
uh I did reply to my friend Ty I said

437
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,639
dude at least wait until I release that

438
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,480
strain before you start giving out

439
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,000
clones that would be polite but like

440
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,879
I've said in the past those are yours

441
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,958
and you can honestly do whatever you

442
00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:15,799
want with them you paid for them I can't

443
00:15:13,958 --> 00:15:18,399
sell you a car until you not to drive

444
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:20,399
fast that doesn't seem right but run

445
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,440
them grow them be a good friend be a

446
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,799
good grower a good cannabis community

447
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,199
community member then share those cuts

448
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,479
all right let's keep the party going I

449
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,439
do have another great question here

450
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:33,440
right in front of me this one also came

451
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,920
from the growel tab on edirect decom

452
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,920
this one came from a friend who wants to

453
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,958
be called 420 Lane big shout out to 420

454
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,039
Lane it's a general grow question that

455
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,679
says yo Rasta Jeff so I've been popping

456
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,000
beans now for a while but for some

457
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:49,318
reason I did not get a cut of this

458
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,720
particular phenotype I'm going to stop

459
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:53,679
myself right there I always preach to

460
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,560
cut a clone any time you're grown from

461
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,318
seed or you get a clone from your buddy

462
00:15:55,559 --> 00:15:59,439
or you're growing something new when you

463
00:15:57,318 --> 00:16:00,879
run it take a clone from it because you

464
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,959
never know that could be the most

465
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,039
amazing plant that you have ever grown

466
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,518
and like our friend here they're

467
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,039
realizing 7 and 1/2 weeks in this plant

468
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,919
is going to be a boss and now they don't

469
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,360
have a clone of it and they're already

470
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:12,759
starting to get heartbroken it's only

471
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,720
seven and a half weeks in we'll read

472
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:16,600
more uh but they don't have a clone they

473
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,920
already are regretting not getting a

474
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,399
clone so I always say take a clone if

475
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,679
you didn't there's another option we

476
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,600
will talk about it right now it says

477
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:27,559
she's now seven and a half weeks into

478
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:30,360
flower if I take a cut from this plant

479
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:32,879
will it root yes the answer is

480
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,720
absolutely yes it will root uh I would

481
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,318
take a clone somewhere near the bottom

482
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,440
just take a nice clone like you normally

483
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:39,838
would uh clip it dip it stick it clean

484
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,560
it up quite a bit at the top so there's

485
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,199
not a whole bunch of extra foliage up

486
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:46,958
there and that clone will root my

487
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:49,639
recommendation is to put that clone in a

488
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,278
turbo cloner an easy cloner an autoc

489
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,120
cloner some sort of aeroponic cloner um

490
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,759
I've noticed they root much more quickly

491
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:59,759
in that style and also they seem to

492
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,720
reveg more quickly in the easy cloner

493
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,839
recently I was experimenting with some

494
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,640
plants I had a plant I did something

495
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,439
similar but I did um enough plants to

496
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,600
where I didn't have room to take as many

497
00:17:08,439 --> 00:17:12,919
clones as I was running plants my theory

498
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:16,240
was just that I was going to reveg so

499
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,439
what I did was um I grew a plant I

500
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,120
flowered it um I finished it I harvested

501
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:22,519
it I left two buds on the bottom or two

502
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,958
branches on the bottom right um I wanted

503
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:26,519
to rev this plant I cut one of those

504
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,480
branches off and put it in the easy

505
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:30,720
cloner and I left that other Branch just

506
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,640
sticking off the pot just like it was

507
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,839
guess which one of those plants reved

508
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,360
way more quickly the plant in the easy

509
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:41,639
cloner was Stronger Faster more robust

510
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:43,678
and it reved way more quickly so I would

511
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,160
recommend taking a cut and putting it in

512
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,600
an easy cloner if that is possible and

513
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,720
that plant will root and rev very

514
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:53,279
quickly in that easy cloner if you give

515
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,400
it 24 hours of light I understand that

516
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:58,200
may not be possible 186 will work 24

517
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,080
hours of light would really speed up

518
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,080
your uh reveg process so take that clone

519
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,038
put it in that easy cloner if possible

520
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,279
put that under 24 hours of light in that

521
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:10,240
easy cloner it will will rev quite

522
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:12,558
quickly for you now I keep saying the

523
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:15,319
word rev if you're not able to get that

524
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,079
clone you can always rev that flowering

525
00:18:15,319 --> 00:18:19,038
plant that you're working with the way

526
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:20,960
that I recommend doing it is when you're

527
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,000
going to harvest there'll be um a couple

528
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,519
of buds at the bottom just cut off most

529
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,359
of the plant leave three maybe five

530
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,599
thumb siiz buds at the bottom I got big

531
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,678
thumbs they don't even have to be this

532
00:18:28,599 --> 00:18:32,399
big big but leave some thumbs with

533
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:33,919
foliage on them you want some leaves and

534
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,080
stuff on those plants cuz that is what's

535
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,200
going to receive the Sun or the light

536
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,158
and that's what's going to tell that

537
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,159
plant to begin the Rev process so chop

538
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:43,760
the plant down leave three to five

539
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,840
little tiny bottom buds at the bottom of

540
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,038
the plant and rev those those should rev

541
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:50,839
quite quickly for you another tip that

542
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:53,038
you can do and I get a lot of

543
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:55,639
controversy when I talk about this

544
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,679
before you harvest about 7 to 10 days

545
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,840
before Harvest you can put your lights

546
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:03,200
back on an 18 hours on and 6 hours off

547
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,038
light cycle I know that sounds wild to

548
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,080
some people but what that's going to do

549
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:09,400
is going to give your plants more Photon

550
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,480
energy photons are the number one source

551
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,360
of energy for our plant if you do that

552
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,599
the last 7 to 10 days of the flowering

553
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,079
period you will bulk up your plants they

554
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,359
will get beefier they will get more

555
00:19:17,079 --> 00:19:22,000
dense and they may even finish a day or

556
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,319
two sooner now also what that is going

557
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,558
to do that is going to speed up your

558
00:19:24,319 --> 00:19:29,119
reveg process people are going to say

559
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:32,399
Rasta Jeff if I put my plants on 186 in

560
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:34,359
flower they will rev yes eventually they

561
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,120
will rev you're going to cut them down

562
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:38,000
before that but you're going to leave a

563
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,439
couple buds on the bottom that have now

564
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,880
gotten a huge head start on the reveg

565
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,320
process they will begin revegging much

566
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,240
sooner than a plant that did not have

567
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,119
186 at the end of flower that reveg

568
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,038
process um the buds are going to look

569
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,399
like [ __ ] for a little while uh nothing

570
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,319
will happen for a few days you'll put it

571
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,120
into the 186 you'll feed it give it some

572
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,960
nitrogen it's not going to do anything

573
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:59,678
after about 2 weeks you'll see coming

574
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:01,240
out of the top of the buds just little

575
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,880
shoots coming out little leaves coming

576
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:04,319
out of the top of the buds then those

577
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,440
will start growing longer then they'll

578
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:08,439
make Leaves they'll make curly Twisted

579
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,519
World leaves then eventually they'll

580
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,960
start making perfect little clones that

581
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:14,440
look just like little plants coming out

582
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:16,679
of there I recommend cloning those

583
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:18,600
little shoots and using those clones as

584
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:20,038
your new mother plant don't use that

585
00:20:18,599 --> 00:20:22,038
revegged one it's been through a little

586
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:23,679
bit of stress get those clones start

587
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:26,119
fresh with those clones that is your new

588
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,720
mother plant so the quick answer the

589
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:31,158
question was can I take a clone at week

590
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,798
7.5 yes you absolutely can uh the

591
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:35,520
quickest way to do that it will reveg

592
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,400
more quickly in the easy cloner and then

593
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:40,319
uh if that does not work for you just

594
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:42,120
simply reveg the entire plant this is

595
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,519
why I do recommend taking clones from

596
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:46,000
everything because you never know you

597
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,359
may have the next uh chem 91 you could

598
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,319
have the next Gorilla Glue you could

599
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:50,839
have the next arise uh you could have

600
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:53,200
the next Girl Scout cookies you never

601
00:20:50,839 --> 00:20:55,759
know what you might be growing so always

602
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,640
take those clones all right ladies and

603
