78
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:55,989
review goes like this I love the way

79
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,299
Rasta Jeff combines humor and

80
00:02:55,989 --> 00:03:00,609
information to teach the listener about

81
00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:02,468
best grow techniques he walks the fine

82
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:04,959
line between take this seriously and

83
00:03:02,468 --> 00:03:06,818
don't be afraid to make mistakes he also

84
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,250
walks you through the details a new

85
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:10,628
grower needs to know he also conveys a

86
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,519
ton of credibility

87
00:03:10,628 --> 00:03:15,098
I trust he knows what he's talking about

88
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,590
I also have purchased from Ira genetics

89
00:03:15,098 --> 00:03:18,908
and the product is world-class keep it

90
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:20,979
up you know I feel like I may have read

91
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:22,478
that review before but that's worth

92
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:24,729
reading again if I did read that on the

93
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,409
show Erica true north dude thank you for

94
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,669
the great review I'm glad that you

95
00:03:26,408 --> 00:03:28,989
notice a little bit of humor in there

96
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,639
while I'm trying to teach and I'm glad

97
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,709
that you're learning from me I've said

98
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:35,079
it before but I was not a good student

99
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:37,299
in school I always want to learn but I

100
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,760
did not like being at school so I try to

101
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,650
educate in a way that I think can keep

102
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:43,000
people's attention so I try to put some

103
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,889
jokes in there I try to keep it

104
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,539
entertaining and funny then you say I

105
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:48,159
walk that fine line between take this

106
00:03:46,539 --> 00:03:48,758
seriously and don't be afraid to make

107
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,459
mistakes

108
00:03:48,758 --> 00:03:53,198
it's your garden we're not doing brain

109
00:03:51,459 --> 00:03:55,120
surgery we're not doing rocket science

110
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,469
we're growing some cannabis so don't be

111
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,000
afraid to make a few mistakes in the

112
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,949
grow room that's how you learn the most

113
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,469
you don't learn anything if things go

114
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:04,120
smoothly every time so do some

115
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:05,590
experiments and challenge yourself and I

116
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,329
think that's how you learn the most

117
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,188
now you also say that I walk you through

118
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:11,199
the details that a new grower needs to

119
00:04:09,188 --> 00:04:12,938
know yes I want to get everybody up to

120
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,650
speed I know that not everybody has

121
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:16,358
experience in a commercial environment I

122
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:18,430
want to grab everybody by the hand and

123
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,168
walk them right through a grow and make

124
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,459
sure they know what they're doing the

125
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:23,319

and the review goes like this if you

212
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:20,560
have a desire to learn about cannabis in

213
00:07:18,788 --> 00:07:22,689
more aspects than simply learning to

214
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,819
grow then this is a good podcast to

215
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:27,160
start with although rasta Jeff does

216
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:29,769
focus most of the podcast time on the

217
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:32,199
cultivation of cannabis it still has a

218
00:07:29,769 --> 00:07:34,598
has savory nugs of the culture in

219
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:36,728
general on the show he is very thorough

220
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,800
and has made me a believer in his

221
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:41,469
capabilities to provide excellent

222
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,770
quality knowledge and entertainment his

223
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,030
arise is fire Mike occasionally comes on

224
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,728
the show with some great information

225
00:07:46,029 --> 00:07:50,379
regarding the legal issues and also how

226
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:52,930
to fight for your rights in the City

227
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:55,120
Council council meetings much respect

228
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,360
and much love to white Mike and Rasta

229
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,829
Jeff for his amazing podcast hey that is

230
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,240
a great review thanks for all that Ridge

231
00:07:59,829 --> 00:08:03,550
monkey there's a lot of great stuff in

232
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,680
there I do focus mostly on growing

233
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,509
because I am a cultivator I've got a lot

234
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,788
of grow experience and I feel that that

235
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:12,339
was what was lacking in the cannabis

236
00:08:09,788 --> 00:08:14,379
podcast area we needed somebody to talk

237
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:17,288
about growing there are plenty of market

238
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:18,728
reviews and politics stuff going on

239
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,500
there wasn't somebody out there talking

240
00:08:18,728 --> 00:08:22,240
about growing so I wanted to fill that

241
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,889
niche I've got a lot of growing

242
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,840
experience I've got a lot of teaching

243
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:27,970
experience I felt like I would be a

244
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,209
great person for that so I do focus

245
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:33,158
mostly on the cultivation part but I'm

246
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:35,319
glad you find that there are nuggets of

247
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,088
our culture in there and I also am glad

248
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,278
that you appreciate Mike being on the

249
00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:41,680
show I really love that you said that

250
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:44,019
Maya rises fire and I also appreciate

251
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,120
that you said I have made you a believer

252
00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:48,639
in my capabilities that means a lot to

253
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,379
me so thanks for that support and thanks

254
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,000

the headline is genuine and informative

265

again we got a five-star rating the

266
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,490
review says rasta Jeff is both honest

267
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:16,680
and knowledgeable he doesn't push

268
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,778
sponsors and doesn't hate on others you

269
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:21,028
won't be let down by an episode every

270
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:23,039
show has a genuine tone and you can feel

271
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:25,889
the care and time that has gone into

272
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:27,899
each production five stars is a perfect

273
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:30,659
rating for this podcast in this genre

274
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,159

I don't push sponsors there's no need

282
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,039
for that if I there was a product that I

283

really supported that wanted to sponsor

284

me thanks for becoming a better grower

302
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:24,269
and also thanks for the great rating and

303
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:26,338
review all right I've got another one

304
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:28,889
for you this one is headlined Irie army

305
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:31,800
for the win we've got five stars this

306
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:34,889
one is left by Ivy Zilla and the review

307
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:37,049
goes like this it occurs to me that I

308
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:39,269
have heard every episode at least once

309
00:10:37,049 --> 00:10:41,039
but I don't think I've ever left a

310
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:43,889
review so this is mine

311
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,629
five stars all the way I stumbled upon

312
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:48,180
Rasta Jeff through an internet search

313
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:50,009
for local Suicide Girls that may be a

314
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:51,808
weird way to find a cannabis podcast

315
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:53,579
creator but that's how it worked for me

316
00:10:51,808 --> 00:10:55,230
I know how that worked out I used to

317
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:56,878
have some friends who were in the

318
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,039
Suicide Girls group and we did a little

319
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,319
thing together there's a photo shoot and

320
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:02,730
some cannabis things happening there so

321
00:11:01,318 --> 00:11:04,558
I understand how that worked I remember

322
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:06,089
that that was quite a while ago the

323
00:11:04,558 --> 00:11:07,569
review goes on to say I also enjoy

324
00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:10,089
listening to Jeff and his

325
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:12,639
as they get lifted and talk about

326
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:14,800
cannabis I recently moved my family from

327
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,289
Colorado to a state that is in the early

328
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,240
days of medical use I especially love

329
00:11:17,289 --> 00:11:21,578
the episodes that talk about standing up

330
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,039
for the creation of new cannabis laws in

331
00:11:21,578 --> 00:11:26,229
your immediate area I feel strongly that

332
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:28,299
the entire country needs to have avenues

333
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:31,060
for responsible adults to acquire

334
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:32,708
cannabis legally and safely we're

335
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:34,869
starting a new year and while the

336
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:36,818
political climate is unpleasant it's

337
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,289
definitely time for the irie army to

338
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:40,448
stand up and be heard

339
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:42,399
safe cannabis for everyone thank you for

340
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:45,458

just take a few dabs and I answer

411
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,399
cannabis questions we hang out sometimes

412

00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:13,509
really goofy sometimes it's really funny

414
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,709
