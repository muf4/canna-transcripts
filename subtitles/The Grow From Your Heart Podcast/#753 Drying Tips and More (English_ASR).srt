that is a brand new web store we are

64
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,400
working out a couple of kinks but i

65
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,719
think things are going quite smoothly

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,640
for how new and how busy it was i think

67
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,239
we got it pretty much under control

68
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,919
please be patient while we do work out

69
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,280
some kinks if you ordered and it took a

70
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,598
minute to get a response or get the

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,199
details you needed i do apologize i

72
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,280
think at this point we've got most of

73
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:33,359
those kinks worked out but once again it

74
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,120
is a new website it is a new service

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
please bear with me while we get that

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,599
going also a lot of people have told me

77
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,680
that things are sold out yes i only put

78
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,598
enough things on there that i can manage

79
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,280
it is mostly me doing that so i've got

80
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,359
to be able to manage those orders i am a

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,000
busy person i only put as much on there

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,360
as i think i can fulfill most things are

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,519

all right that is enough rambling here

116
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
at the start of the show i did say that

117
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,158
i had some great emails to read in this

118
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,598
episode let's jump right into that part

119
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:12,000
this one comes from a friend who would

120
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:15,359
rather remain anonymous it goes a little

121
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,918
bit like this it says yo rasta jeff yo

122
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,040
what's up bro i'll admit this grow is

123
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,639
one of my worst grows in a long time but

124
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,120
with all of your help over the past

125
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,519
couple of months i feel this is my best

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,600
grow as a cultivator that is a really

127
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,279
strong statement our friend is admitting

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,199
that this is one of their worst groves

129
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,279
in a long time the grow is not

130
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,439
up to par it's one of the worst but they

131
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:40,000
feel it is their best grow as a

132
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,439
cultivator in my mind i can imagine how

133
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,279
that would work sometimes i've played

134
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,879
gigs as a musician or i was like that

135
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:46,879
gig totally sucked i didn't play worth

136
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,639
the [ __ ] but i learned more at that gig

137
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,079
where i didn't play well than i did at

138
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,000
the gigs when i felt like a rock star

139
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:54,079
and all the music came out super smooth

140
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,079
smoothly however it should have been i

141
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,918
feel like i learned more at those rough

142
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,439
gigs i feel like i learn more when the

143
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,519
job is hard i've talked about it before

144
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:03,279
i learn more when i make mistakes if you

145
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:04,399
do [ __ ] right you just learned that

146
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,319
you're doing it right if you make

147
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:07,279
mistakes you go what i got to reassess

148
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:10,000
and figure some [ __ ] out there are

149
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,599
details and steps i'm missing or adding

150
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,120
so you got to figure that out so our

151
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,479
friend said that this was their worst

152
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,879
grow but they feel like it was their

153
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,199
best grow as a cultivator so they are

154
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,079
growing inside as a person mentally

155
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,840
physically spiritually and as a grower

156
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,079
they're becoming a better grower even

157
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:28,239
though they did have a bad run just now

158
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,639
it says my plants are [ __ ] but i am

159
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,918
growing and that is that's important uh

160
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,160
you're still growing you're going to

161
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:36,000
continue to grow your life will continue

162
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,320
uh your mind will grow your body will

163
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,800
age the life will go on and guess what

164
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:42,478
you get to grow more plants

165
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,879
i'm sure you learned something that you

166
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,839
should not do again in this last run and

167
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,000
i'm sure you learned something you

168
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:50,159
should try again in the last run so as

169
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,720
long as you're growing with every grow

170
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
it's okay to have some mistakes some uh

171
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,400
to totally ruin a crop that's okay

172
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,439
occasionally just don't do it too many

173
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,599
times

174
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,680
learn from it make sure you learn from

175
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,680
it so my friend is growing as a person

176
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,160
and that is what matters the most it

177
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,000
says i feel like you and he's saying me

178
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,400
says ross to jeff i feel like you spent

179
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,680
as much work on my grow as i did this

180
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,839
run

181
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,680
ah that is awesome bro i don't uh i

182
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,599
can't take any credit for your grow i

183
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,000
put out a podcast i did correspond with

184
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,919
you through emails but you did all the

185
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
work my dude you're in there turning the

186
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,359
knobs picking the leaves watering the

187
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,680
plants doing the things you're doing

188
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,160
that so i appreciate that you feel like

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
i did a lot of work but ah i've done the

190
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,360
work i'm doing the work in my grow and

191
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,439
then talking to you about what i do and

192
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,759
it just so happens that it works

193
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,519
give yourself a lot of credit you're

194
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,520
realizing that your grow is not what you

195
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:43,279
want it to be but you're realizing that

196
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:46,000
you are learning from it and that as a

197
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,359
as a person that is a big growth step so

198
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,439
don't give me too much credit for the

199
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,598
grow it says i just wanted to say thank

200
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,839
you you probably saved me from quitting

201
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,598
growing or having a breakdown or joining

202
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:58,318
a cult i really think that's a funny

203
00:06:55,598 --> 00:07:00,079
message i do appreciate it um

204
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,000
i get a lot of messages from people who

205
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:03,839
tell me how much i help their garden how

206
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,478
much we improve their process improve

207
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:07,679
their yield potency flavor aroma

208
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:09,839
enjoyment

209
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,319
but to hear that our friend has had a

210
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,719
terrible crop experience but is having a

211
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,400
good learning and a good spiritual

212
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,319
mental emotional

213
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:20,079
building experience they're growing to

214
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,199
learn that i'm guiding somebody even

215
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:23,519
though they're having one of the worst

216
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,439
grows ever this girl is one of my worst

217
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:27,359
yeah in a long time but they're still

218
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,199
feeling like they're making growth

219
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,038
and a lot of it is because

220
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,360
they i'm spending time teaching them

221
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:35,360
that is awesome that recharges me uh

222
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,360
that is like giving me some fresh

223
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,598
nutrients giving me a dose of recharge

224
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,840
so dude you asked to remain anonymous i

225
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,120
will honor that wish but bro thank you

226
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,359
big fist bump for the words of

227
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,639
encouragement i do appreciate that all

228
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,240
right we don't need to ramble too much

229
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,120
i've got another message here in front

230
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,280
of me

231
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,918
this one it does not have their name on

232
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,638
it so we will not include that but it

233
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,639
says okay my dude that's how it starts

234
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,000
it said if you had to and this one um if

235
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,360
you've got kids in the room uh cover

236
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,519
their ears now because i'm gonna say

237
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,879
some crass [ __ ] this is uh kind of a fun

238
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,560
email that's why i included it here in

239
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,840
the thursday show is this a monday or a

240
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,399
thursday show this will be a thursday

241
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,839
show uh so if you got kids in the room

242
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,038
maybe cover up their ears right now or

243
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:14,239
turn it down or put your airpods in

244
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,000
because this one's going to be fun but

245
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,319
there will be some foul language the

246
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,160
question is if you had to and this is a

247
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,919
game that uh maybe it's not the best

248
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,439
game it's definitely not a socially or

249
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,439
politically correct game but i'm sure

250
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,038
we're all aware of the game [ __ ] mary

251
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,800
kill we're gonna do a quick round to

252
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,439
[ __ ] mary kill here on the podcast it

253
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,360
goes if you had to either [ __ ] mary kill

254
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,879
one of these girls who would it be and

255
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
this is the only way that this works out

256
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:38,879
to be appropriate because he has chosen

257
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:40,958
strains we are choosing plants not

258
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,320
people which is the only reason i chose

259
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,359
to read this one if it were people we

260
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,440
would have thrown this away we're not

261
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
going to play that but it goes a lot

262
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,080
like this [ __ ] mary kill my three

263
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,839
options are the moon tower prana and

264
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,959
morning do which means i gotta choose

265
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,240
one to [ __ ] one to marry one to kill

266
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,838
um

267
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,639
right off the top of my head we're

268
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,480
killing prana let me explain why

269
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:04,080
there's nothing wrong with prana there's

270
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,080
nothing wrong with flow there's nothing

271
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,560
wrong with the rise the plants that do

272
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,480
make this cross of prana the reason i'm

273
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,319
killing prana right off the bat is

274
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,480
because i ran a dispensary in 2008 mike

275
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,959
and i big up to my buddy white mike uh

276
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,720
shout out to tom also and chris ann and

277
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:21,679
tree uh the people from that dispensary

278
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,080
miss you guys we were running a

279
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,919
dispensary in 2008

280
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,120
and we grew

281
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,559
a mountain of flow we had truckloads of

282
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,360
flow i don't even know how much there

283
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,278
was i didn't care there was a lot of it

284
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,879
we were growing it we were smoking it we

285
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:38,080
were selling it we were turning it into

286
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,480
edibles we were turning it into

287
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,160
concentrates we were doing anything you

288
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
could possibly do with the weed plant we

289
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,919
were making it out of flow

290
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,399
flow was a great plant flo was the

291
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,159
parent of prana so when i smell prana i

292
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,278
smell flow so let me explain why i'm so

293
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,838
sick of it

294
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,159
i had a lot of it in my home i had a lot

295
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,480
of it in my retail

296
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,039
sales place my dispensary i had a lot of

297
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,839
it in my commercial grow i could not get

298
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,679
away from flow everywhere i went it

299
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,839
smelled like flow

300
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,599
the plant grew beautifully the plant

301
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,839
grew perfectly you couldn't ask for

302
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,320
anything more it was robust it took a

303
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,720
beating it took abuse i took temperature

304
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,720
swings it took bad vpd it could handle

305
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,320
anything you could handle it throw at it

306
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,240
it could handle bugs the spider mites

307
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,399
didn't like it i put out good fat

308
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,320
harvest it would finish early it would

309
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,958
be done before everybody else especially

310
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,440
outdoors the herb tasted real good the

311
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,000
buzz was real nice the aroma was great

312
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,200
until it wasn't one day i woke up and i

313
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
was like

314
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,920
all i can [ __ ] smell is flow right

315
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,278
now and i don't want to smell flow right

316
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,439
now but i had

317
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,039
allegedly a lot of flow weed we won't

318
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,720
even talk about how much i had had a lot

319
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:48,319
of it and i was like i can't just get

320
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
rid i mean i could sell it but it's got

321
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,120
to sell it it's not going anywhere for a

322
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,319
minute it's got to sit here for a day or

323
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,639
two until i could drive it to where it

324
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,040
needs to be so the weed is just stinking

325
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,559
up my house and all i can smell is flow

326
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,719

335
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,399
was done with flow and flow makes up

336
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,760
prana after i made prana i put out a

337
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,958
bunch of the seeds and i made sure that

338
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,879
they were awesome and then guess what i

339
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,399
did i chopped down that flow plant i'm

340

344
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,480

405
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,958
voice is a little bit dry i think it was

406
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:34,480
i was outdoors doing some outdoor things

407
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,399
and i was talking quite loud and i feel

408
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,000
like i may have done a little bit of

409
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,559
work on the throat here on the voice

410
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,720
here not sounding like the radio dj i'm

411
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,039

sending the messages i'm always going to

421
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:06,799
troll you and pick on you that means

422
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,879
that we're friends j.h this message goes

423
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,479
a lot like this it says rasta jeff and

424
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,519
the episode about moon tower you

425
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,839
mentioned that if you leave some

426
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,919
phenotypes and too small of a pot they

427
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,360
may stretch can you please elaborate on

428
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,278
that statement

429
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
and then it says is the goal to choose a

430
00:14:19,278 --> 00:14:24,879
pot that will allow for daily waterings

431
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,639
and dry backs in mid bloom so that is a

432
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,399
really good question i did mention in

433
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,198
the moon tower episode that some

434
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:32,799
phenotypes will ah what do they do they

435
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:35,039
get they stretch if you leave them in

436
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:36,559
too small of a pot not only this is not

437
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,639
just the moon tower this is cannabis

438
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,958
plants in general uh this is strain

439
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,680
dependent probably phenotype dependent

440
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,439
plant specific but cannabis plants if

441
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,078
you leave them in too small of a pot

442
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,399
they do begin to stretch they also could

443
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:52,559
autoflower on you if they become root

444
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,480
bound in that small pot it'll take a

445
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,838
couple of things if they're too root

446
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,519
bound and they don't have anywhere for

447
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,040
the roots to go and they're getting a

448
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,639
little bit shaded and not getting the

449
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,480
light that they want then they will

450
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,919
autoflower they'll go into flower on you

451
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,199
just because they're in survival mode

452
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:07,599
they're like hey

453
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,559
my feet can't grow i'm obviously limited

454
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,720
to size i'm not getting enough light

455
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,559
my only option now is to flower my whole

456
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,800
goal in life as a cannabis plant is to

457
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,239
either pollinate or get pollinated if

458
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:19,278
you got some female plants in there that

459
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,639
aren't living up to their best

460
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,159
conditions they're just going to say

461
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,360
[ __ ] it i'm going to go into flower

462
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,639
you're either going to pollinate me or

463
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,959
you're not and i'm getting out of here

464
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,399
this life sucks i'm ending it i'm not my

465
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,319
feet are stuck i'm not getting enough

466
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,078
light i'm not getting enough air my toes

467
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,680
are cramped i can't stretch out [ __ ]

468
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,679
this i'm done and the plant decides to

469
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:37,198
go into flour so some plants will

470
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,120
stretch if you leave them in too small

471
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,278
of a pot some will flower if you leave

472
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,639
them in too small of a pot for too long

473
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:43,919
the reason i said stretch in that

474
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,839
episode is because i was thinking about

475
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,439
them in too small of a pot pressed

476
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,040
together and the light is not

477
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,279
penetrating the canopy to get down to

478
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,120
those lower branches the lower leaves

479
00:15:51,278 --> 00:15:54,639
and all the plants are crushed together

480
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,919
so they just start stretching they know

481
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,680
there's light up there but they can't

482
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:59,360
get it down here because it's so crowded

483
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,879
so they just start going up hoping that

484
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
they can fight for some of that light

485
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,919
our plants naturally want to grow up

486
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,519
there are apical dominant plants they'll

487
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,958
get one main top and the branching will

488
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,799
try to reach up to that and keep up

489
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,479
that's why we top them take out that

490
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:12,078
main top the others have the opportunity

491
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,000
to compete they don't they know the top

492
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:15,838
is gone they all want to be the new king

493
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,839
so if we leave them too close together

494
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,959
too crowded in and too small of a pot

495
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,480
that gives them a really good

496
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,599
opportunity to start stretching they're

497
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,519
not getting the light that they could

498
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,040
get they're not going to branch out do

499
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,560
you look at people's gardens and you see

500
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:28,480
super tall skinny plants that the

501
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:30,000
branches went just out a little bit and

502
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,920
then straight up

503
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,240
a lot of that is because the plants were

504
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,240
either pushed way too close together

505
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
they were in too small of a pot or they

506
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,159
just were not getting enough light

507
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,519
overall if you do see those small pots

508
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,039
and they're really branches stretching

509
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,000
up real tall that should have been

510
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:49,198
flowered sooner or put into a larger pot

511
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,720
in my opinion so uh they stretch because

512
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,000
they're in too small of a pot because

513
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,519
they're getting root bound they're

514
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,759
trying to get up to the light they're

515
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,839
too crowded when they're too crowded the

516
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,680
number one source of everything for our

517
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,040
plants is light they want that light if

518
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,958
you put the light over there and put the

519
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,399
plant over here you'll notice over time

520
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:05,918
that plant leans that way and then

521
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,000
halfway through the day if you just move

522
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,839
the light over there way over there that

523
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
plant will start leaning toward that

524
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,879
they grow toward the light that's

525
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,078
naturally what they want to do so

526
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,400
they're going to stretch they're going

527
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,318
to do their best to get to the light if

528
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,519
you want to grow a vertical wall then do

529
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,279
put the light over there then the plants

530
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,959
will grow that way and up at the same

531
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,199
time that's not what we're doing here

532
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,880
that's not what we're talking about dude

533
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,160
thank you for the great question uh if

534
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,120
you've got any follow there is more to

535
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,120
this i was going to say if you got

536
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,639
follow-ups or more let me know but there

537
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,719
is already follow-ups and more that i

538
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,038
did almost skip and i apologize for that

539
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,360
it says is the goal to choose a pot that

540
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,319
will allow for daily waterings and dry

541
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:44,558
backs in mid bloom

542
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:46,798
that is not always the goal but that is

543
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,678
a good not a goal but a good thing to

544
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,200
have honestly in my personal grow um

545
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,960
some of the larger pots don't get

546
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,038
watered every single day but that's a

547
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,640
personal grow and i like to be able to

548
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,720
flood them and leave for the weekend and

549
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,440
come back and the plants aren't dead in

550
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,160
a commercial grow i definitely want to

551
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,000
water every morning and i want them dry

552
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,679
by the time i get back in the morning if

553
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,279
not by the time i leave a lot of times

554
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,600
in a commercial grow

555
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,200
week six seven eight nine in flower we

556
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,639
will water right when we get there at

557
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,720
seven or eight in the morning and then

558
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,240
water again at six or seven before we

559
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,000
leave that way we know they're not going

560
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,519
to be crunchy again when we get there at

561
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,679
seven six eight seven in the morning

562
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:25,038
again when we show up because a lot of

563
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,600
those big plants we're running three

564
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:30,558
gallon pots but we're also pulling 2 000

565
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,319
to 3 000 gram wet plants they're wet

566
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:35,279
don't don't start judging talking [ __ ]

567
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,678
they're wet but imagine how much a 3 000

568
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:39,200
gram wet plant weighs those are they're

569
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,960
four or five feet tall they're huge

570
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,640
bushy plants they drink up a lot of

571
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,558
water and they're only in a three gallon

572
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,320
pot so we're watering those once or

573
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,879
twice a day

574
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,720
in my personal grow i'm using soilless

575
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,039
mix it's basically a soilless mix with a

576
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,880
bunch of perlite i want to keep that one

577
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,879
kind of wet for a longer time than i do

578
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,039
the commercial grow like i said i like

579
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,880
to i'll use a bigger pot than i need to

580
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,400
and i'll flood that [ __ ] all i like to

581
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,520
leave town i go i like to do a lot of

582
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,360
stuff on the weekends and i don't want

583
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,359
to interrupt my weekend so i like to

584
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,798
give them a big fat watering on friday

585
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:09,918
then i'll just take a peek at them over

586
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:11,279
the weekend and i can tell if they're

587
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,799
cool if they need anything you can look

588
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:14,558
at them through the camera see what's

589
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:16,160
going on but i know that monday they're

590
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:18,240
gonna make it until monday then they'll

591
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,240
need some water first thing monday

592
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,400
morning so i use the bigger pots using

593
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,359
soilless mix of course in cocoa i do

594
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,960
want that more rapid wet and dry time so

595
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,119
that's another really good example of

596
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,600
some of the differences that i use in a

597
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,678
commercial grow and a private grow a big

598
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,678
grow a small grow and the bigger grow

599
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,000
i'm definitely using cocoa three gallon

600
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,679
pots auto watering system and a small

601
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,599
personal grow depending on where it is

602
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,640
or whose it is or who's managing it

603
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:45,918
probably three five or seven gallon pots

604
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,360
generally it's threes and fives

605
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,038
depending on what i'm doing sometimes

606
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,558
we'll put some sevens in there if we're

607
00:19:49,038 --> 00:19:52,240
really limited on plant counts we'll

608
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:54,798
just put seven gallon pots to make the

609
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,240
plants much larger but generally

610
00:19:54,798 --> 00:20:00,558
i'm using soilless mix and i'm going um

611
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,079
my water on friday and then i can water

612
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:04,558
again on monday and then i'll need one

613
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,558
more watering mid-week usually with the

614
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,319
soilless mix all right there we go i

615
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,839
feel like we've wrapped up that question

616
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:11,519

to make improvements and adjustments all

628
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,440
right i do have another message right

629
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,080
here in front of me this is a good one

630
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,840
it says is this an old myth or real in

631
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:42,558
your opinion that is a great way to

632
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:45,199
start a question on a cannabis podcast

633
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,960
it says when drying cannabis still on

634
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,279
the branches hanging so it sounds like

635
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,120
we've chopped down the plant but all of

636
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,798
the herb is still on the bush and it's

637
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:55,439
just hanging upside down so you just got

638
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,918
a cut down plant hanging upside down i

639
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:00,240
wait until i can snap the stems then i

640
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,240
cut each branch into small enough pieces

641
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,038
so they can be placed in tupperware and

642
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,200
an attempt to extend the drying period

643
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,960
okay this makes sense so far you hang

644
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,880
them until the stems pop then you cut

645
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,720
them into smaller sections put them in a

646
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,880
tupperware container in an attempt to

647
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,400
extend the drying period opening and

648
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,640
closing the tupperware as needed to

649
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,640
control the final drying then trim

650
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,640
everything it says is one of the

651
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,240
is this one of those things i read 15

652
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,320
years ago and have been doing for

653
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,079
nothing or is this possibly

654
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:31,359
viable bro this is a really good

655
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:33,759
question and this is basically what i do

656
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:37,038
in a commercial grow environment imagine

657
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:38,480
if we cut down a room full of 3000 gram

658
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:40,798
plants they're wet i want to say that

659
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,200
again 3000 grams wet we're not pulling

660
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,440
down 3 000 gram dried plants that would

661
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,000
be [ __ ] cool but we're not doing it

662
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,440
they're wet plants so we're pulling down

663
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,038
somewhere it depends on what room we're

664
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,240
working in and what facility we're

665
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,879
working in generally it would be

666
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,359
somewhere between one and five hundred

667
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,760
three gallon pots with two thousand gram

668
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:02,240
3000 gram wet plants in there that is a

669
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,079
lot of space that's a lot of material

670
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,558
there is no way that the trim crew could

671
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:08,000
bang through that in a short timely

672
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,558
manner that's going to be a week worth

673
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,640
of work there's a lot of shuckin buckin

674
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,960
defoliating leafing fanning fine

675
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,840
trimming fine tuning a lot of [ __ ] to be

676
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,640
done to process all of that cannabis so

677
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,798
we do a very very similar process to

678
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,400
what you've got going on here

679
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:26,158
right before harvest we will go in the

680
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,480
room the day before harvest we spend the

681
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,840
full day defoliating just pull off all

682
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,679
those leaves and throw them right into

683
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,199
the floor just chop chop chop chip chop

684
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,640
as fast as you can i don't know why i

685
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
said chop there's no fingers i guess

686
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,480
it's or there's no scissors it's all

687
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,559
fingers it's

688
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,558
pull as fast as you can get every leaf

689
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,759
with a pedial anything you can pull off

690
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,359
take it off of there because we're going

691
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,440
to cut down the plants tomorrow we want

692
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:48,719
them naked so we cut off all the leaves

693
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,200
now the plants are naked they had their

694
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,440
hair cut tomorrow we come in and we chop

695
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,080
down every plant we hang it upside down

696
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,640
and we put it in the drying room in that

697
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,319
drying room i've got a humidifier and a

698
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,280
dehumidifier depending on the size of

699
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:05,519
the room maybe i've got multiple d huey

700
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:08,798
and humidifiers battling each other i

701
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:11,038
put them both on 50 humidity i've got

702
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,519
the humidifier cranking out 50 and the

703
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,839
dehumidifier sucking to make it 50. it

704
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,240
stays 50 relative humidity in that room

705
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:20,158
with those two pieces of gear constantly

706
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,000
battling keep all your filters clean

707
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,159
keep everything refreshed keep the water

708
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,759
in the humidifier do not use the

709
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,520
dehumidifier water back in the

710
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:30,158
humidifier that is funky i don't like

711
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,000
that don't do that but keep the machines

712
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,760
battling also keep a good temperature in

713
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,038
that place it is hard to balance the

714
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,279
temperature in a commercial grow

715
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:39,519
environment especially in colorado but

716
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,599
try to keep it around 60 65 degrees in

717
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,079
there if you can 70 will be okay let's

718
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,399
not go too much higher than that 75 is

719
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:48,879
gonna work but you know let's stay lower

720
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,960
if we can so i put all of the plants

721
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:53,520
hanging in that room until just like you

722
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,038
said the branches begin to snap some of

723
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,639
the bigger plants will take longer some

724
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:58,158
of the smaller plants will be quicker

725
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,919
that's a good thing because i've got so

726
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,200
many plants that i don't want them all

727
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,520
ready at the same time it gets

728
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,120
overwhelming so when [ __ ] starts popping

729
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,679
and crunching

730
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,599
i will start throwing it into large

731
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,200
sterlite bins it's the same thing you're

732
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,439
doing with the tupperware containers but

733
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,519
i'm using much larger bins they're

734
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,038
approximately i'm holding my arms out i

735
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,119
think that's about three feet they're

736
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,519
about three feet long they're about 18

737
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:23,038
inches deep and about 18 inches wide and

738
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:25,359
we just cut the plants down cut them

739
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,278
into small pieces get rid of all the big

740
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,199
sticks will get taken out let me talk

741
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:30,960
about something uh while i'm on while

742
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
this is in my brain

743
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,000
sometimes

744
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,640
i let the plants get a little bit

745
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,960
crispier than seems desirable because

746
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,960
when i put them in that big of a plant

747
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,558
with all that material there's a bunch

748
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,480
of bud there's a bunch of stick there's

749
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,240
still a bunch of leaf remaining when i

750
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:49,200
put all of that into the container and

751
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,519
seal it it really really reconstitutes

752
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,038
more than you may anticipate more than

753
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:55,440
you may assume

754
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,919
more than you may expect so

755
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,840
maybe let them get a little bit crispier

756
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,919
i may let them get a little bit crispier

757
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,439
than some growers may prefer before i

758
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,038
put it in that into that container

759
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,960
because i know it's going to remoisten

760
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,640
and reconstitute and it's not going to

761
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,400
be as dry as it looks and we're in a

762
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,520
commercial grow we're going to leave

763
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,640
we're going to go home for the night

764
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,879
we're going to come back in the next

765
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,120
morning i can't have too wet of a

766
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,120
product in a container sealed overnight

767
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,678
i would almost rather let it dry just a

768
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:23,439
little bit too much in that room than i

769
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,200
would put it in the container a little

770
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,440
bit too wet so that's something i wanted

771
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,038
to touch on i let it dry a little bit

772
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,400
too much because

773
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:32,158
i don't want the mold i'd rather a

774
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,519
little bit dry crispy weed that i can

775
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,760
re-moisten with the trick i'll talk

776
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,200
about in a moment then i would moldy

777
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,798
weed that's got to get thrown away and

778
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,640
never makes it to the shelf now if my

779
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,879
weed does get too dry

780
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,038
what do i do how do i fix this problem

781
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,120
it's really easy i go to the grow space

782
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:49,679
and i pull a few leaves off of a growing

783
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,678
plant big fan leaves and i drop those

784
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,759
right in with the dry weed and i seal it

785
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,000
back up now the moisture from that leaf

786
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,079
will re-moisten reconstitute my dried up

787
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,000
weed it won't give it a funky flavor or

788
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,158
aroma because guess what it's weed we're

789
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,519
using weed to remoisten the weed

790
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,120
i think it works beautifully so that's

791
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,759
one trick that i do so i'm on the same

792
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:09,519
path as you we've cut down the plants

793
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,679
we've taken off most of the leaves we

794
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,000
let it get crispy dry now we throw it

795
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,360
into these bins you've got the option do

796
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,880
you want to remove a lot of the big

797
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:18,798
stems or do you want to leave a lot of

798
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,880
the big stems at this time

799
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,400
if it's really dry leave them they'll

800
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,840
help remoisten everything nice and

801
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,759
evenly they'll move it'll move all the

802
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,038
moisture around real evenly to those

803
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,558
buds some of the bottoms will be more

804
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,798
wet the dries will be drier of course

805
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,399
but if it was all real dry it'll move it

806
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,158
around to the moisture is more even in

807
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,080
that container so if your sticks are

808
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,600
super dry pull them out if your sticks

809
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,439
are super or if they're super wet pull

810
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,359
them out if the sticks are dry put them

811
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,440
back in there but we cut off all the

812
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:45,119
leaves hang it upside down let it get

813
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,960
crunchy once it starts popping and going

814
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,678
crack on the stems we put it into the

815
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,440
containers then we seal it up then we've

816
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,278
got a guy it used to be mike's job mike

817
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,278
would be the leader of the trim crew

818
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:56,880
mike and myself would go through after

819
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,640
every break we take a break every two

820
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,919
hours when we come back from the break i

821
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,080
would get the crew going on what they

822
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,919
need to do then i myself and mike would

823
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,000
go into the dry and cure room and pop

824
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,400
open every container sometimes we would

825
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,558
have uh hundreds of uh big 32 quart i

826
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
forgot the size like 32 gallon i totally

827
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,079
forgot what how much fits in that [ __ ]

828
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,240
we'd have these big containers hundreds

829
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:19,678
of them we'd pop them all open and if

830
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,960
they need to be open for 10 minutes

831
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,240
they'd slide over there if they need to

832
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,319
be open for the rest of the day they

833
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,519
slide over there and we inspect every

834
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,359
single bin

835
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,798
then if they need to stay open we'll

836
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:30,879
just leave them open until tomorrow or

837
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,398
we'll close them up if they're fine they

838
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,720
just get sealed up and they get marked

839
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:36,959
don't open anymore now those bins can

840
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,038
sit basically indefinitely until the

841
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,480
trim crew is ready to get to them if

842
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,158
they're dry enough if there's still

843
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,240
moisture in there that could cause a

844
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,720
problem you do have to pop those

845
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,720
as needed i'd say daily hourly quarterly

846
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:51,120
however you feel is needed for that

847
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,360
particular product but once it gets to

848
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,879
that dry state um to where it's not

849
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,879
going to cause any mold problems it's

850
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,640
basically curing in that bin

851
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,799
it gets dry enough to where all i've got

852
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,799
to do is when the trim crew has time or

853
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,879
when one of my workers has time or

854
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,798
myself even when it's time we can just

855
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,480
pull that whole bin out set it on the

856
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:10,319
table we've got a guy that's really good

857
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,919
at shucking he just gets all the sticks

858
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:13,678
out and all the buds will be in a bucket

859
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,520
all the sticks will be in the trash so

860
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,038
then all the big buds go to one area the

861
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,278
small buds go to another and those get

862
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,720
processed but that can happen whenever

863
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,119
as long as we keep

864
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,798
those buds in that container in that

865
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,359
room where the equipment is fighting at

866
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,839
50 50 and the temperature is right those

867
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:31,519
buds will stay fine basically forever

868
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:33,119
i'm sure there's some sort of expiration

869
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,200
date and they pass their prime they

870
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,599
never last that long we get them dried

871
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,200
cured trimmed and sold before that but

872
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:40,639
they basically sit in those containers

873
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,960
until the trim crew can get to them

874
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,799
which may be just a few days or it could

875
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,240
be several days depending on how many

876
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,158
harvests have come and how many bins are

877
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,519
in that harvest one more thing i should

878
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,320
mention

879
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,558
when i do the big bins the big ben not

880
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,879
the clock the big containers when i do

881
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,200
the bins i line them with butcher paper

882
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,278
before i put the plants in there so it's

883
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,038
the big container i just have a roll of

884
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,440
butcher butcher paper on the wall i know

885
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:07,278
how much to pull off i pull that off i

886
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,798
line the bottom of the container i put

887
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:10,880
the buds in there and then i just gently

888
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,798
wrap the paper around it this does a

889
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,399
couple of things that paper absorbs a

890
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,079
lot of moisture

891
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,319
that paper also helps me keep my

892
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,439
containers clean we've got to scrub them

893
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,359
we got to clean them for the next

894
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,038
harvest this is just a little buffer it

895
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:24,879
helps keep some of the key from the the

896
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,119
resin off of the containers helps me

897
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
keep it clean also it does one more

898
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:31,119
thing i like to flip the buds i like to

899
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,558
flip them i like to flip the steak you

900
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,839
don't want the bottom buds on the bottom

901
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,038
the whole time they're going to get

902
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,558
moist down there they're not going to

903
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,038
get airflow they're not going to get dry

904
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,879
properly so i use that paper to just

905
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,879
rotate the whole package of buds i just

906
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,480
flip the whole thing over and that paper

907
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,240
kind of contains it a little bit make

908
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,679
sure the whole package of buds gets

909
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,599
flipped the whole bundle gets rolled

910
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,840
over so i can get that moisture that was

911
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:53,759
down at the bottom up to the top get it

912
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:55,599
out get it moving around get those buds

913
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,519
properly dried and cured once those

914
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,038
plants and buds are appropriately dry

915
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,558
you can just pull them off the stick

916
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:01,919
pass them to the trim crew and they can

917
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,240
trim it up whatever when it's a little

918
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:06,399
bit drier i believe it's much easier to

919
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,000
trim you don't have such sticky [ __ ] to

920
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,119
work with you don't have everything

921
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,119
sticking to your gloves it should be

922
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,558
kind of sticky but when it's dry you can

923
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,158
just use your thumbs i don't even use

924
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:15,359
scissors most of the time i don't have

925
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,600
anything good around here that could

926
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:19,359
work as a bud but if this plant were a

927
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,278
bud and i were trimming it i'd hold it

928
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,719
with one hand and just use my thumbs to

929
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,720
knock off the leaves and just spin it

930
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,079
and work my way up and down it knocking

931
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,839
off the crispy leaves with my thumbs

932
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,918
because it should be that dry so it

933
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:31,599
sounds like you were doing everything

934
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,278
basically the way that i would do it in

935
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,359
a commercial grow we cut it down clean

936
00:30:33,278 --> 00:30:37,119
it up put it in the bins keep it kind of

937
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:38,558
sustained until it's time to trim it

938
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:41,199
then when it's time to trim it we trim

939
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:44,158
it then it goes into uh more containers

940
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,679
that are uh more air tight and better

941
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,039
sealed so that they don't get uh so

942
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,960
crispy from that point then they are

943
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,278
transferred to the dispensaries which at

944
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,798
that point i have no control or no say

945
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:54,798
or no idea what happens to it at that

946
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,480
point we do our best in the commercial

947
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,639
grow to keep the buds the plants the

948
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,960
flowers the products top shelf the

949
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,880
grower has a lot of pride in it we put a

950
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,480
lot of work into it i want you to get

951
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,760
the best flowers but i can't promise

952
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,079
that it's going to be kept fresh at the

953
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,359
dispensaries i wish i had more control

954
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,879
over what happens there but that's a

955
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:13,839
whole other topic for a whole nother

956
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,320
podcast at a whole another time um let's

957
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:18,000
see where do we go this was not one of

958
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:19,678
the things you read 15 years ago that

959
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,759
you've been doing for nothing i believe

960
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,919
that you are doing it basically the way

961
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,158
that i do it in a commercial grow which

962
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,000
in my opinion is great so you've been

963
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,640
doing the right way keep doing it that

964
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,880
way if it ain't broke don't fix it but

965
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,320
once again do always analyze your

966
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,480
process make sure you're not doing

967
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,639
anything unnecessary

968
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,798
alright ladies and gentlemen boys girls

969
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,799
pimps hoes friends foes smokers growers
