[Music]

4
00:00:22,518 --> 00:00:28,320
mother. Yeah. Welcome back podcast

5
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:29,480
world. I'm your host Rosta Jeff. This is

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,719
episode

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,159
876 of the Grow from Your Heart podcast.

8
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,160
You know, I've got a great episode lined

9
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:38,640
up for us. In today's show, I'm going to

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:40,238
give away free seeds. Hang out. We'll

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,719
talk more about those free seeds later

12
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:44,238
on in the show. Before we get too far, I

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,239
do want to send a big thank you shout

14
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:48,399
out for all of the great responses to

15
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:50,320
the previous episode. The previous

16
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,640
episode, of course, was the Clone Care

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,878
Show. I did a full podcast about taking

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,799
clones. I talked about making clones in

19
00:00:54,878 --> 00:00:58,878
an easy cloner environment. I talked

20
00:00:56,799 --> 00:01:00,799
about clones did a clone dome setup. I

21
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:03,119
went on for a full hour. It was a great

22
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,399
show. I got a lot of great response.

23
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,560
Thank you for all of the great

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
responses. That is very encouraging. Uh

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,560
that show was a lot of uh energy to put

26
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:12,639
together and it definitely was worth it

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,240
due to all of the great response. Thank

28
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,920
you. If you didn't see it already, uh

29
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:18,158
after you watch this one, go check out

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,320
the previous show about cutting clones.

31
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,000
And in the very near future, I will work

32
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:23,839
on an episode about potting those

33
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,680
clones. Uh once you cut them, they're

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,880
going to start to grow roots eventually.

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,560
We're going to have to put them into

36
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,519
something. I'll make an episode for you

37
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
about that coming soon. All right, this

38
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,920
episode is going to be a questionand

39
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:37,798
answer podcast. I have a website. That

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,600
website is ireie

41
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,079
genetics.com. At the top of that

42
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:44,319
website, there is a row of tabs. One of

43
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,478
those tabs does say grow or grow

44
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:48,719
questions. If you click on that tab,

45
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:51,039
guess what? You get to send me a grow

46
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,118
question. If I read your question here

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,200
on the podcast, I will send you a coupon

48
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,399
code for a free pack of seeds at

49
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,399
urieirect.com. The first question on

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,040
today's podcast came from our new friend

51
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,640
who wants to be called Ryan D. Big shout

52
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,479
out to my new friend Ryan. Thank you for

53
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,959
the great question. Ryan, check your

54
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,719
inbox and also check your spam because

55
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,680
you have got a coupon code for a free

56
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,959
pack of seeds at

57
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:16,800
iedirect.com. Ryan's question, there's a

58
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
nice intro. Uh, thank you for your

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
service. I'll start with that. He does

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,000
mention that he is a veteran, a disabled

61
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,079
veteran. There's more to it, but then it

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,719
gets right to the question. It says, "I

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,400
have a question on growing naturally and

64
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,560
scrogging." Scrogging, of course, is

65
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,239
when we put a net down and we work the

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,840
plants into the net and we trellis them

67
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,519
out. We'll talk more about that as we go

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,120
on. So, it says, "I have a question

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,360
about growing naturally and a

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,039
scrogging." So, naturally is going to be

71
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,680
uh not scrogging them out, just letting

72
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,199
them grow wild, letting them get big. Uh

73
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,920
they're it's a big difference in my

74
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,318
opinion in my grow. Uh, it says, uh,

75
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,799
when you do, which do you prefer and

76
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:55,439
why? I've grown both ways and I've hit a

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:59,120
monster number on two plants in an AC

78
00:02:55,439 --> 00:03:02,000
Infinity 4x5. I hit 15 plus ounces on a

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,840
harvest. In a 4x4, you got 15 ounces. We

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,120
can improve that, my dude. I guaranteed

81
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,800
we can improve that. It's not a bad

82
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,640
harvest, but we can increase that. But

83
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
there is more. He goes on. It says,

84
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,799
"I've grown other plants naturally and

85
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,518
only lollipopped them, and I get roughly

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,840
200 grams." Thank you, Ross to Jeff. I

87
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,640
look forward to hearing your reply. Stay

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,319
cool. Keep pushing them killer strains.

89
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,238
He wraps it up with, I have been wanting

90
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,799
the Lemon Jeffrey, but you seem to be

91
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,800
out. Yes, I'm out of Lemon Jeffree seeds

92
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,560
for the time being. I'm currently out. I

93
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,400
will make more. Those are uh in the

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
rotation to be re uh remade. It just

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,560
takes me a minute to get them back in

96
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,280
line. Uh there will be clones and cuts

97
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,840
available on i redirect randomly. Maybe

98
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
join the newsletter on ienetics.com. I

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,439
will let you know when those clones and

100
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,280
cutings are available. But the lemon

101
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,680
Jeffree will be back in seed form

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,199
eventually. Let me stay focused here. Um

103
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
the main part of the question is which

104
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,679
do I prefer? Do I prefer to trellis the

105
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,920
plants out or let them grow naturally

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,760
was the other uh the other option here.

107
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:01,598
So uh kind of depends on the goal and

108
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:03,919
the situation. If I'm just doing a quick

109
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,079
pheno hunt uh and I want to run small

110
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,719
plants, I might do a bunch of those and

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,400
I will not trellis them. I will put up a

112
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,799
trellis net, but it serves a different

113
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,959
purpose in this run. Um, I'm going to

114
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,319
just use that net as a support. So,

115
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,639
those plants are going to grow right up

116
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,159
into it and that one top cola is just

117
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
going to be supported by that net.

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
That's all that trellis net is for. So,

119
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,799
in some runs, no, I don't do it. If I'm

120
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,199
just doing a quick small run of a pheno

121
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,639
hunt uh to pack a tent full of just a

122
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,960
bunch of small plants and see what we

123
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,800
get, then no, I will not trellis them. I

124
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,560
will not top them. I'll do minimal

125
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,439
lollipop, which is just cleaning up that

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,839
junk on the bottom. Minimal work to them

127
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,839
on a pheno hunt. Now, once I found the

128
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:45,439
keeper plant and I'm filling up a tent

129
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:47,918
and I want to make some production out

130
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,399
of it, I trellis the [ __ ] out of those

131
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,319
rooms. I crop it. I scrog it. So, I'll

132
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,478
start with plants that are approximately

133
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,800
uh waist high, chest high. To me, I'm a

134
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,399
tall dude. Uh that's three or four feet.

135
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,639
And I'll bang those plants down until

136
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,239
they're 2 feet tall to start my trellis.

137
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,000
And then I will work those plants out.

138
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,319
Instead of being this tall, I'll bang

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
them out to be a flat canopy. And the

140
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,759
reason for doing this, there's a lot of

141
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,680
reasons for doing this. I find, and I do

142
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,520
this in a commercial environment, I

143
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,038
trellis them very heavily. I put out the

144
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,279
nets, and then I work the plants into

145
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,918
that canopy very heavily all through

146
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:21,679
veg, uh, early flower, and then possibly

147
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,519
late into the flowering phase. I won't

148
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,120
stop working them in. If I can level

149
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,758
that out a little bit, I will still keep

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
doing it. My reason for this, if I don't

151
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,879
do it, I'm going to get those big giant

152
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,399
glory buds that grow right into my

153
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:33,519
lights, and then I get a bunch of buds

154
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:35,599
down here at the bottom that aren't

155
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,758
getting enough light. I could top that

156
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,439
and take that big top out. Or I could

157
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,439
bend that bad [ __ ] over and work it

158
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,800
through the net and work it down the the

159
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:44,399
canopy a little bit better. I could take

160
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,240
all those side branches and pull those

161
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,918
down. Now, what happens? You have a

162
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,280
branch that is growing straight up or

163
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:50,959
kind of up. It's growing out from the

164
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,879
plant and growing up. It's growing

165
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,879
upward. These plants want to go up. They

166
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:56,560
go toward the light. Uh they gravity

167
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,079
tells them which way is up. They want to

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,079
go up. That's what they're going to do.

169
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,079
They have aical dominance. One branch is

170
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,918
going to fight for the top at all times.

171
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:06,079
So when we trellis them down, we do a

172
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,240
few things. The plant starts to say,

173
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,839
"Hey, all the tops have been lowered.

174
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,199
I've got a chance to be the top at this

175
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,719
point. Maybe I could be the top." And

176
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,560
they all start growing more rapidly.

177
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
They want to be the top. It evens out

178
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
the growth of that plant a little bit.

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,839
The hormones move around. Uh it makes

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
that plant want to grow more evenly.

181
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:23,599
Now, also, what will happen? Those

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,079
branches that we're growing up, we've

183
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
now leveled them out. They're

184
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:29,038
horizontal. Now, your shoots are going

185
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
to grow out of those. Normally, you'd

186
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,000
grow a branch and it would get a chute

187
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,680
right here that would grow a bud. It

188
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,519
would get a chute that would grow a bud.

189
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,439
Now, your plant is horizontal. All those

190
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,198
shoots are going to grow vertically up

191
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,038
and you're going to have a nice smooth

192
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,199
even canopy with a bunch of shoots

193
00:06:41,038 --> 00:06:44,959
growing out of that instead of just a

194
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,639
bunch of like three or four big donkey

195
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,560
dicks. Now, we're going to get a whole

196
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,079
bunch of regularsized dicks, which is a

197
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,000
very terrible comparison. I kind of wish

198
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,000
I wouldn't have gone that route. This is

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,160
where we are. So now instead of just

200
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,439
those three big [ __ ] glory buds in

201
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,759
the room, you've got a whole bunch of

202
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,160
nice manageable buds across the entire

203
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,879
room. Now if you're growing in a 5x5

204
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
tent, um you got that hot LED light,

205
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,360
you're going to have a couple of buds.

206
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:08,478
If you don't trellis them, you'll have a

207
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,680
couple of buds that are right at that

208
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:10,719
light. The tops of those are going to

209
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,720
look like [ __ ] They're going to get

210
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,240
crispy. It'll get a little bit better as

211
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,840
it gets down. And then down here at the

212
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,439
bottom, all these plants are going to be

213
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:18,879
shaded out by your colas. They're not

214
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,719
going to get enough light. Now that

215
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:22,159
we've spread that out and evened it out,

216
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,599
that light is going to be even across

217
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,720
the whole canopy. You're going to get

218
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:29,439
nice even buds in the entire tent. And I

219
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,440
can do that in a gigantic room. I used

220
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:35,680
to run rows that were 6 feet wide and 75

221
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:37,360
ft long and trellus the entire thing.

222
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,360
And when it came harvest time, those the

223
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
canopy was perfectly [ __ ] even. Those

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
plants, it just looked like you took a

225
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
hedge trimmer and evened them out

226
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,719
because we worked that canopy so much.

227
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,639
So, I prefer to trellis them. I prefer

228
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,400
to scrog them uh if I'm going for

229
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,478
production, if I want numbers, if I want

230
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,239
to see some results. Uh even in my

231
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,758
breeding runs, I trellis those plants

232
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
down because I can lower it, spread it

233
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,360
out more, uh and not get them up there

234
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,598
toward that hot light, create a more

235
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,960
even space. So, what I do, I take that

236
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:04,878
branch, and you can watch there are

237
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,560
thousand great videos out there. Uh

238
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,160
what's his name? Mr. Scroggit. Watch

239
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,079
that dude if you want to be a

240
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,080
professional scrogger. I always shout

241
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:14,240
out Mr. Rob Janie taught me how to

242
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,000
really scrog. I knew how to do it. Was

243
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,519
intimidated by it. Rob Janie was kind of

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,360
like, "Don't be a [ __ ] Pop it. Twist

245
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,719
it. Scrog that [ __ ] in there." And

246
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,639
that's where I really learned how to do

247
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,479
it. So, we're taking a branch that's

248
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,079
going up. I'm going to grab it down here

249
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:27,598
a little bit and give it a little twist.

250
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,519
You're going to hear go pop. And now

251
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,878
that branch is very manipulated, a bowl.

252
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,120
I don't know what the word is. And then

253
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,719
I'm going to I've got my net that is uh

254
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
it's about here, right? My net has come

255
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,320
down. I've lowered my net to where this

256
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,158
top is just sticking out. I'm going to

257
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,479
bend that branch down into another

258
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,000
square of the net and work it in. And if

259
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,360
it's long enough, I'll let it pop out of

260
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,360
the other side. And that part's going to

261
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,879
start growing and working its way up.

262
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,720
All these shoots now are going to work

263
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:52,480
their way up. When this one gets a

264
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,920
little bit longer, I might work it into

265
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,360
the next part of the canopy. If it

266
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,479
doesn't get long enough, I might free it

267
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,800
and let it grow up. This is a a work in

268
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,720
progress. The canopy, the scrogging is a

269
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:04,399
a daily process. I'm in there every

270
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,000
couple of days just popping them,

271
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,799
twisting them, working them where I want

272
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,639
to be so that I can maximize that 5x5

273
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:14,479
space. Um, there's a guy named Eric Bixa

274
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,278
that wrote an article called Growing on

275
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,200
the Grid probably 25 years ago that I

276
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,200
read and that stuck in my head. Why

277
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,399
would I want to grow? Let's think about

278
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:26,879
it this way. You got a 5x5 tent that is

279
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,799
5x5x 5x5 whatever you do the geometry

280
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:32,240
there. This many cubic feet of grow

281
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:34,958
space. Would you, if I told you fill

282
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,120
that cubic grow space with weed, do you

283
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:39,359
want a low canopy with a couple of big

284
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,879
buds sticking out wasting space or would

285
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,120
you try to pack that [ __ ] nice and

286
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,879
evenly to where all of that canopy is

287
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,879
filled with weed? That's what Eric Bixa

288
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,360
teaches us to do uh in the article

289
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:52,320
growing on the grid. He wants uh so his

290
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,919
ideal uh setup what I would do also now

291
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,240
what I've kind of learned I use two net

292
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,759
systems. One is to pull the plants down

293
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
to lower them and I weave them into

294
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:01,759
that. Then as they grow, I put up

295
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,879
another net to support those colas

296
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,799
because if I do it right, they're going

297
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:06,639
to get big. In a big commercial

298
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,319
environment, I would put a third net

299
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,639
also. It would get crazy. I know it

300
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,959
sounds wild, but those buds were four,

301
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:14,879
five, six or seven feet tall. So, my

302
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,439
first uh my first grog is to pull them

303
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:19,360
down. My second one is to grow uh to

304
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,720
keep them uh supported. What I want to

305
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,079
do is have one cola in every square of

306
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,680
my 3x3 canopy netting. So, one butt in

307
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,439
everything. That is called growing on

308
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:31,759
the grid and I learned that one from

309
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
Eric Bixa. Another thing that I learned

310
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,278
was from my buddy Subcool. Shout out to

311
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,200
Subcool. Rest in peace, brother. [ __ ]

312
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:38,559
miss you. Wish you were still around to

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,278
teach me some more [ __ ] and spread some

314
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,958
good seeds. But Subcool once taught me.

315
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,320
He said the same thing. If I gave you a

316
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,239
[ __ ] cooler, brother, and I told you

317
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,760
to fill it with weed, would you put a

318
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,120
few buds in there this way and stack

319
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,958
them up like baguettes where you can

320
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,480
barely close it, or would you put a

321
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:54,078
bunch of normalsized buds in there and

322
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,320
just fill that bad [ __ ] all day with

323
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,399
normalsized buds? It's up to you. So, it

324
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,040
makes sense to me. That's why I prefer

325
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,039
scrogging, uh, trellising, working a

326
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,639
canopy. There's a lot to it that's not

327
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,199
just pulling the net down and [ __ ]

328
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,958
narrow, lowering the plants. Uh, I let

329
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,320
the plants grow and then I just drop the

330
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,679
net right on them. Just just pull it

331
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,920
down. I put it on each corner of the

332
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,679
tent and pull two corners at a time and

333
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,519
just kind of work my way around and

334
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,278
watch the plants bend down. You'll see

335
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,560
you'll start getting stressed out. When

336
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,159
you're freaking out those plants are

337
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,518
going to bend or break, go a little bit

338
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,519
further. That's when you need to start

339
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,720
getting in there and spreading them out.

340
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,720
I'm not going to teach you all about

341
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,360
scrogging right now. Mr. Scroggit is who

342
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,560
who to go for for that,

343
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,959
honestly. So many videos out there, but

344
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,439
spread them out. Then I also recommend

345
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,199
popping and twisting the bottom from

346
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,519
where the plant comes out of the dirt up

347
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,040
to where all of it actually. I pop that

348
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,720
main stock. I grab it with two hands. I

349
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,319
give it a little twist, a pop. And then

350
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,839
I do it up again up here. Pop. Then I do

351
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,000
it again up here. Pop. And I'll work the

352
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,519
entire main stock of that plant. Once

353
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,759
I've done from top to bottom of that

354
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,320
main stock, I'll do every single branch.

355
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:58,000
Start at the bottom. Pop, pop, pop. What

356
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,000
this does is it makes a little nurl, a

357
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,600
knuckle in your branch, and that branch

358
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,958
will get a little bit stronger and a

359
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,879
little bit thicker and a little bit more

360
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:07,919
robust. This serves a couple of purposes

361
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:10,159
in my mind. This will allow for

362
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,639
sturdier, beefier plants, which can

363
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,159
support bigger, sturdier, beefier buds,

364
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,159
and those bigger branches are going to

365
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,559
be able to promote more bud growth as

366
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:20,319
well. Then the next thing I do, I take

367
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,159
off all that [ __ ] on the bottom below

368
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,079
that first net. Once they start to grow

369
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,078
into that uh once they start growing

370
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,479
into that second net, I start cleaning

371
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,078
out all that [ __ ] on the bottom. All the

372
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,680
uh the little sucker branches, all the

373
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:33,039
lary [ __ ] the stuff that's not going to

374
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,719
be worth trimming. If it's not going to

375
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,958
give me anything worth trimming down

376
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,639
there, take it off. Uh don't take off

377
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:40,159
the long branches. If they reach up to

378
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,079
the net, leave those branches. If they

379
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,679
don't make it up to that net, consider

380
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:46,159
taking those branches right off. Clean

381
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,078
up that bottom of that canopy. uh make

382
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:49,600
all that energy go up to the top. That

383
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:51,679
is one of my pieces of advice. We're

384
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
popping. Uh we're twisting. So, we're

385
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:55,120
doing twisting. Uh we're popping the

386
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,320
branches. We're twisting them. We're

387
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,078
cleaning up the bottoms. We're

388
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,079
lollipopping a little bit. Once these

389
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,159
plants start growing up into this net,

390
00:13:00,078 --> 00:13:04,799
I'm going to pop th that growth also up

391
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,559
top up here. Uh once that net is looking

392
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,799
like it's full, that's when I'm going to

393
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,559
put that room into flower. When I do

394
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,479
this correctly, if I choose the correct

395
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,559
strains and line up the room and veg the

396
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,079
appropriate time and make this work, uh

397
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:20,958
it is very easily in a 5x5 tent, uh you

398
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:23,278
could easily achieve uh two, even two

399
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,199
and a half, maybe three lbs. If you're

400
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:27,120
paying attention and you're choosing the

401
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,399
right strains and you know your strains,

402
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,720
you know how to feed them, you know how

403
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,720
to pop, twist, lollipop, uh if you know

404
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,278
how to trellis it all properly, you can

405
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,120
hit three lbs in a 5x5 tent. It is not

406
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,879
unheard of. It is definitely going to

407
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,200
depend on your skill level, your

408
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:42,958
dedication, your genetics, and also your

409
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:45,120
your environment, your lighting. All of

410
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,518
that will matter, but it's possible if

411
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,519
you trellis and scrog it properly. I've

412
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,839
never gotten that close without doing a

413
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,320
trellis system, to be honest with you.

414
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,240
So, uh, where are we? I think I answered

415
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,839
all of your questions and then some.

416
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,839
Rambled pretty good on that one. and my

445
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:01,360
say than it looked. Uh I army is the

446
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,799
coupon code. Let's jump into this

447
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
question now before I stutter a little

448
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:07,599
bit more. It says, "If I pollinate a

449
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,079
femse seed with a male from another

450
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,000
variety, so they have a plant that came

451
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:14,319
from a feminized seed." It's just a a

452
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,240
feminized plant. It is now just a normal

453
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,079
plant at this point. Uh, no real

454
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,440
noticeable difference from this female

455
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:24,159
fem plant and a regular seed plant. So,

456
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,839
if I pollinate a fem seed with a male

457
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,078
from another variety. Now, I've just got

458
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,680
a male plant just random random dude

459
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:32,799
came by and they hooked up and they did

460
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,159
their thing. The question is, will the

461
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,519
progyny of them have more interex

462
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:40,319
traits? My question is, what do you mean

463
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,879
more? Where is the more coming from?

464
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:47,040
There should be no interex trait at all

465
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:48,879
in this setup. If your fem seed uh is a

466
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:51,039
true female, which that that was up to

467
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,120
the breeder before that, then that

468
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,519
should be a female. There should not be.

469
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:58,959
The misnomer that feminized seeds are

470
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,600
interex or hermaphrodites or herms uh is

471
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:03,119
inaccurate. That is not how it is done.

472
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,600
So, let me talk real quick about this

473
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,399
because I love to do this ramble. Uh if

474
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,959
made properly, feminized seeds do not

475
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,879
contain any hermaphroditic trait. That

476
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,638
is a misnomer. When you think of

477
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,480
feminine seeds, when you think of making

478
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,720
fem seeds, take the word hermaphrodite,

479
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,720
interex, hermy, herm, all that needs to

480
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,800
be removed from this whole entire

481
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,920
equation. Because what needs to be done

482
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,919
for proper feminized seeds is two true

483
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:31,198
female plants need to be used. Which

484
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,360
means the breeder that grew these

485
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:35,198
plants, that bred with these plants, has

486
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,680
grown these plants multiple times in

487
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:40,078
multiple environments and given them

488
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:42,638
stresses on purpose, [ __ ] with these

489
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:45,679
plants a lot to see what they do under

490
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:47,839
stress. If you see if I see interex

491
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:50,479
traits present themselves in my breeding

492
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,720
stock, I do not make seeds out of that

493
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,360
breeding stock. So there should not be

494
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,959
any. And then also I test those uh I

495
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,039
grow those seeds that are made and we

496
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:02,239
should not see any intersects in that

497
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,639
progeny. So my fem seeds there's no and

498
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,558
we were when we do the reversal process

499
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,720
we are reversing it. People say making

500
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,038
it harm that is not what's happening.

501
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,199
That is ignorance. That's miseducation.

502
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:15,439
Uh that is not what is going on. We are

503
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,720
using a solution. I am using a solution.

504
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,160
There are multiple different products

505
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,400
and ways out there now to make this

506
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,079
happen. But what we're doing is

507
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,000
disrupting the copper movement within

508
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,759
the plant which creates I'm not going to

509
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,519
go too far. It creates a reaction in the

510
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,200
plant, a hormonal reaction within the

511
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,359
plant that says, "Hey, I got to figure

512
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,519
out what to do." And that female plant

513
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:35,439
creates anthers. It's not making it

514
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,119
harm. It is creating full anthers. We

515
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,880
are treating it with a solution. This

516
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:40,798
would not have happened without a

517
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,559
chemical solution. I am causing this

518
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:43,918
with chemicals. It is not a

519
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,160
hermaphrodite plant. There's no

520
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:48,038
hermaphrodite involved. Plant A and

521
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,160
plant B, neither one of those were

522
00:17:48,038 --> 00:17:52,400
hermaphrodite. The progyny that comes

523
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,440
from that, no hermaphrodites in there.

524
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,600
So, I'm not giving you any

525
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,519
hermaphrodites to start with. The male

526
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,959
plant that you're using, let's just say

527
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,400
that it's been tested and it's not

528
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,720
hermaphroditic at all. There's no

529
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,880
interex traits there. Where would the

530
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,720
herm trait come from? It's got to be

531
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,320
maybe it's a super recessive trait that

532
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,759
is hidden in these genetics. That is

533
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,839
possible that's in there that can be

534
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:13,359
unlocked. one of the grandparents,

535
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,678
great-grandparents somewhere down the

536
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:18,399
line may have had the interex trait. We

537
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,480
could unlock that, that's possible, but

538
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,798
highly unlikely if the breeding is done

539
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,960
properly here. So, the idea that will

540
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,679
the progyny of them have more interex

541
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,319
traits? Uh, no. That where did the

542
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,880
interex come from? The way I kind of

543
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,879
think of breeding and this is mostly

544
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,880
accurate except the flaw here is

545
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,280
recessive traits. The way that I think

546
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,960
of breeding is uh the ingredients you

547
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:44,079
put in or the ingredients you're going

548
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,558
to get out. It is a lot like cheffing uh

549
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:47,839
except uh there's also with cheffing

550
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,440
there's a lot of [ __ ] happening behind

551
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:52,159
the scenes that we can't see. We have

552
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,240
only have a few uh senses and traits we

553
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,480
can observe. We can see weed. What does

554
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,839
it look like? We can also see food. When

555
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,279
you see both of them, you go, I want

556
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,879
some of that. There's you know what

557
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,639
traits you like. Do you like fried

558
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,559
looking [ __ ] Do you like stuff that's

559
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,640
been decorated with frosting and [ __ ]

560
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,079
crumbly [ __ ] on top of it? You know what

561
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,360
triggers your brain? What kind of weed

562
00:19:08,079 --> 00:19:11,359
do you like? Do you like purple weed,

563
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,519
bright green weed, dark green weed with

564
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,038
[ __ ] purple [ __ ] whatever you're

565
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,279
into. You know what you like? We got our

566
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:19,440
eyes. We got our nose. Before you even

567
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,440
see food, you smell it and you know I

568
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,960
want that. Or you go that gumbo smells

569
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,880
like dog [ __ ] Like your brain tells

570
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,640
you. It does the same thing with weed.

571
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,559
We've only got a few senses and we can

572
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,240
use that. It's just like cheffing. So,

573
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,440
whatever you get, if you put chocolate

574
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,960
and strawberry into your uh oven and mix

575
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,160
it, I'm making up a cake here is what

576
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,840
I'm trying to do. If you make a

577
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,519
chocolate strawberry flavored cake,

578
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:42,279
you're going to get chocolate strawberry

579
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,319
flavored outcome. If you put uh

580
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:46,000
non-hermaphroditic plants together,

581
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,119
where did the hermaphroditic traits come

582
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,240
from? That's what I'm talking about.

583
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,239
It's what I'm trying to get to in this

584
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,319
long ass ramble here. You're going to

585
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,240
get what get out what you put in. So, if

586
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:56,960
nothing is interex going in, nothing is

587
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,400
interex coming out. Unless, like I said,

588
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,079
my flaw here is that recessive trait,

589
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,160
uh, that old recessive gene that may

590
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,720
have lied in one of the grandparents,

591
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,400
but I've tested the mom, the dad, and

592
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,000
the mom and the dad of both of these

593
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,880
plants enough times where I know there

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,359
should not be interex. So, uh, the idea

595
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:18,080
of more uh, no, that that shouldn't

596
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:20,079
happen. Uh, the fems are not herms in

597
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,879
the first place, and your male plant is

598
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,480
not a herm in the first place. The only

599
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,840
real difference, and I've been giving a

600
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,839
lot of shout outs on knowledge in this

601
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:31,038
podcast. I feel like that's important.

602
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:35,519
The only difference in a feminized seed

603
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:37,200
and a non feminized seed is uh the

604
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,720
pollen. The pollen is the only

605
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,038
difference. Once that pollen hits the

606
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,038
ovule and the plant happens, there's no

607
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,640
difference except there's no option for

608
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:46,798
a male chromosome to get in there

609
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,720
because there were no male chromosomes

610
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,240
uh present in this uh breeding project.

611
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,319
Uh I was going to give some credit to my

612
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,720
friend Mr. Soul. Mr. Soul put this

613
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,720
analogy in my head. This is not how it

614
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,519
works. This is an idea to how to teach

615
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,880
you. Imagine if we took a male plant and

616
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,440
a female plant and we figured out how to

617
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,600
remove the male pollen from the air

618
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,200
before it got to the female. That's

619
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,759
basically what we've learned how to do

620
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
when making fem

621
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,599
seeds. And I know that the pollen is

622
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,200
what decides sex because I'm not

623
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,719
treating the female plants in any way.

624
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,759
the pollen receiver are not getting

625
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,600
treated any specially any special way.

626
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,279
The pollen donor is the one I'm [ __ ]

627
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:27,359
with and manipulating. So, I know that

628
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:29,279
is where my female traits are coming

629
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,199
from. My all female pollen. That's where

630
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,798
that's coming from. So, essentially,

631
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,480
imagine if you learned how to suck the

632
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,639
male pollen right out of the air before

633
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,240
it got to the girls. That's all we are

634
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,840
doing with fem seeds. There's no

635
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,319
difference. Once that interaction

636
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,079
happens, the difference is over. There's

637
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,519
no difference. People like to think,

638
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:50,079
say, claim, show me. Get the same strain

639
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,918
in a reg seed, the same strain in a fem

640
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:54,158
seed. That's going to be hard. Uh, but

641
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,320
get the same thing. Run them side by

642
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,760
side in the exact same conditions. We're

643
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:59,599
going to have to do this four, five,

644
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,960
maybe 10 times because genetics are

645
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,798
going to be different. Breeders are

646
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,558
going to be different. But I bet

647
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,720
scientifically we don't see much of a

648
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,879
difference. I bet smoking wise we don't

649
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,319
see a difference. Um, I bet it's you

650
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,240
won't notice a lot of difference. People

651
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:14,480
say that the uh the fem seeds have less

652
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,759
vigor. They are less potent. Uh that's

653
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,000
wild because uh I sell a lot of seeds. I

654
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,759
offer regular and feminized seeds. I put

655
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,279
seeds on the website for very fair

656
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:27,599
prices. And uh approximately 80% of my

657
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,440
seed sales are fem seeds. So if they're

658
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:32,158
so shitty, why are people coming back

659
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,640
and buying fem seeds? Also, Lemon

660
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,559
Jeffrey, Golden Goat, Orange Gasm, Rose,

661
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,120
Blanch, my top sellers lately are

662
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:42,079
[ __ ] killing it. Guess what? all fem

663
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:44,319
seeds. So, that is my argument there.

664
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,759
Um, I really rambled on that one for a

665
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:47,439
long time. This was supposed to be an

666
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,960
episode where I banged through a bunch

667
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,720
of these papers and got a bunch of

668
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,319
questions answered. Instead, you're

669
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,240
getting long [ __ ] answers today. I

670
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,678
hope you're enjoying it. Uh, my buddy

671
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,599
Joe, I hope I answered your question cuz

672
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,759
I've been talking long enough, dude. Um,

673
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,038
no. Unless you put herms in, herms won't

674
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:02,720
come out. I tried to compare it to a

675
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:05,200
breeding mix and got lost on that or to

676
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,120
a growing mix and a baking mix. Couldn't

677
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,640
put it together today. That's my uh my

678
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:10,639
brain working for you today. Dude, check

696
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,240
want to support the podcast. I said I

697
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,158
was going to read more questions. Let's

698
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,079
get right into it. This one came from a

699
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,000
friend who wants to be called Twisted.

700
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:52,000
Shout out to my dude Twisted. Is this

701
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,480
like the official Twisted? Is this the

702
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,558
one? I will never know. The question

703
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,839
goes a lot like this. It says, "Yo, Rost

704
00:23:56,558 --> 00:23:59,519
Jeff." And once again, we have another

705
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,240
pollen question. I thought I would stick

706
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,440
with the theme. Can I use pollen from a

707
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,159
reversed female on another plant? If

708
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,919
yes, will that cross be feminized, too?

709
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,159
So, now this lets me piggyback on the

710
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,559
last question. This listener wants to

711
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,799
use pollen that came from a reversed

712
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,399
female. That's totally fine. That's uh

713
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,480
totally viable. We've got a female

714
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
plant. We have treated that plant with a

715
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,159
solution that is now making pollen,

716
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,480
right? We've got that pollen from our

717
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,200
reversed female. Can we put this on

718
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,880
another plant? Absolutely [ __ ] yeah,

719
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,679
dude. I encourage that. That is making

720
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,320
new [ __ ] Uh, open up the the gene pool.

721
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,919
Yes, do that. Um, will that cross be

722
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:42,158
feminized also? Yes. Because like I said

723
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,880
a moment ago, that pollen is what

724
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,799
dictates the feminization. That's a word

725
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
I think I might have just made up. Uh,

726
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:51,278
of these seeds that those uh the pollen

727
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,759
is what dictates the male or female and

728
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:56,720
we are using all female pollen. So, your

729
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,359
progyny will be all female. This makes

730
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,120
me want to explain um a couple of

731
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:04,079
growing and breeding terms and labeling

732
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:06,000
terms with you. So, you said if I use

733
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,759
pollen from a reversed female, let's

734
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,759
start there. We've got pollen from a

735
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,200
reversed

736
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,879
female. Let's just say for shits and

737
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,558
giggles because this is familiar in my

738
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,880
head. The plant we are working with here

739
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,960
is golden goat. You have taken a golden

740
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,960
goat female. You have made reversed

741
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,120
pollen. We're going to take that pollen

742
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,798
and put it on another clone of golden

743
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,359
goat. Same plant, just a different

744
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,798
clone, right? Same [ __ ] genetics. Uh,

745
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:30,558
just a different version, a different

746
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,918
plant of the same genetics. My screen

747
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:33,678
just went all blue. I don't know if I

748
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,200
have a computer anymore. That's weird.

749
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,278
Uh, I don't need notes right now. We

750
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,159
will survive. Panic mode has set the

751
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:42,159
[ __ ] in. Um, so we've taken that pollen

752
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,960
from the golden goat. We put it on the

753
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,400
other golden goat. That is golden goat

754
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,720
S1. That is what is known as an S1 or a

755
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,080
self golden goat. Golden goat. And this

756
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,400
is the way you're going to remember it.

757
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,639
Golden goat [ __ ] itself. Selfded

758
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,960
itself. It just jerked itself off. Made

759
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,038
its own seeds of itself. Golden goat

760
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,558
self seeds. That's a golden goat. If

761
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:06,558
it's the first time this happened,

762
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:09,278
that's a golden goat S1. The self first

763
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,359
generation of self seeds is that S1

764
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,519
golden goat. Took the golden goat on

765
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:14,479
golden goat. Pure golden goat S1. I

766
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,720
think that's going to stick in your

767
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,720
brain the way that I said it. Now, let's

768
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,640
take this golden goat pollen and put it

769
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,720
on some other plants. I took some notes.

770
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,200
What do we put it on? in my notes. We're

771
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,798
going to put it on a lemon skunk plant.

772
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,080
And we're go also going to put that

773
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:32,558
golden goat pollen on a uh what's the

774
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,119
other one? It's a platinum tangi plant.

775
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:37,119
Now, that is going to make uh the lemon

776
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,359
skunk to golden goat makes lemon

777
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,278
Jeffrey. That's exactly how I made Lemon

778
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,479
Jeffrey. The golden goat. I don't know

779
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:43,599
how I said that just now. I might have

780
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,640
[ __ ] up the wording in my head. I'm

781
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:46,319
thinking too many thoughts with this

782
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,320
blue screen. Let me just fix this blue

783
00:26:46,319 --> 00:26:50,158
screen of doom. It works. I do have a

784
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,439
computer. All right. So, we took the

785
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,679
golden goat pollen. We're going to put

786
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,519
it on a lemon skunk plant that makes

787
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,679
lemon Jeffrey. We take the golden goat

788
00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:00,079
pollen and put that on platinum tangi.

789
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,400
That makes orange gm. Those are both

790
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,879
feminized and also two of my bestselling

791
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,360
strains I've ever made. So, by putting

792
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,840
that pollen on another plant that is a

793
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:13,839
reversed pollen, so that is known as an

794
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:16,798
R1, a reversed pollination generation

795
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:19,278
one. It's an R. If I take the pollen

796
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:21,440
from a plant and put it on itself, I

797
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:23,278
have selfded it. If I take that pollen,

798
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,558
the feminized pollen, and put it on

799
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,919
another plant, that is an R, a reversal.

800
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,918
If it's the first time this has

801
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,038
happened, it is a one that goes after

802
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,960
that, an S1 or an R1. I'm not going to

803
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,720
confuse you with other generations and

804
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,720
further things. That will be a future

805
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,558
episode. Let me uh check my notes and

806
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,240
get the fur out of my eye. Got a little

807
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,278
furry from my my hat here getting in my

808
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,440
eyeball. I'm not even going to edit that

809
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,480
[ __ ] out. It's a real show today. Um, so

810
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,880
that's how I made um, so the Golden Goat

811
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,360
S1s straight up that I sell that will be

812
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,559
restocked on the website probably early

813
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,319
fall, late summer, those are S1s. When I

814
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:00,879
take that golden goat poll and I put it

815
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,038
on the platinum tangi, that makes orange

816
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,120
gm. When I put it on the lemon Jeffrey

817
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,879
or on the lemon skunk, that makes lemon

818
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:08,959
jeff Jeffrey. When I put it on the red

819
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,399
Lebanese hash plant, that makes rose.

820
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,278
When I put it on the blue raspberry

821
00:28:10,398 --> 00:28:16,000
truffle, that makes blanch. Those last

822
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:17,440
few plants are what are known as R1s. I

823
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,960
hope you saw the spit. Not even going to

824
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,640
edit it. Uh, but those are R1s. Self and

825
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,640
reversals. All of those will be

826
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:28,399
feminized because like I keep saying

827
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,000
that pollen came from feminized pollen.

828
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,158
All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys,

829
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,398
girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes,

830
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,399
smokers, growers, clone cutters, pollen

831
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,678
chuckers, all of you lovely cannabis

832
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,278
enthusiasts out there. I do want to

833
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,038
thank you once again for listening to

834
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:42,319
another great episode of the podcast. I

835
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:44,240
had fun recording this one. And if you

836
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,319
can't tell, uh, make sure you mash that

837

Patreon at

840

patreon.com/growfroyouheart. I know I

841
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:57,278
was giving out seeds to supporters. I

842
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,798
have honestly ran out of new [ __ ] to

843
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,798
offer. So, I've been offering old [ __ ]

844
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:04,079
and trying to keep up, but have no fear

845
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:06,079
because there are new seeds coming very

846
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,678
soon. There's been a recent a recent

847
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:11,119
harvest uh of some blueberry regular

848
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,880
seeds. That's right. I did not talk too

849
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,038
much about it because I've been [ __ ]

850
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:17,120
jinxing myself by talking about talking

851
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:18,720
about projects too early. Kind of kept

852
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:20,158
this one on the download and it worked

853
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,159
like a champ. There's a bunch of new

854
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,240
blueberry crosses. I'll be loading the

855
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,640
website up with stuff very soon. So

866

happen through the newsletter. So, join

that newsletter. Also, Patreon does get

868
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,880
the first heads up. I make the

869
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,720
newsletter. I make it so Patreon gets

870
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,240
all that heads up [ __ ] first, uh,

871
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,919
because of course they do contribute,

872
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,079
then the newsletter gets it second, then

873
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,480
I go to social media for my advertising.

874
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:06,079
So join all of those Patreon, the

875
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,558
newsletter, and of course all the social

876
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:09,720
media to stay uptodate. Also, make sure

877
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:12,079

878
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:15,038

880
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,798
that is all of the rambling and

881
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:20,240
jabbering I'm going to do for this week.

882
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,000
Once again, thank you for listening.

883
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,319
I'll be back in a week with fresh new

884
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,880
content. I want to give a big shout out

885
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:29,519
to my friend Jessica K. And until next

886
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,060

887
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,558
