00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,239
to see you there all right let's not

46
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
waste too much time with the long intro

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:46,640
i do want to make an update before i get

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,240
too far on a previous episode

49
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,159
in a previous episode i was talking

50
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,920
about saving money i gave a bunch of

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,320
tips and advice on saving money in your

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
grow room but i forgot one major

53
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:58,319
component that may help you save some

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,718
money let's think about kilowatt hours

55
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,639
electricity is cheaper at off-peak hours

56
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:03,519
in most areas i live in a semi-large

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,920
city

58
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:08,560
i know that after peak hours electricity

59
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,038
gets cheaper so why not run your grow

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,479
lights at night when the sun goes down

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,399
when all the business is closed when

62
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,000
most of the people go to bed your grow

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,840
lights come on that way the light is a

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,439
little bit cheaper to run it doesn't

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,719
sound like a big cost cutter but the

66
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,719
more lights you're running the more

67
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,878
hours you've got them on the more money

68
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,878
you will save what goes along with

69
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,878
running the lights in the dark time so

70
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,639
you've got the dark time is now the

71
00:02:28,878 --> 00:02:32,399
daytime so you've got your normal

72
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,399
daytime it's dark in your grow space

73
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,159
when the sun goes down your lights come

74
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,760
on in the grow space now you don't need

75
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:39,519
as much air conditioning because it's

76
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:41,280
not as hot outside so you're helping

77
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,280
yourself out in a couple of ways you

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,719
don't need as many fans you don't need

79
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,199
much air conditioning you don't have as

80
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,959
much dehumidification to be done not as

81
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,679
much competition with other equipment

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,239
and natural elements so i completely uh

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,159
missed it when i said uh let's run the

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,759
lights at night i forgot that part all

85
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,120
right i feel like i'm caught up now i

86
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:01,679
feel like that was really important

87
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,920
since the kilowatts are cheaper run them

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,040
at night why not then another thing that

89
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:06,719
i should mention it is becoming

90
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:09,759
wintertime a lot of people are going to

91
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,280
choose to pull in cold air from outside

92
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,518
to cool off their grow space that's a

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,039
good idea but don't bring in too cold of

94
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,800
air you don't want to introduce icicles

95
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:19,280
into your grow space that's a great way

96
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,040
to cause problems and encourage powdery

97
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
mildew so those were two things that i

98
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,959
thought i should include in the last

99
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,640
episode got excited got carried away

100
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,519
left some [ __ ] out wanted to make sure

101
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,878
to get that into this episode all right

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,560
let me give you an update on what has

103
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:34,239
been going on in my world it feels

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,519
comfortable to start the show by talking

105
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,319
about what's going on then we'll work

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,319
our way casually into the grow lessons

107
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:41,518
i have been pulling seeds from the buzz

108
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,119
that's right if you've been following

109
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,039
along you know that i did have an

110
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
outdoor harvest that in my opinion was

111
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,560
very successful i gave a huge shout out

112
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,799
to the crew that helped me out so thank

113
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
you guys once again guys and gals can't

114
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,640
forget the lovely females that help us

115
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
out uh but thank you for that i've been

116
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,000
pulling the seeds from those buds it

117
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
took a few days to get the buds nice and

118
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,080
dry then of course i needed to find a

119
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,158
moment to dedicate time to getting those

120
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,480
seeds out of the buds i get them super

121
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,679
dry in a container uh then i just crunch

122
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:10,079
them up i put on rubber gloves and

123
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,840
crunch the buds up basically into a dust

124
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,159
then i run the seeds through the grow

125
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,759
easy seed sorting machine it's the easy

126
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:17,519
seed or grow easy something like that

127
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,759
they don't pay me to advertise for them

128
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,918
but i've got a seed separating machine

129
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
that does save me quite a bit of time

130
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,719
run the seeds through there then

131
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,840
immediately after that they go through a

132
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,280
seed counter so i spent most of the

133
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,039
afternoon pulling seeds and running them

134
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,519
through the seed counter the numbers

135
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,199
were in my opinion quite impressive

136
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,799
my friends that grew outdoors said that

137
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,160
next year it will be double because the

138
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,000
plants will be larger we'll be more

139
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,000
prepared do more tricks and tips this

140
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
year was a test run i was more than

141
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
satisfied really excited there's some

142
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,919
new stuff in those seeds there are some

143
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,519
old stuff in those seeds

144
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,519
many people have been asking if those

145
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:53,359
were the feminized seeds no they are not

146
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,599
feminized they did not do feminized

147
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,919
seeds outdoors femme seeds are a little

148
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,560
bit more work this was my first run in a

149
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:02,879
greenhouse environment breeding outdoors

150
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,600
i didn't want to do femme seeds outdoors

151
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,519
that is two uh obstacles i wanted to do

152
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,759
regular male female seeds with a male

153
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:12,159
plant and a female plant outside

154
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,840
less less uh less what's the word

155
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,919
variables that's what i'm looking for it

156
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,918
was more likely for success so i wanted

157
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,240
to learn outdoors with rag seeds we'll

158
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:22,240
keep the femme seeds indoors that works

159
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,000
but people were asking if these were the

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,840
orange gasms and the lemon jeffries and

161
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,879
the golden goats no unfortunately for

162
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,560
you they were not uh there was

163
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,240
i guess it is time to announce a couple

164
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,478
more of the things that were in there of

165
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,800

have been named soccer souffle and the

178
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,839
machine they've already been made i made

179
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:05,839
a bunch more so that we can release them

180
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,918
and put these out to the market saka

181
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,519
souffle and the machine are officially

182
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,000
made people have been asking a lot of

183
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,079
questions about them i will do full

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,240
complete podcast episodes on soccer

185
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,000
souffle and the machine closer to the

186
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,079
release time we are working on getting

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,600
that released i am working on getting

188
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,359
those seeds released

189
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,000
i made artwork for the packaging the

190
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,600
packaging is being uh i threw together

191
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
an idea i've got a real artist that can

192
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
do real work for the packaging they're

193
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
putting real art together for packaging

194
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,038
designs for me

195
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,400
i've got to package the seeds um

196
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,079
that's basically what's happening the

197
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,719
art is in the works and the packaging is

198
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,879
happening then we will plan an official

199
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,639
release and official drop date for

200
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,319
soccer souffle and the machine and i

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,478
will tell you all about what those names

202
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,319
mean a lot of my friends excuse me for

203
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,159
that a lot of my friends already know

204
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,319
what soccer souffle and what the machine

205
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,319
means if you've been asking is it this

206
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,000
yes you're probably correct it is

207
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,319
everything you're assuming that those

208
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
strains are named after especially when

209
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,120
you hear them together it should make it

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,079
a little bit more obvious if you don't

211
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
know what i'm talking about at this

212
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,000
point we will reveal it i'll tell you

213
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
everything about soccer souffle and the

214
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,160
machine in the future again those are

215
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,800
being planned for an official drop there

216
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,639
was more stuff in that uh that run also

217
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,720
that does need to be tested i made some

218
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,800
brand new stuff i've got some new

219
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,720
crosses in there that i've never bred to

220
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,478
um let's just tease one of them i

221
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,720
pollinated the p91 clone with an arise

222
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,839
male uh the arise was the male in the

223
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,280
greenhouse just in case you haven't

224
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:33,519
caught on if you aren't familiar with my

225
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,598
crosses but the arise king solomon or

226
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:39,038
risemail was the male in the greenhouse

227
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,639
and he pollinated the p91 clone i think

228
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,560
i've got a good name for that cross it's

229
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,079
being sent out as testers

230
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,199
people are getting a lot of stuff as

231
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,478
testers so uh i hit the p91 with your

232
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,720
rise that's one of the new things i'll

233
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,240
reveal more stuff as time goes on since

234
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
i did mention testers a lot of people

235
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
are going to ask how to be a tester

236
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,000
there's a full podcast episode about

237
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,520
being a tester please listen to that

238
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,399
episode then reach out if you would like

239
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:04,799
to test for me then i want to say this

240
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,598
i've mentioned several strains on this

241
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,720
podcast that i made i have not revealed

242
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,199
everything that was made in that

243
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,400
greenhouse if you're getting testers

244
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,598
don't think that just because i've

245
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,439
mentioned something on the show that

246
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,598
that's what you've got you could have

247
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:19,120
tester seeds from the run before they

248
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,038
could be testers from the greenhouse

249
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
they could be testers from

250
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,639
an indoor run it could be anything that

251
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,478
you are testing i try to keep the

252
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,879
testing a little bit secret i know what

253
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:30,159
you've got but you probably don't uh

254
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
don't think that just because i'm

255
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,320
talking about p90 one two arise that

256
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,680
you've got the testers maybe you do

257
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,599
maybe you don't there are about six

258
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,958
things out there being tested right now

259
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,080
a lot of people are going to start

260
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,598
seeing the testing pop up on the discord

261
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,920
that's right advertise the discord one

262
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:49,120
more time on the discord server there is

263
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:51,439
a uh seed tester tab it says ire

264
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
genetics tester or rasta jeff's testers

265
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,399
it's real easy it's real obvious it's

266
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,399
really easy to find

267
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,639
i'm asking all of my testers to post

268
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,799
their test pictures their stories their

269
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,879
grow reports right there on the discord

270
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:05,278
it makes it easy for me to find and it

271
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,879
makes it transparent for the consumers

272
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:09,278
if you're thinking about buying a strain

273
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,879
you can see it from the testing from all

274
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,320
the other people that are growing it you

275
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,399
can see what it's going to be like in

276
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,839
their environment their experience so if

277
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,919
you're interested check it out on the

278
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,720

279
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,240
section

280
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,080

00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,359
get that going anyway let me get myself

286
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,320
back on track saka souffle and the

287
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,159
machine are coming up uh p912 arise i

288
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,240
think it's got a good name that's one of

289
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,399
the fun parts about making new crosses

290
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,839
is naming all the stuff it's a good time

291
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,159
i think that's all i've got for that

292
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,240
part i did mention uh the femme seeds

293
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,639
people have been asking for orange gasm

294
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,879
lemon jeffrey and golden goat feminized

295
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,080
seeds also people that are uh in the

296
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,278
know that have been paying attention

297
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,800
people that are in the loop have been

298
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,879
asking for the red pill and the blue

299
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:58,240
pill which may get renamed i've been

300
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,838
tossing around i've got new names for

301
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
them in my mind but they may just stay

302
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,519
red pill and blue pill because it kind

303
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,600
of stuck right at this point why [ __ ]

304
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
change it but they may have hashtags or

305
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
sub names or taglines or something with

306
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,279
them anyway i'm rambling again it seems

307
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,480
to be the theme of the show

308
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,000
but if you've been asking for those

309
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,920
feminized seeds you will be happy to

310
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,919
know that the clones are cut and the

311
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:20,078
plants are growing they're not very big

312
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,519
yet but be patient give me some time

313
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,239
those clones have been cut they're

314
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,639
happening um they're coming up give me i

315
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,120
want to say 150 days i keep saying 120

316
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,039
to 150 days because that's a good time

317
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,679
frame that gives me time to get all the

318
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,958
stuff that needs to happen done um also

319
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,479
good things come to those who wait

320
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,359
there's no way to rush these plants

321
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,720
they're going to grow at the rate

322
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,159
they're going to grow i'm going to

323
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,879
pollinate them when it's time they'll

324
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,480
get harvested they'll get to you um all

325
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:46,559
i can say is be patient you've been

326
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,680
being quite patient for quite a while so

327
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,199
uh

328
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,958
just keep waiting they're coming i

329
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,680
promise they're coming i'm making them

330
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:55,278
this does segue me into my next note a

331
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,159
few days ago while i was working in my

332
00:10:55,278 --> 00:11:00,078
grow space i discovered an ugly furry

333
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,519
spider he's scary he's what nightmares

334
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:04,319
are made of it could be a he it could be

335
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:06,639
a she i guess i just gender assumed it's

336
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
gender i apologize to the spider uh and

337
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,838
i it might not even be a spider for all

338
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,720
i know i'm not a scientist or a

339
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,560
scientologist or an arachnidis uh but

340
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,959
anyway there is a creature in my grow

341
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,879
that does look a lot like a spider uh

342
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:21,119
and it's ugly and it's creepy and it's

343
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,480
furry uh in california when i was a

344
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,919
little kid we called them mexican

345
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,200
jumping spiders because they would ball

346
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:26,399
up into a little ball and then jump at

347
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,879
you when he looked at him they'd freak

348
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,720
my [ __ ] out um i don't know if that's

349
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,838
did i just culturally appropriate that

350
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,360
spider

351
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,800
the future is weird anyway there's a

352
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,879
mexican jumping spider that i have

353
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,639
decided it's a dude i've named it as a

354
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,240
boy i call it bro and i call it dude

355
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,759
when i talk to it so

356
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,959
blame me if you want anyway i've

357
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,519
developed a relationship with this

358
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,359
spider and i can't bring myself to kill

359
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,078
it as long as he doesn't [ __ ] with me i

360
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,560
won't [ __ ] with him uh it stays a few

361
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,919
feet from me wherever i move in the grow

362
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:55,278
i kind of keep an eye on it and i'm like

363
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,599
where are you [ __ ] and every

364
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,759
time i move around so does he he seems

365
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,440
to know where i am he stays away from me

366
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,039
he doesn't want anything to do with me

367
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,040
just like i don't want anything to do

368
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,879
with him but i don't want to kill it

369
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,199
because i haven't seen a fungus gnat in

370
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,720
there since that spider popped up i

371
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,560
think he's working security i think he's

372
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,200
doing me some favors i think he's

373
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:17,599
earning his space he's paying rent so i

374
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
am not killing him my question to you is

375
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,159
how do you feel about a spider and your

376
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,320
grow it's not a polite looking spider

377
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,919
he's not a cuddly [ __ ] friendly

378
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,160
looking spider like i said earlier is

379
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,159
what nightmares are [ __ ] made of uh

380
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:31,600
it's an ugly spider and sorry spider if

381
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,360
you hear this you're [ __ ] ugly bro

382
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,440
you probably think i'm ugly too

383
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
but how do you guys feel about a spider

384
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,880
in your grow do you leave a spider in

385
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,078
the grow space i don't know if this

386
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,838
spider

387
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,519
is harmful to humans i really don't i

388
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,600
didn't do any research on that the way

389
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,440
that he stayed away from me i feel like

390
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,040
that spider wants nothing to do with me

391
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,040
and it knows where i am when i move a

392
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:53,120
plant over here it goes that way it's

393
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,719
like nope and he's always up near the

394
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,560
top of the canopy so i can find him he

395
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
likes the light and i think he's just

396
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,278
waiting for the fungus gnats to go up to

397
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,879
the light and then come down and then he

398
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,559
eats them like i think he's got a good

399
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,360
strategy there haven't been any other

400
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,518
bugs in there and i've been i usually

401
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
spray for pes i spray pesticides once a

402
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,480
week i haven't sprayed because i've seen

403
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
him in there i don't want to kill him i

404
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
feel like that's kind of that's his

405
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:14,799
little playground i don't know how long

406
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,800
he's gonna live how long that spider

407
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,000
breed lasts i don't know what if it has

408
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,359
a bunch of babies and i have a bunch of

409
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,958
[ __ ] spiders in there what if it's a

410
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,720
mama spider and i'm calling it bro this

411
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,000
whole time anyway

412
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,440
i've got a spider in the grill and it

413
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,759
seems to be working security because

414
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,360
there are no other bugs this particular

415
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:31,120
type of spider doesn't make a lot of

416
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,278
webs he's not a webby spider i haven't

417
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,959
seen any webs or any messes in there so

418
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,799
i'm just curious would you how do you

419
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,039
react how do you respond to a spider and

420
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,799
your grow a lot of people like a praying

421
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,958
mantis a lot of people like ladybugs

422
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:44,240
which in my opinion ladybugs are lazy if

423
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:46,638
you're gonna release ladybugs in your

424
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,159
grow release a more aggressive predator

425
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:51,198
something that's going to be worth its

426
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,120
money worth its time uh ladybugs die

427
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:54,958
ladybugs die very quickly in the grow

428
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,320
space a lot of them end up in your fan

429
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,159
and your ductwork and you gotta sweep

430
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,680
them up or you step on them and then

431
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:01,039
they make that crunchy poppy noise and

432
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,239
you feel like [ __ ] about it and they

433
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,759
also stink so bad also they are a vector

434
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,919
for diseases they bring their own

435
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,759
problems with them a lot of them are

436
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,120
harvested here in the rocky mountain

437
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,600
regions and they're sent all over the

438
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,078
world so you're taking a rocky mountain

439
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
ladybug species and putting it all over

440
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,198
the country i guess maybe not the world

441
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,320
but all over the country and it doesn't

442
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:21,919
want to be there so it's not going to

443
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,079
thrive it's going to die get a more

444
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:26,479
aggressive more appropriate predator is

445
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,599
what i'm trying to say but um

446
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,039
how do you feel about the spider i've

447
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,320
been rambling long enough about them i

448
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,240
want to know what you think do you kill

449
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,440
that spider or do you not i know all the

450
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,959
hippie girls are going don't kill the

451
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,959
spider it's peaceful in there but i want

452
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:39,838
to know that's a production area we want

453
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:41,759
it clean we want it safe but also he's

454
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,839
paying rent i think he's eating more

455
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:45,198
bugs all right that is a lot of rambling

456
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,760
how long have i been going long enough

457
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:50,719
to work my way into the question that i

458
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,720
want to present you today i've been

459
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,480
talking a lot about when is the first

460
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,920
day of flip i always and i'm going to

461
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,079
say it again just because i want to put

462
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:00,479
it out there one more time day one of

463
00:14:58,078 --> 00:15:02,879
flower is when you change the timer to

464
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,440
12 12. that is day one you decide when

465
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,600
day one is you turn the timer to 12 12.

466
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,360
this let me let me regroup and resave

467
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,680
this again

468
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,240
in an indoor grow environment day one of

469
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,039
flowering is when you turn the timer to

470
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,039
12 hours on and 12 hours off or

471
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,278
something similar it could be 11 13 or

472
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:25,120
something like that but day one is when

473
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,480
you change that timer not any other time

474
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,399
some people want to wait till they see

475
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,879
pistols some people want to do that and

476
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,039
then count ten days after that it's not

477
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:36,159
a [ __ ] math equation day one is the

478
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,838
day we change the timer why why do a

479
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:40,399
math equation there's no algebra

480
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,360
involved here this is day one so that

481
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,078
being said um the next question is when

482
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,240
do i flip when when do i flip how do i

483
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,000
know when it is time to flip my plants

484
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,240
how do i know that's a really really

485
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,559
good question a lot of knowing when to

486
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
flip your plants is understanding your

487
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:58,559
goal another big part about knowing when

488
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,039
to flip your plants is understanding how

489
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:02,638
much your plants are going to stretch

490
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,159
understanding the stretch of the

491
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,159
flowering phase let's talk about that

492
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,559
for just a little bit what do i mean by

493
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,879
the stretching phase when we change that

494
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,119
timer to 12 12 we have now told the

495
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,720
plant it is flowering time the end is

496
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,639
near it it's an annual plant it's

497
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,000
supposed to live for one year normally

498
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,399
it would get a spring it would get a

499
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
summer in the late summer the time the

500
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,879
daylight hours would get shorter that

501
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,559
tells the plant oh the winter is near i

502
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:28,480
better flower the plant wants to make

503
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:31,119
flowers the flowers are the parts we're

504
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,600
after we want to smoke the dried flower

505
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,600
tops the plant's main goal is to receive

506
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,560
pollen so that it can get pollinated

507
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,480
make seeds and grow again next year so

508
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,638
when we turn our timer to 12 12 to tell

509
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,560
the plant to begin to flower it starts

510
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,000
stretching that is a natural part of

511
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,239
turning to flower the plants just

512
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,320
naturally stretch some strains will

513
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,799
stretch more than others that could be a

514
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,120
tongue twister if i had one more dab

515
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,679
but research the strains you are growing

516
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,240
with a lot of my strains straight up

517
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,719
will double in height which means you

518
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,919
need to flower your plants when they are

519
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,640
halfway to your maximum height so let me

520
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,480
use a good example if your grow space is

521
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,880
six feet tall let's say that you've got

522
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,400
a six foot tall grow space you've got to

523
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,039
deduct the height of the light let's

524
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,679
just say that from the floor to your

525
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:21,838
light is six feet now we've got six feet

526
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,000
of space let's keep in mind that we need

527
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,078
space between the light and the top of

528
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,240
the plant when we finish so now we've

529
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,519
worked ourselves down to five feet right

530
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,120
that sounds about right in most

531
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,879
environments you can get about a foot

532
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:34,639
you may want to go 18 inches two feet

533
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,880
from the light depending on your light

534
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,960
your air conditioning so allow yourself

535
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,600
that space 18 inches let's just stick

536
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,200
with 18 inches now you've got

537
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,079
we had six feet you've got four and a

538
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,759
half feet of growth space if your plants

539
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:49,759
are going to now let's also think you've

540
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,519
got a pot that's gonna take six or ten

541
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,400
inches off let's just say you've got

542
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,558
four feet of actual growth space now i

543
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,280
would say veg the plants until they are

544
00:17:56,558 --> 00:18:01,519
two feet tall maybe a little bit taller

545
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,000
then flip them into flower mode if the

546
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,319
plants double in size they will finish

547
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,839
at four feet tall which leaves you a few

548
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,960
inches height for the pot which leaves

549
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,639
you about a foot or 18 inches from your

550
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,038
light so

551
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,160
ideally you would flower when your

552
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,160
plants are about halfway to your maximum

553
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,000
height now there are variables in here

554
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,320
like i did mention some plants are going

555
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,319
to stretch a lot some plants won't

556
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,639
stretch very much depending on your

557
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:31,038
light spectrum your light intensity the

558
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,280
kind of light you've got that may uh

559
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:35,440
contribute or attribute to how much your

560
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,119
plants do stretch if you've got a lot of

561
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
really good light they won't stretch as

562
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,639
much if the plants aren't getting the

563
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,640
right light the right light spectrum the

564
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,080
right intensity the right time period

565
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,360
they may stretch a little bit more

566
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,558
they're getting up there looking for the

567
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:49,839
light that's why your plants are

568
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:52,160
stretching so be prepared for anticipate

569
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,240
a double stretch when you're flowering a

570
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,160
plant for the first time now there are

571
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,400
other things you need to keep in mind

572
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,640
maybe you want to spread that plant out

573
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,080
a little bit you're going to run out of

574
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,600
vertical space let's grow it

575
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,119
horizontally if you've got a plant

576
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,279
that's stretching out of control you can

577
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:09,279
grab it and bend it over and tie it down

578
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,639
so it doesn't get as tall of course the

579
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:11,918
branches are going to start growing up

580
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
around it it's still going to go up

581
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,759
that's what the plant naturally wants to

582
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,000
do but you can learn how to control it

583
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:19,519
and keep it down so you can veg a little

584
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,679
bit longer you don't have to flower

585
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,200
right away that way

586
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:24,720
another thing we should think about is

587
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,880
topping when we top the plants we're

588
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,038
allowing it to grow into a nice even

589
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,520
canopy a nice bush we took that main top

590
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:33,839
out so those lower branches can catch up

591
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,440
let all of that stuff fill your canopy

592
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,839
let all of that stuff fill your grow

593
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,160
space then flip it so that way you can

594
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,519
get all those bottom branches all even

595
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,519
that'll get you evened out so you don't

596
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:45,359
have one big bud close to the light you

597
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:46,879
can get that one big button bend it over

598
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:48,959
or you can cut out the top and let the

599
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,520
bottoms recover you can do things to

600
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,200
fill that space before you get one bud

601
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:54,879
right up to the top of the light now i

602
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,200
was talking about bending plants over

603
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,520
and breaking [ __ ] off i think that

604
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,000
popping and twisting our plants really

605
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,759
slow down that vertical stretch i've

606
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,200
done a full episode about popping and

607
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,319
twisting i'll try to put a link to that

608
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,159
in the show notes in the video

609
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,079
description you can click right on that

610
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,480
one i'll show you popping and twisting

611
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,000
technique that does slow down the

612
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,079
vertical growth because the plants are

613
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,480
spinning their energy repairing that pop

614
00:20:16,079 --> 00:20:20,399
and twist and that will not slow down or

615
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,519
damage our buds in any way because at

616
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,120
this point

617
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:25,119
there are no buds the plants are just

618
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:27,359
shifting their hormones they're going

619
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,038
from fl from veg to flower they're

620
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,079
basically going through puberty they

621
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:31,759
need a couple of weeks for their

622
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,399
hormones to adjust then they'll start

623
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,319
making buds so at this point crack them

624
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,759
pop them twist them abuse them get them

625
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,200
short get them the shape you want so

626
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,720
that when they start building buds

627
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,080
they're right in the position we need

628
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,919
them in

629
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,439
now i did just say that it's best to

630
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,000
grow those plants up until you've got

631
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,798
them halfway and fill your space but it

632
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,319
is not necessary when i run new plants

633
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:53,279
plants i've never grown before plants

634
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,678
that i don't know what they're going to

635
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,079
do i don't want to waste time space and

636
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,240
energy nutrients water lights all of the

637
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,399
above all of that stuff real estate

638
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,480
space it's all very expensive it's all

639
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,640
very precious to me so when i'm running

640
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
new stuff i don't run those plants very

641
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,120
big at all i put them in a beer cup or a

642
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,280
six inch net pot and i honestly veg them

643
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,678
until they are about maybe six eight

644
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,200
inches tall then i flower them and i

645
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,120
don't do anything to them i don't top

646
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,080
them i don't do any manipulation i let

647
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:24,158
them grow because i simply want to see

648
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,158
what those seeds do what i made new

649
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,320
seeds what do these plants do what did i

650
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,600
create do they grow beautiful plants do

651
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:32,000
they grow a bunch of mutants is it a

652
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,399
bunch of intersex trash what did i

653
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,759
create does it grow tall and skinny does

654
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,600
it grow short and squat does it make

655
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,599
cool colors did i just make a bunch of

656
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:41,439
hemp is there a bunch of great trichome

657
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:42,879
content coming out of there i really

658
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,960
want to know what i made so i just grow

659
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:47,440
little tiny plants so don't think that

660
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,000
you have to grow giant plants but you

661
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,480
can grow them about halfway flip when

662
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,880
you are ready again i really like to run

663
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,558
new plants really small the first time i

664
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,400
see people throwing away plants that are

665
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,079
like three and four feet tall and then

666
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,919
like turns out it was a male and i'm

667
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,839
like why did it ever get that big you

668
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,679
could have flowered it when it was this

669
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,199
big and then put it back into veg and

670
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,120
for you guys that are listening this big

671
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
was the size of a gi joe what is that

672
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,079
four inches tall three and three

673
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,679
quarters so you could have floured it

674
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,918
when it was that big it'll show you sex

675
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,600
put it right back in veg then keep going

676
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,000
if it's a male toss it don't waste your

677
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,959
time so when i'm running small stuff i

678
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,880
really do prefer tiny pots tiny plants

679
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,840
because there's no need to run big old

680
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,679
[ __ ] then what i do is um let's say that

681
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,678
i've got a commercial environment and i

682
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,679
can run a lot of plants i would put a

683
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,440
tray of plants underneath one light like

684
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,080
fill a four by four a five by five

685
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,159
section with just a tray of small plants

686
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,000
how we can water the tray i just put a

687
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,520
pump that waters the tray every day two

688
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,519
times a day so i don't even have to go

689
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:47,038
there very often uh the commercial grows

690
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,119
i just pop in once a week and make sure

691
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,400
shit's running get my grow report take

692
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,519
my pictures and get out of there it's a

693
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,038
good way to do a final hunt a test run

694
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:56,558
just a little sample run to see what you

695
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,279
got going on

696
00:22:56,558 --> 00:22:59,279
so

697
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,440
um let me recap here because i did get

698
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,119
quite rambly a really easy way to

699
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,960
determine when to flip your plants is

700
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,199
when they are approximately half the

701
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,640
height of your maximum growth space you

702
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,080
do have to keep in mind that you've got

703
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,400
a pot underneath them going to raise

704
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,639
them up 10 to 12 maybe 14 inches

705
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,559
depending on the size size of your pot

706
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,880
and the height of your pot then you do

707
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:21,440
have to consider the height between or

708
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,039
the distance between your light and the

709
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,880
top of your canopy depending on what

710
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,879
kind of light you're using you will need

711
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,640
more space in some of my grow

712
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,200
environments i've got the old school

713
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,440
ducted lights it's got it's an hps light

714
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,960
with glass and a duct on it and a blower

715
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,200
so that the heat from that light never

716
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
makes it to my canopy my plants can get

717
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,720
quite close to that at a commercial

718
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,798
growing colorado springs we're using

719
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,798
gavitas can't get very close to the

720
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:46,558
gavitas because the plants will sizzle

721
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,798
and burn you're not supposed to burn

722
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,599
them until you dry and cure them you got

723
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:53,839
to stay at least like 16 18 inches away

724
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,319
from those gavitas 12 inches as [ __ ]

725
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,480
scary the plants start looking like [ __ ]

726
00:23:56,319 --> 00:24:00,558
uh then some of the leds depending on

727
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,480
the intensity the spectrum you can get

728
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:03,759
really close or really far away with

729
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,079
some of the leds depending on what

730
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:08,319
you're [ __ ] with so um

731
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:10,798
in that case uh keeping the plants the

732
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:12,319
distance uh from the light i would

733
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:13,359
definitely recommend most of those

734
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,278
lights are going to come with a

735
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:17,599
recommendation from the manufacturer

736
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,359
follow that but go too high put the

737
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:21,439
plant most of you are limited on ceiling

738
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,759
height go as high as you can turn the

739
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,840
light to about 50 percent and see how

740
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:27,200
the plants react you can go closer and

741
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,959
more intense

742
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,798
it's better for the plants to show you i

743
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,278
want more light than for the plants to

744
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,278
say i've had too much light watch this

745
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,599
the reaction from less light is way

746
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:39,839
easier to fix than the reaction from too

747
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,278
much light now i've got one more detail

748
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:42,798
that i should add being a very

749
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,000
experienced grower who's done this for a

750
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,480
long time

751
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,798
let me say that you are expecting eight

752
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,679
maybe nine weeks until harvest give

753
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:54,319
yourself an extra week or two allow

754
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,480
room and height for an extra week or two

755
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,639
of growth that you're not expecting

756
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,159
these plants need to grow longer than

757
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,440
you're going to allow them they're not

758
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,200
done yet when you think they're done

759
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,720
they're not done every new grower wants

760
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,159
to cut down early

761
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,759
give yourself the extra time give

762
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,679
yourself the extra height if you allow

763
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:11,599
the extra height you eliminate the

764
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,320
excuse if they're too tall i need to cut

765
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:16,639
them early allow them to finish plan

766
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:18,720
ahead for that extra height

767
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,919
it's super frustrating late in a grow

768
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,839
when you're trying to figure out how to

769
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,000
bend these branches over and lower [ __ ]

770
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,199
because you've only got 10 more days but

771
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,640
everything's growing into the light

772
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,240
you're trying to figure out am i going

773
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,278
to turn down the light do i turn do i

774
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,759
tip the light do i turn the light

775
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:34,159
[ __ ] sideways do i bend this [ __ ]

776
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:36,480
branch over what do i do it's always

777
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,480
such a frustrating 10 days if you don't

778
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,319
prepare for that last bit of growth so

779
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,798
set yourself up for success give

780
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,359
yourself plenty of space between the top

781
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:48,639
of your plant and your light plan ahead

782
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,479
probably flip about half of your space i

783
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,120
usually grow my plants to about i'm six

784
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,038
foot five i usually grow my plants about

785
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,798
knee-high and then i flower them in a

786
00:25:55,038 --> 00:25:58,400
three gallon pot they get about they get

787
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:00,639
topped once grow until they're about

788
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,759
knee-high uh then i flour them they

789
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,038
finish out about maybe my uh just below

790
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,200
my chest area low chest area um that's

791
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,640
just about perfect for an indoor garden

792
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,120
alright ladies and gentlemen boys and
