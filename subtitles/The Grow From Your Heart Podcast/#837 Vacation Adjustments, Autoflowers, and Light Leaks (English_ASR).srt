all right I feel like we've covered all

59
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,878
of the advertising here at the start of

60
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,319
the show now it is time to talk about

61
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,560
the most popular Topic in the Cannabis

62
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,039
world this week and of course that is

63
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,920
that the DEA has now announced that they

64
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:47,759
are rescheduling cannabis to a schedule

65
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:49,719
three drug that may have a lot of

66
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:52,399
implications for the Cannabis industry

67
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:54,800
that could cause a lot of changes so far

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,280
I do not know what to expect this could

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,159
be a good thing this could also be a

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,120
very detrimental thing for the cannabis

71
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,759
industry um will they ban hom grows will

72
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,280
they force a prescription on us for

73
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:09,798
cannabis will this crush the industry

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,080
will this override state laws and

75
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,040
regulations I am very curious to see

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,239
what is going to happen I am not ready

77
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:18,280
to tell you anything or report anything

78
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,360
on this new change I'm sure we're all

79
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:22,680
paying attention to it as I understand

80
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,879
it more as we see how things roll out

81
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,120
Mike and I will do our best to keep you

82
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,598
updated on the changes and what this

83
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,920
does mean for our plant for our industry

84
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:34,039
and and for our community but pay

85
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,399
attention because they have now decided

86
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,719
to reschedule cannabis to a class 3 drug

87
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,120
everything else that is class 3 requires

88
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:44,519
a prescription and strong oversight for

89
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,799
production so this could mean a lot of

90
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,840
changes for our community and our

91
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,040
industry stay tuned I will do my best to

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,479
have Mike and myself keep you guys

93
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:56,359
updated on those changes and what we can

94
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,959
expect and how they will change and

95
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,319
affect the community and the industry so

96
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,598
that's what I've got for you today on

97
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,919
schedule 3 all right podcast world now

98
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:07,399
we are going to segue into the pet peeve

99
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,318
portion of today's podcast everybody

100
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:11,680
knows what a pet peeve is it's something

101
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,919
that just drives you crazy occasionally

102
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,560
I like to highlight a grow room or a

103
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:18,519
cannabis Community pet peeve and today

104
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,560
we are going to talk about unlabeled

105
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:24,918
plants and disorganized grow spaces

106
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,199
disorganized mix spaces and unorganized

107
00:04:24,918 --> 00:04:31,758
pesticide mix and storage areas all of

108
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,038
that disorganization simply drives me

109
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,720
crazy organize your stuff you guys it

110
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:37,399
would be so much easier to work in that

111
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,240
grow space if you just put some things

112
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:41,758
away organize your stuff it'd be more

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,240
pleasurable to work in there it would

114
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,680
take less time you would be more

115
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,400
efficient and I think you would just

116
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,240
enjoy it I enjoy a clean tidy workspace

117
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:50,839
so every couple of days once I notice

118
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,759
that these bottles are moved around and

119
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,399
my pH pens over here and the scissors

120
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:56,560
are over here I'll just take a few

121
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,038
minutes and just regroup and reorganize

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,879
everything that makes less chaos in the

123
00:04:59,038 --> 00:05:02,599
growth I don't have to look for a pH pin

124
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,680
and look for scissors if they're right

125
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,560
there I can spend that much more time

126
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,639
focused on the tasks that I do need to

127
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,600
get done in the grow so the stuff that

128
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,680
drives me crazy is just the

129
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,240
disorganization uh the disorganization

130
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,759
in the grow room uh by that I mean label

131
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,639
your plants why aren't the plants

132
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:20,400
labeled uh each plant should have a

133
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
clear tag in it and yes this was

134
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,839
inspired by my friend who always tells

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
me he forgot to label a plant or forgot

136
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,918
which plant we're smoking cuz he didn't

137
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,638
write it down on the bag or something

138
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:33,359
dude label your stuff all of you guys

139
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,720
label those pots label them redundantly

140
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,280
sometimes I'll put a piece of duct tape

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,960
on the pot with the name on it and then

142
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:40,758
a plant tag inside the pot sometimes two

143
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,918
plant tags just depend on depends on the

144
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:45,038
process of that plant but let's label

145
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:47,240
all of the plants also if you're running

146
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,318
Perpetual grows if you've got multiple

147
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,800
Cycles in there put the date that that

148
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,360
plant went into flower on the plant tag

149
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,079
and possibly in a grow journal and a

150
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,199
grow log write that down so let's update

151
00:05:57,079 --> 00:06:00,839
organize and try to be more uh

152
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,960
proficient and the grow by cleaning

153
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,038
everything up and being organized

154
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,399
organize the grow space Also organize

155
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:08,800
that mix area clean up that mix area

156
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,519
wherever you're pouring nutrients into

157
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,520
your mixing container shaking that [ __ ]

158
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:14,120
up every day I bet there's some drops

159
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:15,598
some dribbles that need to be cleaned up

160
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,598
I bet your measuring cups need to be

161
00:06:15,598 --> 00:06:19,279
cleaned up if you use dry amendments

162
00:06:17,598 --> 00:06:21,598
dried nutrients I bet your scale needs

163
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,279
to be cleaned up sweep and mop that area

164
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:25,839
let's just clean all that stuff up show

165
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,959
some pride in there also that pesticide

166
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,719
mix area I really think that's an

167
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:31,560
important area wherever you're pesticide

168
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,720
are stored they should be if you're in a

169
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,280
commercial facility those pesticides

170
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,360
should be in some sort of a locked

171
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:39,559
container a locked recepticle a closet a

172
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,560
cupboard something that is locked also

173
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,478
clean up all of those bottles um you

174
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,079
don't want pesticides dripping down the

175
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:46,519
side of the bottle when you pick it up

176
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:48,439
you don't realize you got some on your

177
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:49,879
glove your hand your finger then where

178
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:52,439
is that going to end up your pants your

179
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,159
hair your face your food the door knobs

180
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,360
so let's clean off those bottles after

181
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,120
you pour clean off the bottle put that

182
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,960
pesticide in whatever clean up whatever

183
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,478
you use to transfer it let's try to

184
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:03,399
clean up all that stuff have some pride

185
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:05,359
in it it's also about efficiency it's

186
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:07,918
also about safety especially in that

187
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,080
pesticide mix area another pet peeve of

188
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:12,120
mine is when I ask a grower when was the

189
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,000
last time you did this or when did this

190
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,478
happen in the grow and they say I don't

191
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,478
know I forgot I did not forget because I

192
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,519
wrote it down when is the last time you

193
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,839
applied a pesticide when did you water

194
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:25,598
last when you watered last what was in

195
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:27,719
that mix um how many milliliters of each

196
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:30,360
bottle went into that mix how much water

197
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,560
did you start with what was the EC what

198
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,199
was the pH was there any runoff did you

199
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,478
measure the EC and pH of the runoff Mark

200
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,478
all that stuff down it drives me crazy

201
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:41,680
when people say I don't remember what I

202
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,000
did I don't remember either but I wrote

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,079
it down so I can scroll back or fold

204
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,680
back in my pages and I can look and see

205
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,519
what is going on in my grow space so be

206
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,240
more organized clean up your stuff

207
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:54,799
organize your stuff clean your tools

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,639
clean your space and keep some notes of

209
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,199
what's going on in that grow

210
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,759
disorganization kind of drives me crazy

211
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,360
a especially in a commercial environment

212
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,639
especially in a grow where a grower

213
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,240
cannot identify a problem what's going

214
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:09,560
on in here man well what have you done

215
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,439
the past few feedings I don't know it's

216
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,240
really hard to diagnose a problem if you

217
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,680
don't know what you have been putting

218
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,120
into those plants so that is my pet pee

219
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,079
for the day clean up reorganize take

220
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,120
some notes mark down the plants just

221
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:23,839
give it some basic love some care show

222
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,680
some pride in that grow is what I think

223
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,839
I'm trying to say all right we will wrap

224
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,158
up the pet peeve section of today's show

225
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,120
if you have a grow room or a cannabis

226
00:08:30,158 --> 00:08:34,639

236
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:07,838
now we're going to work on the question

237
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,440
and answer portion of today's show I do

238
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,800
have a website on the top of that

239
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
website there's a list of tabs one of

240
00:09:11,799 --> 00:09:15,559

246
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,360
question came from our friend who wants

247
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,439
to be called I think it's [ __ ] tokes a

248
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,360
lot uh shout out to my new friend tokes

249
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,920
a lot the question says I am new to

250
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,120
Growing well welcome to the family

251
00:09:36,919 --> 00:09:41,679
brother it says as my state recently

252
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,120
legalized congratulations says I have

253
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:46,799
only grown Auto flowers all indoors in a

254
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:49,278
grow tent setup I will eventually try

255
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,879
photo periods I'm doing my research now

256
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,919
but I have questions about light leaks

257
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:56,078
is this a real thing I know where you're

258
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,599
headed with this light leaks are a real

259
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,679
thing but indoors and Outdoors it is a

260
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,079
completely different ball game so let's

261
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:05,599
stick with the email it says hear me out

262
00:10:03,078 --> 00:10:07,639
I'm listening bro it says there is no

263
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,519
place that I know of on Earth where

264
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:12,278
cannabis grows outside that there are

265
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,639
not Stars that's a very good point stars

266
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:16,679
give off give off light so I'm confused

267
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:19,039
about light leaks that makes very good

268
00:10:16,679 --> 00:10:20,879
sense why must I have total darkness

269
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,039
with no light leaks in my ENT during

270
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:25,559
lights out time it just doesn't make

271
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:27,599
sense to me please explain bro that's

272
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:29,119
what I'm here for I'm explain it to you

273
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,360
you will understand very well by the

274
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,399
time time I am done rambling he wraps it

275
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,480
up with your podcast is great with lots

276
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,839
of information and very informative

277
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:39,200
thank you and keep up the great work my

278
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,240
friend toes a lot thank you for the

279
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,200
great compliment and thank you for the

280
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,720
great question the answer is so there's

281
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:47,879
a lot to this it'll take me a minute to

282
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,000
get there but it will all make sense so

283
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,559
in an outdoor environment as the sun

284
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,720
sets it begins to create a red spectrum

285
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,638
of lighting the sun's position in the

286
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,759
sky relative to the atmosphere relative

287
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:02,120
to the Earth creates a red light

288
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:04,439
spectrum that red light is known as far

289
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,639
red lighting when the plants receive

290
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,120
that far red lighting that triggers what

291
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,959
is known as a phytochrome red response

292
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,159
in the plants that phytochrome response

293
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:15,919
basically tells those plants hey ladies

294
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,319
the day is ending it is time for you to

295
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:19,599
brush your teeth and go to bed so those

296
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
plants will start putting their leaves

297
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,278
down they'll get a little bit droopy and

298
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,800
they will go to sleep and then they will

299
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,838
start their nighttime processes now that

300
00:11:25,799 --> 00:11:29,679
is triggered by that phytochrome or that

301
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,480
far red light and the phyto Chrome

302
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,479
response this will happen before the sun

303
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,920
sets completely so one thing I do want

304
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,519
to highlight here is I see people saying

305
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:41,278
I've got 14 hours of uh sunlight in my

306
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,560
area it's safe to put my plants out they

307
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,679
won't go into flower that is not

308
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:48,559
absolutely accurate it is daylight it is

309
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,159
visible light it is sunshiny a little

310
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,879
bit for 14 hours but the spectrums in

311
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:55,000
which your plants are receiving are not

312
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,919
the proper Spectrum to keep that plant

313
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,839
in a vegetative state for a continued

314
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:01,439
state of time those plants if you put

315
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:03,320
them out right now they will flower as

316
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,200
the sun rises in the morning it puts off

317
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,920
that blue spectrum that wakes them up

318
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,399
and tells them hey ladies it's time to

319
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:11,078
get the day going but as it sets that

320
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:13,159
happens earlier than you're thinking

321
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,759
because you may have 14 hours but as it

322
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:17,360
starts to set that 13th 12th hour may

323
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,679
have already triggered that phytochrome

324
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,759
red response and your plants are going

325
00:12:18,679 --> 00:12:23,078
to sleep that's why many of you see your

326
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:24,439
plants going into flower early Outdoors

327
00:12:23,078 --> 00:12:26,078
all right now let's try to stay back on

328
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,760
track here we are talking about why the

329
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,479
plants uh do need total darkness indoors

330
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,639
versus Outdoors now when that

331
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,240
phytochrome red response happens these

332
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,198
plants are in much more deep sleep than

333
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,839
the plants that you have indoors Because

334
00:12:37,198 --> 00:12:40,359
unless you're buying the new technology

335
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,360
there's only one light that I know of

336
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,519
that's got that far red lighting unless

337
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,600
you're introducing that far red lighting

338
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,440
it's taking much longer for your plants

339
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,800
indoors to fall asleep and just think

340
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,519
about it like the sun is the most

341
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:56,078
powerful light source you could ever

342
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,240
imagine we cannot replicate that uh it

343
00:12:56,078 --> 00:12:59,359
is super powerful it is the biggest

344
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,759
light that there is I'm trying to

345
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
exaggerate about it but that's all I can

346
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:04,360
say it's the most powerful light that

347
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,000
there possibly is imagine trying to

348
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,600
compare that to a bulb that's indoors so

349
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,799
if you run that sun all day the plants

350
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,199
are going bro I'm getting Sun blasted

351
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,559
compared to a th000 watt HPS bulb inside

352
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:17,719
your basement when it gets dark outside

353
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:19,919
it's way dark compared to how dark it is

354
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,839
when it just gets dark in your basement

355
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,319
without that thousand watt bulb so the

356
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,160
plants have that that super super sun

357
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,360
compared to your thousand watt bulb the

358
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:29,719
amount of light that was hitting those

359
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,759
plants all day long Outdoors based on

360
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,120
the amount of light that was hitting

361
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:34,958
them indoors is drastically different so

362
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,240
we've got two things that will affect

363
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:39,359
the interruption of the dark cycle here

364
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,919
at night time Outdoors they've been put

365
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,480
to sleep by that far red light so

366
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,120
they're tucked in they're sleeping real

367
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,120
good uh they've been cos beat a little

368
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,560
bit by the Sun and told to go to sleep

369
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:50,278
indoors they were not tucked in and the

370
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,439
light that they're used to isn't super

371
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:54,039
intense so if they do get a little bit

372
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,800
of light they think it's just like the

373
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:57,719
normal grow light that they normally get

374
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:59,359
they go is that it and they think that

375
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,720
that might actually be the light they're

376
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,079
supposed to react to and photosynthesize

377
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:05,639
for and schedule themselves on but if

378
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,479
it's in the Sun and then you get a

379
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,560
little like a car driving by or a

380
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,759
flashlight passing by it goes no that

381
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:13,000
wasn't nearly the light that I'm

382
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,560
supposed to wake up for so we've got the

383
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,480
far red lighting the phytochrome

384
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:19,078
response outdoors and then we've got the

385
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,600
DraStic differences in amount of light

386
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:23,559
and intensity and Spectrum uh that make

387
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,720
a huge difference so what I'm trying to

388
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:29,159
say is that far red light uh tucks your

389
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,600
plants in and uh Stars the moon things

390
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,600
like that won't interrupt the plant

391
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,199
because of that nature had that figured

392
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,360
out man jaw knew that that was going to

393
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:36,639
happen when he made all these things

394
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,240
he's like I got to leave a little bit of

395
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,560
lights on for all the people that like

396
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,000
to hang out at night so he put some

397
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,159
stars and a moon up there but he's like

398
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,639
I can't mess up the plants so he put

399
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:46,439
some Far red lighting up there to put

400
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,440
those plants to sleep that is just my

401
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,480
quick description of it indoors you're

402
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,240
not getting that far red lighting uh so

403
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,199
they're not getting tucked in and also

404
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,519
the amount of light that is interrupting

405
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:57,639
versus the amount of light that they are

406
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,159
used to is not very far apart not

407
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,600
different so the plants don't know know

408
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,399
if they're supposed to wake up or not so

409
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,839
they do wake up that my friend is why it

410
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:08,440
is much more critical to have that

411
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,639
uninterrupted Darkness indoors uh that

412
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:12,639
dark period than it is outdoors I hope

413
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,759
that made sense leave your comments your

414
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,480
questions and your concerns in the

415

Theo good to meet you bro says I've got

436
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,078
a quick question for you well I've got a

437
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:04,198
good answer for you my dude says I'm

438
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,120
going on vacation for a week and I'm

439
00:16:04,198 --> 00:16:09,479
planning on switching my photo period

440
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,879
plants from 24 hours on and zero hours

441
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,759
off to 18 hours on and 6 hours off to

442
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,759
help them conserve water would there be

443
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,680
any negatives from doing this like

444
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,278
potentially initiating flower uh my dude

445
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:24,039
no this is basically what I do uh

446
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:26,159
something similar to this when I go on

447
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:27,599
vacation when I go out of town if I know

448
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:29,559
I'm going to take off I do make

449
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,000
adjustments sort of like this

450
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:33,518
uh my first thing though that I want to

451
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,240
say is um you got them on 24 hours on

452
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:38,679
and zero hours off I would always

453
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,680
recommend giving these plants just a few

454
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:43,758
hours of Darkness 4 hours five maybe six

455
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,078
hours of Darkness per night all living

456
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,240
things like a nap you like a nap uh the

457
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:49,838
cat and the dog obviously like a nap I

458
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,278
think all living things would like some

459
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,880
sleep time so I would give the plants a

460
00:16:52,278 --> 00:16:56,838
few hours at least four uh four to 6

461
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:58,958
hours every night to sleep with lights

462
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,319
off a lot of processes that happen in

463
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,559
the root Zone happen during the

464
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:04,678
nighttime process of our plants so

465
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,558
during that dark cycle a lot of stuff is

466
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:08,880
happening in the root zone so it's very

467
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:10,678
beneficial to give them some sleep time

468
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,199
also the plants will just look better I

469
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,640
think uh I have ran plants on 24 hours

470
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,959
on before uh they start to get a little

471
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,919
stretchy they start to look a little

472
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,679
tired things get kind of weird if you

473
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:23,319
give them time to sleep I feel like they

474
00:17:20,679 --> 00:17:25,600
stay stockier bushier uh they just look

475
00:17:23,318 --> 00:17:27,599
more healthy overall uh just like you

476
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,199
would if I ran you for 24 hours for a

477
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,639
week you'd start to look a little rled

478
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,240
and [ __ ] up too uh the plants do the

479
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:37,640
same thing also you're going to save

480
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:40,359
electricity on your equipment um 4 hours

481
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,320
off 5 days you're already saving 20 20

482
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:44,279
hours of kilowatts if you're running a

483
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,678
th000 watt light that will add up quite

484
00:17:44,279 --> 00:17:47,839
quickly you will notice that in the

485
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,720
electric pill so the first thing I would

486
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,720
do is I would say yes immediately bro

487
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,120
change those lights to 186 that will be

488
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,600
a good thing other things that I do I

489
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:58,439
wrote down a couple of things um I just

490
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,639
did go on vacation I was able to go uh

491
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,679
for 7 days without watering the plants

492
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,759
which is quite fantastic for a grower

493
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:06,960
who uh likes to grow and has things

494
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,720
going on um anyway I was able to go away

495
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,159
for 7even days what I did was uh the

496
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,919
night before I went I defoliated very

497
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:16,480
heavily I topped a couple of the larger

498
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,080
plants um I watered excessively so there

499
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,519
was still water left in the trays but

500
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,399
not enough to drown the plants I know my

501
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,798
plants well enough I just watered

502
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,159
heavily there's still water left in the

503
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:27,480
tray that'll buy me a day or two but

504
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,360
then I reduced my lights I've got LED

505
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:32,000
lighting that I can just go turn a I

506
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:34,798
turned him down to 50% I also reduced my

507
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,640
timer to 16 hours on so my plants were

508
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,440
only getting 16 hours a day for the

509
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,919
amount of time that I was gone that's

510
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,679
enough to keep them awake and not let

511
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,159
them go into flow and for just a week it

512
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,080
was going to be just fine uh then I also

513
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:47,640
reduced all of the fans that way the

514
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,759
fans weren't blowing around in there

515
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,919
super crazy uh that will dry out the

516
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:55,000
plants more quickly so my steps were to

517
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,799
overwater defoliate I topped a couple of

518
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,079
plants I reduced the lighting I reduced

519
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,599
the fans and I actually even un plugged

520
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:02,439
one of my lights because there's plenty

521
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,319
of light in that room and I really

522
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,480
didn't need that light going I just

523
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,399
slowed the plants down for a solid week

524
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,720
when I came back everybody was super

525
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,080
happy so I think what you're doing uh

526
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,079
your ideal will work perfectly but also

527
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,519
reduce the fans reduce the intensity of

528
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:19,558
the light and if you could do it maybe

529
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,119
overwater them just a little tiny bit

530
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,519
all right my dude Theo I hope my advice

531
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,599
worked for you I hope you enjoy your

532
00:19:22,519 --> 00:19:26,079
vacation Have fun wherever you're going

533
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:28,079
I hope those plants look great when you

534
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,480
come back also make sure you check your

535
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,240
email actually check your patreon inbox

536
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,360
because I'm going to send you a coupon

537
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,679
code for a free pack of seeds at iir but

538
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:40,279
check your patreon inbox because that's

539
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,360
where the message will go once again

540
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,399
thanks Theo good question let's keep

541
00:19:42,359 --> 00:19:46,439
this party moving I've got another good

542
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,798
question here in front of us this one

543
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,919
came from the growel tab on iry

544
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,319
genetics.com this one came from my buddy

545
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,880
Mighty Mike Mighty Mike my dude make

546
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:57,079
sure you check your email cuz you've got

547
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,320
a coupon code for a free pack of seeds

548
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,199
at iirc

549
00:19:59,319 --> 00:20:03,839
Mighty Mike has a good question it's a

550
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,600
mighty question it says hi roster Jeff

551
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,798
I've been an avid listener and I can't

552
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:10,119
thank you enough for all you do for the

553
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:11,639
community my bro thank you every time

554
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,918
somebody says that it means a lot to me

555
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,720
it recharges me it gives me some fuel so

556
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,360
thank you I do appreciate it those words

557
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,079
do not go unnoticed thank you for being

558
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:22,839
part of the community that we have

559
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,918
established here it goes on it says uh

560
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:26,678
recently I recently started pollen

561
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:28,679
chucking and I've been trying to

562
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,320
understand how to breed autoflowering C

563
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,159
capabilities into a photo period PL will

564
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,639
the Autoflower feature need to come from

565
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,000
the male or the female part or does that

566
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,480
matter thanks for the response and give

567
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,480
your mom a big hug hey wait I don't hug

568
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,558
my mom you hug your mom that's backwards

569
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,120
bro um all right this is a great

570
00:20:45,558 --> 00:20:49,599
question I do have a good answer for you

571
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:52,119
so the question uh this listener this

572
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,199
viewer uh this Community member wants to

573
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,439
breed autoflow plants they're asking um

574
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,600
so they're asking if when they make

575
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,759
autof flowers does the male or the f

576
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:03,359
female part of this equation need to be

577
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:05,558
the Autoflower to make the breeding work

578
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,918
let me start by saying I am not an

579
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:09,918
Autoflower breeder I have never done

580
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,799
autof flowers I will not do autof

581
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,720
flowers I have friends that are in the

582
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:15,720
business with me that have some of my

583
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,600
plants and they are working my stuff

584
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,839
into autof flowers but I am not doing it

585
00:21:18,599 --> 00:21:23,199
um I give advice I give suggestions I

586
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:24,839
help with selection but overall that is

587
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,400
their project I have two friends doing

588
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:28,759
Autoflower projects two different

589
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,080
companies uh love trust and respect both

590
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:34,038
of them and fully endorse them but Autos

591
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:37,038
are not for me that being said I'm not

592
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:40,278
the autof flower maker as well so this

593
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:42,960
advice is not 100% solid in my opinion

594
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:44,759
this is from my opinion my breeding

595
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,640
experience my knowledge I have never

596
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,640
done this I'm kind of pulling this out

597
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,480
of my ass so uh with that being said

598
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:54,038
from my breeding understanding if you

599
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,159
want to make Autoflower seeds you need

600
00:21:54,038 --> 00:21:57,759
one Autoflower plant to begin with and

601
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,080
that does not matter if that is the male

602
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,400
or the female

603
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:03,199
I want to say do the male because I just

604
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,880
like what male plants contribute to the

605
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,519
mix and I feel more confident

606
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,320
intuitively telling you to use the mail

607
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,158
I really don't believe that there would

608
00:22:09,319 --> 00:22:13,278
be a difference as long as one is

609
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,320
autoflow well you're going to have to as

610
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:17,720
long as one is autoflow uh you should be

611
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:20,119
able to create Autoflower progeny

612
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,200
however um it's not going to be the

613
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,319
first filial generation so let's just

614
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,200
say um for my advice you chose an

615
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:28,519
Autoflower maale now let's just say so

616
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,880
what I'm going to say we're going to

617
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,359
skip you a step we're going to save

618
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,640
problems here I'm going to come up with

619
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:35,719
a genius idea we're not even going to

620
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,720
have a male plant we're going to do

621
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,480
feminized seeds so what you're going to

622
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,880
do find an autoflow female that you like

623
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,120
because most of the autof flowers you

624
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,880
buy are going to be fem so find an

625
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:49,439
autoflow female that you like reverse

626
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,120
that that one will make pollen put that

627
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,159
autoflow reversed pollen on a photo

628
00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:58,119
period female plant that will start the

629
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,720
process of making feminized Autoflower

630
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:03,038
plants for you so after that step one of

631
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,079
reversing an Autoflower taking that

632
00:23:03,038 --> 00:23:07,158
pollen putting it on a regular plant

633
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:09,678
you're going to make seeds now you've

634
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,000
got to grow those seeds find another

635
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,480
Autoflower plant and another Autoflower

636
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
plant you're only going to be able to

637
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:16,720
tell because they're going to flower on

638
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,960
their own that's the only way to figure

639
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,880
this out but you would select one of

640
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,319
those that you really like and reverse

641
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,880
that one and put that pollen on another

642
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:27,759
Autoflower female now you've doubled up

643
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,278
the possibilities doubled up the amount

644
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:32,319
of genetics in that plant there will be

645
00:23:29,278 --> 00:23:34,880
autoflow the likelihood of the next uh

646
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,759
filial generation showing autoflow is

647
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,080
much more likely if you did the

648
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:41,200
selections correctly so you're going to

649
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:43,199
have to reverse a plant pollinate a

650
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,159
plant reverse a plant pollinate a plant

651
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,558
and keep going and eventually by the

652
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:50,679
third or fourth time those plants should

653
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:53,440
be Autoflower plants those will be uh

654
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,480
feminized Autoflower plants if you do it

655
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,320
correctly now I do keep saying if you do

656
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,240
it correctly selection is the most

657
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,519
important part of this process process

658
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:03,359
and I am not an autoflow grower or

659
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,400
breeder so I don't even know what to

660
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,639
tell you to look for when it comes to

661
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,480
selecting autoflow plants but what I do

662
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,520
know is that if you want to move that

663
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,720
Autoflower Gene and make that Autoflower

664
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,038
Gene a dominant trait in those plants

665
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,360
you need an Autoflower plant and a photo

666
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:20,798
period breed that the first batch is

667
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:22,719
going to have some autos and some photos

668
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:25,119
find your autos and breed those together

669
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,679
again that next batch will be mostly

670
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:29,639
Autos in some photos find more autos and

671
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,278
breed those together do it again it'll

672
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:33,840
take three or four tries before

673
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,240
everything starts coming out Autoflower

674
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,918
you can keep going and lock in the

675
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,519
traits you really desire if that's what

676
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:40,640
you want to do that's what I would

677
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:42,879
recommend but by the third or fourth

678
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,200
filial generation you should have pretty

679
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,080
uniform homogeneous Autoflower feminized

680
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,798
seeds and once again let me give a

681
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,678
disclaimer I am not an Autoflower

682

684
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:59,719
autoflowers but I do understand genetics

685
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,399
and I think my advice should apply

686
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:03,278
